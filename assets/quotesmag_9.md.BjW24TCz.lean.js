At that time the company employed 20-25 workers including the owners and the only equipment the company owned at the time was an old Crane, three Pick-ups trucks and a couple of compressors.

Therefore Mr. Awad decided to purchase various types of equipment needed for the projects, simultaneously hiring qualified personnel and using the profits earned from projects for equipment purchase.

The program has helped Ukraine develop its own military and civilian capacities for security, emergency management and organization. The foundation of their cooperation has been built upon exercises like PEACE SHIELD and RAPID TRIDENT. California and Ukraine have trained together is these multinational exercises, hosted by Ukraine, for over 15 years. This partnership will transition to SABER GUARDIAN in 2014 and beyond. While not seeking to enter NATO, Ukraine is committed to all NATO deployments and achieving NATO interoperability through development of Rapid Reaction Forces. The EU has been seeking a closer relationship by moving beyond regional cooperation toward gradual economic integration and deepening of political cooperation; however, a strategic EU trade agreement is currently on hold due to selective prosecutions. Ukraine is currently trimming military forces by 30% as part of a new Strategic Defense Initiative. In 2012, a new Minister of Defense and Chief of Defense were appointed. In 2011, California participated in the single largest Air National Guard exchange in the partnerships history. Members of the California Air National Guard travelled to Mirgorod Air Base, Ukraine to conduct a two-week training exercise called SAFE SKIES 2011. A squadron of six Fighting Falcon F-16's from the Air National Guard lead the multinational Air Superiority exercise, which was designed to prepare Ukraine for real world missions it would face during EUROCUP 2012. California and Ukraine had been planning SAFE SKIES 2011 for over 3 years and its execution helped strengthen bonds between these former enemies of the Cold War. During the exercise, more than 60 air sovereignty mock intercepts took place using Ukrainian Su-27s and MiG-29s, and American and Polish F-16s.

A Kurdish activist in the 1980s, she was arrested and tortured by Turkish police. A close associate of Abdullah √ñcalan and a senior member of the PKK, she was shot dead in Paris, France, on 9 January 2013, with two other female Kurdish activists, Fidan Doƒüan and Leyla S√∂ylemez. Early life Cansƒ±z was born around 1958 in Tunceli, a city in eastern Turkey, to an Alevi family They were eight siblings and she was the eldest daughter. To primary and secondary school she went in Tunceli. In the secondary school she got influenced by her teacher Yusuf Kenan Deniz, who introduced his class to the Dev-Gen√ß, the Revolutionary Youth Federation of Turkey. She began to hear about Denis Gezmis on the radio and saw posters of him depicted as a hero. There were also other posters that called him names like ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunist on the run‚Äù. Gezmis and other members were depicted as criminals or villains and the posters advertised a reward for their capture. That day at recess Sakine and her friends took down the posters, which they thought to be depicting them negatively, in hopes that by taking down the posters that none of the people would be found. It was in middle school that she experienced her first dissent and learned to be secretive about certain topics. In 1969 her father migrated to Germany. In 1973 she and her elder brother followed their father to Berlin, Germany. After 11 months in Berlin she returned to Dersim, where she began to study at the Gymnasium and became engaged to Metin. She began to take part in revolutionary activities, which were not endorsed by the family of her fianc√©e. She fled to Ankara where she first met Abdullah √ñcalan, with whom she would work closely. In an interview, she said of this period: \\"In a sense I abandoned the family. I did not accept that pressure, insisting on revolutionism. That's how I left and went to Ankara. In secret of course.\\"  Revolutionary consciousness  * While in Germany, Sakine attended an event with her father and everyone was dressed in traditional Kurdish attire. Sakine did not wear traditional clothing and was upset when she realized that everyone else attending the event was wearing traditional clothing. She became so used to feeling like she had to hide her identity that she felt like an outsider from her own society. Upon moving back to Dersim her relationship with her mother became rocky, she was growing up, becoming a young woman while also gaining a revolutionary consciousness and her mother was attempting to stop all of this and control her life. Sakine acknowledged that her mother's attempt to control her only made her want to rebel more. * A protest took place at Sakine's school, they were fighting for improved school conditions. The demonstration was considered an act of resistance and Sakine felt as though she had to participate. The police threw stones at them to try and put a stop to the protests and many students got arrested. The students gathered in front of the government building awaiting the announcements. Violence began to break out and this was Sakine's first experience in an uprising situation. Many of her friends were arrested and detained. * After the protest, school for Sakine began to feel mundane and trivial. For Sakine, the possibility of raising political developments and awareness in the classroom was more important than traditional coursework. Depending on the type of teacher that Sakine had she would be exposed to leftist ideas, school became a political gathering place rather than a place for education. Sakine began to experience a total shift in her identity as a young woman. Her desires and behaviors changed greatly and she began to surround herself with politically motivated people like herself. She also began to experience difficulties in her relationship with her fianc√©, Metin, she spent less and less time thinking about him and became frustrated when he tried to give her advice on how to live her life. * Sakine began her own group that began to gain consciousness and became stronger, it was the first revolutionary women's group. The women worked together to point out each other's weaknesses and identify mistakes in an attempt to make their group consciousness stronger. The group had no name, no headquarters, no newspaper but everyone agreed to act the same way in the face of injustice. Eventually the name ‚ÄúApocu‚Äù emerged. The number of group members was increasing along with the consciousness of Kurdish identity and tradition.  Sakines escape to become a revolutionary  * Sakine still felt tied to her family, but she knew if she had stayed with them it would be impossible for her to be a revolutionary. She finally made the decision to escape in May 1975. She obtained her ID from her school by telling them that she was going to get married. She arrived at her extended family's home and they were happy to see her but they explained that they have to tell Sakine's parents that she is safe with them. This infuriated her and she decided to leave to meet up with political science faculty who were going to think more similarly to her. She moved to Izmir with Baki and worked in a factory alongside other workers who were mostly Kurds. Sakine and Baki decided to get married despite her previous rejection to his proposals. * Sakine acknowledged in discussions with her Turkish friends she could tolerate some of their arguments surrounding the topic of Kurdistan, but when she is with her Kurdish friends she was unable to tolerate it. She admitted that these discussions often became very confrontational, however she was educated on these topics and was not going to let others tell her she was wrong. She felt as though the Marxist classics best demonstrated the group's political outlook, it was not necessary that the name Kurdistan be used. The groups' ideological ideas were analyzed, discussed and created prior to the October revolution. * Sakine began to find people that are similar to her and she started to feel more welcomed. She went to different political clubs where she was able to make friends that have similar ideologies as her. She was considered part of the UKO- the Kurdistan revolutionary group. Sakine decided to take a break from her relationship with Baki to focus on herself. Baki did not align with Sakine organizationally or ideologically and it was beginning to take a toll on their relationship, she admitted to herself and her older brother that she is unhappy. * A big demonstration took place against the state security courts, all of the different groups were going to participate. Sakine admitted that she learned a lot from these events that took place in Izmir, she began to feel more comfortable defending her position even though she was far away from her home country and her organization. In the factory where she worked, Sakine explained to her peers that as a Kurdistan Revolutionary she felt as though it was her role to contribute to the workers‚Äô resistance. Her goal was not to organize the workers and make them participate in the Kurdistan Revolution, but rather to try and help them to see their problems in comparison to the working class. By doing this, she would attempt to bring awareness to what the Kurdish people are going through and allow a consciousness of solidarity to emerge. Sakine brought up the idea of failing to perform a task because they expected someone else to do it which would insinuate that they approve of the other person's oversights, however she pointed out that someone with a revolutionary consciousness would not behave this way. Instead, they did what others neglect, even if it meant she will not be taken seriously it was better to be involved in the conversation and stand up for what she believed in than to stand on the sidelines and not participate. Activities She was one of the PKK's founding members (code name \\"Sara\\"), and the organization's first senior female member. At the founding meeting of the PKK in Lice in southern Turkey in late September or November 1978 (with 22 persons attending), she represented El√¢zƒ±ƒü, the administrative center of El√¢zƒ±ƒü Province. Cansƒ±z and √ñcalan's former wife Kesire Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m were the only women who participated in this meeting. Cansƒ±z was arrested in 1979 soon after graduating high school. According to The Guardian, she was arrested just after the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat.Cansiz was imprisoned along with other members of the PKK. She spent years in jail in Diyarbakir where 34 inmates died of torture between the years 1981 and 1989. The treatment that they received in the prison was horrible and was one of the main reasons for the organizations radicalization and the increased armed struggle against the Turkish that began in 1984. While in jail, Cansiz continued her work for the Kurdish movement, becoming a \\"legend among PKK members\\". After her release in 1991, Cansƒ±z stayed in the PKK camps in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley and then in northern Iraq where she fought under the command of Osman Ocalan. In addition to fighting she organized and headed women squads of the PKK there. She went to Europe in the mid-1990s. Murat Karayƒ±lan sent her there to be responsible for the PKK's European branch, first in Germany and then in France, to deal with the group's civil affairs. According to H√ºrriyet, she was moved to Europe after having opposed the execution of PKK member Mehmet ≈ûener. France granted Cansƒ±z asylum in 1998 after she had disagreed with some senior PKK figures. She was detained in Hamburg in March 2007 upon Turkeys request, but released after protests opposing her detention in April 2007. Reportedly, \\"she was the most prominent and most important female Kurdish activist. She did not shy away from speaking her mind, especially when it came to women's issues.\\" = Revolutionary Activities = Sakine was fired from her job at the factory with no just reason. She became frustrated and questions her boss as to why she was being let go. Her boss is unable to give her a valid reason for her termination and when conflict arises between the two her boss calls the police. When the police arrived they grabbed Sakine and tried and forced her into the car, she was somehow able to break free and ran away toward the factory. The other workers, who were on their lunch, break and began to join in on the resistance against to police. They made it evident that they were not going to leave the lunch room until the police pulled away. Sakine said this day was a precursor for a strike. As predicted, the next day a strike occurred and out of 350 workers, half participated. Although this was not a bad turnout, Sakine was worried that if more people did not begin to participate that some of the workers would change their mind and go back to work. The police had enough and began to physically remove Sakine and some of her friends. The police were violent in their actions, pulling Sakine's hair and beating her with a club. She was forced onto a bus with twenty others where they were brought to a police station in Alsancak. Upon being released from the police station, a hunger strike broke out which landed Sakine and her peers back in the police station. Again, they were all taken in for questioning and then transferred to a prison in Buca. In the prison the men and the women were separated. The women had access to newspapers and Sakine was pleased to notice that the newspapers demonstrated that they had achieved their goals. Death On 10 January 2013, Cansƒ±z, in her 50s, was found dead with two other Kurdish female activists, Fidan Doƒüan and Leyla ≈ûaylemez. Autopsy results placed the time of death for the three women as sometime between 6pm and 7pm on the day before. Their bodies were found in the Kurdistan Information Center in Paris. The three women were last seen inside an information center on a Wednesday afternoon, hours later a member of the Kurdish community tried to visit the center but the door was locked. The three women were found dead with gunshot wounds in the information center on Thursday morning. This was the first time that a senior member of the PKK had been killed in Europe. alt=A group of people marching down an urban street behind a red flag with a star in the middle. They are holding up placards with pictures of three different women on them The killings occurred at a time when the Turkish government was in negotiation with PKK leaders including √ñcalan. PKK activists in Paris considered the murders an attempt by \\"dark forces\\" within the Turkish government to derail these negotiations. The PKK blamed the Turkish government. Turkish officials pointed at frequent strife within the PKK, with the Turkish national daily H√ºrriyet claiming that Cansƒ±z had been in conflict with Ferman Hussein, the alleged commander of the PKK's military wing. Also killed were Fidan Doƒüan of the Kurdistan National Congress (based in Brussels) and Leyla S√∂ylemez, a \\"junior activist\\". The French interior minister Manuel Valls announced that the three women were all killed execution-style. Two days after the murder, √ñmer G√ºney was detained and later prosecuted for the assassination of the three women. The prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins concluded that the surveillance cameras showed that √ñmer G√ºney was within the Kurdish Information Center during the time of the assassination. And on his bag was found gunpowder. On 17 December 2016, √ñmer G√ºney, the sole suspect in the assassination of Sakine Cansƒ±z, Fidan Doƒüan and Leyla ≈ûaylemez died of a severe illness in his Paris prison cell. After his death the French authority decided to close the investigation into the assassination of the three women. In May 2019 the investigation was reopened. Funeral The body of Cansƒ±z together with those of the other two women murdered was brought from Paris to Istanbul on 16 January 2013 and transferred to Diyarbakƒ±r. A funeral ceremony for the three slain women was held in Diyarbakƒ±r with the attendance of tens of thousands of Kurds on 17 January 2013. Each was buried in her hometown: Cansƒ±z in Tunceli, Doƒüan in Kahramanmara≈ü, and S√∂ylemez in Mersin. =Reactions= Both Turkey and France condemned the killings of the three women. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan suggested that the murders were done for two possible reasons: 1) to derail the current negotiations or 2) to carry out an internal execution within the PKK. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and government spokesman B√ºlent Arƒ±n√ß condemned the attack and expressed his condolences.

Biography Cubiles was born in C√°diz in 1894. His pianistic gifts were already apparent by the age of five. He first studied music theory and elementary piano with Rafaele Tomasetti, director of the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia (now known as the Real Conservatorio Profesional de M√∫sica de \\"Manuel de Falla\\" de C√°dizReal Conservatorio Profesional de M√∫sica de \\"Manuel de Falla\\" de C√°diz). From age 11, he studied at the Madrid Royal Conservatory,Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (1954), Vol. II, p. 556 under the patronage of Princess Isabella of Bourbon, daughter of Queen Isabella II of Spain. His principal teacher there was Pilar Fern√°ndez de la Mora. At age 15 he won the Premio Extraordinario awarded by the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes. In 1911 he won the Conservatory's First Prize. He undertook further study at the Conservatoire de Paris with Louis Di√©mer, graduating in 1914 with another Premier Prix, a Gold Medal, and a Pleyel grand piano. Madrid Royal Conservatory In 1916 he was appointed a professor at his Madrid alma mater. That year he founded a chamber trio with the cellist Juan Ruiz Casaux and the violinist Fern√°ndez Ortiz. During the war years he accompanied the violinist Manuel Quiroga on tours of the United States and Canada. He also played in chamber ensembles with artists such as Jacques Thibaud, Paul Kochanski and Gaspar Cassad√≥, and was known for his performances of the music of the Spanish masters Isaac Alb√©niz, Enrique Granados, Joaqu√≠n Turina and Manuel de Falla, as well as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, C√©sar Franck, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Jos√© Cubiles is best known outside Spain as the soloist in the world premiere performance of de Falla's composition for piano and orchestra, Nights in the Gardens of Spain, on 9 April 1916 with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra under Enrique Fern√°ndez Arb√≥s, at the Teatro Real in Madrid. The work was dedicated to the pianist Ricardo Vi√±es, but de Falla chose Cubiles as a tribute to his exceptional qualities as a virtuoso and a musician. He later recorded the work with the Vienna Philharmonic under Ernest Ansermet. On 6 June 1916, during Igor Stravinsky's first visit to Spain to present his ballets The Firebird and Petrushka, Cubiles played the difficult piano part in Petrushka in a performance conducted by Ansermet, in the presence of the composer, who had personally rehearsed the players.Carol A Hess, Manuel de Falla and Modernism in Spain, 1898-1936, p. 98 (Cubiles and Stravinsky died one day apart, on 5 and 6 April 1971 respectively.) From 1920 Cubiles played with great success throughout Europe and Britain, giving solo recitals, and concerto performances under conductors such as Ernest Ansermet, Carl Schuricht and Paul Paray. He also conducted the Berlin Philharmonic on occasion. He also conducted the principal Spanish orchestras, and played all five Beethoven piano concertos with the Madrid Philharmonic Orchestra. Joaqu√≠n Turina On 16 November 1927 in Madrid, Cubiles introduced the original piano solo version of Ernesto Halffter's ballet Sonatina (containing the well-known \\"Danza de la Pastora\\"). It was later presented in a concert version with orchestra and a fully staged ballet (both in 1928). He premiered most of Joaqu√≠n Turina's major works for solo piano. He was the dedicatee and gave the premiere of both sets of Cinco danzas gitanas (Opp. 55 and 84), on 15 January 1932 and 8 March 1935 respectively, in Madrid. He first played En el cortijo: Impresiones andaluzas (On the Farm: Impressions of Andalusia) on 2 February 1942, as part of a recital at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Rinc√≥n m√°gico (Magical Corner: Parade in sonata form), Op. 97 (1941‚Äì46) is a piece in which Turina paints the portraits of certain friends, including Cubiles, and himself. He characterises Cubiles as \\"Pepe, el pianista gaditano\\". Cubiles became professor of advanced classes at the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1926, and in 1943 became professor of the special virtuoso class. He was the head of the institution between 1962 and 1964. His students included Joaqu√≠n Ach√∫carro, Guillermo Gonzalez, Y√ºksel Koptagel and Rafael Orozco. He was elected to the seat left vacant by the death of Enrique Fern√°ndez Arb√≥s in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of St Ferdinand. He was also a member of the Academy of Santa Isabel de Hungria in Seville, and the Hispano-American Academy in Cadiz. In addition to Nights in the Gardens of Spain, Cubiles recorded numerous solo pieces, including works by Alb√©niz (the suite Iberia and other works) and Turina (Cinco danzas gitanas, Op. 55). Jos√© Cubiles received the Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise and the French Legion of Honour. He died in Madrid in 1971, aged 76.

The book was published on January 3, 2013 through Viking Adult and is set in 1970s apartheid South Africa. Synopsis White Dog Fell from the Sky is set in Botswana in the late 1970s and follows three characters as their lives interact with one another. Isaac Muthethe is from South Africa, still under apartheid. He had a promising future as a medical student until he was forced to flee to Botswana after watching the South African Defence Force kill someone. Once in Botswana, Isaac works as a gardener for Alice Mendelssohn, an American postgrad student who has left her studies behind in order to accompany her husband. The two strike up a friendship of sorts and when Isaac goes missing, Alice decides that she must find him. Development Initial development for the character of Alice began over twelve years ago, with Morse creating her as a character for a different book that was never completed. She developed the character of Isaac later, while teaching a fiction writing class. Morse also stated that she drew upon her own experiences of Botswana, utilizing several words and phrases in Setswana to accent the novel. Reception Critical reception for White Dog Fell from the Sky has been mostly positive, with Oprah.com listing it as one of their 16 Must-Read Books for January 2013. Common praise for the novel included the depictions of Botswana and for Morse's writing, while Kirkus Reviews criticized the book saying that the \\"idealization of Isaac and all the black Africans as noble victims does them a disservice by making them two-dimensional in contrast to the three-dimensional whites\\". Reviewer Sara Vilkomerson gave the book the grade of B+ and wrote, \\"Morse's writing is lyrical and quite beautiful, with searing descriptions of the dusty earth, unforgiving sun, and stark skies. The inner workings of her main characters' minds may remain a mystery, but that doesn't stop you from getting attached to their respective heartaches and plights and rooting for their happiness.\\" References Category:2013 American novels Category:Novels set in Botswana Category:Fiction set in 1976 ","title":"White Dog Fell from the Sky"},{"id":"38185575","text":"Gli Aristocratici (\\"The Aristocrats\\") is an Italian comic strip series created in 1973 by Alfredo Castelli and Ferdinando Tacconi.

Company history The company was formed in November 1982 as a consulting firm, before transforming into development the following year. The Reidys targeted the then recently released ZX Spectrum, and initially attempted to write business software, producing the Visicalc clone Omnicalc, but quickly realised that the future for the machine lay with games after their first effort, a cassette containing Crevasse and Hotfoot, received a good review in Sinclair User. After recruiting local artist and family friend Keith Warrington, they released one of their best known and critically acclaimed games, Skool Daze in 1984, which sold 50,000 copies and Crash described as \\"excellent value, plenty to do, addictive, unusual\\" and followed it up with Back to Skool in 1985, which drew similar praise. When interviewed, the Reidys said that they used no compilers or assemblers, and designed everything on pencil and paper, adding the raw, hand assembled Z80 machine code onto the computer. Warrington tried using a computer to design his graphics, but decided he preferred traditional methods on graph paper. The company never expanded, as the founders had no motivation to do so, and as time progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to cope with the more professional marketing campaigns that started to be introduced in the maturing computer game industry. In an interview, Helen Reidy said that \\"It seems they're [retail stores] more concerned with your advertising budget and the size of your box - it's very difficult to get a good game from a small software house into the large stores.\\" The company's last release was the detective adventure Contact Sam Cruise, which according to David Reidy wasn't commercially successful, blaming software piracy for lack of sales. Uninterested in developing for the emerging 16 bit computers and consoles, he decided to change careers and became an electrical engineer.

Czech folklore is the folk tradition which has developed among the Czech people over a number of centuries. Czech folklore was influenced by a mix of Christian and pagan customs. Nowadays it is preserved and kept alive by various folklore ensembles uniting members of all ages, from children to seniors, showing their talent during competitions, folklore festivals or other performances. The Czech Republic is divided into a number of ethnographic regions. Each of them has special folklore traditions, songs or costumes and specializes in different crafts. As a result, Czech folklore provides a diverse source of entertainment. Music and dance Music played an important part in life of common people or peasants in the Czech Republic. It offered both means of expression and a vent for their emotions. Resulting music varies not only by the region of its origin but also in the purpose of its use. Therefore, there are myriads of distinct folk songs. ƒΩubom√≠r P√°riƒçka playing bagpipes, Czech Republic Music often addressed everyday issues and was passed down orally. From the 19th century onward it was recorded by ethnographers. Traditional celebrations such as welcome of the spring, successful harvest are still among the occasions traditionally celebrated with songs. More lively themes were used specifically during celebrations, weddings or feasts. Funerals and mournful occasions also had their own set of songs and tunes. Songs and especially dances were often linked to conscription of Czech young men to the Army; they are called ‚Äúverbu≈àk‚Äù in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened during wartimes and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music. They are listed by UNESCO in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. There are a number of instruments associated with Czech folk music, which add to its distinct sound ‚Äì violin and the double bass; instruments specific to Bohemia and Moravia such as bagpipes (bock), shepherd's pipe, dulcimer and trumpet. All of them are still in active use by the folklore groups during their shows. Folk dance from Czechia Polka dance originated in Bohemia and still remains an integral part of folklore traditions especially in the western part of the country. Since the 19th century this dance has spread from Bohemia to many neighbouring European countries as well as overseas. Traditional Czech celebrations Wallachian folk costumes Decorating Wallachian Easter eggs. Ro≈ænov pod Radho≈°tƒõm In the past, emphasis was placed on changes connected to the four seasons of the year; every season had its own specific traditions. In the spring, people practiced customs which would ensure health of their crops and future successful harvest. In the winter, it was most important to protect households and villagers against adverse effects of cold weather and supernatural forces. Many Czech regions still hold traditional celebrations, which also revel in folklore music, dance and costumes. Among the most typical is Drowning of Morana, Shrovetide, erecting the maypole, grape harvest or celebration of Easter. * Drowning of Morana: to celebrate the end of the winter, young girls in a number of villages build an effigy of a woman out of straw and branches, and dress the figure in old clothes. The woman represents a Slavic goddess of winter and is associated with death. Therefore, her destruction symbolizes the beginning of new life in spring. After taking the figure out of the village in a solemn procession, Morana is set on fire and then thrown into the water by singing girls. * Shrovetide (Masopust): also serves to celebrate spring and ensure the fertility of future harvest. It includes a carnival-like procession of singing people dressed in masks of beasts and animals. * Easter celebrations: the most distinctive customs preserved in the Czech Republic are spanking women solemnly with a whip made of thin willow branches (poml√°zka); or drenching them with cold water to symbolically guarantee their good health. In exchange, men often receive traditional food, decorated eggs and (recently), alcoholic beverages. * Burning of witches: also known as Walpurgis Night in German speaking countries; according to the traditional Czech stories, the night on the turn of April 30 and May 1 had a magical power. Not only was evil believed to be more powerful at this time, but also those who felt brave enough to go outside could find treasures if they carried with them items such as wood fern flower, wafer or sanctified chalk. It was also believed that during the night witches were flying and gathering for the Sabbath. To protect themselves, villagers burnt bonfires on hills and set fire to brooms, which were then thrown into the air to reveal any flying witch. These celebrations are nowadays accompanied with music and traditional food and mark the opening of the tourist season. * Erecting a Maypole: unmarried men in southern parts of the Czech Republic and in Slovacko cut off trees such as fir, spruce or pine to make a traditional maypole out of it over night representing spring. The branches are cut off and only the top of the tree is left and decorated with ribbons and flowers. The maypole is then erected in the middle of the village. It is important to guard one's maypole because men from other villages may try to cut it down as a form of contest. Traditional costumes Hanakia) and a sign \\"Good day - Olomouc greets Prague\\" Folklore is not merely about music. Czech folklore is characteristic for elaborate traditional costumes distinctive to each region or even village. Specific aspects such as colors, embroidery, themes and fragments of traditional costumes varied on the basis of social, geographical and symbolical factors as well as according to the purpose of their use. Costumes worn on special occasions were usually lavishly decorated, colorful and accompanied with a wide range of accessories (scarves, ribbons, headdresses, hats, belts, etc.) while everyday clothes tended to be rather simple and practical. Every region had a set of amusing peculiarities. For example: * Women in the Plzen region wore up to 24 underskirts, which restricted their movement but were nevertheless a show of their fashionableness. * While married women in Hanakia wore plain clothes and hid their hair under bonnets and headdresses even from their own husbands, their men wore their hair long and even their clothes were flauntingly colorful and decorated. Traditional costumes are no longer commonly worn in most parts of the Czech Republic. They may be used during traditional celebrations or festivals when worn by members of folklore ensembles. In some families, costumes are handed down from generation to generation as they wish to preserve the tradition. Likewise, many stay protected in museums and private collections. Folklore festivals Multiple folklore shows and festivals are organized in the Czech Republic throughout the year. They are a display of rich Czech traditions and folklore. At the festivals, various folklore groups demonstrate the heritage of their country. The performers are presented in traditional costumes particular to different regions of the Czech Republic. They perform folk dances, traditional folk songs and play musical instruments. Many festivals are not only demonstrations of music and dances, but also show traditional cuisine and crafts. There are many folklore festivals in the Czech Republic. * Moonlight in Prague The biggest and most famous international folklore festivals is \\"Moonlight in Prague\\" held traditionally once per year in July. * Vlƒçnov: probably the most famous one is a festival called ‚ÄúRide of the Kings‚Äù. This festival takes place every year and can be also found on the list of UNESCO. * Str√°≈ænice: Another unique folklore festival. Not only does this festival present traditional Czech folklore, but also folklore groups from all over the world visit the town to show their own traditions. * Strakonice: The Bohemian city holds an annual bagpipe festival that attracts the locals, as well as foreign tourists. The festival is a parade and a meeting place of Czech and international bagpipe players. Folklore groups Czech Republic is abundant in folklore groups of all kinds. Their goal is to preserve local traditions and folklore and to pass the heritage on to the following generations. Members of the folklore groups are enthusiasts of all ages: from little children through adolescents to adults. They all enjoy building up folklore spirit with dances, music and showing off beautiful folklore dresses, as well as performing in front of audiences at folklore festivals. Children are encouraged to participate in folklore ensembles from a very early age. Traditional arts and crafts Traditional arts and crafts are an inseparable part of Czech folklore. * Cornhusk dolls: among the most popular traditional products. These dolls made of cornhusk and a few strings are nowadays used as decorations but in the past children used them as toys. Cornhusk dolls are also great souvenirs tourists can buy in the Czech Republic if they are looking for something truly traditional. * Pottery: Another popular traditional artistic product. Bohemian and Moravian pottery is painted with various folklore patterns, simple or floral ornaments. The pottery serves for both decorative and practical purposes. * Bobbin lace: also one of the popular traditional items. The most famous Czech bobbin lace products are made in Vamberk, a city in Eastern Bohemia. * The Czech Republic is also renowned for its production of glass: crystal glasses, bowls, vases, and other products contribute to the richness of heritage of the Czech Republic. * Indigo print products: hand-made textile goods. Tablecloths, toys, and other accessories are made of this material.

Born in Spanish Town, Foster was educated in Kingston, and participated in organised sport from an early age. Aged 19, he set a national record for the 100-yard dash, becoming recognised as one of Jamaica's top sprinters. Foster unsuccessfully attempted to participate at the 1908 Summer Olympics, and subsequently defeated several competitors at post-games meetings. On return to Jamaica, he concentrated more on cricket, playing irregularly at first-class level until the mid-1920s. Foster would go on to become one of Jamaica's foremost athletics coaches, helping to train athletes for both the Summer Olympics and Commonwealth Games. He died in 1966, with Jamaica's principal sporting college, the G. C. Foster College of Physical Education and Sport, later being named after him. Early life and athletics career Born in Spanish Town, Saint Catherine Parish, Foster attended Wolmer's Boys' School in Kingston, where organised sport was an essential part of the school curriculum.

Cricket career and later life On his return to Jamaica, Foster began to concentrate more on cricket, and made his first-class debut for the Jamaican representative side against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, during the team's 1908‚Äì09 tour of the West Indies.First-class matches played by Gerald Foster (9) ‚Äì CricketArchive.

Due to Jamaica's distance from the other British colonies in the West Indies, its cricket team did not compete in the Inter-Colonial Tournament (featuring Barbados, British Guiana, and Trinidad), and consequently rarely played at first-class level throughout the rest of the 1910s and the early 1920s. Foster was often unavailable for these matches, and did not play again until the 1924‚Äì25 season, when Barbados toured for three matches. With almost 14 years having elapsed since he last played at first-class level, Foster scored 61 runs in his first innings after his return, putting on 108 runs for the fifth wicket with Frank Martin (195).Barbados v Jamaica, Other First-Class matches in West Indies 1924/25 ‚Äì CricketArchive.

Most laws allow sneak boats to be paddled to increase the speed need to reach open water rafts of ducks. These boats often have some type of fall-away concealment which the hunter drops down at the last second to improve the range of the wing shooting. This is a sport with a long history going back to market hunters and punt boats with small cannons mounted to them. Sometimes the boats are referred to as a sneakbox which seen great use on the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes Other versions of sneak boats are called sculling boats which use a paddle protruding out of the transom of the boat allowing the hunter to lay flat while sculling the boat into rafted waterfowl. The main focus of the sneak boat is to put the hunter very close to the decoys or rafts of live waterfowl if not directly into them for additional closer shooting. This makes for very dramatic hunting scenarios where rafting waterfowl comes extremely close to the hunter and boat. Most sneak boats are used for diver duck or ocean duck hunting where an open deep water waterfowl species frequent. Sometimes they are deployed in marshes for more traditional puddle duck hunting or goose hunting. They are also referred to as sculling. Open water sneak boat hunters are well known to be a hearty bunch and are known for operating on the riskier side of waterfowl hunting. They are known to target diver ducks such as bluebills (greater scaup), canvasback, goldeneye, scoter and eider to name a few. These boats are known to be long and sleek to cut through the water fast and have extremely shallow drafts. Boats rang from 10 ft to upwards of 21 ft on the great lakes and rivers. They usually accompany two hunters at a time using the wind to catch a sail like blind in the front of the boat while also sculling to achieve greater speed. Sneak boat hunters sometimes uses small spreads of decoys in open water while they lay and wait some distance away watching with binoculars. Once ducks have landed into the decoy spread the hunters begin their sneak. To waterfowl the boat is just some driftwood or breakaway marsh. Other sneak boat hunter use large cabin cruiser as a base and perform sneaks using several sneak boats and a tender boat to allow quick retrieval.  References  *Sternberg, Dick; Simpson, Jeff (1997).

The spotlight was turned to the North African; and particularly; Moroccan Jewish communities, constituting the largest of the Jewish communities in North Africa at the time. Riots in Oujda and Jerada and fear that Morocco's eventual independence from France would lead to the persecution of the country's Jews, led to a large-scale emigration. Approximately 28,000 Jews immigrating to Israel between 1948 and 1951. Upon the return of Mohammed V and the consequent declaration of Morocco as an independent state in 1956, the Jews received citizenship but with fewer freedoms than the dominant Muslim population, including restrictions on traveling abroad. However, following pressures exerted by the Arab league in 1959, Jewish emigration became prohibited if the destination for their immigration was Israel, and therefore the immigration for the most-part took place illegally by means of the underground Jewish organization in Morocco, via Spain and France. Mossad and HIAS made a deal with King Hassan II to covertly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel in Operation Yachin, between 1961-1967. By 1967 250,000 Jews had left Morocco, some fleeing to Europe and the USA whereas a large part of them immigrated to Israel. The Moroccan immigrants encountered many cross culture and integration difficulties that later became the characterizing features of this immigration. These cultural barriers and discrimination led to protestation and consequently a gradual change in Israel's political map.  Before the Establishment of the State of Israel  The rising French influence in Morocco at the beginning of the 20th century encouraged Moroccan Jews to enroll into French schools, receive a French education and integrate into French culture until 1940 when the Vichy laws came into effect and forbade Jewish attendance to French schools. After the Second World War and the establishment of the state of Israel, the Jewish Zionist organizations encouraged many Jewish families to leave Morocco and migrated to Israel legally, with the approval of the French rule at the time. Following the war, many young Moroccan Jews migrated to Israel in a bold move and joined \\"Gahal\\" forces that were fighting the War of Independence. Prior to the signing of the Fez Treaty, which entailed French protection of Moroccan Jews, there was a mass escape of Jews from large cities such as Fez, Meknes, Rabat and Marrakech to the smaller towns and villages surrounding the cities. The overcrowding, the decline in the financial circumstances and the need to pray in secret motivated some young families to emigrate to Israel or move to neighboring Tunisia, which employed a more liberal policy for Jews. Rumors and letters which started arriving at synagogues told of Jews migrating to and settling in Israel, encouraging the Maghreb Jews to do so as well. The first community to make the move were Jews were living near the synagogue (the main synagogue) in Fez. About 60 to 80 young families migrated from 1908 to 1918, settling mainly in Jerusalem and Tiberias. Amongst the first families to settle in Jerusalem were; Ohana, and Zana, Mimeran Turgeman, and Aifraga. The Aifragan brothers, who were bankers back in Fez, could not adapt to life in Israel; they bid their cousins, the Zane family, goodbye in 1918, and moved to France and subsequently to Canada. The David, Zane and Turgeman families lived in the Jewish Quarter whilst the rest of the families lived in Mishkanot (English: Residence) and Sukkot Shalom (English: Peace Tent). The migration was carried out largely through Tunisia, using small boats to travel from there to Israel. In the summer of 1911, a baby boy; Moshe Vezana, was born, a son to Simcha (Pircha) and David, aboard the ship on their way to Israel. Upon their arrival at Yafo port, the baby's Brit Milah was celebrated. The boy, which was a son to a 'Mugrabi' family, was recorded at times as a Tunisian native and at other times, as an Israeli native. All other eight brothers were born in the Old City of Jerusalem. It was a large family of Mughrabi; the greatest living inside the walls of the Old City, until their escape to Katamon due to War of Independence. The Maghreb Jewish community was small between the first and third migrations. Leading congregations in Jerusalem were primarily communities which immigrated from Iraq, Iran, Bukhara and Yemen.  After the establishment of the state of Israel  Upon the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority Moroccan Jewry, which held Zionist-religious values, awoke to the possibility of migration to Israel (similarly to other countries at the time). After the establishment of Israel, the conditions for Jews in Morocco worsened due to increasing terrorism in the country and the hostile attitude of the Jews by the local population. Morocco's worsening conditions for the Jews acted as a catalyst to encourage migration to Israel. = Riots in Oujda and Jerada = Moroccan Jewish immigrants arriving in Israel, 1954 The 1948 UN declaration of the founding of the state of Israel worsened the situation in Morocco. The Moroccan nationalist movement, carrying the flag of the Arab League, incited against the Jews, and the Moroccan nationalist press (namely the newspaper \\"Al Alam\\") promoted hostility. A few days before pogroms broke out, death threats were made against Jews, and on the day of the June 7 massacre, no Arabs showed up to work for Jewish employers. Riots commenced in the city of Oujda at 9:30 in the morning. A mob armed with axes and knives gathered at the \\"shuk al Yahud\\" (Jewish market) in Oujda and killed five people, four Jewish and one French. Police eventually gained control and the crowd dispersed. In a nearby area, a group of Muslims gathered, armed with axes, picks and knives, and rode on buses towards the coal mining town of Jerada. In Jarada, this group spread a rumor that a Jew murdered a Muslim, triggering a massacre of 38 Jews, including the community's Rabbi (Rabbi Moshe Cohen), his wife, his mother and his three children. A total of 44 people were murdered that day, and another 55 were wounded by rioters in the cities of Jerada and Oujda. Additionally, shops and homes of Jews were looted. The French military court in Casablanca tried 35 rioters for the massacre. Two defendants were sentenced to death, two to hard labor for life, and the rest to a variety of different penalties. The year 1954 saw additional pogroms against Moroccan Jews, considerable theft of property, and arson at \\"Kol Israel Haverim\\" schools. These incidents increased the emigration rate of Moroccan Jews. = Policy Instated by Mohammed V = With the return of Mohammed V from exile he decided he wanted the Jews to remain in Morocco after Morocco's independence from France in 1956; Jewish citizens were given equal rights. King Mohammed V was willing to integrate the Jews in the parliament and position them in prominent roles. The League of Arab states began operating in Morocco, influencing Morocco's political parties and causing anti-Semitism, leading the Moroccan government to refuse to recognize the State of Israel. This environment cause less affluent Jews to request to leave Morocco as soon as possible. Following the mass exodus, which did not please the Moroccan government, Zionism was outlawed and defined as a serious crime in 1959, and immigration to Israel was banned, forcing Moroccan Jews to flee the country by sea only, towards Spain or France. Following the emigration ban a large number of international organizations cooperated with the Israeli government to do everything in their capacity to persuade Moroccan authorities to allow Jewish citizens of Morocco to leave the country. Representatives of the various Jewish organizations succeeded in forming good relations with the Moroccan authorities, however they failed to convince them to allow the Jews to leave. Nevertheless, Israel had sent dozens of Mossad officers to North Africa who carried out an operation (\\"operation frame\\") that entailed the illegal immigration of Moroccan Jews. Many local young folks joined the operation. Between the years 1948 - 1955 around 70,000 Jews left Morocco. Between the years 1955 - 1961 around 60,000 Jews left Morocco =Emigration under Hassan II of Morocco= Policy changed with the accession of Hassan II of Morocco in 1961. Hassan agreed to accept a large per-capita bounty from the international Jewish community for each Jew who emigrated from Morocco, and under this agreement Jews were allowed the freedom to emigrate. Between the years 1961 - 1967 around 120,000 Jews left Morocco. The Six-Day War in 1967 led to another wave of emigration of Jews from Morocco, primarily to France, but also to Canada, the United States, Israel and other countries. = The Disaster of \\"Egoz\\" (Nut) Ship = In 1961 the ship \\"Egoz\\" (nut) which held 44 illegal immigrants drowned in the sea on its way to Israel. After the sinking of \\"Egoz\\" pressure was exerted on Morocco and a secret treaty was signed with King Hassan II and consequently a massive exodus of Jews from Casablanca port was carried out under the supervision of General Oufkir. Some Jews came to Israel and some migrated to France and other countries. = Integration of Moroccan Jews in Israel = Immigration of Moroccan Jews to Israel encountered many difficulties. The new immigrants who were housed in transit camps, brought different ways of life and thought with them, that were misunderstood to the most-part of European originated immigrants. Most notable was the complaint of the Moroccan hot temper, which clashed with the neighbors' culture and slower temper. This was the origin of stereotypical, derogatory nickname that stuck to these immigrants - Maroko Sakin / \\"Morocco knife.\\" The cultural gap and the overt and covert discrimination caused unrest fords across the Israel. Already in the early years of statehood, with the establishment of the policy of population dispersal, signs of a struggle against the settlement coordinators began, since those tried to halt the phenomenon of the abandoning of settlements on the borders of Israel. The transition of Moroccans from border lines villages to the city, and their rejection of an agricultural lifestyle, was assumed to indicate their refusal to participate in productive enterprises and the Judaization of the land that the state intended for them, and an active strategy of dealing with separation and socialization processes which the country was implementing in the fifties. Discriminatory policies led to, among other things, an active protest whose two most prominent manifestations were in the \\"Wadi Salib events\\", led by David Ben-Arush against ongoing discrimination and the establishment of the \\"Black Panthers\\" movement. They set themselves a goal; to promote their social status and they fought passionately to earn their place in Israeli society. It took eighteen more years, after the events in 1977 in \\"Wadi Salib\\", for the North African immigrants to be heard clearly in national politics. In the 1977 revolution their demographic power became evident where they succeeded in bringing the \\"Likkud\\" national party to power, led by Menachem Begin, and overthrow the \\"Mapai\\" government. Due to this change in regime, many of the first and second generation of immigrants from Islamic countries (the \\"second Israel\\") felt that this would give them a voice, and influence over the leadership state, which was hitherto denied to them during Mapai's reign. Nowadays, descendants of Moroccan immigration are found in the forefront in Israel in versatile and leading roles, in management, leading companies, in the command of the army, politics, sports and culture. Descendants of the Moroccan community now constitute one of the pillars of Israeli culture in such areas as television, theater, literature, song, poetry, and film.

The clause X is referred to as the antecedent (or protasis), while the clause Y is called the consequent (or apodosis). A conditional is understood as expressing its consequent under the temporary hypothetical assumption of its antecedent. Conditional sentences can take numerous forms. The consequent can precede the \\"if\\"-clause and the word \\"if\\" itself may be omitted or replaced with a different complementizer. The consequent can be a declarative, an interrogative, or an imperative. Special tense morphology can be used to form a counterfactual conditional. Some linguists have argued that other superficially distinct grammatical structures such as wish reports have the same underlying structure as conditionals. Conditionals are one of the most widely studied phenomena in formal semantics, and have also been discussed widely in philosophy of language, computer science, decision theory, among other fields. Overview In English conditional sentences, the antecedent (protasis) is a dependent clause, most commonly introduced by the complementizer if. Other complementizers may also be used, such as whenever, unless, provided (that), and as long as. Certain condition clauses can also be formulated using inversion without any conjunction; see below. The consequent clause, expressing the consequence of the stated condition, is generally a main clause. It can be a declarative, interrogative, or imperative clause. . It may appear before or after the condition clause: ::If I see him, I will tell him. (declarative sentence, condition first) ::I will tell him if I see him. (declarative sentence, condition second) ::If you saw him, would you tell him? (interrogative sentence, condition first) ::Would you tell him if you saw him? (interrogative sentence, condition second) ::If you see it, photograph it. (imperative sentence, condition first) ::Photograph it if you see it. (imperative sentence, condition second) As with other dependent clauses in written English, it is common for a comma to be used to separate the clauses if the dependent clause comes first (as is done in the above examples). See . It is possible for the consequence clause to appear alone in a sentence, without a condition clause, if the condition has been previously stated or is understood from the context. It may also be shortened by verb phrase ellipsis; a minimal conditional sentence could therefore be something like \\"Would you?\\" or \\"I would.\\" This phenomenon is known as modal subordination. Counterfactual conditionals Like other languages, English uses past tense morphology to indicate that the speaker regards the antecedent as impossible or unlikely. This use of past tense is often referred to as fake past since it does not contribute its ordinary temporal meaning. Conditionals with fake past marking go by various names including counterfactuals, subjunctives, and X-marked conditionals.The term subjunctive conditional was borrowed from Latin grammar, but is a misnomer as applied to English. English conditionals of this sort do not use subjunctive mood. See Palmer (1986), Dancygier & Sweetswer (1996), Iatridou (2000), Karawani (2014), Romero (2014), Mackay (2015), von Fintel and Iatridou (2020), among others. ::Indicative: If it is raining in New York, then Mary is at home. ::Counterfactual: If it was raining in New York, then Mary would be at home. In older dialects and more formal registers, the form \\"were\\" is often used instead of \\"was\\". Counterfactuals of this sort are sometimes referred to as were'd up conditionals. ::Were'd up: If I were king, I could have you thrown in the dungeon. The form \\"were\\" can also be used with an infinitive to form a future less vivid conditional. ::Future Less Vivid: If I were to be king, I could have you thrown in the dungeon. Counterfactuals can also use the pluperfect instead of the past tense. ::Conditional perfect: If you had called me, I would have come. English language teaching In English language teaching, conditional sentences are often classified under the headings zero conditional, first conditional (or conditional I), second conditional (or conditional II), third conditional (or conditional III) and mixed conditional, according to the grammatical pattern followed, particularly in terms of the verb tenses and auxiliaries used. =Zero conditional= \\"Zero conditional\\" refers to conditional sentences that express a factual implication, rather than describing a hypothetical situation or potential future circumstance (see Types of conditional sentence). The term is used particularly when both clauses are in the present tense; however such sentences can be formulated with a variety of tenses/moods, as appropriate to the situation: ::If you don't eat for a long time, you become hungry. ::If the alarm goes off, there's a fire somewhere in the building. ::If you are going to sit an exam tomorrow, go to bed early tonight! ::If aspirins will cure it, I'll take a couple tonight. ::If you make a mistake, someone lets you know. The first of these sentences is a basic zero conditional with both clauses in the present tense. The fourth is an example of the use of will in a condition clauselingua.org.uk: WILL with IF (further down on the page) (for more such cases, see below). The use of verb tenses, moods and aspects in the parts of such sentences follows general principles, as described in Uses of English verb forms. Occasionally, mainly in a formal and somewhat archaic style, a subjunctive is used in the zero-conditional condition clause (as in \\"If the prisoner be held for more than five days, ...). For more details see English subjunctive. (See also below.) =First conditional= \\"First conditional\\" or \\"conditional I\\" refers to a pattern used in predictive conditional sentences, i.e. those that concern consequences of a probable future event (see Types of conditional sentence). In the basic first conditional pattern, the condition is expressed using the present tense (having future meaning in this context. in some common fixed expressions or in old-fashioned or excessively formal The present subjunctive is occasionally found. for example:If need be, we'll rent a car. see use of the present subjunctive), and the consequence using the future construction with will (or shall): ::If you make a mistake, someone will let you know. ::If he asks me, I will/shall consider his proposal carefully. The use of present tense in dependent clauses with future time reference is not confined to condition clauses; it also occurs in various temporal and relative clauses (as soon as he arrives; take the first train that comes; etc.), as described under . The present tense used in the condition clause may take the form of the simple present as in the above examples, or the present progressive, present perfect or present perfect progressive as appropriate (according to general principles for uses of English verb forms): ::If he is sleeping when we arrive, we shan't wake him. (present progressive) ::Will you wake him if he hasn't stirred by 10 o'clock? (present perfect) ::If you have been working for more than ten hours when he returns, he will take your place. (present perfect progressive) The condition can also be expressed using the modal verb should. This form can be used to make an inverted condition clause without a conjunction: ::If you should make a mistake, ... (equivalent to \\"If you make a mistake\\") ::Should you make a mistake, ... (inverted form equivalent to the above). ::If you should be young, ... (equivalent to \\"If you are young\\") ::Should you be young, ... (inverted form equivalent to the above) Otherwise, the condition clause in a first conditional pattern is not normally formed with a modal verb, other than can. However, there are certain situations (often involving polite expressions) where will, would and could may be used in such clauses; see below. For the occasional use of the subjunctive in the condition clause, see under zero conditional above. In colloquial English, an imperative may be used with the meaning of a condition clause, as in \\"go eastwards a mile and you'll see it\\" (meaning \\"if you go eastwards a mile, you will see it\\"). Although the consequence in first conditional sentences is usually expressed using the will (or shall) future (usually the simple future, though future progressive, future perfect and future perfect progressive are used as appropriate), other variations are also possible ‚Äì it may take the form of an imperative, it may use another modal verb that can have future meaning, or it may be expressed as a deduction about present or past time (consequent on a possible future event): ::If it rains this afternoon, come round to my place! (imperative) ::If it rains this afternoon, we can/could/should/may/might find somewhere to shelter. (other modals) ::If it rains this afternoon, then yesterday's weather forecast was wrong. (deduction about the past) ::If it rains this afternoon, your garden party is doomed. (deduction placed in the present) A particular case involves a condition clause that expresses a goal (this is often done using the be + to construction, the going-to future or the verb want), and the main clause expresses something that is necessary for the achievement of that goal, usually using a modal verb of necessity or obligation. In this case it is effectively the main clause, rather than the dependent condition clause, that expresses a \\"condition\\". ::If we want to succeed, we have to try harder. ::If you are to get your pocket money, you must start behaving yourself. As noted in the following section, it may be possible to express a statement about a hypothetical future situation using either the first or second conditional pattern, with little specific difference in meaning. =Second conditional= \\"Second conditional\\" or \\"conditional II\\" refers to a pattern used to describe hypothetical, typically counterfactual situations with a present or future time frame (for past time frames the third conditional is used). In the normal form of the second conditional, the condition clause is in the past tense (although it does not have past meaning. see Use of the past subjunctive), and the consequence is expressed using the conditional construction with the auxiliary would: ::If I liked parties, I would attend more of them. ::If it rained tomorrow, people would dance in the street. The past tense (simple past or past progressive) of the condition clause is historically the past subjunctive. In modern English this is identical to the past indicative, except in the first and third persons singular of the verb be, where the indicative is was and the subjunctive were; was is sometimes used as a colloquialism (were otherwise preferred), although the phrase if I were you is common in colloquial language. For more details see . ::If I (he, she, it) were rich, there would be plenty of money available for this project. ::If I (he, she, it) were speaking, you would not be allowed to interrupt like that. When were is the verb of the condition clause, it can be used to make an inverted condition clause without a conjunction. If the condition clause uses the past tense of another verb, it may be replaced by the auxiliary construction were to + infinitive (particularly if it has hypothetical future reference); if this is done, then inversion can be applied here too: ::If I were rich, ... / If I were to be rich, ... / Were I (to be) rich, ... ::If I flew, ... / If I were to fly, ... / Were I to fly, ... Another possible pattern is if it weren't for... (inverted form: were it not for ...), which means something like \\"in the absence of ...\\". For clauses with if only, see . For the possible use of would or could in the condition clause as well, see below. The conditional construction of the main clause is usually the simple conditional; sometimes the conditional progressive (e.g. would be waiting) is used. Occasionally, with a first person subject, the auxiliary would is replaced by should (similarly to the way will is replaced by shall). Also, would may be replaced by another appropriate modal: could, should, might. When referring to hypothetical future circumstance, there may be little difference in meaning between the first and second conditional (factual vs. counterfactual, realis vs. irrealis). The following two sentences have similar meaning, although the second (with the second conditional) implies less likelihood that the condition will be fulfilled: ::If you leave now, you will still catch your train. ::If you left now, you would still catch your train. Notice that in indirect speech reported in the past tense, the first conditional naturally changes to the second: ::She'll kill me if she finds out. ::He said I would kill him if I found out. =Third conditional= \\"Third conditional\\" or \\"conditional III\\" is a pattern used to refer to hypothetical situations in a past time frame, generally counterfactual (or at least presented as counterfactual). Here the condition clause is in the past perfect, and the consequence is expressed using the conditional perfect. ::If you had called me, I would have come. ::Would he have succeeded if I had helped him? It is possible for the usual auxiliary construction to be replaced with were to have + past participle. That used, the above examples can be written as such: ::If you were to have called me, I would have come. ::Would he have succeeded if I were to have helped him? The condition clause can undergo inversion, with omission of the conjunction: ::Had you called me, I would have come. / Were you to have called me, I would have come. :: Would he have succeeded had I helped him? / Would he have succeeded were I to have helped him? Another possible pattern (similar to that mentioned under the second conditional) is if it hadn't been for... (inverted form: had it not been for ...), which means something like \\"in the absence of ...\\", with past reference. For clauses with if only, see . For the possible use of would in the condition clause, see . Occasionally, with a first person subject, would is replaced with should. In the main clause, the auxiliary would can be replaced by could or might, as described for the second conditional. If only one of the two clauses has past reference, a mixed conditional pattern (see below) is used. =Mixed conditional= \\"Mixed conditional\\" usually refers to a mixture of the second and third conditionals (the counterfactual patterns). Here either the condition or the consequence, but not both, has a past time reference. When the condition refers to the past, but the consequence to the present, the condition clause is in the past perfect (as with the third conditional), while the main clause is in the conditional mood as in the second conditional (i.e. simple conditional or conditional progressive, but not conditional perfect). ::If you had done your job properly, we wouldn't be in this mess now. ::If I hadn't married Kelly, I wouldn't be living in Scotland now. When the consequence refers to the past, but the condition is not expressed as being limited to the past, the condition clause is expressed as in the second conditional (past, but not past perfect), while the main clause is in the conditional perfect as in the third conditional: ::If we were soldiers, we wouldn't have done it like that. Other variations on the respective clause patterns are possible, as used accordingly in the second and third conditionals. Contradiction between the zero and first conditional. There is a problem when the condition refers to the present, but the consequence to the future, as in these examples: *If you are young, you will like that book. (I do not know how old you are.) *If you are already so good at it, you will be a master in one year. *If he is already here, you will find him. Formally, every sentence above looks like the first conditional, with the condition having future meaning, which was not our intention. Generally, context and auxiliary words like \\"already\\", \\"at present\\", etc. sometimes are enough to inform us that the condition has present meaning, but sometimes are not, which leads to ambiguity, for example: *If you do it now, you will not have to do it later. The word \\"now\\" can be interpreted as \\"at present\\" or \\"in the immediate future\\". Hence, the condition can refer both to the present and future. Use of will and would in condition clauses As noted above regarding the first conditional, will (or shall) is not normally used to mark future time reference in a condition clause; instead an ordinary present tense is used: ::If she wins (not: will win) tomorrow, I'll eat my hat. However, there are certain situations where will can appear in a condition clause. One type of situation is referred to above under zero conditional, where will expresses futurity, but the sentence as a whole expresses factual implication rather than a potential future circumstance: \\"If aspirins will cure it, I'll take a couple tonight\\" (the taking is not a consequence of the curing, but a consequence of the expectation that they will cure). More commonly, will appears in condition clauses where it has a modal meaning, rather than marking the future. (See uses of will.) Relevant meanings include willingness, persistence, or strong disapproval Grammar for CAE and Proficiency by Martin Hewingswordreference.com: single forum post (Reliable source quoted in an online forum, changed slightly here to prevent confusing American speakers with the original's plural pronoun.) To stress willingness or wish, you can use \\"would\\" or \\"will\\" in both clauses of the same sentence: If he would practise more, he would play better. If he will practise more, he will play better. Both mean the same. (Based on the examples and explanations from Practical English Usage, Michael Swan, Oxford) ::If you will excuse me, I think I will slip into something more comfortable. (willingness) ::If you will keep all the windows shut, of course you'll get headaches. (persistence) ::A: The zookeeper was really annoyed with me. ::B: Well, if you will throw stones at the animals, it's not surprising! (strong disapproval) In the second and third sentences will is stressed, and cannot be contracted to \\"'ll.\\" Similarly, would is not generally used in the condition clauses of the counterfactual patterns (second and third conditional) in standard English: ::If I knew (not: would know) him, I would talk to him. ::If you had written (not: would have written), it would have put my mind at rest. However, some varieties of English regularly use would (contracted to 'd) and would have (d have) in counterfactual condition clauses, although this is often considered non-standard: ::If you'd leave (standard: you left) now, you'd be on time. ::If you'd have told (standard: you had told) me, we could've done something about it. Such use of would is widespread especially in spoken American English in all sectors of society. It is not usually found in more formal writing; however some sources describe it as acceptable US English, no longer labeling it colloquial.perfectyourenglish.com: Learn English - Writing - American and British English - Differences in usage \\"Conditional would is sometimes used in both clauses of an if-sentence. This is common in spoken American English.\\"Pearson Longman, Longman Exams Dictionary, grammar guide: It is possible to use would in both clauses in US English but not in British English: US: The blockades wouldn't happen if the police would be firmer with the strikers. Br: The blockades wouldn't happen if the police were firmer with the strikers. There are also cases where would can appear in the condition clause in British English too, but these can be considered to be modal uses of would, indicating willingness: ::If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something.The English-Learning and Languages Review, \\"Questions and Answers\\". Retrieved 3 December 2012. Also, in cases where the event of the if-clause follows that of the main clause, use of would in the if-clause is standard usage (this is similar to the aspirin example given above for will): ::If it would make Bill happy, I would give him the money. Would like and could are sometimes used in condition clauses for politeness: ::I'll make a pot of tea if you would like some. ::Please help Mrs Brown if you could. For the use of should in future condition clauses, see under first conditional. Inversion in condition clauses Certain condition clauses (if- clauses) can be cast without any conjunction such as if or unless, instead using subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion to indicate their meaning. The principal constructions are as follows: *In the first conditional (where the condition clause expresses a possible future condition), inversion can be applied to the form of the condition clause constructed using should: ::If you feel hungry, ... (usual condition clause; present tense with future meaning) ::If you should feel hungry, ... (should form of the condition clause) ::Should you feel hungry, ... (inverted form) *In the second conditional (where the condition clause expresses an unlikely or counterfactual present/future condition; this may also occur in the mixed conditional), inversion is possible in the case where the verb is were ‚Äì the past subjunctive: ::If she were here, ... (usual condition clause) ::Were she here, ...(inverted form) *As a special case of the above, when a condition clause based on a different verb (normally with hypothetical future reference) is formulated using the were to construction, inversion is again possible (provided were and not was is used): ::If you shot, ... (usual condition clause; past tense) ::If you were to shoot, ... (were to construction) ::Were you to shoot, ... (inverted form) *In the third conditional (where the condition clause expresses a counterfactual past condition; this may also occur in the mixed conditional), the condition clause formed with the auxiliary had can be inverted: ::If he had written, ... (usual condition clause; past perfect) ::Had he written, ... (inverted form) *The above can be written with the were to have construction, inversion once again possible. ::If he were to have written, ... (were to have construction) ::Were he to have written, ... (inverted form) Inversion is also possible when the present subjunctive be is used (e.g. \\"Be he called on by God...\\" for \\"If he be called on by God...\\"), but this is archaic usage for condition clauses; it is still occasionally found in dependent clauses expressing \\"no matter whether ...\\", e.g. \\"Be they friend or foe ...\\" (equivalent to \\"Whether they be friend or foe ...\\"). For similar examples see English subjunctive.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Clun Forest, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. Its benefice is united with those of St Mary, Bedstone, St Cuthbert, Clungunford, St Mary, Clunton, and St Edward, Hopton Castle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church originated in the 12th century as a chapel of ease to St George's Church, Clun, achieving parochial status in 1341. Additions and alterations were made to it in the 14th and 15th centuries. There were further alterations in 1842, and in 1848 when the organ chamber was added. The church was restored in 1881 by James Piers St Aubyn, including the addition of a timber-framed south porch. Architecture=Exterior= St Swithin's is constructed in limestone and roofed in slate and stone slate. Its plan consists of a three- bay nave, a chancel, a south porch, a south organ chamber, and a west tower. The tower probably dates from the late 12th century, with its top stage added as late as the 17th century. It has a west door and an 18th-century sundial in the south side. The bell openings are louvred and arched, the parapet is battlemented, and the tower is surmounted by a pyramidal cap and a brass weathercock. On the south side of the church is the timber-framed porch leading to a Norman doorway. To the right of the porch is a Norman window. The other windows on the south side of the nave are Decorated in style. Also in the south wall is an external tomb recess containing a tomb-slab carved with a cross. The south organ chamber has a west doorway. The three-light east window of the chancel contains 19th-century tracery in Perpendicular style. The north wall of the chancel contains a Norman-style window, and there is another Norman window in the north wall of the nave. Interior of Clunbury church, 1910s =Interior= Inside the church is the original Norman west doorway of the nave; this was formerly on the exterior of the church, but now leads into the tower. Above this is a 12th-century window. The roof of the nave has been dated by dendrochronology to 1494‚Äì95. In the south wall of the nave is a trefoil-headed piscina, in a position corresponding to the external tomb recess. The font dates from the 12th century. There is stained glass in the east window and in some of the nave windows by Hardman, and in one window in the south wall of the nave is a window dated 1920 by Kempe and Company. There are separate war memorial plaques to the parish dead of the two World Wars, a slate plaque to Lieutenant Edward Whitehead (killed in First Gulf War 1991), and a prayer desk given in memory of Robert Henry Cooper and his comrades who were killed in World War II in the sinking by enemy action of MV Siamese Prince. The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1882 by Nicholson of Worcester. There is a ring of six bells; one of these was cast in 1620 by William Clibury, and the other five in 1887 by John Warner and Sons.

The Tvam (\\"Thou\\") padartha of the Mahavakya Tat Tvam Asi is determined by the analysis of Panchakoshas that are not the atman. Panchakoshas are discussed in the Brahmanandavalli Chapter of Taittiriya Upanishad which is a part of the Taittiriya Samhita of the Krishna Yajur Veda and in which particular chapter is discussed ways and means to achieve Brahman. It gives a detailed description of the dimensions of human personality or the dimensions of the Self. What is Atman? The Sruti declares that human birth, by divine grace, is meant to strive to know and understand the atman. The knowledge and understanding of the atman invariably results in Jiwanmukti i.e. Moksha or \\"Spiritual liberation\\". Spiritual Liberation is of the nature of bliss in which there is complete negation of all sorrow, it does not arise by mere study of sastras, sacrifice to gods, performance of karmas and meditation on the divinities, these acts do not result in the knowledge of the unity of atman. Atman is Brahman who is of the nature of satyam, jnanam and anantam, and the knower of Brahman becomes Brahman. Knowledge is gained after renouncing attachment to all sense-objects and all actions, for one's body, that harbours the mind that makes for bondage and is not the atman. The Atman is the substratum of the consciousness of \\"I\\". What is anatman? Anatman means not-self or non-self. Anatman is everything that is not Atman. All objects of consciousness are called Anatman, including the mind and the ego. The samsara is the vast turbulent ocean which is the embodiment of avidya and its effects that cannot be crossed without the aid of perfect wisdom; the samsara is the anatman. By non-realisation of the true nature of the atman, the atman is mistaken as the karana sarira (\\"causal body\\"), suksma sarira (\\"subtle body\\") and sthula sarira (\\"gross body\\") which bodies constitute the anatman. For a person who is unaware of the atman there is no other go except to do karmas intended for purification of the mind. What are Panchakoshas? The Panchakoshas are listed as follows - # Annamaya Kosha - The food sheath # Pranamaya Kosha - The vital energy or breath sheath # Manomaya Kosha - The mind sheath # Vijnanamaya Kosha - The intellect sheath # Ananadamaya Kosha - The bliss sheath Panchakoshas are divided in three bodies - * The gross body sthula sarira - made up of physical matter. This body consists of Annamaya kosha and Pranamaya Kosha. * the subtle body suksma sarira - This body consists of Manomaya Kosha and Vijanamaya Kosha. * the causal body karana sarira - This body consists of Ananadamaya Kosha. The atman is behind the Panchakoshas. The Sthula sarira is the Annamayakosha (food-ful, consisting of the gross body). The Suksma sarira is made up of the Pranamayakosha (energy-ful, the subtle body), the Manomayakosha (instinctive, the perceptual body) and the Vigyanamayakosha (cognitive, the conscious body). The Karana sarira is the Anandamayakosha (blissful, the transcendental body). The Sruti insists upon elimination of these five sheaths of the sariras. The doctrine of Panchkoshas represents the hierarchy of human values and is held to be a useful springboard for a modern scientific understanding of cosmology and evolution. Annamaya kosha Anna means matter, annam literally means food; Taittiriya Upanishad calls food the medicament of all. The gross body which is matter-born and matter sustained and transient and subject to perception is the Annamayakosha whose origin is food eaten by parents. It is visible, dependent and impure. It is not the atman because it did not exist before its origination and ceases to exist once it is destroyed. It is subject to origination and destruction every moment. It is the anatman because it is not in the beginning and at the end, is non-existent also in the present. It does not know itself. The deluded mind that does not inquire considers his atman to be this body or kosha. Such a person cannot enjoy bliss. Pranamaya kosha Pranamayakosha, separate from and subtler than Annamayakosha, pertains to the Sukshma sarira, it is the sheath of the vital airs completely enclosing and filling the Annamayakosha. The Prana in combination with the five organs of action constitutes the Pranamayakosha. The Annamayakosha is an effect of the Pranamayakosha. The Annamayakosha gets life by the Prana entering into it and engages in all kinds of action. Prana is the life of beings and the Universal life. Whatever happens in the Annamayakosha is wrongly identified as belonging to the atman by reason of its being pervaded by the Pranamayakosha which is effect of Vayu, and totally unaware and dependent. Manomaya kosha Manomayakosha belongs to the Suksma sarira. It is the \\"self\\" having Pranamayakosha as its body. The organs of knowledge and the mind form this kosha which is the cause of the sense of the \\"I\\" and of the \\"mine\\" and of the varying conceptions. It creates difference of names etc., because organs of knowledge are dependent on and determined by the mind which is of the nature of determination and doubt. It is powerful because bondage and liberation depend on the mind which producing attachment binds a person and which by creating aversion for them liberates them from that self-made bondage. It pervades the Pranamayakosha. It is the sacrificial fire, the five organs are the priests who pour into this fire the oblations of sense-objects, which fire fuelled by various vasanas burns out the world created and expanded by the mind that when fouled by rajas (\\"projection\\") and tamas (\\"concealment\\") superimposes the samsara but when free of rajas and tamas can bring about the state of being established in Brahman. Vijnanamaya kosha The word Vijnana means Knowledge. This layer is made of the intellect and knowledge. This is the part of mind that makes decisions, and takes ownership of action and becomes an ego. Vijnanamaya kosha also belongs to the Suksma sarira and pervades the Manomayakosha that pervades the Pranamayakosha which pervades the Annamayakosha. Buddhi with its organs of knowledge and its actions having the characteristics of an agent is the Vigyanakosha, the cause of samsara. It has the power of reflection of the chaitanya which it accompanies as a modification of Prakrti (avidya) and characterised by knowledge and action and always identified with the body, organs etc. This kosha is endowed with jnana and to it belong the waking and dream states and the experiences of joy and sorrow. Being very luminous in close proximity of the Paramatman deluded by which upadhi it is subject to samsara, this atman which is compacted of vigyanana and shining in the heart near the pranas being immutable becomes a doer and enjoyer in the midst of the upadhis. Its \\"jivabhava-existential- character\\" i.e. Jivahood, persists so long as there is delusion as it is born of mithyajnana. Though avidya is beginningless it is not eternal. Anandamaya kosha Ananda means bliss. This is the bliss of the Atman. This bliss is experienced when we fall into deep sleep. Anandamaya kosha is the last layer and it is the closest layer to the Atman. It is a modification of avidya and appears as a reflection of the atman compacted of absolute bliss. It is fully manifested in the dreamless deep sleep. It is not the atman because it is connected with upadhis (\\"limitations\\") and a modification of Prakrti as an effect of good deeds. Significance Atman can be identified only by negation of the anatman. The Panchkoshas are anatman that hide the atman, these koshas or sheaths are required to be systematically removed. Their removal brings to fore a void which void is also required to be removed. After removal of the five sheaths and the resultant void through the process of negation, what remains is the Atman; and then the non-existence of all the modifications beginning with the ahamkara is self-witnessed, the self that witnesses is itself the supreme Self. These five sheaths envelop the atman or \\"soul\\". The Vedanta conceives the expression of the gross universe possible by traversing through all these stages of emanation from the cloud of Maya covering the face of Brahman to Sthula bhutas or gross matter with all its multifarious aspect including gross energy. Badarayana, drawing attention to ‚Äôs grammar (V.iv.21), explains that the suffix mayat as in Annamaya (made of food), Pranamaya (made of vital air) etc., besides conveying the meaning \\"made of\\" has also the sense of abundance and plenitude as wellBrahma Sutra I.i.13 for which reason it is repeatedly said - Brahman is the Blissful (Anandamaya) Self.

This could be a part-load power station (Teillast-Durchfluss-Kraftwerk) or a storage power station. Also called a balancing reservoir.  Function  The hydropower station sited above the basin works only a few hours a day. Often it is only used to generate peak current electricity. During hours of low current demand, the power station switches off in order to save the water available in the headstream for the valuable peak power times. Without some form of equalization, however, the tailwaters would run dry when the turbines shut down. This would result in extremely low levels of water, causing serious problems for the plants and animals that live in and around the stream or river. In general, therefore, the power station operator today is required to regulate the flow in order to ensure a specified minimum level of water flow into the tailwaters. During periods when the turbines are running (peak current generation) the equalizing basin fills up; during periods when the turbines are shut down, the basin drains gradually. In the main, equalizing basins are small reservoirs located below a larger dam and reservoir system. The water flowing out of the equalizing basin into the tailstream can be used in a run-of-river power station.

Their structural classification ranges from hexahedrites to octahedrites. IIABs have the lowest concentration of nickel of all iron meteorite groups. All iron meteorites are derived from the metallic planetary cores of their respective parent bodies, but in the case of the IIABs the metallic magma separated to form not only this meteorite group but also the IIG group. Naming Iron meteorite groups are designated with a Roman numeral and one or two letters. Classification is based on diagrams in which the nickel content of meteoric iron is plotted against certain trace elements (e.g. gallium, germanium and iridium). Clusters in these diagrams are assigned a row (Roman numeral) and a letter in alphabetical order. The first two cluster of the second row, IIA and IIB, were merged when additional measurements connected the two clusters into one, the IIAB group. Description The low concentration of nickel in the IIAB group leads to most of the meteoric iron becoming kamacite. All iron meteorites are made of a native metal called meteoric iron. The concentration of nickel has an influence on the mineralogy of the meteoric iron. During cooling kamacite is exsolved from taenite. The lower the concentration of nickel, the more kamacite is formed. IIABs have some of the lowest nickel concentrations of all iron meteorites. They are in the range of 5.3 to 6.6%. For this reason they mostly consist of kamacite with minor amounts of taenite. The two groups that were merged into the IIAB group had different nickel concentrations and therefore different structural classifications. The IIA group has lower nickel concentrations and forms hexahedrites, the IIB has higher nickel concentrations and forms octahedrites. Parent body Phase diagram showing the suspected cooling path of the parent body. While cooling the parent body reached the IIAB field. It then followed the field to the eutectic point where the remaining melt cavities formed the IIG meteorites. The IIAB meteorites formed the metallic core of their parent body before it was destroyed, and some of the fragments reached earth as iron meteorites. The planetary core of the IIABs was rich in sulfur and phosphorus. This special chemical composition caused the magma to split into two separate liquids while cooling. The concentration of sulfur is estimated to have been about 5%. For this reason the metallic magma reached the liquidus curve (a point where solids coexist with a liquid) of the iron + liquid field. This led to the crystallization of the IIAB meteorites. The remaining liquid was trapped in cavities of the IIABs and crystallized once the temperature reached the eutectic point. At this temperature the remaining magma crystallized schreibersite and iron, thereby forming the IIG meteorites. Notable specimens There are currently 117 meteorites classified as IIAB and 1 as IIAB-anomalous. Of these only three were observed falls. Seven IIAB meteorites weigh more than 1000 kg. The Sikhote-Alin meteorite is the heaviest of these and was an observed fall, while the Old Woman meteorite is, at and originally, the largest meteorite found in California and the second largest found in the United States.

The bout was marred by technical glitches: after Ovtchinnikova took a 9‚Äì5 lead, she struck a hit which did not register on the electrical apparatus and was finally denied. The incident occurred twice. After the problem was resolved, Besbes struck ten hits in a row to win the bout. At the age of 18 she became the first female African athlete to fence in an Olympic quarter-final. She took a 9‚Äì6 lead against US fencer and World No.1 Rebecca Ward, but Ward levelled, before taking the advantage on 14‚Äì12. Besbes rallied to 14-all at the end of fencing time. The last hit required a lengthy video review and was finally given to Ward, who won the bout. Besbes incriminated a lack of support from the Tunisian Fencing Federation, which did not allow her to prepare correctly for an event of this magnitude. In the 2008‚Äì09 season Besbes posted a top-8 finish at the Ghent World Cup and earned the gold medal at the African Championships in Dakar. The next year, she took a silver at the Africans in Tunis and reached the quarter- finals at the 2010 World Championships in Paris, before being stopped by Ukraine's Olena Khomrova. In the 2010‚Äì11 season she climbed her first World Cup with a bronze medal at the Bologna World Cup. She regained her African crown in Cairo and posted a last-16 finish at the World Championships in Catania. These results allowed her to close the season World No.8, a career best . Besbes qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics as the top-ranked African fencer, this time with another Tunisian, Amira Ben Chaabane . Besbes defeated Hong Kong's Au Sin Ying in the first round, before losing out her next match to American fencer Dagmara Wozniak, with a score of 13‚Äì15. Besbes again qualified to the individual event of the 2016 Summer Olympics, and reached the quarterfinal. She was ultimately ranked 5th. In April 2018, in a phone call with the Tunisian TV channel \\"Elhiwar ettounssi\\", Azza announced the end of her career. The reason was because the Tunisian minister of sports \\"Majdouline Cherni\\" (who was busy with the local elections) refused to take Azza's calls in order to force Azza to accept the contract offered my the government despite Azza multiple warnings of multiple legal breaches in the contract. Azza described The Tunisian minister \\"Majdouline Cherni\\" as the worst sports minister she has ever dealt with during her tenure.

Overview The election oversaw the increasing influence of the political groups in the local elections. The three major emerging pro- democratic groups, which later evolved into today's pro-democracy camp, the Meeting Point, Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and Hong Kong Affairs Society were the strategic allies against the conservative kaifong leaders in the election. The older political organisation, the Hong Kong Civic Association cooperated with Maria Tam's Progressive Hong Kong Society, while the Progressive Hong Kong Society and also the pro-Beijing leftist Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions remained in low-profile in the election. Some candidates who used to be closely associated with older conservative groups were switching over to the younger liberal camps, such as Vivien Chan stood for the Reform Club of Hong Kong in 1985 and was claimed to be one of the influential members in the club had moved over to the Hong Kong Affairs Society. Kan Chun-lim had also swung away from Maria Tam's conservative Progressive Hong Kong Society to the liberal Hong Kong Affairs Society. In this election, the Meeting Point had built a power base in Tuen Mun while the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood in Sham Shui Po. The Hong Kong Affairs Society had its power base in Sha Tin while it tried to test their strength in the Eastern District, Wan Chai and Central and Western District, and tried to break the dominance of the older conservative Civic Association. The Reform Club tried to recapture a power base in the Eastern District under the umbrella of Brook Bernacchi and concentrated its resources in Yau Ma Tei under Kwan Lim-ho.

He was one of The Eight (1909‚Äì1918), who first exhibited under that name in Budapest in 1911 and were influential in introducing cubism, fauvism and expressionism into Hungarian art. Many of them had studied in Munich and, even more importantly, Paris, from which they brought back leading techniques and artistic movements. They were part of the radical intellectual culture in Budapest in the early 20th century, associated with such poets as Endre Ady and composers as B√©la Bart√≥k. In 1937, Czig√°ny killed his family and committed suicide in what was considered a psychotic breakdown.\\"A List of Artists Who Committed Suicide\\", Art History, About.com, accessed 1 February 2013 Early life and education Dezs≈ë Czig√°ny was born to a Jewish-Hungarian family in Budapest in 1883.Adrian M.

In 1901 and 1903, he studied at the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony in Hungary, at what is now Baia Mare, Romania. Career Czig√°ny was interested in exploring more contemporary movements in art and became one of The Eight in Budapest. Their first exhibit, called New Pictures, was in 1909, and in 1911, they opened another called The Eight. Other members included K√°roly Kernstok, B√©la Cz√≥bel, R√≥bert Ber√©ny, √ñd√∂n M√°rffy, Deszs≈ë Orb√°n, Lajos Tihanyi and Bertalan P√≥r.

Among the writers and composers involved with The Eight was Endre Ady, and Czig√°ny was one of at least four men who painted a portrait of this pivotal figure and friend in the early 20th century. The composer B√©la Bart√≥k was also associated with these artists. By 1914, Czig√°ny was one of four of the group accepted for an exhibit at the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus, together with M√°rffy, Orb√°n, and Kernstok. The works of Ber√©ny and Tihanyi, who had embraced expressionism, were rejected as too radical.\\"'The Eight: Hungary's Highway to Modernism' on view at Bank Austria Kunstforum\\", Art Daily, 14 September 2012, accessed 1 February 2013 He painted many still lifes in numerous variations.Judit Szabadi, Gy√∂rgy Darabos, The Kieselbach Collection: Hungarian Painting 1900‚Äì1945: A Selection, Tam√°s Kieselbach, 1996, pp. 66‚Äì70 They are considered to show his quality of restraint and withdrawal, as the scholar Ir√©n Kisd√©gin√© Kirimi describes them as \\"lacking any lyrical quality.\\"Ir√©n Kisd√©gin√© Kirimi, Still-lifes in the Hungarian National Gallery, Corvina Press, 1977 Unlike several members of the group who left in 1919 after the fall of the Hungarian Democratic Republic, Czig√°ny stayed in Hungary for most of his career. In his later life, he also painted numerous self-portraits, always with a serious expression on his face. Suffering from depression, in 1937 Czig√°ny killed his family and committed suicide.Michael Largo, Genius and Heroin: Creativity and Reckless Abandon, HarperCollins, 2010, p. 284, accessed 1 February 2013 Shortly after the end of World War II, a solo retrospective exhibition was held in Budapest to honor Czig√°ny's art work.

The childhood of St Lawrence, the patron saint of Undl√∏se, is also presented. Grotesque figures can also be seen, probably as a warning against unseemly living.

The Undl√∏se workshop is considered to have a higher artistic standard than its contemporaries. The figures are plastic, the faces specific and the costumes carefully chosen. The landscapes and buildings have perspective while shading creates emphasis. The ornamental decoration is elegant consisting primalily of a rod, encircled with a broad ribbon and a spiralled vine with twigs of spruce. The artwork appears to have been inspired by the Bohemian Master of Wittingau (c. 1380) or the Wesphalian Conrad von Soest while the artists themselves may have been foreign.\\"Undl√∏se Kirke\\", in Marie-Louise J√∏rgensen, Hugo Johannsen: Danmarks Kirker IV: Holb√¶k Amt, vol 1, 1979, Nationalmuseets Forlag, pages 357-398.

Relationship with the Master of Fogd√∂ It has been suggested that the Union Master may also be responsible for the frescoes in Fogd√∂ Church, Runtuna Church and in Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral in Sweden. It has also been suggested that this is another artist, sometimes called the Master of Fogd√∂ (). To some extent the attribution of works to individual artists or workshops of this age will remain uncertain and a case for further research. However, according to Signums svenska konsthistoria, a comprehensive art history of Sweden, artistic details uncovered in R√∏rby Church in Denmark in 1981 convincingly display similarities strong enough to rule out that the Swedish and the Danish frescoes are by different artists. The Master of Fogd√∂ would thus be identical with the Union Master.

Not until the 19th century the mines were finally closed due to unprofitability. Even today, gold can be panned in the Rauris.

(Villaricca, 7 June 1863 - Naples, 16 July 1929), was an Italian physician known for his compassion for the poor of Naples and later a priest of the Barnabite Order. He was declared venerable by Pope John Paul II on 12 December 1992. Life=Birth= He was born in Villaricca, in the Province of Naples to Francesco De Martino, a Chancellor of the trial court of Giugliano, and his wife, Concetta, the only son among their three children. His parents provided him with a strict and wise Christian education. He was baptized in the local parish on the same day of his birth, and he received the full name of Vittorio Pietro Paolo Giovanni Battista Pasquale De Martino. =Studies and medical career= After finishing his elementary school in 1878, De Marino attended the Bianchi College, operated by the Barnabites in Naples and in 1882 he chose to study medicine in compliance with his parents' will. He graduated from the University of Naples Federico II with honors, received a medical degree at the age of 24 and he became a well-known and admired doctor. He was known as the \\"Doctor of the poor\\" as he mainly took care of the poorest people and supported them with economic aids. In fact he usually left money in hidden places for the poor in order to give them the possibility to buy their medicines. De Marino was also the main financial support of his parents, helping them in caring for one of his sisters who suffered from cancer for many years. Faith When his sister eventually died, De Marino, at the age of 47, decided to follow a religious vocation he had long felt, but which had been hindered by his parents. So, on 21 April 1910, he entered the novitiate of the Barnabite Fathers in San Felice a Cancello in Caserta, where he professed his religious vow the following years. As he demonstrated virtues as a doctor and as a benefactor of the people, he gained the admiration of his brothers and he was considered as an example for them. He was ordained a priest in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran in Rome on 20 September 1913. De Marino's first role of priestly ministry was at San Felice a Cancello in the church of St John the Evangelist. In 1916 he was appointed Superior of the community and he kept on practicing as a doctor during World War I and during the worldwide pandemic of the Spanish flu that took many victims. In 1922 he was appointed Rector of the new Apostolic School of the Barnabites in Arpino, and in 1924 he became the Superior of the community of Santa Maria di Caravaggio in Piazza Dante, Naples. Death De Marino was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which quickly got worse and led to his death on 16 July 1929 in Naples in Bianchi College. His body was initially buried in the Cemetery of Poggioreale and then moved to San Giovanni Evangelista Church in San Felice a Cancello on 2 May 1954, twenty-five years later, in the same year the process for his beatification was begun.

Life The high altar of the St. Annakirche Hans and his father, the sculptor and woodcarver Adolf Daucher (c. 1460, Ulm ‚Äì c. 1524, Augsburg), both worked in Augsburg and belonged to the Ulm School. Either Hans or Adolf produced the altarpiece weighing 370 talents which has been on the high altar of the Evangelical Lutheran St. Annenkirche in Annaberg-Buchholz, though it was long thought to be a collaboration between them. Some of its materials originated in the Ore Mountains on the Czech border, 403 kilometres from Augsburg. In 1522 the work was unveiled in the 'Hauptchor' or upper choir of the church. The Solhofen limestone sculptures were surrounded by a framework made up of ten different types of Italian marble. Hans is also known to have worked independently on the Fugger Chapel in the same church after 1512 ‚Äì its central Corpus Christi and Lamentation of Christ groups, the putti on the marble balustrade in front of the chapel and the choir stalls are his work. Daucher's sculpture The Lamentation of Christ, dated to around 1500, is in Notre-Dame-de-la-Nativit√© in the town of Saverne. Hans also worked between 1515 and 1516 on the late Gothic decoration of the Rathaus in Augsburg.

He was so in demand that he had to maintain a large studio in Augsburg, with one area producing and processing huge marble blocks for his sculptures and another for melting and casting medals and cooling his large and small sculptures.

These immigrants quickly sought to establish and regulate the basic institutions of the trades: Friendly societies, the house of call and apprenticeship. Friendly societies were worker controlled mutual insurance organizations. They provided an income in the case of strike, injury or economic downturn. Their association with specific trades also made them useful vehicles for trade union organization. The master-journeymen- apprentice system Master tradesmen were the skilled workers who would contract to perform large building projects. They depended upon their apprentices, \\"tradesmen in training,\\" and those apprentices who had graduated, the independent journeymen. = Apprenticeship = Apprenticeship was the means by which tradesmen acquired their skills and controlled access to their trade. It was a seven-year contract in which the master agreed to train the apprentice and frequently board him in his own home as well. The apprentice would be paid for part of their service, but at a much reduced rate compared to journeymen. Apprentices were indentured under the \\"Law of Master & Servant\\" and hence subject to significant penalties for breach of contract should they abandon their masters. Journeymen in contrast, were supposed to be independent subcontractors. As will be seen, their actual independence was constrained by the common practice of keeping them in debt. They couldn't change masters without the fear of losing their owed wages.  The Mechanics Institute  Second market in York (Toronto) In 1830, Reform politicians John Lesslie and William Lyon Mackenzie helped form the York (later Toronto) Mechanics' Institute, based upon their experience with the \\"Dundee Rational Institute\\" in Scotland, and the London Mechanics Institute. This was an early attempt to provide more general working class education for apprentices. \\"Common schools\\" received little government support compared to the \\"grammar schools\\" that taught a classical education to the elite Family Compact bound for university. The Institute built up a lending library, and held weekly lectures. The Mechanics Institute was closely bound to the Reform movement, and shared quarters with their political organization, the Canadian Alliance Society, in the second market buildings. A Mechanics Institute was also started in Kingston. = Journeymen = After completing their apprenticeship, workers joined the ranks of journeymen. Like their bosses, the masters, they performed the same tasks and had the same terms of employment (on contracts). They differed from masters who were more stabile (having a shop) and willing to take on large contracts and to subcontract. Over time, as he gained skill and capital, a journeyman could begin to sub-contract larger projects and eventually take apprentices and become a master himself. Friendly societies Friendly Societies were democratically organized self-help community insurance organizations designed to alleviate tragedies arising from accident, sickness and old age. Regular contributions to a common fund entitled the society member to relief when sick or unemployed, providing that member an income in the face of calamity. Legislation had been passed in Britain in 1793 giving the Friendly Societies legal standing while confirming the illegality of other forms of popular organization. Their association with specific trades also made them useful vehicles for trade union organization, which was otherwise illegal under the Combination Act of 1799.  Houses of call  Friendly Societies representing specific trades would meet at taverns, their ‚Äúhouse of call.‚Äù Journeymen looking for work could register at these taverns, and masters looking for men could find them there. Journeymen were mobile, and could rarely count on long-term employment. Only apprentices were hired for any length of time, usually the period of their seven-year indenture to learn the trade.  Jobbing and tramping  Having served an apprenticeship, journeymen owned their own tools and could be hired by the task (piecework), by the ‚Äújob,‚Äù or by time. ‚ÄúJobbing‚Äù was a form of sub- contracting, in which the worker provided not only his own tools, but also his own materials. Journeymen thus had a range of flexible employment options which entailed frequent short-term stints of work and equally frequent periods of ‚Äútramping‚Äù looking for jobs. When tramping, they might travel a circuit of towns visiting their Houses of Call. If they were members of a trade-based Friendly Society, they might appeal to its members for aid during these periods of unemployment. =Masters and contracting=The trades and their unionization Trade unions were illegal in Britain until 1825. Their legal standing in Upper Canada is uncertain. However, as the Owenite socialist movement in England and America gathered steam in 1834 they created Grand Trade Unions bringing tradesmen of many professions in one union in both continents. A similar movement took place in Upper Canada. A builders union emerged in 1834, followed by a typographers union shortly thereafter. By 1836, the tradesmen (called \\"mechanics\\" then) formed a petitioning organization, the \\"Mechanics Association,\\" in order to further the political issues important to workers - the use of prison labour in particular. =Legal standing= In Britain, the ‚ÄúCombination Act‚Äù of 1799 made labour unions ‚Äúcriminal conspiracies,‚Äù illegal until 1825, when the Act was finally repealed. Some have argued that the Combination Act never applied in Upper Canada; English criminal law applied in Upper Canada because the House of Assembly accepted all English criminal statutes as of 17 September 1792, seven years before the Combination Act was passed. However, other acts passed after the reception date were subsequently accepted as law. If the Combination Act was taken as received, its repeal in 1825 was a separate issue again. As the matter was never settled in the higher courts in this period we can only point to the general ‚Äúindefinite area of toleration‚Äù for such combinations evidenced in the magistrates‚Äô manuals for Upper Canada. W.C. Keele's ‚ÄúThe Provincial Justice, or Magistrate‚Äôs Manual‚Ä¶ compiled and inscribed by permission, to His Majesty‚Äôs Attorney General‚Äù was published in 1835 and stated without qualification that any justice of the peace could have any striking worker jailed, its untested formal legality notwithstanding. =General contracting and the building trades= Third Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada (1834) Chewett Building, designed And built by John George Howard The drive to form labour unions in Upper Canada resulted from a fundamental change in the way building projects in Toronto were contracted. The change to general contracting happened first in government construction projects, then private ones, leading to labour strife. General contracting was introduced in the building trades in the 1820s in Britain. General contracting reorganized the bidding process by which construction contracts were awarded, and in so doing, challenged the master- journeyman system. General contracting began in the British ‚ÄúOffice of Public Works‚Äù during the Napoleonic Wars; they obtained competitive tenders for the whole project by a single builder at fixed cost for the first time. This was a means by which they could limit their liability for cost overruns. By 1825, the system became common in the northwest of England, resulting in a steep fall in wages. General contracting was introduced in Upper Canada in the construction of public works such as the new parliament buildings in Toronto, beginning in 1829. This placed the project in the hands of a single master builder who subcontracted portions of the project to the other trades. Rather than ‚Äújob‚Äù the work to a subcontractor, the general contractor would provide his own building materials, hiring masters and their journeymen as labour only. By limiting ‚Äújobbing,‚Äù the general contractors also eroded the traditional measures by which these jobs were costed. This gave the general contractor more profit, and the masters less. John George Howard, architect & general contractor The general contractors had no interests in perpetuating the master-journeyman system and its traditional standards of payment, and abused the apprenticeship system by hiring unqualified workmen. General contracting was clearly an issue in Toronto as early as 1831 when the members of the United Amicable Trade and Benefit Society of Journeymen Bricklayers, Plasterers and Masons rejected the general contracting system. The general contractors used debt to bind workers to them. Workers complained of ‚Äúgreat delay in obtaining payment‚Äù in June 1833, when the friendly society of carpenters and joiners called on their employers ‚Äúfor more punctual payments than what we have had in time past.‚Äù They demanded ‚Äú$5 per week on account, and a settlement at the end of each month.‚Äù According to an anonymous ‚ÄúMaster Builder‚Äù (contractor), ‚Äúthey receive from 3 to 5 dollars per week, at an average; and a settlement when the employer gets in his money, or obtains installments upon his contracts, when the Journeymen are often paid from ¬£5 to ¬£20 of arrears.‚Äù Thomas Dalton, editor of the Patriot, retorted: These workers could not easily change jobs when those general contractors owed them substantial back-wages. The tension between general contractors and the building tradesmen came to a head in 1833 with the construction of Chewett's block by general contractor John George Howard. Chewett's building, was a ‚Äúsplendid block of lofty brick houses is erecting on King and York Streets, to comprise eight or ten tenements for stores or dwelling houses, with an extensive hotel at the corner‚Ä¶ ‚Äù Its designer and general contractor was a new British emigrant, John George Howard. Howard was to become one of Toronto's most famous architects and builders: besides Chewett's building, he built 4 large houses in Toronto the year he arrived and predicted he would build twenty of the one-hundred houses that would be built the next year. Just before Christmas, the workers on Chewett's block went on strike after Howard refused to pay them their wages in full. The workers now refused to work for ‚Äúany person whatever, other than a Master of their respective Trades, except it be direct for the Owner or Proprietor of Buildings.‚Äù Howard's intermediary role as general contractor was clearly a point of contention. The striking workmen were up against the Family Compact. James G. Chewett was not only the deputy surveyor general of the province, but also a magistrate. Chewett, building owner and magistrate, had William Jarvis, sheriff of the Home District and elected representative for the city lay charges against the men. This is Toronto's first major strike. No court records survived of the case, but 6 weeks after they first struck for the payment of back wages they received ¬£85. This incident appears to have emboldened the masters and their journeymen to petition their member of the Legislative Assembly, Sheriff William Jarvis (the man who had arrested them for striking) to prepare for a ‚Äúlien law somewhat similar to an act of that name now in force in New York, by which the wages of the workmen employed in buildings are very adequately protected.‚Äù The law required the commissioner of a building to withhold labourers‚Äô wages from installment payments made to contractors, and to pay those labourers directly. The Assembly prepared a ‚ÄúMechanics Protection Bill,‚Äù but as William Lyon Mackenzie correctly predicted, ‚ÄúNothing will be done on it this parliament. It may pass the next, if the legislative council be new modelled.‚Äù =The Typographical Union= The city's 20 journeymen printers in the Typographical Union of Toronto struck in October 1836, for higher wages and a limit on the number of apprentices per shop. The Mechanics Association and prison labour These craft-based friendly societies organized themselves as a ‚ÄúMechanics Association‚Äù in 1836, with branches in Kingston, Toronto, and Dundas. It was first organized in Kingston in 1833 as a result of opposition to the use of convict labour in the new penitentiary. The artisans argued that convict produced goods would compete with their own, lowering prices, and impoverishing them. As the penitentiary neared completion in 1835, the mechanics of Kingston again petitioned the legislature. A similar public meeting was called in Toronto in March. By August 1836 they formed a Mechanics Association. Key to coordinating the associations were Charles Sewell, a Kingston watchmaker who moved to Toronto that year; and William Lesslie, a Kingston storekeeper in a family business with branches in Toronto and Dundas, who moved to Toronto in 1835. Sewell went on to become the secretary of the new association. In explaining the need for such an innovation, they stated The formation of a ‚Äúpolitical union‚Äù for the purpose of organizing petitions was the primary form of political activity of the era, and had resulted in the ‚ÄúGreat Reform Act‚Äù of 1832 in Britain. The new Association was intended to politically represent the ‚Äúmechanical interest‚Äù only ‚Äì that is, masters and their journeymen ‚Äì ‚Äúeither by petition to the Legislature, or to any other branch of Government, for any alteration or extension of duties, by inforcing the law against such as may violate it to their injury, by addresses to the public or its own members.‚Äù As such it is similar to the National Union of the Working Classes (founded in 1831) in London, which was to instigate the Chartist movement in 1838, or the American Workingmen's party in New York.

The property is best known as the scene of the Wave Hill Walk-Off, a strike by Indigenous Australian workers for better pay and conditions, which in turn was an important influence on Aboriginal land rights in Australia. Description Wave Hill is located about east of Kalkaringi, south east of Timber Creek and about south of Darwin in the Northern Territory. The station occupies an area of and encompasses part of the Victoria River, which bisects the station. The land is situated on high open downs with basalt plains and covered in Mitchell grass, and is well watered by the Victoria River to the west and the Camfield River to the east as well as numerous creeks. The northern portion of the property is predominantly vertisols covered in tussock grassland. The southern portion is based mostly on kandosols with a landscape composed of open woodland to the south west and shrubland to the east with smaller areas of hummock grassland dispersed throughout. It is bounded to the north west by Victoria River Downs, the north east by Camfield Station, to the east by Cattle Creek Station. Areas to the south and west are Aboriginal Land holdings. it is shown as named Wave Hill or Wave Hill/Cattle Creek and owned by Western Grazing. It is the company‚Äôs largest station, at over . It uses Grey Brahman, Charolais and Charbray bulls to breed cattle. It mainly supplies the live export market, but can also move stock south into Queensland. History The traditional owners of the lands are the Gurindji peoples, who have lived in the area for approximately 60,000 years. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1854 by Augustus Charles Gregory, and later in 1879 by Alexander Forrest during his journey from the coast of Western Australia to the Overland Telegraph Line. Both Wave Hill and Victoria River Downs were established in 1883. =Buchanan Family= The station was established in 1883 by Nathaniel Buchanan, who took delivery of 1,000 head of cattle in May 1884 after having some trouble finding a suitable route. Buchanan, a renowned explorer and bushman, took delivery of another 3,000 head in late 1885 that had been overlanded from Cloncurry. An employee at the station, John Holmes from Devonshire, died of sunstroke in October 1887. By 1888, Buchanan was moving cattle off Wave Hill and to another holding, Sturt's Creek Station, where he was fattening the cattle for butchering on-site. This was providing prime fresh beef, at sixpence per pound, to the men at the nearby gold diggings and at the port at Wyndham. The station manager in 1891 was Sam Croker (also known as \\"Greenhide Sam\\") who was described as \\"as thorough a bushman as can be found in all of Australia\\". It was Croker that also provided the name of the station when he suggested it after being struck by the sharp undulations of the plateau. Buchanan put the property up for auction in 1894, advertising the property as being of high open downs, basalt plains with rich black soil covered in with Mitchell grass. Wave Hill was stocked with horses and 15,000 head of cattle, of which 8,000 bullocks were ready for market. The property was purchased by Nathaniel Buchanan's brother, William Buchanan who then suffered from a tick infestation on cattle in the area, meaning he was unable to move any stock across the Western Australian border in late 1896. The station was blamed for introducing the tick into the Kimberley after 600 cattle from the station crossed the border in 1896 and 100 had died as a result from tick or redwater. In 1899, station manager Mr T. Cahill and his stockmen were attacked by Indigenous Australians while they were in camp while out mustering. The men had been mustering in an area where a man known as \\"Paddy the Lasher\\" had been murdered two years earlier, and once they had made camp and were sitting down to a meal several spears were thrown at them, hitting none of the men. The party made to defend themselves and the attackers scattered. Later the same year the homestead was burned to the ground. This was also blamed on an Aboriginal group who had \\"been pretty troublesome on the station lately\\". The first person to cycle around Australia, Arthur Charles Jeston Richardson, was to stop at the station during his ride, and found the burnt out building. He later came across the mustering party to give them the bad news. By 1901, the station was carrying about 20,000 head of cattle. 20,000 head of cattle were removed from Wave Hill and overlanded to Killarney Station, near Narrabri in New South Wales, in 1904. The \\"remarkable droving feat\\" took 18 months to complete. A droving record was set by William Philips in 1906 when he overlanded 1,260 bullocks from Wave Hill some to Burrendilla, near Charleville in just 32 weeks. By 1907, Wave Hill was stocked with an estimated 58,000 head of cattle. =Vestey Group= Buchanan died in 1911 and Wave Hill was advertised to be sold by auction in February 1913. The property was advertised in 1912 as occupying an area of , stocked with 75,000 cattle and 1,400 horses. The property was bought the English company Union Cold Storage Company in January 1914. Union was part of the Vestey Group, a British pastoral conglomerate owned by Lord Vestey. The station manager, Harold Seale, who had lived in the Territory for the preceding ten years, died of pneumonia and pleurisy in 1915 at 35 years of age. A subsequent manager, Oswald Quinn, died in 1921 ‚Äì also at age 35 ‚Äì from malaria and complications arising from the effects of gas from overseas military action. A meat house, used for storage, was burnt down in 1921. The building was in poor condition and unhygienic. By 1923 the size of the property was estimated at and was the third largest run in the Northern Territory, the largest being Victoria River Downs, which occupied . Destructive floods wreaked havoc at the station in February 1924. Following heavy rains the river rose rapidly and swept away buildings, plant and stock worth thousands of pounds. A safer site was selected and a new homestead was completed a year later. A wireless station was constructed at the station in 1925. The set had a two kilowatt power rating and could be used to communicate with Camooweal some away and bigger towns such as Darwin and Townsville. The set was powered by an oil electric generator. The explorer and author Michael Terry passed through Wave Hill as part of his expedition to drive from Broome in Western Australia to Darwin in 1927. Following the disappearance of the Southern Cross that was piloted by Charles Kingsford Smith in early April 1929 as part of the flight from Sydney to Wyndham, messages had been sent using the Wave Hill wireless station. Several search-planes went to look for the Southern Cross including the Kookaburra, flown by Lieutenant Keith Anderson with mechanic R. Hitchcock, which took off from Alice Springs on the 10th of April. The Kookaburra never landed at Wave Hill to resupply and was declared missing. The Southern Cross was found 12 April on mudflats at the mouth of the Glenelg River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The wreckage of the Kookaburra was found in desert country south-east of Wave Hill on 21 April with Hitchcock's body beneath one wing and Anderson missing. Anderson's body was found a few hundred meters away. The station was struck by drought in 1932 with many springs drying up and cattle being in poor condition. 4,200 head of Wave Hill stock had to be quarantined at Anthony's Lagoon after an outbreak of pleuro- pneumonia. Shorthorn cattle were introduced into the herd in 1935. Sixteen bulls were brought in from Queensland and it was hoped that breeding with the shorthorn would improve the quality of the herd. Another drought struck in 1936 when the monsoon failed to deliver any significant rain, Wave Hill lost about one quarter of its stock from lack of water and feed. Aboriginal station workers were ready to walk off the station in 1938 as a result of a shortage of food stuffs available to them over the wet season. Potatoes, onions and other essential commodities were not supplied, in violation of the Pastoral Award. The station owners transferred the workers to other properties. Throughout the 20th century, the station was a centre of cultural and musical exchange, as Aboriginal station workers from different language groups exchanged songs and performed wajarra (public or non-sacred songs). Following another drought in 1954 most of the stock were droved to Helen Springs Station. Six mobs of cattle each with about 1,300 head, most of which were in very poor condition, had to make the long trek of about with very little grass available along the way. It was expected that only about 60% of the stock would survive the trip. Cattle Creek outstation of Wave Hill cattle station, 1962 =Cattle Creek= By the 1960s the second homestead or outstation, now known as Cattle Creek PDF or Jinparak, was made up of the main building as well as at least 20 corrugated iron buildings as well as a number of bough sheds, a thatched meat house, several outhouses, a poultry yard, stockyards and a bore. This homestead was abandoned in 1969 with the usable buildings removed and the rest demolished. In 1984 the property was sub-divided into Wave Hill and Cattle Creek stations, but it is shown as one property, named Wave Hill or Wave Hill/Cattle Creek. =Wave Hill Walk-Off= Gough Whitlam and Vincent Lingiari in 1975 Wave Hill is best known for the Wave Hill Walk- Off or Gurindji strike, referring to the walk-off and strike by 200 Gurindji stockmen, house servants and their families in August 1966. The strike lasted until 1975 when the federal Labor government of Gough Whitlam finally negotiated with Vesteys to give the Gurindji back a portion of their land, a landmark in the land rights movement in Australia for Indigenous Australians. =Oxenford= Vestey Group sold its Australian pastoral holdings in early 1992. The Western Grazing company name and some of the former Vestey holdings were bought by Gambamora Industries, owned by Brian Oxenford and the Oxenford family, who have other pastoral interests. Gavin Hoad took over as station manager in 1992 and remained 18 years at the station until he resigned in 2010 after finding it too difficult to find experienced workers. In 2007 the walk- off route was heritage listed. Parts of the route include; the old Wave Hill homestead, the fence-line down to the Gordy Creek waterhole crossing, the track to the Victoria River camp (Lipanangu) although it is now traversed by the Buchanan Highway. The route then continues to the bottom camp then turns to the Daguragu Community to the handover site at a small park near the centre of the community. =Top Gear= The British Television show Top Gear filmed a segment of their Season 22 episode herding cattle at this station. They used a Bentley Continental GT, a BMW M6 Gran Coupe and a Nissan GTR. =2020 native title determination= A native title claim was lodged in 2016 by the Central Land Council on behalf of the traditional owners, as there were mining interests in area covered by Wave Hill Station's pastoral lease. On 8 September 2020, the Federal Court of Australia recognised the native title rights of the Gurindji people to of the Wave Hill Station, allowing them to receive royalties as compensation from resource companies who explore the area. Justice Richard White said that the determination recognised Indigenous involvement (Jamangku, Japuwuny, Parlakuna-Parkinykarni and Yilyilyimawu peoples) with the land \\"at least since European settlement and probably for millennia\\". The court sitting took place nearly south of Darwin, and descendants of Lingiari and others involved in the walk-off celebrated the determination.

Life and career John Edward Heys was born and raised in New Jersey. Upon his father's death two days after Heys' 12th birthday, he was enrolled and educated (grades 7 thru 12) at a private boarding school in northern New Jersey. After graduating from secondary school, Heys moved to Miami Shores, Florida, to the home of his maternal aunts. After two semesters of college majoring in Liberal Arts, Heys moved to New York City in 1968 and became part of the East Village and West Village alternative life and LGBTQ culture. In August 1969, he founded America's first bi-monthly newspaper for the LGBTQ community, Gay Power, the official title totaling 24 issues, and was editor until August 1970. One of its covers was created by Robert Mapplethorpe. The newspaper also contained illustrations by Touko Laaksonen, better known as Tom of Finland, and featured contributors such as Arthur Bell, Taylor Mead, Charles Ludlam, Pudgy Roberts, Bill Vehr, Pat Maxwell, Clayton Cole, as well as columns from all of the active LGBSTG groups, from the most conservative Mattachine Society to the most radical The Gay Liberation Front, and all the other groups in between. Heys created several one-man performance pieces and acted with Cookie Mueller, H.M. Koutoukas, Charles Ludlam, Ethyl Eichelberger and as part of the Angels of Light NYC Group, which Hibiscus founded after moving to NYC. Heys was a subject for artists Peter Hujar, Francesco Clemente, Charles Ludlam, Richard Banks, Frank Moore and numerous other photographers. Heys was a close friend and muse of photographer Peter Hujar and the subject of many portraits. Hujar once remarked upon Heys' resemblance to Diana Vreeland, \\"I can take a picture of her and another of you and there is a resemblance\\".Frame, Allen http://bombsite.com/issues/29/articles/1261 Fall 1989, Retrieved May 20, 2013. In Berlin he was a friend of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, the Neue Deutsche Welle (New Wave) band Die T√∂dliche Doris, and radical gay activist Napoleon Seyfarth. Heys made two films of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf and one of Napoleon Seyfarth and was the subject of an 8mm short film that Wolfgang Mueller made in 1984 in the legendary 1930s bordello, Pensione Florian.

It was relaunched as Chugworth Academy 2 on May 21, 2003, having previously been a series of pin-ups and erotic animations Dave created under pen-name \\"Scribblekid\\". After some server website issues which forced the site to shut down in mid-2007, Chugworth Academy returned, but updates were sporadic at best. Cheung posted in January 2009 that his writer, Jamal (Jay) Joseph, had been too busy to work on scripts for Chugworth. Plot The strip revolves around the lives of four teenagers, two of whom attend Chugworth Academy, an elite prep school. The tone of the strip runs heavily towards sexual situations and fanservice. There are also several spinoff strips, like Pancake Motherfuckers and Classic Comedy Moments. Cast=Major characters= *Sally Richards - Cynical, sarcastic and has more intellectual clout than everyone she socializes with. She also has a geeky side to her nature that she tries very hard to conceal - mostly revolving around an unhealthy obsession with computer games and pencil and paper role-playing games. She also likes Kiyoshi very much and has sex with him (off-screen) often. The relationship has hit a rough spot when Kiyoshi accidentally broke both of Sally's legs by knocking her down a flight of stairs, ruining her chance at competing in the U.S. Open. Sally has therefore dumped Kiyoshi, although whether this is permanent or not remains to be seen. Her legs have healed since then, but she is still unable to walk and has to use a wheelchair, or has to be carried by Chloe. She has also cut her previously long hair to chin length. *Chloe Winsdale - Sally's cousin and best friend, although they are often mistaken for sisters. Chloe hates anything mainstream and listens to the most obscure punk rock and heavy metal bands on the planet. She also likes to think that she is rebellious, even though she is a well-mannered, straight-A student. Her prized possession is her talking electronic keychain of Witchy Cranky Poo, from unreleased comic \\"The God Machine\\" by Chandra Free. Her other closest companion is a teddy bear with a pierced ear. It also seems she might be the only virgin among the main cast members. *Kiyoshi Masamune - A well-endowed half Japanese-half American. Sally and Kiyoshi have been dating for what seems like forever, giving substance to the claim that \\"opposites attract.\\" Dim-witted but good-natured and totally in love with Sally, Kiyoshi is a modestly successful underwear model and the public face of Splammo Drinks company. He is obsessed with sandwiches. Kiyoshi is now going through an emo phase as a result of being dumped by Sally, and is so depressing that even the other emos have told him to cheer up. His continuous consumption of Splammo has also had an ill effect on his mind, which causes him to see a foul-mouthed Mickey Mouse at odd times, and is also a likely contributor to his diminished intelligence quotient. *Ellice Matthews - Unstable, moody, as dim-witted as Kiyoshi, and perhaps bisexual, Ellice longs for a career as a top film actress but generally comes up short in the jobs she finally lands. She is Kiyoshi's best friend as well as a long-time friend of Sally and Chloe. Unfortunately, she is often the butt of their jokes. She is also Kiyoshi's father's lover, which was latterly a subject of some contention between them. =Supporting Characters= *Dar - A character from Jamal Joseph's Goth and Jock strip who made an appearance early in Chugworth's continuity, Dar is the goth of the pair. He has longish black hair and always wears a cross around his neck, and is obsessed with death and morbid subjects. The face on his shirts also changes with his mood, and says the mood that he is in. *Jam - The other half of Jamal's Goth and Jock duo, who appeared in the early storyline featuring the pair. Jam is the jock of the two, and is often more boastful than he can realistically back up. *Mr. Tummy Giggles - Tummy Giggles is a children's television show host who also seems to be somewhat of a sex offender, groping Ellice when she served as the assistant on his show, and displaying somewhat pedophiliac tendencies. He was last seen co-anchoring the New Bumpshire Action News with Laura Crabbs. *Laura Crabbs - Laura is the co-anchor of the New Bumpshire Action News, and is highly composed and professional, providing a comedic foil to her rather less professional co-workers. *P-Quay McNasty - P-Quay is a \\"former hip hop sensation\\" who now provides sports coverage for New Bumpshire Action News. He is Caucasian, but wears a large jeweled dollar sign on a necklace and speaks African-American Vernacular English. *Mister Sundance - Chugworth Academy's fundamentalist Christian Religious Studies teacher who insists Sally is a slut for being the only one in her class to admit that she is not a virgin. He seems to have a personal vendetta against her because of that, despite her perfect grades. He is also quite possibly gay, ironically. *Manuel Bistro, Red Commando - Manuel is a Communist revolutionary who led a team of other revolutionaries and took over Sally's classroom briefly in an attempt to overthrow...well, something. *Slappy Shortbobski - A member of Manuel Bistro's team who is a \\"master of the deadly art of Spoon Combat\\". The exact nature of Spoon Combat has yet to be revealed. *Fernando Cassanova - Fernando is another member of Bistro's team. He is reputedly irresistible to women and wears a coat made from the \\"pubic hair of his conquests.\\" He also appears to be irresistible to Mr. Sundance, who \\"offered himself up\\" to Cassanova in order to \\"save\\" Sally and Chloe from the Red Commandos. *The Director - Director of the Blockbuster movie \\"The Slow and the Moderately Angry\\" as well as countless other Box Office hits. Does not tolerate failure. *Kiyoshi's Dad - He is the father of Kiyoshi, but he is also a ninja and insists Kiyoshi uphold that honor. He has a heavy accent, but is a ladies man like his son (sleeping with Ellice on more than one occasion). He tends to get his 'L's and his 'R's mixed up. He also believes that Naruto Uzumaki is the greatest ninja ever thus making some fans believe that he watches ninja based anime. *Mr. Splammodopolis - Head of the Splammo Drinks Empire and the world's wealthiest man. He neglects his son Demitri, instead concentrating on his protege Kiyoshi. Splammodopolis is possibly even less intelligent than Kiyoshi, insisting on ham flavored sodas and actually burning his employees alive when firing them. *Mr Splammodopolis' Assistant - Mr Splammodopolis' personal assistant who is several times more intelligent than her employer. She is very good at what she does and even better at angering Ellice Matthews when they first meet. *Demitri Splammodopolis - Heir to the Splammo-Inc fortune, he is often ignored by his father, who has taken a greater liking towards Kiyoshi. This induces a deep rooted hatred in Demitri towards Kiyoshi whom he finally decided to kill after finding out he was dating Sally Richards, who he had become infatuated with. He is currently in jail for the murder of Vance Petrol. *Rabbit Girl (Real name: Bunnie Mittens) - Demitri's unofficial girlfriend whom he solely uses for sex. She is rather naive and talkative, much to Demitri's pleasure and dismay respectively. She insists the two are in love. Her younger brother Bobby is also one of Sally's role-playing friends, who constantly speaks street slang. *Rabbit Girl's Friend (Real name: Aimee Downings) - Rabbit Girl's best friend who is sadly as naive as she is. *Vance Petrol - An A-list Hollywood action star, he is Kiyoshi's costar in his latest film, \\"The Slow and Moderately Angry\\", and is a parody of Vin Diesel. He stayed at Sally's house during the initial filming of the movie before meeting an untimely end. Seemingly invincible, it took several attempts on his life and a heart attack to kill him. *Pringles the Almadirro/Armadillo - Sally's pet Armadillo, given to her by Kiyoshi. Referred to as an 'Almadirro' by Kiyoshi and his father, Pringles carelessly flirts through life, doing such things as peeing on Sally and having sex with cats. He inadvertently caused Sally to break her legs when he was thrown at her by Kiyoshi, effectively ending Kiyoshi and Sally's relationship. *Tyrone - An African-American boy that plays Dungeons and Dragons with Sally after school. He appears to be a parody of Will Smith's character on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, with a rich Uncle Bill, an English butler named Gregory, and a short cousin named Charleston. *The Intern (correction might be needed) recurring character that never had her name stated. First possible appearance is on #208 where she is an intern on Kiyoshi's movie set where she got shot by Demitri, who was trying to kill Kiyoshi. From then on her left arm was always shown in a sling. She later worked in Taco Bell while still healing. On #354 she got hit by a kunai in her right arm, during a ninja fight at the Taco Bell, possibly by Kiyoshi's dad to stop her complaining.

It was heard in the Appellate Division on September 3, 1984, with judgment handed down on September 27, 1985. The presiding officers were Jansen JA, Joubert JA, Cilli√© JA, Van Heerden JA and Vivier AJA. The appellant was represented by the State Attorney, Johannesburg. The respondent's attorneys were Mather & Sim, Johannesburg, and McIntyre & Van der Post, Bloemfontein. The central issue was the extent of the liability of the Minister of Police for wrongful acts committed by a policeman. In an appeal by the Minister of Police against an award of damages by the court a quo, it was contended that the sergeant's conduct had been unrelated to his police work. The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal, referring to the proposition that a master (in this instance, the State) who does his work by the hand of a servant (in this instance, the sergeant) creates a risk of harm to others if the servant should prove to be negligent or inefficient or untrustworthy. The sergeant's conduct, on the facts, had fallen within the purview of the risk created by State in employing him, and it was evident to the court that the sergeant's employment was conducive to the wrongs he committed. The State, therefore, was found to be vicariously liable for those wrongs. The case is cited most often for the following passage: > It seems clear that an act done by a servant solely for his own interests > and purposes, although occasioned by his employment, may fall outside the > course or scope of his employment, and that in deciding whether an act by > the servant does so fall, some reference is to be made to the servant's > intention.Estate Van der Byl v Swanepoel 1927 AD 141 at 150. The test is in > this regard subjective. On the other hand, if there is nevertheless a > sufficiently close link between the servant's acts for his own interests and > purposes and the business of his master, the master may yet be liable. This > is an objective test. This test, although frequently applied, \\"has not always been followed.\\"K v Minister of Safety and Security 2005 (6) SA 419 (CC) at para 33. In K v Minister of Safety and Security,2005 (3) SA 179 (SCA). for example, the Supreme Court of Appeal formulated the test somewhat differently, saying that the question to be asked is whether the deviation is of such a degree that it can still be said the employee is exercising the functions to which he was appointed or carrying out some instruction of the employer. When K v Minister of Safety and Security went before the Constitution Court, O'Regan complained that \\"variations of the [Rabie] test have proliferated, and have resulted in uncertainty,\\"Para 33. and sought to remove this uncertainty by applying the test and holding its objective element, approached with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution in mind, to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate constitutional as well as other norms. It required the court applying it to articulate its reasoning for its conclusions as to whether there was a sufficient connection between the wrongful conduct and the employment. Thus developed, O'Regan J held, the application of the test was not at odds with the constitutional order.Paras 44‚Äì45.  Facts  About thirty minutes into New Year's Day 1981, Andr√© Rabie, the respondent in this matter, was stopped by one Albertus Arnoldus Van der Westhuizen, a sergeant employed in the South African Police Force as a mechanic to repair police vehicles, who accused him of attempting to break into a CNA store. The sergeant was at the relevant time off duty, in plain clothes, on the scene in his private vehicle and in pursuance of his own interests. Although he identified himself to Rabie, and purported and intended to act, as a policeman, he was in fact actuated only by malice. Van der Westhuizen proceeded to assault, arrest and detain Rabie in prison. Rabie was duly prosecuted but ultimately acquitted. Van der Westhuizen's actions were found by the court to be totally self-serving and mala fide. Rabie instituted and later succeeded in an action for damages based on section 1 of the State Liability Act.Act 20 of 1957. In the Witwatersrand Local Division, Goldstone J held the Minister of Police and Van der Westhuizen to be jointly and severally liable. The former appealed.  Arguments = Appellant = In the Appellate Division, JJ Wessels argued that Van der Westhuizen had acted maliciously in assaulting, arresting and charging Rabie, without having any reason to do so. This he had done out of spite or ill-will, brought on by factors unknown, but it was speculated that it could have been related to his experience earlier on in the evening, when he had been ejected from the home of his ex-parents-in-law, who lived in the area and had been hosting a New Year's Eve gathering. There could be no suggestion, Wessels continued, that Van der Westhuizen had reasonably suspected that the respondent was attempting to break into the CNA. The conclusion must be that Van der Westhuizen was acting without any reasonable cause and out of pure malice at the time of the arrest and assault. The court a quo, Wessels noted, had found Van der Westhuizen to have been acting within the course and scope of his employment when he arrested and assaulted the respondent, and that Van der Westhuizen had \\"also acted as servant of the State in detaining the plaintiff.\\" Goldstone J had erred, however, in Wessels's view, by overlooking the fact that Van der Westhuizen had not acted in pursuance or in the execution of any duties imposed upon him by the Police ActAct 7 of 1958. or his employer, but that he had arrested and assaulted the respondent without any reasonable cause, and had therefore acted maliciously. The judge a quo had also erred, according to Wessels, in his finding that the appellant was liable merely because Van der Westhuizen also acted \\"as a servant of the State.\\" The court was at this point referred to the case of Minister of Police v Mbilini.1983 (3) SA at 711D. The sole point for decision, contended Wessels, was whether or not the appellant could be held vicariously liable for the conduct of Van der Westhuizen. The position of policemen committing delicts had been considered in a number of previous cases, including Mhlongo and Another v Minister of Police,1978 (2) SA 551. Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander1979 (4) SA at 764H. and Magubane v Minister van Polisie.1982 (3) SA 542. The functions of the South African Police were set out in section 5 of the Police Act; their powers and duties were enumerated in section 6.See Hiemstra Suid-Afrikaanse Strafprosesreg at 113. It fell now to be decided what were the duties of a private employee in relation to his employer and the employee's delict and duties of employment or instruction.See Mkize v Martens 1914 AD 382; Estate Van der Byl v Swanepoel 1927 AD 141; Scott Middellike Aanspreeklikheid in die Suid-Afrikaanse Reg at 139, 159; Feldman (Pty) Ltd v Mall 1945 AD at 742, 753, 756, 780, 783, 784, 787; Moosa v Duma and the Vereeniging Municipality 1944 TPD 30; Germishuys en 'n Ander v Van Heerden 1958 (2) SA 99; Magubane v Minister of Police 1982 (3) SA at 548D; Sahanga v Dupont NO 1965 (2) SA 404 (headnote); Khoza v Minister of Justice 1964 (3) SA at 82H, 83D; Masikane v Smit and Another 1965 (4) SA at 297; Komane v Van der Merwe 1941 (2) PH K62. Van der Westhuizen was not acting in terms of the Police Act at the time of the incident, and he was not under the supervision of officers of the Police Force, but was busy, Wessels argued, with an act unrelated to his employment with the Department of Police; he was engaged upon a private and personal enterprise. Wessels said that this was borne out when the test enunciated in the case of Ongevallekommissaris v Onderlinge Versekerings-Genootskap (AVBOB)1976 (4) SA 446. was applied: namely, that of \\"dominante indruk.\\" Wessels thought it clear that Van der Westhuizen had acted maliciously, in that he had arrested and assaulted respondent without any reason. Under these circumstances, his conduct would be comparable with the policeman's actions in the case of Germishuys. Van der Westhuizen's conduct had nothing to do with police work; it was a private action. If, for instance, Van der Westhuizen had personally broken into the CNA and stolen goods, the CNA would not have been able to hold the appellant liable for the damages. Why then, Wessels demanded, should the appellant be held liable for the assault and arrest?See Scott Middellike Aanspreeklikheid in die Suid-Afrikaanse Reg at 197. The next question to be decided was what the appellant's position was in regard to the detention of respondent. Section 50 of the Criminal Procedure ActAct 51 of 1977. regulates the procedure after arrest.See, in particular, s 50 (1). As soon as an accused is brought to the police station, and a charge laid against him, a new decision has to be taken by the police: whether he should be detained or not. Even if the arrest and detention up to that stage were unlawful, Wessels continued, the detention after the decision to prosecute can be lawful, if the decision to prosecute was lawful: that is to say, taken bona fide on reasonable grounds. Only when the police act mala fide, without reasonable and probable cause, can an action for unlawful detention against the appellant succeed for the time that the respondent was held in custody in the police cells.See Donono v Minister of Prisons 1973 (4) SA at 262. In this case, Wessels concluded, the action of the police was justified in view of the fact that there was a statement in the docket by Van der Westhuizen which reasonably showed an attempt by respondent to break into the CNA, whilst the respondent had made a statement saying that he did not wish to say anything at that stage but that he would make his statement in court. In so far as the claim for malicious prosecution was concerned, Wessels cited for the elements of malicious prosecution the fifteenth volume of Joubert's The Law of South Africa381 and McKerron's The Law of Delict7th ed at 263. In so far as the position of the appellant was concerned in regard to the malicious prosecution, the respondent could not succeed against the appellant unless he proved that Van der Westhuizen had acted within the course and scope of his employment when he made the statement at the police station. What had already been submitted in regard to vicarious liability, Wessels argued, was therefore also applicable in this regard. He noted also that it was not only policemen who were concerned with the prevention of crime and the maintenance of law and order, but also private individuals. Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 authorises private persons to arrest people without a warrant and compels private persons between the ages of sixteen and sixty to assist policemen with the arrest of a person or the detention of a person if requested by a policeman.ss 42 and 47. Wessels described the statement made by Van der Westhuizen as having also been made maliciously, out of caprice, and as unrelated to any duties of a policeman in terms of the Police Act. = Respondent = TW Beckerling, for the respondent, said that the only issue to be decided was whether or not the appellant was vicariously responsible and liable for the damages sustained by the respondent in consequence of Van der Westhuizen's conduct.See Rabie v Minister of Police and Another 1984 (1) SA at 789D. The basis for the respondent's claim against the appellant arose from the provisions of section 1 of the State Liabilities Act. It was common cause that Van der Westhuizen had committed a wrong by unlawfully arresting the respondent and causing the latter's detention and prosecution. It was likewise common cause between the parties that, at all relevant times, Van der Westhuizen was a servant of the State, in that he was employed in the South African Police Force as a policeman in the mechanical section of the South African Police at Boksburg. The issue to be decided was confined to whether Van der Westhuizen, when he committed the unlawful acts, acted in his capacity or within the scope of his authority as a servant of the State. Although section 1 of the State Liabilities Act spoke only of a State servant acting \\"within the scope of his authority\\", the courts, Beckerling contended, had treated this as embracing the concept \\"within the scope of his employment\\".Union Government (Minister of Justice) v Thorne 1930 AD at 51; African Guarantee & Indemnity Co Ltd v Minister of Justice 1959 (2) SA at 445A; Mhlongo and Another NO v Minister of Police 1978 (2) SA at 567B-C. A \\"member of the Force\\" was defined in section 1 of the Police Act. Sergeant Van der Westhuizen clearly was a member of the Force in terms of the pleadings and the statement of admitted facts. He was also a \\"peace officer\\" as defined in section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA). His powers of arrest were set out, inter alia, in section 40(1) of the CPA. It was common cause that Van der Westhuizen, being a member of the Force in terms of the Police Act, purported to arrest the respondent in terms of section 40(1) when, thinking that the respondent had attempted to commit the crime of housebreaking, he grabbed hold of the respondent, confronted him with his suspicion, struck him with a wheel spanner across the forehead, identified himself as a policeman by stating that he was a policeman and that he was arresting the respondent, and thereafter took the respondent to the police station. Beckerling argued that Van der Westhuizen, thinking that the respondent had attempted to commit the crime of housebreaking, was dutybound to arrest him.See Naidoo v Minister van Polisie 1976 (4) SA 954; Gladys Booi v Minister of Police (unreported, Eastern Cape Division, 14 November 1977); Mdolomba v Minister of Police (unreported, Eastern Cape Division, case No 131/1976); Mazeka v Minister of Justice 1956 (1) SA at 317F-G. Contra, however, Mhlongo v Minister of Police 1977 (2) SA 800. See also WP le Roux and JT Pretorius \\"'n Aantekening oor Staatsaanspreeklikheid voortspruitend uit Polisie-arrestasies na aanleiding van Mhlongo v Minister of Police 1978 (2) SA 551 (A)\\" 1979 (42) THRHR at 92‚Äì96. Even, however, if it were held that Van der Westhuizen, perceiving the situation as he did, was under no duty to arrest the respondent, he nevertheless exercised his discretion in deciding to arrest the respondent. All the members of the South African Police Force, Beckerling continued, are prima facie servants of the State; consequently, when a wrongful act is committed by a member of the Force in the course or scope of his employment, the State is prima facie liable. It is then for the State to show that, in committing the wrongful act, the policeman was engaged upon a duty or function of such a nature as to take him out of the category of servant pro hac vice.Mhlongo and Another v Minister of Police 1978 (2) SA at 567E-F; Union Government (Minister of Justice) v Thorne at 51); Sibiya v Swart NO 1950 (4) SA 515; Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander 1979 (4) SA at 765G-H. There was no evidence to the effect that a person employed as was Sergeant Van der Westhuizen had police duties any different from those of any other member of the Force. It would, furthermore, be for the appellant, said Beckerling, to show that the nature of the duties of Sergeant Van der Westhuizen were such that, when he arrested the respondent, he was not acting as a servant of the State.See Rabie v Minister of Police and Another at 791C-D. In order for the duty or function to take a policeman out of the category of servant, it must be one which is personal to him, in the sense that from its very nature the State is so deprived of the power to direct or control him in the carrying out of his duty or function that he cannot be regarded pro hac vice as the servant of the State.See Mhlongo and Another NO v Minister of Police at 567F-G. The mere fact that the duty or function is a statutory one, or that it confers upon the policeman a discretion, was not to Beckerling's mind decisive. Many aspects of a policeman's employment are governed by statute. In many of his functions, he must, of necessity, be called upon to exercise some measure of discretion. The essential criterion is whether his employer, the State, has the power to direct or control him in the execution of his duty or function, including the exercise of the discretion, if any.Mhlongos case at 568A-B. Complete control in every respect, argued Beckerling, is not essential to the master-and servant relationship. Some degree of freedom from control is not incompatible with the relationship.See R v Feun 1954 (1) SA at 61A; Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander at 767F. In Mhlongo's case, it had been unnecessary for the court to decide whether there was State liability for an unlawful arrest effected by a policeman exercising his own discretion to arrest without a warrant while he was about police business.See Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander at 765‚Äì766. The court in Mhlongo, however, had voiced the following obiter opinion: > Turning more specifically to an arrest made by a policeman without warrant > and upon his own initiative in his role of \\"peace officer,\\" it seems to me > that a distinction can, and should, be drawn between his decision to make > the arrest and the means employed by him to effect the arrest.568C-D. Furthermore: > In the circumstances, there is much to be said for the view that the > decision of the policeman to arrest without warrant is a function over which > his employer, the State, has no power of direction or control.568H It is contrary to principle and policy, Beckerling urged, that a policeman should have the chameleon-like ability to be a servant of the State at one moment and not at another, when at both times he is carrying out the functions of a policeman.See JM Burchell in Annual Survey of South African Law (1977) at 209‚Äì211; Naidoo en 'n Ander v Minister van Polisie 1976 (4) SA at 957E; Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander at 767H. The decision to arrest might take only seconds, and it seemed to Beckerling that, for that brief period, a police officer arresting without a warrant might, according to Mhlongo's case, pro hac vice be taken out of the category of a State servant. The court in Mhlongo had held that the essential question is not whether the duty performed by the policeman is statutory, or whether the policeman exercises a discretion, but rather whether the State has the power to direct or control him in the execution of his duty or function.568B. The important question, in regard to the control test for determining the master-servant relationship, is not the existence of control but rather the right of control or, to use the Court's words, power to control. That being so, continued Beckerling, the State, through the Commissioner of Police and superior officers, has the power or right to control the decision of policemen to arrest or not to arrest in a particular instance.See Rodrigues v Alves 1978 (4) SA at 842A; Annual Survey of South African Law (1978) at 269‚Äì274; Minister van Polisie en 'n Ander v Gamble en 'n Ander at 768A-B. Unlawful arrests, he noted, constitute a serious encroachment on individual liberty.See Areff v Minister van Polisie 1977 (2) SA at 914G; Lambrechts v Provinsiale Administrasie van die Provinsie Kaap die Goeie Hoop 1979 (2) PH J64 (C). The liability of the Minister of Police had now been broadened to the extent that it included liability for every stage of an unlawful arrest committed by a policeman in the scope of his employment. The principles, based on the peculiar status of the police force in England, ought now, in Beckerling's opinion, to have been fading into obscurity.See JRL Milton in (1967) 84 SALJ at 25; JM Burchell in Annual Survey of South African Law (1979) at 206‚Äì209. In the light of the dictum in the Areff case, he argued, the broadening of the basis for State liability was understandable and proper. The vicarious liability of a master, in the ultimate analysis, is based upon considerations of social policy.See McKerron The Law of Delict 7th ed at 90; JA v S. d'Oliveira State Liability for the Wrongful Exercise of Discretionary Powers (doctoral thesis) at 403 et seq. In conclusion, Sergeant Van der Westhuizen, when he arrested the respondent, was a member of the Force as defined in the Police Act. Being a peace officer, he was entitled in terms of section 40 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act to arrest the respondent without a warrant. He purported to arrest the respondent. He was prima facie a servant of the appellant and consequently, when he wrongfully purported to arrest the respondent, the appellant became prima facie liable. It was then for the appellant to show that, in committing the wrongful act, Van der Westhuizen was engaged upon a duty or function of such a nature as to take him out of the category of servant pro hac vice. In order for the duty or function to take Van der Westhuizen out of the category of servant, it had to be one which was personal to Van der Westhuizen, in the sense that, from its very nature, the appellant was so deprived of the power to direct and control him in the carrying out of his duty or function that Van der Westhuizen could not be regarded pro hac vice as a servant of the appellant. Van der Westhuizen had, at all material times, when he was about police business, been under the command, supervision and control of his seniors, and thus under the control of the appellant. It therefore could be said that pro hac vice Van der Westhuizen was not an employee or servant of the appellant when he exercised his statutory discretion within the scope of his employment. In the premises, said Beckerling in closing, the appellant was vicariously liable for the damages caused by the unlawful acts of Van der Westhuizen.  Judgment  After Wessels's reply, the case adjourned, and a year later a majority of the Appellate Division returned with its decision. It held that the apposite approach to the present case, where Van der Westhuizen (whatever his ostensible conduct) was not in reality performing any of the functions set out in section 5 of the Police Act,Act 7 of 1958. would proceed from the basis for vicarious liability set out in the case of Feldman (Pty) Ltd v Mall:1945 AD 733. > A master who does his work by the hand of a servant creates a risk of harm > to others if the servant should prove to be negligent or inefficient or > untrustworthy [....] Because he has created this risk for his own ends he is > under a duty to ensure that no one is injured by the servant's improper > conduct or negligence in carrying on his work.741. The court held further that, on this approach, the emphasis shifted from the precise nature of Van der Westhuizen's intention and the link between his acts and police work, to the dominant question of whether or not his acts fell within the risks created by the State. The court found that his acts did indeed fall within the purview of the risks created by the State in appointing him as a member of the Force, it being evident that his appointment was conducive to the wrong he committed.

The problems of photographic lens design, creating a lens for a task that would cover a large, flat image plane, were well known even before the invention of photographyRudolf Kingslake, A history of the photographic lens, page 23 due to the development of lenses to work with the focal plane of the camera obscura. Early photographic camera lenses Biconvex (or double convex) lens with aperture stop in front of it The early photographic experiments of Thomas Wedgwood, Nic√©phore Ni√©pce, Henry Fox Talbot, and Louis Daguerre all used simple single-element convex lenses.Michael R. Peres, Focal encyclopedia of photography: digital imaging, theory and applications, page 55 These lenses were found lacking. Simple lenses could not focus an image over a large flat film plane (field curvature) and suffered from other optical aberrations. Their severe longitudinal chromatic aberration meant the light the photographers were seeing (generally yellow light) and the light to which the early photographic mediums were sensitive not converge to the same point, making it difficult to focus. Reversed achromatic lens Charles Chevalier's Paris optical firm produced lenses for both Ni√©pce and Daguerre for their experiments in photography. In 1829Frizot 2008, p. 21., Chevalier created an achromatic lens (a two-element lens made from crown glass and flint glass) to cut down on chromatic aberration for Daguerre's experiments. Chevalier reversed the lens (originally designed as a telescope objective) to produce a much flatter image plane and modified the achromat to bring the blue end of the spectrum to a sharper focus. Reversing the lens caused severe spherical aberration so a narrow aperture stop was necessary in front of the lens. On 22 June 1839, Daguerre contracted Alphonse Giroux (France) to manufacture his daguerreotype apparatus. The Giroux Le Daguerreotype camera used an almost 16-inch (40 cm) focal length reversed achromatic lens with a f/16 stop in front of it made by Chevalier to take 6¬Ω√ó8¬Ω inch (about 16.5√ó21.5 cm) images.Todd Gustavson, Camera: A History of Photography From Daguerreotype to Digital. New York, NY: Sterling Innovation/Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2009. . pp 8-9.Colin Harding, Classic Cameras. Lewes, East Sussex, UK: Photographers‚Äô Institute Press, 2009. . pp 18-19. Meniscus or 'landscape' lens In 1804 William Hyde Wollaston invented a positive meniscus lens for eyeglasses. In 1812 Wollaston adapted it as a lens for the camera obscuraKingslake 1989, pp. 23-26, 307. by mounting it with the concave side facing outward with an aperture stop in front of it, making the lens reasonably sharp over a wide field. Ni√©pce began using Wollaston Meniscus in 1828.Gernsheim 1969, p. 61.Kingslake 1989, p. 136. Daguerre used this lens in his experiments, but since it was a single-element lens that lacked any chromatic aberration control it was impossible to focus accurately with the blue-sensitive media in the daguerreotype process.Kingslake 1989, p. 25. By the end of 1839, Chevalier had created an achromatic version of the meniscus that combined field flattening and chromatic aberration control.Kingslake 1989, pp. 27-28.Peres 2007, p. 158. The lens had the reverse concave flint glass side facing the subject and an f/16 aperture stop at its radius of curvature, making it reasonably sharp over a wide field of about 50¬∞.Michael R. Peres, Focal encyclopedia of photography: digital imaging, theory and applications, page 158 Reversing the lens did increase chromatic aberration, but this fault could be lessened by adjusting the achromat to bring colors at the blue end of the spectrum into focus to match the blue-sensitive nature of the photographic emulsion.Kingslake 1989, p. 25. This design was copied by other lens makers. Because of its large flat field over a wide angle of view and its \\"slow\\" f/16 aperture (requiring twenty to thirty minutes for outdoor daguerreotype exposures), this lens came to be known as the \\"French landscape lens\\" or simply the \\"landscape lens\\". Petzval Portrait lens Petzval Portrait lens Because the Achromat Landscape lens was quite slow, the French Society for the Encouragement of National Industry offered an international prize in 1840 for a faster one. Joseph Petzval (of modern Slovakia) was a mathematics professor with no optical physics experience, but, with the aid of several human computers of the Austro- Hungarian army, he took up the challenge of producing a lens fast enough for a daguerreotype portrait. He came up with the Petzval Portrait (modern Austria) in 1840, a four-element lens consisting of a front-cemented achromat and a rear air-spaced achromat that, at f/3.6, was the first wide-aperture portrait lens. It was appropriate for one- to two-minute shaded outdoors daguerreotype exposures. With the faster collodion (wet plate) process developed in the 1850s, a camera equipped with this lens could take one- to two-minute indoor portraits. Because of national chauvinism, the Petzval did not win the prize, despite being far superior to all other entries.Kingslake 1989, pp. 35-36. A 150mm Petzval lens was fitted to a conical metal Voigtl√§nder camera taking circular daguerreotypes in 1841. The Voigtl√§nder-Petzval was the first camera and lens specifically designed to take photographs, instead of being simply a modified artist's camera obscura.Kingslake 1989, p. 37.Robert G. Mason and Norman Snyder; editors, The Camera. Life Library of Photography. New York, NY: TIME-LIFE Books, 1970. No ISBN. pp 135, 140-141.Wade, Short History. pp 18, 20. The Petzval Portrait was the dominant portrait lens for nearly a century. It had what would now be considered severe field curvature and astigmatism, but It was centrally sharp (about a 20¬∞ field of view, or 10¬∞ for critical applications), and it quickly drifted out of focus to a soft outer field, producing a pleasant halo effect around the subject. The Petzval Portrait remains popular as a projection lens where the narrow angles involved mean the field curvature is not significant.Kraszna-Krausz, p 836. The Portrait was illegally copied by every lens maker, and Petzval had a nasty falling out with Peter Voigtl√§nder over unpaid royalties and died an embittered old man.Kingslake 1989, pp. 37, 263, 299. Although the Portrait was the first mathematically computed lens formula,Peres 2007, p. 159. trial and error would continue to dominate photographic lens design for another half century, despite well-established physical mathematics dating from 1856 (by Philipp Ludwig von Seidel [modern Germany], working for Hugo Adolph Steinheil [modern Germany]), to the detriment of lens improvement.Kingslake 1989, pp. 3-4, 289. Overcoming optical aberrations Harrison & Schnitzer Globe Dallmeyer Rapid- Rectilinear and Steinheil Aplanat The Achromat Landscape was also afflicted with rectilinear distortion ‚Äì straight lines were imaged as curved. This distortion was a pressing problem as architecture was an important photography subject early on.Kingslake 1989, pp. 49-50. In addition, photographs of exotic places (especially in stereoscope formGeorge Gilbert, Collecting Photographica: The Images and Equipment of the First Hundred Years of Photography. New York, NY: Hawthorn/Dutton, 1976. . pp 90-92.) were a popular means to see the world from the comfort of one's home ‚Äì the picture postcard is a mid-19th century invention.Mason and Snyder, pp 148-149. The distortion got progressively worse as the field of view increased, which meant the Achromat Landscape could not be used as a wide-angle lens. The first successful wide-angle lens was the Harrison & Schnitzer Globe (USA) of 1862, although with a f/16 maximum aperture (f/30 was more realistic). The lens had a 92¬∞ maximum field of view, although 80¬∞ was more realistic. Charles Harrison and Joseph Schnitzer's Globe had a symmetric four-element formula; the name refers to the consideration that if the two outer surfaces were continued and then joined, they would form a sphere.Kingslake 1989, pp. 52-53.Peres 2007, p. 160. Symmetry was discovered in the 1850s to automatically correct the distortion, coma, and transverse chromatic distortions.Kingslake 1989, pp. 49-50.Kraszna-Krausz, pp 3-6, 1029-1030.Mark D. Licker; publisher, McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. 10th Edition. 20 Volumes. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2007. . Volume 1. Aberration (optics), pp 9-14. Volume 4. Chromatic aberration, pp 126-128.Peres 2007, pp. 174, 716-717. There are also decentration aberrations arising from manufacturing errors. A real lens will not produce images of expected quality if it is not constructed to or cannot stay in specification.Cox 1971, pp. 147-150, 198-200. There are additional optical phenomena that can degrade image quality but are not considered aberrations. For example, the oblique cos4Œ∏ light falloff, sometimes called natural vignetting,Norman Goldberg, Camera Technology: The Dark Side of the Lens. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1992. . pp 255-257.Lester Lefkowitz, \\"Lenses: Facts and Fallacies,\\" pp 75-98. Modern Photography, Volume 47, Number 9; September 1983. ISSN 0026-8240. and lateral magnification and perspective distortions seen in wide angle lenses are really geometric effects of projecting three-dimensional objects down into two-dimensional images, not physical defects.Peres 2007, p. 717. The Globe's symmetric formula directly influenced the design of the Dallmeyer Rapid-Rectilinear (UK) and Steinheil Aplanat (modern Germany). By coincidence, John Dallmeyer's Rapid-Rectilinear and Adolph Steinheil's Aplanat had virtually identical symmetric four-element formulae, arrived at almost simultaneously in 1866, all of which corrected most optical aberrations, except for spherical and field curvature, to f/8. The breakthrough was to use glass of maximum refractive index difference but equal dispersion in each achromat. The Rapid-Rectilinear and Aplanat lenses were scalable over many focal lengths and fields of view for all contemporaneous media, and they were the standard moderate-aperture, general- purpose lenses for more than half a century.Kingslake 1989, pp. 59-62.Peres 2007, p. 167. The Landscape, the Portrait, the Globe, and the Rapid- Rectilinear/Aplanat constituted the nineteenth-century photographer's entire lens arsenal.Kingslake 1989, p. 8. Aperture stops It was known in the 1500s that an aperture stop would improve lens image quality.Kraszna-Krausz, p 453. It would be discovered that this was because a center stop that blocks peripheral light limits the transverse aberrations (coma, astigmatism, field curvature, distortion, and lateral chromatic) unless the stop is so small that diffraction becomes dominant.Kraszna-Krausz, p 438. Even today, most lenses produce their best images at their middle apertures, at a compromise between transverse aberrations and diffraction.Dan Richards, \\"Lens Special: Behind The Glass: Lessons from 444 lens tests.\\" pp 74-79. Popular Photography, Volume 72 Number 2; February 2008. ISSN 1542-0337. Therefore, even the Meniscus had a permanent stop. Nevertheless, the earliest lenses did not have adjustable stops: their small working apertures and the lack of sensitivity of the daguerreotype process meant that exposure times were measured in many minutes. Photographers did not want to limit the light passing through the lens and lengthen the exposure time. When the increased sensitivity wet collodion process was perfected in 1851, exposure times were shortened dramatically and adjustable stops became practical.Kingslake, p 10. The earliest selectable stops were the Waterhouse stops of 1858, named for John Waterhouse. These were sets of accessory brass plates with sized holes, mounted through a slot in the side of the lens structure.Kraszna-Krausz, pp 436-437.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 84-85. Around 1880, photographers realized that aperture size affected depth of field.Kingslake, p 12. Aperture control gained more significance, and adjustable stops became a standard lens feature. The iris diaphragm made its appearance as an adjustable lens stop in the 1880s, and it became the standard adjustable stop about 1900. The iris diaphragm had been common in early nineteenth century cameras obscura, and Ni√©pce used one in at least one of his experimental cameras.Kraszna-Krausz, p 136, 454. However, the specific type of iris used in modern lenses was invented in 1858 by Charles Harrison and Joseph Schnitzer.Charles Harrison and Joseph Schnitzer, Diaphragm For Photographic Cameras. United States Patent #21,470: granted 7 September 1858. Harrison and Schnitzer's iris diaphragm was capable of rapid open and close cycles, an absolute necessity for lenses with camera auto-aperture control.Kingslake, p 11. The modern lens aperture markings of f-numbers in geometric sequence of f/1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64, 90, etc. was standardized in 1949. Previously, this British system competed with the Continental (German) sequence of f/1.1, 1.6, 2.2, 3.2, 4.5, 6.3, 9, 12.5, 18, 25, 36, 50, 71, 100 ratios. In addition, the Uniform System (U.S., invented UK) sequence of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. (where U.S. 1 = f/4, U.S. 2 = f/5.6, U.S. 4 = f/8, etc.), was favored by Eastman Kodak early in the twentieth century.Kingslake, pp 12-13.Kraszna-Krausz, p 439.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 83. Telephoto lens Dallmeyer and Miethe telephotos Busch Bis-Telar A single-element camera lens is as long as its focal length; for example, 500 mm-focal-length lens requires 500 mm from the lens to the image plane. A telephoto lens is made physically shorter than its nominal focal length by pairing a front positive imaging cell with a rear magnifying negative cell. The powerful front group over-refracts the image, the rear restores the focal plane, thereby greatly shortening the back-focus length.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 166-167. Originally, accessory negative cells were sold to attach to the rear of a regular lens. The Barlow lens, a negative achromat magnifier invented by Peter Barlow in 1833, is still sold to increase the eyepiece magnification of amateur telescopes.Kingslake, p 131. The teleconverter is the modern photographic equivalent.Kingslake, p 191.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 196-197. In 1891, Thomas Dallmeyer and Adolf Miethe simultaneously attempted to patent new lens designs with nearly identical formulae ‚Äì complete photographic telephoto lenses consisting of a front achromat doublet and rear achromat triplet. Primacy was never established and no patent was ever granted for the first telephoto lens.Kingslake, pp 133-134. The front and rear cells of early telephotos were unmatched and the rear cell also magnified any aberrations, as well as the image, of the imaging cell. The cell spacing was also tunable, because that could be used to adjust the effective focal length, but that only worsened aberration problems. The first telephoto lens optically corrected and fixed as a system was the f/8 Busch Bis-Telar (Germany) of 1905.Kingslake, pp 135-137. Anastigmat lens Zeiss Protar The photographic lens leapt forward in 1890 with the Zeiss Protar (Germany).Paul Rudolph, Photographic Objective. United States Patent #444,714; granted 13 January 1891. Paul Rudolph's Protar was the first successful anastigmat (highly corrected [for the era] for all aberrations, including properly for astigmatism) lens. It was scalable from f/4.5 portrait to f/18 super wide angle. The Protar was originally called the Anastigmat, but that descriptive term quickly became generic and the lens was given a fanciful name in 1900.Kingslake, pp 82-83. The Protar is considered the first \\"modern\\" lens, because it had an asymmetric formula allowed by the new design freedom opened up by newly available barium oxide, crown optical glasses.Peres, p 168. These glasses were invented by Ernst Abbe, a physicist, and Otto Schott, a chemist, (both Germany) in 1884, working for Carl Zeiss' Jena Glass Works. Schott glasses have higher refractive index than soda-lime crown glass without higher dispersion. The Protar's front achromat used older glass, but the rear achromat used high index glass.Kraszna-Krausz, p 838. Virtually all good quality photographic lenses since circa 1930 are anastigmat corrected. (The primary exceptions are deliberately \\"soft-focus\\" portrait lenses.) Today's photographic lens state-of-the-art is apochromatic correction, which is, very roughly, twice as strict as anastigmatic.Anonymous, \\"Too Hot To Handle,\\" p 67. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 10; October 1984. ISSN 0026-8240. However, such lenses require correcting for higher ordered aberrations than the original sevenSidney F.

Cooke Triplet Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Cooke Triplet The quintessential twentieth century photographic lens was the 1893 Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Cooke Triplet.Harold Dennis Taylor, Lens. United States Patent #568,052; granted 22 September 1896. Harold Taylor's (UK, not related to the Taylors of T, T & H) Cooke Triplet was a deceptively simple looking asymmetric three element anastigmat formula created by reexamining lens design from first principles to take maximum advantage of the advances in new Schott optical glasses. The elements were all of such strong power that they were highly sensitive to misalignment and required tight manufacturing tolerances for the era.Kingslake, pp 103-106. The Cooke Triplet became the standard \\"economy\\" lens of the twentieth century. For example, the Argus Cintar 50mm f/3.5 for the Argus C3 (1937, USA), probably the best-selling rangefinder camera of all time, used a Cooke triplet.Jason Schneider, \\"The Camera Collector: When is a Yankee classic a bona fide dog? When it's an Argus C-3! What finally killed it? Better 35s from Japan!\\" pp 18, 30. Modern Photography, Volume 51 Number 11; November 1987. ISSN 0026-8240. The Triplet was adequate for contact prints from medium format roll film cameras and small enlargements from 35mm \\"miniature\\" format cameras, but not for big ones. The films of the first half of the twentieth century did not have much resolving power either, so that was not necessarily a problem. Tessar Zeiss Tessar Paul Rudolph developed the Tessar from dissatisfaction with the performance of his earlier Protar,Paul Rudolph, Photographic Objective. United States Patent #721,240; granted 24 February 1903. although it also resembles the Cooke triplet. The Tessar was originally an f/6.3 lens. It was refined to f/2.8 by 1930, although f/3.5 was the realistic limit for best image quality.Kingslake, pp 86-88 The Tessar was the standard high-quality, moderate-aperture, normal-perspective lens of the twentieth century. The Kodak Anastigmat Special 100mm f/3.5 on the Kodak Super Six-20 (1938, USA), the first autoexposure still camera, was a Tessar,Jason Schneider, Jason Schneider On Camera Collecting: A fully illustrated handbook of articles originally published in MODERN PHOTOGRAPHY.

It was fitting that the Zeiss Stiftung's last camera, the Zeiss Ikon S 312, had a Zeiss Tessar 40mm f/2.8 (1972, West Germany).Marc James Small and Charles M. Barringer, Zeiss Compendium: East and West - 1940 to 1972. Second Edition 1999. Small Dole, UK: Hove Books, 1995. . pp 66-68, 156. It is often incorrectly stated that the Leitz Elmar 50mm f/3.5 fixed to the Leica A (1925, Germany), Leitz's first camera, was a Tessar.Jason Schneider, \\"The Camera Collector: You can't beat the system. Leitz knew that over 50 years ago, and proceeded to give us the world's first 'system 35.'\\" pp 54-56. Modern Photography, Volume 48 Number 6; June 1984. ISSN 0026-8240. However, at the time the Leica was introduced the 50mm f/3.5 Kino Tessar had only been designed to cover the cine format of 18x24mm, which was insufficient for the new 24x36mm format of the Leica, and Leitz had to develop a new lens to provide adequate full frame coverage. It was only when Zeiss Ikon were designing the Contax in response to the success of the Leica that a 50mm Tessar which could cover the 24x36mm format was designed. The Elmar was based on a modified Cooke Triplet with a different computation to the Tessar and with the stop in the first air space.Die Leica, 1933 No. 6. \\"Was ist eigentlich \\"Elmar\\"? Ernostar and Sonnar Ernemann Ernostar 10.5cm f/1.8 Zeiss Sonnar 50mm f/1.5 With anastigmat image quality achieved, attention next turned to increasing aperture size to allow photography in lower light or with faster shutter speeds. The first common very wide aperture lens suitable for candid available light photography was the Ernemann Ernostar (Germany) of 1923.Ludwig Bertele, Photographic Lens. United States Patent #1,584,271; granted 11 May 1926. Ludwig Bertele's formula was originally a 10 cm f/2 lens, but he improved it to 10.5 cm and 85mm f/1.8 in 1924.Jason Schneider, \\"The Camera Collector: The Ermanox Legend, or how a super-fast lens turned a conventional camera into the darling of the press corps.\\" pp 22, 30-31, 68, 132. Modern Photography, Volume 47 Number 7; July 1983. ISSN 0026-8240. The Ernostar was also a Cooke Triplet derivative; it has an extra front positive element or group.Kingslake, p 112. Mounted on the Ernemann Ermanox (1923, Germany) camera and in the hands of Erich Salomon, the Ernostar pioneered modern photojournalism. French Premier Aristide Briand once said: \\"There are just three things necessary for an international conference: a few Foreign Secretaries, a table and Salomon.\\"Mason and Snyder, p 164. Note, American photojournalists favored flash use into the 1950s (see Arthur Fellig [Weegee]). Bertele continued Ernostar development under the more famous Sonnar name after Ernemann was absorbed by Zeiss in 1926. He reached f/1.5 in 1932 with the Zeiss Sonnar 50mm f/1.5Ludwig Bertele, Objective. United States Patent #1,975,678; granted 2 October 1934.Kingslake, pp 117-118. for the Contax I 35mm rangefinder camera (1932, Germany).Jason Schneider, \\"The Camera Collector: Zeiss-Ikon's answer to the Leica was the Contax, a camera praised and damned for its brilliantly complex design.\\" pp 18, 22-23, 150. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 10; October 1984. The Sonnar was (and is) also popular as a telephoto lens design ‚Äì the Sonnar is always at least slightly telephoto because of its powerful front positive elements. The Zeiss Olympia Sonnar 180mm f/2.8 for the Contax II (both 1936, Germany) is a classic, if not mythic, example.Stephen Gandy, \\"Legendary Zeiss 180/2.8 Olympia Sonnar,\\" from http://www.cameraquest.com/oly180.htm retrieved 14 December 2004. Asymmetric double Gauss In 1817 Carl Friedrich Gauss improved the Fraunhofer telescope objective by adding a meniscus lens to its single convex and concave lens design. Alvan Clark further refined the design in 1888 by taking two of these lenses and placing them back to back. The lens was named in honour of Gauss. The current design can be traced back to 1895, when Paul Rudolph of Carl Zeiss Jena used cemented doublets as the central lenses to correct for chromatic aberration. Later the design was developed with additional glasses to give high-performance lenses of wide aperture. The main development was due to Taylor Hobson in the 1920s, resulting in the f/2.0 Opic and later the Speed Panchro designs, which were licensed to various other manufacturers. The design forms the basis for many camera lenses in use today, especially the wide-aperture standard lenses used on 35 mm and other small-format cameras. It can offer good results up to with a wide field of view, and has sometimes been made at 1.0. The design is presently used in inexpensive-but-high-quality fast lenses such as the Canon EF 50mm 1.8 and Nikon 50 mm 1.8D AF Nikkor. It is also used as the basis for faster designs, with elements added, such as a seventh element as in both Canon and Nikon's 50 mm 1.4 offerings or an aspherical seventh element in Canon's 50 mm 1.2. The design appears in other applications where a simple fast normal lens is required (~53¬∞ diagonal) such as in projectors. Development of the Double Gauss Anti-reflection coating Surface reflection was a major limiting factor in nineteenth century lens design. With a four to eight percent (or more) reflective light loss at every glass-air interface dimming the light transmission plus the reflected light scattering everywhere producing flare, a lens would not be of practical use with more than six or eight losses. This, in turn, limited the number of elements a designer could use to control aberrations.Cox, pp 215-218. Some lenses were marked by T-stops (transmission stops) instead of f-stops to indicate the light losses.Cox, p 222. T-stops were \\"true\\" or effective aperture stops and were common for motion picture lenses,Kraszna-Krausz, p 440. so that a cinematographer could ensure that consistent exposures were made by all the different lenses used to make a movie. This was less important for still cameras and only one still lens line was ever marked in T-stops: for the Bell & Howell Foton 35mm rangefinder camera. Bell & Howell was normally a cinematographic equipment maker. The Foton's standard lens was the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Cooke Amotal Anastigmat 2 inch f/2 (T/2.2) (1948; camera USA; lens UK, a Double Gauss).Schneider, On Camera Collecting. pp 153-155. The quarter stop difference between f/2 and T/2.2 is a 16% loss. In 1886/1890 the natural phenomenon was noticed by Lord Rayleigh (Rayleigh's Film) and later by Dennis Taylor in 1896, that some lenses with glass tarnished by age counter- intuitively produced brighter images. Investigation revealed that the oxidation layer suppressed surface reflections by destructive interference.Kingslake, pp 16-17.Harold Dennis Taylor, A Method of Increasing the Brilliancy of the Images Formed by Lenses.

Beginning in '39 and continuing postwar, all Zeiss lenses, East and West, were coated.\\" Antireflection coating could cut reflection by two-thirds.Cox, pp 222-224. Anti-reflection coatings were of immediate interest to Technicolor Corporation, which ordered the first commercial coated projection lenses from Bausch and Lomb for 25 Loew theatres in the larger US cities for the first showings of Gone with the Wind where \\"improvements in screen illumination, image contrast, and sharpness of focus\\" were noted. \\"Similar improvements were noticed on professional camera lenses. A typical uncoated high-speed motion picture anastigmat lens, such as the Astro Pan-Tachar, suffered light losses in excess of 41 percent due to reflections from the eight air-to-glass surfaces comprising its lens formula.\\" Due to the effective increase in light transmission of 1 stop, f/2.3 lenses could replace f/1.6 lenses, giving the same brightness with a smaller aperture and therefore superior optical quality and definition, and increased depth of field. In 1941, the Kodak Ektra (USA) 35mm RF was introduced with the first complete antireflection coated lens line for a consumer camera: the Kodak Ektar 35mm f/3.3, 50mm f/3.5, 50mm f/1.9, 90mm f/3.5, 135mm f/3.8 and 153mm f/4.5.Stephen Gandy, \\"The 1941 Kodak Ektra,\\" from http://www.cameraquest.com/ektra.htm retrieved 5 January 2006. World War II interrupted all consumer camera production and coated lenses did not appear in large numbers until the late 1940s. They became standard for high quality cameras by the early 1950s. The availability of antireflection coating permitted the Double Gauss to rise to dominance over the Sonnar. The Sonnar had more popularity before World War II because, before antireflection coating, the Sonnar's three cell with six air-glass surfaces versus the Double Gauss's four and eight made it less vulnerable to flare.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 152. Its telephoto effect also made the lens shorter, an important factor for the Leica and Contax 35mm RFs designed to be compact. As maximum aperture continued to increase, the Double Gauss's greater symmetry promised easier aberration correction. This was especially important for SLRs because, without the parallax error of RFs, they also began offering much closer focusing distances (typically a half meter instead a whole meter).Herbert Keppler, \\"SLR: Perspective, Controlled: What's your personal focal? Here's how I found mine.\\" pp 28, 30, 32. Popular Photography & Imaging, Volume 69 Number 3; March 2005. ISSN 1542-0337. The Double Gauss became the preferred normal lens design in the 1950s with the availability of anti-reflection coating and new generation extra high refractive index rare earth optical glasses.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 152. Coating lenses with up to a dozen or more different layers of chemicals to suppress reflections across the visual spectrum (instead of at only one compromise wavelength) were a logical progression. Further, coatings were used to modulate colour balance (transmission) and even contrast (and therefore MTF resolution) across lenses to achieve either consistent performance, or highest efficiency. Minolta (as Chiyoda K≈çgaku Seik≈ç) produced the world's first multicoated consumer photographic lens in 1956 for their 'Minolta 35 Model II' rangefinder camera - the Rokkor 3.5cm f/3.5 - with their patented Achromatic Coating. New lenses for the 1958 Minolta 35 Model IIB, also used the Achromatic coating, including the Super Rokkor 5cm f/1.8 and 3.5cm f/1.8. All other lens surfaces of the 5cm f/1.8 were single-coated with at least the front-group being multicoated. Although the 3.5cm f/3.5 lens did not sell well due to the slow aperture, a more modern, multicoated Super Rokkor 3.5cm f/1.8 was later produced for the 35 IIB shortly before the system was discontinued, and therefore the lens is extremely rare today. A prototype mutlicoated 5cm f/1.4 lens was also produced for the discontinued Minolta Sky M-mount rangefinder during its development, though it is not known if the coating was more advanced than that applied to prior lenses. By 1958, single-layer anti-reflection coatings were commonplace on photographic lenses around the world but it was not until 1966 with the introduction of MC ('Meter-Coupled') lenses that all Minolta focal lengths were updated to be fully multicoated, where every optical surface was coated at least twice, with the exposed front surface coating being relatively more scratch-resistant. Prior to this, full multicoating was mainly only applied to the standard 55\\\\58mm AR ('Auto-Rokkor') series SLR lenses, between 1958 and 1965. These lenses would be collectively referenced by Minolta as the 'green Rokkor lens' in a 1962 16mm company film promotion titled This is Minolta, because of the predominant green reflection of the front-surface coating which was distinctive to the coatings of other companies. Their Achromatic Coating initially consisted of a two-layer thickness-varying vapour deposit of Magnesium-Fluoride but no 'hard' coating, meaning many examples of the lens today show scarred surfaces due to improper cleaning. After 1958 when Minolta ended development of interchangeable-lens rangefinder products and focused on interchangeable SLR cameras and lenses, their Achromatic coating was continually updated throughout production with major coating advances being seen in 1966 (MC), 1973 (MC-X), and finally through 1977 to 1984 (MD-I, II, III). Hard-coatings were initially used in the immediate SR SLR series lenses. MC corresponds to the application of achromatic layers on all lens surfaces with new 'ingredients' ('Double Achromatic'), while MC-X introduced even more layers of new 'ingredients' ('Super Achromatic Coating') similar to Pentax's SMC, achieving an empirical improvement of about 1 stop with regards to flare and contrast control of dominating light sources. Beginning with the MD series lenses, additional layers were introduced as standard, although it is clear that for all lenses in any series, improvements in coatings were gradually introduced into production lenses as they were developed. One of the primary marketing claims of Minolta's Achromatic coating was that colour consistency was achieved across all lenses, deprecating the requirement for colour correction filters (common in the 1920's to 30's) when shooting under constant lighting conditions with different lenses, although the claim has not been substantiated and any colour-consistency difference over competing brands is not clear. It is also not clear if Minolta intended the process name as a reference to achromatic ('neutral') colour (white, grey and black) - or achromatism (a lack of red/blue chromatic aberration). Asahi Optical claimed their SMC Takumar lenses (1971, Japan) to be the first all-multicoated (Super- Multi-Coated) lenses for consumer cameras (M42 screw mount Asahi Pentax SLRs) although all of the other major manufacturers were already using their own proprietary coating similar to Minolta's Double Achromatic process, besides Fujifilm's more advanced 11-layer EBC (Electron Beam Coating) - however EBC was only applied to some commercial movie camera lenses around 1964. SMC was not a Pentax invention, but a patented and licensed process invented by coating pioneers OCLI (Optical Coating Laboratory Incorporated).Danilo Cecchi, Asahi Pentax and Pentax SLR 35mm Cameras: 1952-1989. Susan Chalkley, translator. Hove Collector's Guide. Hove, Sussex, UK: Hove Foto Books, 1991. . pp 96-98. Modern highly corrected zoom lenses with fifteen, twenty or more elements would not be possible without multicoating.Kingslake, p 17.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 74-75, 108-109. The transmission efficiency of a modern multicoated lens surface is about 99.7% or better.Anonymous, HOYA Filters: The Difference is Clear: All Filters Are Not Created Equal! Long Beach, CA: THK Photo Products, no publication date, but circa 2009. p 56. Then and today, Pentax's SMC coatings were regarded as the most efficient at reducing flare and maintaining contrast. Today, Fuji's Super EBC, Pentax's Super-SMC and Zeiss' T* are regarded as the most advanced photographic lens coatings available, although technical differences are now negligible between manufactures. Not all layers in multicoating are designed for anti-reflection - some are related to surface adhesion (Argon/Nitrogren Abrasion) or substrate and inter-layers as part of the manufacturing process, exterior 'hard' coating for durability, and Œª-filter layers (eg. T≈çky≈ç K≈çgaku 'UV Topcor' lenses) for increasing or decreasing transmission of certain wavelengths, and other finishing layers such as oleophobic and hydrophobic coatings to make the surface easy to clean. Antireflection coating does not relieve the need for a lens hood (a conical tube slipped, clipped, screwed or bayoneted onto the front of a lens to block non-image forming rays from entering the lens) because flare can also result from strong stray light reflecting off of other inadequately blacked internal lens and camera components.Cox, pp 214-215, 230-231.Kraszna-Krausz, p 843.Bennett Sherman, \\"Techniques Tomorrow: Veiled threats from inside your camera may be lighting up your pictures in the wrong spots.\\" pp 40-41, 44, 132.

Retrofocus wide-angle lens Ang√©nieux Retrofocus 35mm f/2.5 Zeiss Biogon 21mm f/4.5 Regular wide angle lenses (meaning lenses with focal length much shorter than the format diagonal and producing a wide field of view) need to be mounted close to the film. However, SLR cameras require that lenses be mounted far enough in front of the film to provide space for the movement of the mirror (the \\"mirror box\\"); about 40 mm for a 35mm SLR compared to less than 10 mm in non-SLR 35mm cameras. This prompted the development of wide field of view lenses with more complex retrofocus optical designs. These use very large negative front elements to force back-focus distances long enough to ensure clearance.Kingslake, pp 142-143.Kraszna- Krausz, pp 1675-1676. In 1950, the Ang√©nieux Retrofocus Type R1 35mm f/2.5 (France) was the first retrofocus wide angle lens for 35mm SLRs (Exaktas).Herbert Keppler, \\"SLR: Are the sacrifices we make to use an SLR worth it?\\" pp 27-28, 30, 34. Popular Photography, Volume 64 Number 6; June 2000. ISSN 0032-4582. Except for the front element, Pierre Ang√©nieux' R1 was a five element Tessar. Note, \\"retrofocus\\" was an Ang√©nieux trademark before losing exclusive status. The original generic term was \\"inverted\\" or \\"reversed telephoto.\\" A telephoto lens has a front positive cell and rear negative cell;Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 166-167. retrofocus lenses have the negative cell in front and positive cell to the rear.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 160-161. The first inverted telephoto imaging lens was the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson 35mm f/2 (1931, UK) developed to provide back-focus space for the beamsplitter prism used by the full-color via three negatives Technicolor motion picture camera.Kraszna-Krausz, p 840. Other early members of the Ang√©nieux Retrofocus line included the 28mm f/3.5 Type R11 of 1953 and the 24mm f/3.5 Type R51 of 1957.Aguila and Rouah, pp 129-130. Retrofocus lenses are extremely asymmetric with their large front elements and therefore very difficult to correct for distortion by traditional means. On the upside, the large negative element also limits the oblique cos4Œ∏ light falloff of regular wide-angle lenses.Ellis Betensky, M. Kreitzer and J. Moskovich, \\"Handbook of Optics. Volume II. page 16.5.\\" from http://www.opconassociates.com/book/physics165.htm retrieved 30 June 2010.Goldberg, pp 255-257.Lefkowitz, p 86. Retrofocus design also influenced non-retrofocus lenses. For example, Ludwig Bertele's Zeiss Biogon 21mm f/4.5,Ludwig Bertele, Five Component Wide-Angle Objective. United States Patent #2,721,499; granted 25 October 1955. released in 1954 for the Contax IIA (1950, West Germany) 35mm RF, and its evolution, the Zeiss Hologon 15mm f/8Erhard Glatzel and Hans Schulz, Dreilinsiges Weitwinkelobjektiv. (Triplet Wide-Angle Lens.) West German Patent #1,241,637; granted 1 June 1967. of 1969, fixed to the Zeiss Ikon Hologon Ultrawide (West Germany), were roughly symmetrical designs. However, each half can visualized as retrofocus. The Biogon and Hologon designs take advantage of the large negative elements to limit the light falloff of regular wide angle lenses.Kingslake, pp 150-152.Leslie Stroebel and Richard Zakia; editors, The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography. 3rd ed. Stoneham, MA: Focal Press/Butterworth-Heinemann, 1993. . pp 423, 434-435. With a 110¬∞ field of view, the Hologon would otherwise have had a 3¬º stop corner light falloff, which is wider than the exposure latitude of contemporaneous films. Nonetheless, the Hologon had a standard accessory radially graduated 2 stop neutral density filter to ensure completely even exposure. The distance from the Hologon's rear element to the film was only 4.5 mm.Small and Barringer, pp 86-88. Many normal perspective lenses for today's digital SLRs are retrofocus, because their smaller-than-35mm-film- frame image sensors require much shorter focal lengths to maintain equivalent fields of view, but the continued use of 35mm SLR lens mounts require long back-focus distances. Fisheye lens Beck Hill Sky A fisheye lens is a special type of ultra-wide angle retrofocus lens with little or no attempt to correct for rectilinear distortion. Most fisheyes produce a circular image with a 180¬∞ field of view. The term fisheye comes from the supposition that a fish looking up at the sky would see in the same way.Kingslake, p 145. The first fisheye lens was the Beck Hill Sky (or Cloud; UK) lens of 1923. Robin Hill intended it to be pointed straight up to take 360¬∞ azimuth barrel distorted hemispheric sky images for scientific cloud cover studies.Robin Hill and R. & J. Beck, Ltd., Improvements in Photographic Lenses. United Kingdom Patent #GB225,398; granted 4 December 1924. It used a bulging negative meniscus to compress the 180¬∞ field to 60¬∞ before passing the light through a stop to a moderate wide angle lens.Kraszna-Krausz, p 747. The Sky was 21mm f/8 producing 63mm diameter images.Stroebel and Zakia, p 432. Pairs were used at 500 meter spacing producing stereoscopes for the British Meteorological Office.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 162. Note, it is impossible to have 180¬∞ rectilinear coverage because of light falloff. 120¬∞ (12mm focal length for the 35mm film format) is about the practical limit for retrofocus designs; 90¬∞ (21mm focal length) for non-retrofocus lenses.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 78. Macro lens Strictly speaking, macrophotography is technical photography with actual image size ranging from near life-size (1:1 image-to-object ratio) to about ten or twenty times life-size (10 or 20:1 ratio, at which photomicrography begins). \\"Macro\\" lenses were originally regular formula lenses optimized for close object distances, mounted on a long extension tube or bellows accessory to provide the necessary close focusing, but preventing focusing on distant objects.Kraszna-Krausz, p 901. However, the Kilfitt Makro- Kilar 4 cm f/3.5 (West Germany/Liechtenstein) of 1955 for Exakta 35mm SLRs changed the everyday meaning of macro lens.Bob Schwalberg, \\"Historical Focus,\\" p 8. Popular Photography, Volume 95, Number 2; February 1988. ISSN 0032-4582. It was the first lens to provide continuous close focusing. Version D of Heinz Kilfitt's (West Germany) Makro-Kilar focused from infinity to 1:1 ratio (life- size) at two inches; version E, to 1:2 ratio (half life-size) at four inches.Stephen Gandy, \\"1st 35mm SLR MACRO LENS: Kilfitt Makro-Kilar of 1955: infinity to 1:2 or 1:1,\\" from http://www.cameraquest.com/mackilar.htm retrieved 5 January 2006. The Makro-Kilar was a Tessar mounted in an extra long draw triple helical. SLR cameras were best for macro lenses because SLRs do not suffer from viewfinder parallax error at very close focus distances.Kraszna-Krausz, pp 1259-1260, 1635. Designing close-up lenses is not really that hard ‚Äì an image size that is close to object size increases symmetry. The Goerz Apo-Artar (Germany/USA) photoengraving process lens was apochromatic in 1904,Kingslake, pp 101-102. although ultra-tight quality control helped.Arthur Kramer, \\"View From Kramer: Goerz, grand old American lens factory is saved from oblivion. And its hero is Schneider, the world famous German optical manufacturer.\\" pp 34, 38. Modern Photography, Volume 36, Number 12; December 1972. ISSN 0026-8240. It is getting a sharp image continuously from infinity to close-up that is hard ‚Äì before the Makro-Kilar, lenses generally did not continuously focus to closer than 1:10 ratio. Most SLR lens lines continue to include moderate aperture macro lenses optimized for high magnification.Ray, Photographic Lens. p 180. However, their focal lengths tend to be longer than the Makro-Kilar to allow more working distance.Bob Schwalberg, \\"History of Macro Lenses,\\" p 79.

ISSN ISSN 0032-4582. \\"Macro zoom\\" lenses began appearing in the 1970s, but traditionalists object to calling most of them macro because they stray too far from the technical definition ‚Äì they usually do not focus closer than 1:4 ratio with relatively poor image quality.Herbert Keppler, \\"Keppler's SLR Notebook: When is macro, macro?

Supplementary lens Zeiss Tele-Mutar and Wide-Angle-Mutar Schneider Retina-Xenon C system A supplementary lens is an accessory lens clipped, screwed or bayoneted to the front of a main lens that alters the lens' effective focal length. If it is a positive (converging) only supplement, it will shorten the focal length and reset the infinity focus of the lens to the focal length of the supplementary lens. These so-called close-up lenses are often uncorrected single element menisci, but are a cheap way to provide close focusing for an otherwise limited focus range lens.Kraszna-Krausz, pp 1485, 1488.Kingslake, p 182. An afocal attachment is a more sophisticated supplementary lens. It is a so- called Galilean telescope accessory mounted to the front of a lens that alters the lens' effective focal length without moving the focal plane. There are two types: the telephoto and the wide angle. The telephoto type is a front positive plus rear negative cell combination that increases the image size; the wide angle has a front negative and rear positive arrangement to reduce the image size. Both have cell separation equal to cell focal length difference to maintain the focal plane.Cox, pp 290-292.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 198-199. Since afocal attachments are not an integral part of the main lens' formula, they degrade image quality and are not appropriate for critical applications.Kraszna-Krausz, p 1488. However, they have been available for amateur motion picture, video and still cameras since the 1950s.Kingslake, pp 182-183. Before the zoom lens, afocal attachments were a way to provide a cheap sort of interchangeable lens system to an otherwise fixed lens camera. In the zoom lens era, they are a cheap way to extend the reach of a zoom. Some afocal attachments, such as the Zeiss Tele-Mutar 1.5√ó and Wide-Angle-Mutar 0.7√ó (1963, West Germany) for various fixed lens Franke and Heidecke Rolleiflex brand 120 roll film twin-lens reflex cameras, were of higher quality and price, but still not equal to true interchangeable lenses in image quality. The very bulky Mutars could change a Rolleiflex 3.5E/C's Heidosmat 75mm f/2.8 and Zeiss Planar 75mm f/3.5 (1956, West Germany) viewing and imaging lenses into 115mm and 52mm equivalents.Kraszna-Krausz, p 846.Jason Schneider, \\"The Camera Collector: A farewell to the twin-lens Rolleiflex: elegant to the end.

Component lens design is tightly constrained by the need to reuse the rear cell and the lenses are extremely bulky, range limited and complex compared with fully interchangeable lenses,Kraszna-Krausz, pp 845-846. but the Retina's interlens Synchro-Compur leaf shutter restricted lens options. Zoom lens Voigtl√§nder-Zoomar 36-82mm f/2.8 The zoom lens evolved from the focal length compression elements found in telephoto lens. Varying the spacing between a telephoto's front positive and rear negative cells changes the lens' magnification. However, this will upset focus and aberration optimization, and introduce pincushion distortion. A real zoom lens needs a compensating cell to push the focal plane back to the appropriate place and took decades of development to become practical. The earliest zooms came out between 1929 and 1932 for professional motion picture cameras and were called \\"Traveling,\\" \\"Vario\\" and \\"Varo\\" lenses.Kingslake, pp 155-156.

For example, Nippon Kogaku always apologetically acknowledged that Takashi Higuchi's Zoom-Nikkor Auto 43-86mm f/3.5, the first popular zoom lens, did not meet its normal image quality standards.\\"Too Hot To Handle.\\"June 1985. p 51. However, efforts to improve them were ongoing. In 1974, the Ponder & Best (Opcon/Kino) Vivitar Series 1 70-210mm f/3.5 Macro Focusing Zoom (USA/Japan) was widely hailed as the first professional-level quality very close focusing \\"macro\\" zoom lens for 35mm SLRs. Ellis Betensky's (USA) Opcon Associates perfected the Series 1's fifteen element/ten group/four cell formula by calculations on the latest digital computers.Herbert Keppler, \\"Keppler's SLR Notebook: Good Grief!

Modern Photography, Volume 47 Number 8; August 1983. ISSN 0026-8240. Modern computer created zoom designs may be so complex that they have no resemblance to any of the classical human created designs. The optical zooming action of the Series 1 was different from most earlier zooms such as the Zoomar. The Zoomar was an \\"optically compensated\\" zoom. Its zooming cell and focal plane compensating cell were fixed together and moved together with a stationary cell in between.Cox, pp 296, 302-304. The Series 1 was a \\"mechanically compensated\\" zoom. Its zooming cell was mechanically cammed with a focal plane compensating cell and moved at different rates.Rinzo Watanabe and Ellis I. Betensky, Zoom Lens Having Close- Up Focusing Mode of Operation. United States Patent #3,817,600; granted 18 June 1974. The tradeoff for greater optical design freedom was this increase in mechanical complexity. The external controls of the Series 1 were also mechanically more complex than the Zoomar. Most early zooms had separate twist control rings to vary the focus and focal length ‚Äì a \\"two touch\\" zoom. The Series 1 used a single control ring: twist to focus, push-pull to zoom ‚Äì a \\"one touch\\" zoom. For a short time, about 1980-1985, one-touch zooms were the dominant type, because of their ease of handling. However, the arrival of interchangeable lens autofocus cameras in 1985 with the Minolta Maxxum 7000 (Japan; called Alpha 7000 in Japan, 7000 AF in Europe) necessarily forced the decoupling of focusing and zooming controls and two touch zooms made an instant comeback. In 1977, zoom lenses had advanced far enough that the Fuji Fujinon-Z 43-75mm f/3.5-4.5 (Japan) became the first zoom lens to be sold as the primary lens for an interchangeable lens camera, the Fujica AZ-1 (1977, Japan) 35mm SLR, instead of a prime.Anonymous, \\"Modern Tests: Fujica AZ-1 Zooms and Has Motor Winder Too,\\" pp 164-168.

The first auto-everything 35mm point-and-shoot camera with built-in zoom lens, the camera type that dominated the 1990s, was the Asahi Optical Pentax IQZoom (1987, Japan) with Pentax Zoom 35-70mm f/3.5-6.7 Tele-Macro.Anonymous, \\"Modern Tests: Pentax IQZoom: First Point-And-Shoot 35 With Built-in Zoom,\\" pp 54-59, 96. Modern Photography, Volume 51, Number 5; May 1987. ISSN 0026-8240. The next landmark zoom was the Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan) of 1981. It was the first super-wide angle zoom lens for still cameras (most 35mm SLRs). Previously, combining the complexities of rectilinear super-wide angle lenses, retrofocus lenses and zoom lenses seemed impossible. The Sigma's all-moving eleven element/seven group/three cell formula was a triumph of computer-aided design and multicoating.Anonymous, \\"Modern Tests: First Ultra-Wide Zoom Lens [Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4],\\" pp 108-109. Modern Photography, Volume 46 Number 3; March 1982. ISSN 0026-8240. Along with optical complexity, the mechanical complexity of the Sigma, with three cells moving at differing rates, required the latest in manufacturing technology. Super-wide angle zoom lenses are even more complicated for most of today's digital SLRs, because the usually smaller-than-35mm-film-frame image sensors require much shorter focal lengths to maintain equivalent fields of view, but the continued use of 35mm SLR lens mounts require the same large back-focus distances.

Small aperture 35mm format lenses were made practical by the availability of snapshot quality, high sensitivity ISO 400 color films in the 1980s (and ISO 800 in the 1990s), as well as cameras with built-in flash units. During the 1990s, point-and-shoot cameras with compact small aperture zooms were the dominant camera type. Compact variable aperture zoom (some wide range, some not) lenses remain a standard lens on today's digital point-and-shoot cameras. At about this time the image quality of zooms was noticed to be equalled that of primes.Herbert Keppler, \\"Keppler's SLR Notebook: Super Stretch Zooms: Do You Lose Picture Quality?\\" pp 34-35, 74.

Catadioptric \\"mirror\\" lens Example of a catadioptric lens that uses rear surfaced mangin mirrors (Minolta RF Rokkor-X 250mm f/5.6) Catadioptric photographic lenses (or \\"CAT\\" for short) combine many historical inventions such as the Catadioptric Mangin mirror (1874), Schmidt camera (1931), and the Maksutov telescope (1941) along with Laurent Cassegrain's Cassegrain telescope (1672). The Cassegrain system folds the light path and the convex secondary acts as a telephoto element, making the focal length even longer than the folded system and extending the light cone to a focal point well behind the primary mirror so it can reach the film plane of the attached camera. The Catadioptric system, where a spherical reflector is combined with a lens with the opposite spherical aberration, corrects the common optical errors of a reflector such as the Cassegrain system, making it suitable for devices that need a large aberration free focal plane (cameras). The first general purpose photographic catadioptric lens was Dmitri Maksutov 1944 MTO (Maksutov Tele-Objectiv) 500mm f/8 Maksutov‚ÄìCassegrain configuration, adapted from his 1941 Maksutov telescope.Herbert Keppler, \\"SLR: The CAT did it: Want a tiny 500mm supertele for $100 or maybe $69?

Movable element prime lens Nippon Kogaku Nikkor-N Auto 24mm f/2.8 Nippon Kogaku Nikkor 200mm f/2 ED IF The complex internal movements of zoom were also adapted to prime lens designs. Traditionally, prime lenses for rigid cameras were focused closer by physically shifting the entire lens toward the object in a helical or rack and pinion mount. (Cameras with bellows expanded the bellows to shift the lens forward.) However, element spacing for best aberration correction may be different for near versus far objects. Therefore, some prime lenses of this era began using \\"floating elements\\" ‚Äì zoom-like differential cell movement in nested helicals for better close-up performance.Ellis I.

Internal focusing was originally popular in heavyweight, wide-aperture telephoto lenses for professional press, sports and wildlife photographers, because it made their handling easier. IF gained all- around significance in the autofocus era, because moving a few internal elements instead of the entire lens for focusing conserved limited battery power and eased the strain on the focusing motor.Goldberg, pp 45-46.

Traditionally, time-consuming hand computation limited lens designers to correcting aberrations for the in-focus image only, with little consideration given to the out-of-focus image. Therefore, approaching and outside the specified circle of confusion or depth-of-field, aberrations built up in the out-of-focus image differently in different lens design families. Differences in the out-of-focus image can influence the perception of overall image quality. There is no precise definition of bokeh and no objective tests for it ‚Äì as with all aesthetic judgments. However, symmetrical optical formulae such as the Rapid-Rectilinear/Aplanat and the Double Gauss are usually considered pleasing, while asymmetric retrofocus wide angle and telephoto lenses are often thought harsh.Jason Schneider, \\"Bokeh: Splendor In The Glass.

Modern Photography, Volume 47 Number 10; October 1983. ISSN 0026-8240. An early result of these explorations was the Minolta Varisoft Rokkor-X 85mm f/2.8 (Japan) of 1978 for Minolta 35mm SLRs. It used floating elements to allow the photographer to deliberately under-correct the spherical aberration of the lens system and render unsharp specular highlights as smoothly fuzzy blobs without affecting focus or other aberrations.Shuji Ogino, et al, Variable Soft Focus Lens System. United States Patent #4,214,814; granted 29 July 1980. Bokeh is now a normal lens design parameter for very high quality lenses. However, bokeh is virtually irrelevant for the tens of millions of very small sensor smartphone and digital point- and-shoot cameras sold every year. Their very short focal length and small aperture lenses have enormous depth-of-field ‚Äì almost nothing is out of focus. Since wide aperture lenses are rare today, most contemporary photographers confuse bokeh with shallow depth-of-field, having never seen either. Many are even unaware of their existence. Improving standards of quality Lenses have improved over time. On average, lenses are sharper today than they were in the past.Herbert Keppler, \\"SLR: How to find your way out of the lens test jungle‚Äìor maybe get more entangled in it?\\" pp 40, 42, 44, 11279. Popular Photography, Volume 66 Number 6; June 2002. Image format sizes have been steadily shrinking over the last two centuries, while standard print sizes have stayed about the same. The increasing resolving power of new generations of lenses have been used to maintain a relatively equal level of print quality and therefore higher levels of enlargementcompared with preceding eras. For example: the human eye can resolve about five lines per millimeter at a distance of 30 cm (about one foot). Therefore, a lens must produce a minimum resolution of forty lines per millimeter on a 24√ó36 mm 35mm film negative if it is to provide a linear enlargement of eight times to an A4 (210√ó297 mm or 8.27√ó11.69 inch) print and still appear sharp when viewed at 30 cm.Bennett Sherman, \\"Techniques Tomorrow: Resolving the dilemma of the resolving power figures used for lenses by MODERN's test lab,\\" pp 10, 12, 141. Modern Photography, Volume 47, Number 11; November 1983. ISSN 0026-8240. Optical engineers continually make use of more exact lens formulae. In the nineteenth century, opticians dug to the level of the Seidel aberrationscalled mathematically the third-order aberrationsto reach basic anastigmatic correction. By the mid-twentieth century, opticians needed to calculate for the fifth-order aberrations to produce a high-quality lens.Cox, pp 106-107, 110-111, 116, 120, 122-123, 136. Today's lenses require seventh order aberration solutions.Sidney F. Ray, Applied Photographic Optics. p 82. The best photographic lenses of yesteryear were of high image quality (twice the minimum resolution mentioned above) and it may not be possible to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the best of today's lens without comparing poster size (around 610√ó914 cm or 24√ó36 inch) enlargements of exactly the same scene side by side.Herbert Keppler, \\"SLR: Can you see the difference in pictures shot with a super-high-quality modern lens and an inexpensive old SLR lens?\\" pp 26-27.

However, this causes off-axis light to be focused closer to the lens than axial rays (spherical aberration); especially severe in wide angle or wide aperture lenses. This can be prevented by using elements with convoluted aspheric curves. Although this was theoretically proven by Ren√© Descartes in 1637,Watson, pp 91-92, 114. the grinding and polishing of aspheric glass surfaces was extremely difficult and expensive.Kingslake, pp 4, 15-16.Ray, Photographic Lens. pp 50-51, 110-111.

It was said to be capable of resolving 250 lines per millimeter. The four element lens was a Triplet with an added rear field-flattener. The Kodak Disc cameras contained very sophisticated engineering. They also had a lithium battery, microchip electronics, programmed autoexposure and motorized film wind for US$68 to US$143 list.

Diffractive optic lens Canon EF 400mm f/4 DO IS USM With computer-aided design, aspherics, multicoating, very high refraction/low dispersion glass and unlimited budget, it is now possible to control the monochromatic aberrations to almost any arbitrary limit ‚Äì subject to the absolute diffraction limit demanded by the laws of physics. However, chromatic aberrations remain resistant to these solutions in many practical applications. In 2001, the Canon EF 400mm f/4 DO IS USM (Japan) was first diffractive optics lens for consumer cameras (for Canon EOS 35mm SLRs). Normally photographic cameras use refractive lenses (with the occasional reflective mirror) as their image forming optical system. The 400 DO lens had a multilayer diffractive element containing concentric circular diffraction gratings to take advantage of diffraction's opposite color dispersion (compared to refraction) to correct chromatic and spherical aberrations with less low dispersion glass, fewer aspheric surfaces and less bulk.Herbert Keppler, \\"News: How Canon will cut the weight & size of tele lenses by about one-third.\\" pp 62-63, 148.

Lenses in the digital era In 2004, the Kodak (Sigma) DSC Pro SLR/c (USA/Japan) digital SLR was loaded with optical performance profiles on 110 lenses so that the on-board computer could correct the lateral chromatic aberration of those lenses, on-the-fly as part of the capture process.Michael J.

Also in 2004, DO Labs DxO Optics Pro (France) computer software modules were introduced, loaded with information on specific cameras and lenses, that could correct distortion, vignetting, blur and lateral chromatic aberration of images in post-production.Debbie Grossman, \\"Review: DxO Optics Pro: Optical Illusion: Do you really need a pricey DSLR lens?

Lenses have already appeared whose image quality would have been marginal or unacceptable in the film era, but are acceptable in the digital era because the cameras for which they are intended automatically correct their defects.

Telling the story of the Siliwangi Division and its leader Captain Sudarto on a march to West Java, Darah dan Doa is often cited as the first \\"Indonesian\\" film, and the film's first day of shooting ‚Äì 30 March ‚Äì is celebrated in Indonesia as National Film Day. Produced on a budget of 350,000 rupiah and intended to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival, financial difficulties led production of Darah dan Doa to almost stop before the director received financial backing. After raising controversy for its subject material, the film underwent censorship and was finally released to commercial failure. Retrospective analysis has, however, been more positive, and Ismail has been dubbed the \\"father of Indonesian film\\". Plot The Siliwangi Division, originally headquartered in West Java, is temporarily based in Central Java owing to the Renville Agreement. After putting down a communist rebellion in Madiun, killing numerous members of the Communist Party of Indonesia in the process, they are on a break. The division's leader, Captain Sudarto, meets with an Indo woman named Connie, who is originally from Bandung. The two become fast friends, but after a Dutch attack is launched on the capital at Yogyakarta, they must separate as the division heads westwards. Captain Sudarto leads his men ‚Äì together with women and children ‚Äì over more than , resting during the day and traveling in the morning and evening. They face hunger, a shortage of supplies, and Dutch airstrikes. Along the way, Sudarto begins to fall in love with a nurse named Widya. The division comes across a village that has been razed to the ground by Dutch forces, killing almost all of its inhabitants. Upon directions from the sole survivor, they go to a nearby village and are warmly received, being given much-needed food. As the men settle for the night, Sudarto goes for a walk with Widya, raising the men's ire. That night the men sleep comfortably in beds while the villagers stand guard. In the morning, however, the villagers ‚Äì who are revealed to be related to the Darul Islam militant group ‚Äì turn on them. The men successfully fought back, though Sudarto is shot by the village chief. The Siliwangi Division in combat, in a scene from the film Sudarto orders the chief executed, a deed which ultimately falls on the man's son. Afterwards the division continues west. One night, Sudarto's second-in-command Adam tells him that the men are restless over his relationship with Widya. They argue, and Widya ‚Äì who has overheard everything ‚Äì says that she will go. The following morning Dutch soldiers launch an ambush in which many are killed, including Widya and Adam. The division in dire straits, Sudarto offers to go to nearby Bandung on his own for the much-needed supplies, leaving his fellow officer Leo in charge. After meeting with resistance fighters who offer supplies, Sudarto goes to visit Connie and is captured by Dutch forces. While in prison Sudarto is tortured and begins to regret his actions, especially his womanising. After the Dutch recognise Indonesia's independence, Sudarto is released from prison, only to learn that his wife has left him and he is under investigation for poor leadership. After meeting with Leo, he realises that the division had reached safety. One night, as he reads his diary, Sudarto is accosted by a man whose relatives were killed in Madiun. After the two argue, Sudarto is shot dead. Production Usmar Ismail, the film's director and producer Darah dan Doa was directed by Usmar Ismail, a former soldier who had previously served as assistant director on Andjar Asmara's Gadis Desa (Village Maiden) and directed two films on his own, Tjitra (Image) and Harta Karun (Treasure; all 1949). Creative control for these works, all of which were produced for the Dutch-sponsored South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was held by cameraman A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling; Ismail served more as a dialogue coach. When the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence following several months of conferences in 1949, Ismail and other SPFC staff discussed establishing their own studio, though steps were not taken to do so until the following year. For his first production, Ismail chose to adapt a short story by the poet Sitor Situmorang, which the latter man had brought to him; Ismail later wrote that he considered it interesting because it \\"honestly told the story of a man without descending into cheap propaganda\\". Crew for the production consisted of cameraman Max Tera, a former SPFC employee, with makeup by Rancha', artistic design by Basuki Resobowo, G. R. W. Sinsu on music, and Sjawaludin and E. Sambas responsible for the sound effects. Ismail, using his military connections, received technical assistance from various members of the Indonesian Army, particularly Captain Sadono. The film's cast mostly consisted of newcomers who had responded to newspaper advertisements, a conscious decision by Ismail who was searching for \\"new faces with fresh talent\\" Ismail adapted this technique from Italian directors such as Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica. Ultimately Del Juzar, a law student, was cast as Sudarto, with other spots going to Ella Bergen, Faridah, Aedy Muward, Awaluddin Djamin, Rd Ismail, Suzana, Muradi, and Rosihan Anwar. Del Juzar in 1953; he was cast in the lead role of Sudarto. Twenty-nine years old, Ismail began shooting on 30 March 1950 in Subang, West Java. The following day he established his own studio, Perfini, to produce the film. Unlike his earlier films, Ismail had severe technical limitations. Though Tjitra had cost 67,500 rupiah, when the filming of Darah dan Doa began Ismail had only collected 30,000 ‚Äì more than half of which was spent to rent the SPFC (since renamed Produksi Film Negara [State Film Company, or PFN]) studios and facilities. For their trip to Subang, the cast and crew rented a decrepit microbus; filming was completed using an aged (\\"decades-old\\") Akeley camera; and the crew had to hold more than one role. Human factors also led to delays in production. Ismail and the other crew members attempted to achieve realism by ensuring everything in the film was as it was in life, a decision which he later recanted after realising that \\"film was truly the art of make-believe, making people believe something, creating a new reality from what is.\\" Cast-wise, three actors (including the lead, Del Juzar), competed for the affections of Faridah, leading to frictions between the actors. The cast also argued about interpretations of their roles, with Ismail insisting on them following his direction. During filming, Ismail typed his shooting scripts every night, expanding on the source material. After each day of filming had concluded, Ismail sent the results back to PFN in Jakarta and obtained rush prints which he screened for the cast and crew. One such showing spurred a deal between Ismail and local cinema owner Tong Kim Mew, in attendance at the time: Tong would lend funds the production, heavily in debt (Ismail notes that, by this point, they had not paid their lodgings in \\"a while\\"), needed, while Ismail would allow Tong to handle distribution. This funding allowed the crew to finish shooting, including further scenes in Purwakarta. Upon returning to Jakarta, Ismail and the crew found that some of the footage was unusable, as the \\"story did not work\\". As such, additional footage was shot in West Javan mountains, including Mounts Lawu and Gede. Other scenes were filmed at the banks of Citarum River. Ultimately the film cost 350,000 rupiah (then approximately $90,000 USD), over three times that of an average contemporary production. Release Darah dan Doa was released in 1950 and distributed by Spectra Film Exchange. It was given the English title The Long March, which the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests is a reference to the Chinese Long March of 1934. Not long after the film's release, a two- pronged controversy grew around it, which resulted in the film being banned in parts of the country. Members of other military divisions considered the film to put too much emphasis on Siliwangi's role, while members of the general public had difficulty believing that Darul Islam could have betrayed the national cause. Ultimately the film required President Sukarno's permission to be re-released in September 1950, after he received a private screening at the Presidential Palace in mid-1950. However, several scenes had to be cut. Domestic critical reception of Darah dan Doa, which was advertised as showing \\"fierce fighting against the colonials!\\" and \\"the joys and sorrows in guerrilla warfare\\", was predominantly negative. A review in the newspaper Merdeka considered Darah dan Doa unsatisfying, with only a few acceptable scenes. Armijn Pane, writing four years after the film's release, criticised the troops' neatness during their march, writing that their uniforms should have become progressively dirtier. Foreign reception, however, has been more positive. The Japanese film critic Tadao Sato, for instance, praised the film's concept, comparing it to the work of Andrzej Wajda.in . The Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that Ismail intended to \\"not consider commercial aspects\\" and send the film to the Cannes Film Festival in France. Ultimately Darah dan Doa was both a financial failure, with losses that were not recouped until after Ismail released his next film the following year. The film was not screened at Cannes. In a 1960 retrospective, the company attributed the film's failure to a conflict of what the people wanted and what was provided; the write-up stated that Ismail had not meant to portray the military as it should be, but as it was ‚Äì as well as individuals within it. Legacy Ismail considered Darah dan Doa reflective of a \\"national personality\\", and, in a 1962 letter, he wrote that he considered it his first film because he had had little creative control in his 1949 productions. After directing the film he went on to make twenty-five more films as director, including two (Enam Djam di Jogja [Six Hours in Jogja; 1951] and Pedjuang [Warriors for Freedom; 1959]) dealing with the Indonesian National Revolution; competing companies also released films in a similar vein, though Biran argues that they did not touch on the essence of the revolution. For his role as Darah dan Doa director and his subsequent work, Ismail has been dubbed the \\"father of Indonesian film\\", though the film scholar Thomas Barker suggests that his role in the film industry's development was exaggerated by the New Order for their anti- communist, pro-nationalistic purposes. Darah dan Doa is often considered the first \\"national\\" Indonesian film, although the first movie produced in the area, L. Heuveldorp's Loetoeng Kasaroeng, had been released 24 years prior. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the films released between 1926 and 1949 could not be called Indonesian films, for they lacked a sense of national identity. The film critic Nova Chairil stated likewise, considering the film the first to be \\"directed by a native Indonesian, produced by an Indonesian production house, and filmed in Indonesia\\". Barker and fellow film scholar Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn, however, argue that films by ethnic Chinese producers ‚Äì generally dismissed as profit oriented in mainstream studies ‚Äì already contained an Indonesian identity, citing examples such as Njoo Cheong Seng's Kris Mataram (Keris of Mataram; 1940). They note that, unlike the homogenous national identity offered in Darah dan Doa, these Chinese-produced films offered the possibility of a heterogeneous identity. The Indonesian film community began celebrating the first day of Darah dan Doa shooting, 30 March, as National Film Day in 1950. In a 1962 conference of the National Film Board of Indonesia, the date was given more formal recognition as National Film Day, and Darah dan Doa was recognised as the first \\"national film\\". National Film Day was formally established in 1999, when President B. J. Habibie passed Presidential Decree no. 25/1999. According to actor turned film director Slamet Rahardjo, the commemoration is so that \\"Indonesians acknowledge their local film industry and are willing to develop it\\". The Siliwangi Division's long march was the subject of another film, Mereka Kembali (They Return) in 1972. Directed by Nawi Ismail, it starred Sandy Suwardi Hassan, Rahayu Effendi, Rina Hasyim, and Aedy Moward. Mereka Kembali won a single award, Runner-Up for Best Actor (Arman Effendy), at the 1972 Indonesian Film Festival. Heider, contrasting the two films, suggests that Darah dan Doa portrayed communists in a more sympathetic light and \\"ignored\\" Darul Islam, while Mereka Kembali did not depict the events in Madiun and demonised Darul Islam. He suggests that the earlier film was released in \\"a time for healing, a time to consolidate the new republic, to reincorporate even those who ... had fought against it.\\" He further suggests that Darah dan Doa was more Europeanised and individualistic, with a focus of Sudarto, while Mereka Kembali emphasised the importance of the group and represented an \\"Indonesianization of the national cinema\\". The Indonesian video archive Sinematek Indonesia holds both 35 mm and VHS copies of Darah dan Doa. It is also held at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise. The film continues to be screened at festivals.

Miko≈õ, Polish Baroque and Enlightenment Literature: An Anthology. Ed. Michael J. Miko≈õ. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1996. 104-108. Cultural background Early life Giovanni Maria Bernardoni was born in northern Italy in the commune of Cagno in 1541. He worked as a mason until he was 23 years old upon which he left for Rome to join the Order of the Jesuits and become an architect. The Order directed him towards the construction of their main church in Rome, the Church of the Ges√π, where he worked for 6 years.http://bha.knihi.com/11/kal_e11.htm, Star way of Giovanni Maria Bernardoni, Valiancin Kalnin The construction was under the supervision of the famous Italian architect and the inspector of the Order's construction projects, John Tristan.L‚Äôarchitetto Gian Maria Bernardoni sj tra l‚ÄôItalia e le terre dell‚ÄôEuropa centro‚Äìorientale Architectural work=Italy= Church of Saint Catherine, 100 px Starting in 1573, Bernardoni worked on the construction of churches in Milan, Florence, Naples, and Abruzzo. The Chief Vicar of the Province Bernardoni was in at the time wrote about him to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus saying: \\"We are happy that God has gladdened us by giving us this master who was essential in helping Father Giovanni\\".Salviucci Insolera L. Il periodo italiano di Giovan Maria Bernardoni //L‚Äôarchitetto Gian Maria Bernardoni‚Ä¶ P. 13 Later, he goes on to work in Sardinia, specifically Cagliari, where he founds the Church of St. Michael towards the end of 1578 and the Church of Saint Catherine in Sassari (1579-1609). Lithuania and Poland In 1583, by command of the head of the Jesuit Order, Bernardoni was sent to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where Prince Nicholas Radziwill had already been asking for an architect for a long time. However, he wasn't able to make it to his new assignment since on the way there, Bernardoni was taken in Lublin by the rector of the Gda≈Ñsk Jesuit College, Christopher Varshevitski who was very influential in Poland. In Lublin, Bernardoni worked for 3 years doing projects for the Lublin College and churches in Pozna≈Ñ, Kalisz, and a restoration after a fire in the Bridgettines convent in Gda≈Ñsk.Biographical Dictionary of Italians - Volume 9 (1967), BERNARDONI, Giovanni Maria, detto Bernardone, J√≤sef Lepiarczyk =Nesvizh= Jesuit Church at Nesvizh in the 19th century by artist Kazimezh Pyastushkevich Facade of the Corpus Christi Church in Nesvizh Franciscan Monastery and Church in Kalwaria Zebrzydowska After the persistent reminders of Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç to the Order of Jesuits for an architect, in 1586 Bernardoni comes to Nesvizh and stays there for 13 years. There was a lot of work to do: firstly, the need to oversee the construction of Nesvizh college which had just begun. The project had already been prepared in Rome by Giovanni de Rossi, Bernardoni only needed to make adjustments and corrections. The main project was the local Church of the Jesuits which had to be designed and built. The prototype for this church became the main church of the Order of the Jesuits in Rome.* R≈´stis Kamuntaviƒçius et alii, Artisti del lago di Lugano e del Mendrisiotto in Lituania, 2013, 20, 22, 23, 25. Work in Nesvizh moved quickly although before Bernardoni was a difficult task: in addition to the need to keep the style of buildings dictated by the Jesuits, the wishes of Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç had to also be considered - including that the temple be built as a tomb for the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's. Due to the multipurpose nature of the church, the project require a lot of precision. For example, there were four staircases to ensure there would be a different path to separate locations and choirs for members of the princely family, priests, students of the college, and the commoners. There was also established two separate entrances to the crypt-dungeons, where different parts of the dungeon held the coffins of princes, monks, and eminent members of the community. It is known that while working in Nesvizh, Bernardoni helped Minsk-born former furrier Jan Frankiewicz, who after joining the Jesuits worked in Nesvizh as a baker and was taught to be an architect by Bernardoni. Later, at the beginning of the 17th century, Frankiewicz built the St. Casimir's Church in Vilnius, which still stands at the Town Hall Square. Over the years, many churches in Nesvizh were simplified, redone, and had additions made to them especially in the middle of the 18th century, but the stylistic basis of the building, both inside and outside remains unchanged since the times of Bernardoni. Apparently, the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's were involved in the design process of many of the buildings. In November 1593, the construction of the church was completed and the first services there were held. Jesuit churches in Nesvizh were considered the first buildings built in the Baroque style on the territory of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth simply because they were completed more quickly than others, even those that were started being built much earlier. This is thanks to the exclusive interest of Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's in the project, who did not allow interruptions in the construction, who promptly gave money to such an extent that in the end amounted to more than the previously agreed cost.Paszenda J.

Peter and Paul as well as completing the Monastery of St. Bernard in Kalwaria Zebrzydowska and St. Casimir in Vilnius. In 1605, when the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul had only the dome left to build, the walls cracked to which Bernardoni orders the foundation to be dug so the walls could be strengthened; this was not his fault - the foundation was laid down by a different architect. Bernardoni managed to fix his predecessor's mistake and the dome was quickly erected where it remains till this day. He never saw the completion of his last work as he died that same year, in 1605.Paszenda J. Nieznane ≈∫√≥dlo do driej√≥w budowy ko≈õcio≈Ça Sw. Piotra w Krakowie // Biuletyn Historii Sztuki. T.

Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017. is fairly new technology developed as a sub- branch of Digital Signage. It differs from the Second screen configuration. The latter typically has the first screen being a big screen and the second screen being the smaller screen of a cellphone. Where the small screen cannot affect or control the big screen. The small screen is often used to provide supplementary data on the content of the big screen. In contrast, SSI is distinguished by the small screen being able to change the flow of information or content on the big screen. The big screen shows an identifier of its computer network address. Often, the network is the Internet. The identifier might be in a barcode that is part of the image on the big screen. The mobile device scans the barcode, decodes it and queries a server. The server controls the big screen. When the server gets the query, it extracts the identifier of the big screen. The server can alter the mobile device screen and the big screen in a feedback loop. The user of the mobile device can pick buttons in its web page to change the big screen. The mobile device functions as a remote control. The advantage is the decoupling of specific hardware requirements for the pair of the mobile device and the big screen. If the mobile device is a cellphone, it only needs a camera and wireless Internet access. If the big screen shows a browser, then there are paired web pages. One for the small screen, one for the big screen. Microsoft calls this the \\"Companion Web\\". In general, the pages in the pair are different. The page for the big screen is essentially a digital poster. It does not need any buttons or selectable links. It can have large graphics. The large screen can be assumed to be on a wired connection, giving it large bandwidth. The small screen page is optimised for low bandwidth across a wireless connection. SSI is gradually becoming a standard for Digital Signage Implementation, seeking to expand the traditional capabilities of this technology, adopting the modern Internet and 'Connected Devices' concepts. It is related to augmented reality and the Internet of Things. Interactive Digital Signage might be a growth engine for traditional digital signage. Interactive capabilities are gaining increasing attention by retailers, clinics, hotels/restaurants/bars, and other venues that provide service to a 'captive audience'. Muzzley is a trend in present technology that lets a user in any connected network access the Digital Signage screen using the smartphone. In this scenario, the smartphone keeps adapting its interface according to the experience that the user is having. Muzzley integrates with all the major digital signage manufacturers as well as traditional applications made in standard developing languages as javascript, java, node.js, flash / Action Script and others. In general, Screen-Smart device Interaction is a set of mobile, networking, signal processing, software and hardware technologies that allows users with mobile devices (typically cellphones) to connect (using QR, URL or any other novel method) to a public screen and interact, control or acquire its content for emerging applications like effective outdoor advertising, event information distributions, out-of- home gaming, etc.\\"Convergence of Interactive Displays with Smart Mobile Devices for Effective Advertising: A survey\\", J.

High End Systems  In 1987, Belliveau began experimenting with dichroic filters and designed a color fading lighting instrument called Color Pro. It used three MR-16 lamps to crossfade between colors, which was unique at the time. In the process, it was discovered that dichroic filters, which are color-tuned thin-film filters deposited on hardened glass, were very expensive. Belliveau bought a used vacuum chamber and directed employees to re-build it for the purpose of manufacturing their own dichroic filters. At the time, there were no other lighting companies that made their own dichroic filters. Color Pro was distributed worldwide through a newly established distributor network.Jim Hutchison, \\"High End Systems: The Blackstone Audio Days\\", Jim on Light blog, October 26, 2009 Around the same time, Belliveau set up a manufacturing division called Lightwave Research for the purpose of designing and building new products. Another new company called High End Systems was incorporated in order to separate the installation company, Blackstone Audio Visual, from the sales and distribution of equipmentAustin Business Journal staff, \\"High End productions\\", Austin Business Journal, July 20, 1997 The next products to be designed and built were the Laser Chorus and Dataflash. Laser Chorus was a multiple-head laser system with 4.9-milliwatt gas laser tubes available in red, yellow, green, and orange. The heads were controlled by a microprocessor- based controller and they were capable of producing effects such as tunnels, planes, and various other geometric shapes and patterns. Because they were not over 5 milliwatts they were Class IIIA lasers and did not require a variance to operate in most states in the U.S. Dataflash was a multi-head, microprocessor-controlled strobe system with DMX512 control. It was used on high-profile tours, including the Michael Jackson Dangerous tour,Kevin Mitchell, \\"PLSN Interview: Peter Morse, Lighting Designer\\", Projection, Lights & Staging News, September 2012, pp. 34-35 as well as in nightclubs.  Intellabeam launched  Intellabeam automated light was introduced in 1989. Until that time, most automated lighting in the live event production industry were rented, and Vari-Lite dominated the concert and touring market. This allowed production companies to buy their own automated lighting and rent them for concert tours and corporate events.Richard Cadena, \\"Automated Lighting: The Art and Science of Moving Light, 2nd Edition\\", Focal Press, March 2010, page 28-30  Later years  In 2000, High End Systems introduced a digital projection system with a video projector, Orbital Mirror Head, and a DMX- controlled media server that interfaced with a lighting console. It allowed a lighting programmer to program the video switching and effects into the lighting console and play them back as part of the light show. The first such system was called Catalyst, but Catalyst evolved into the DMX-controlled media server in 2002 while the Orbital Mirror Head was marketed alone. Up until that point, media servers were manually-operated systems where the media, either tape or video computer files, were switched using a push button matrix switcher or a T-handle switcher to crossfade between sources. Jim Moody, Paul Dexter, \\"Concert Lighting: Techniques, Art and Business, 3rd Edition\\", Focal Press, September 2009, pp. 184-186 That era marked the beginning of High End Systems‚Äô immersion in digital luminaires. Soon after Catalyst, they introduced the DL.1 Digital Luminaire, a moving yoke projection system under the control of DMX512. It required the use of an external media server but the next evolutions of the product, the DL.2, DL.3, and DL.V all have media servers built in. The integration of media servers in their digital luminaires led to the development of another media server, the Axon Media Server. In 2017, High End Systems was acquired by Electronic Theatre Controls.

Early life Charles Fraser was born at Charleston, South Carolina in 1782. His parents died when he was nine years old and thereafter, he was raised by his older brother, Frederick Fraser. He studied law and practiced until 1818, but afterwards devoted himself to art. He attended the classical academy of Bishop Robert Smith in Charleston along with Thomas Sully. Career At various points in his career, he was associated with Washington Allston and John Stevens Cogdell. In 1806, he visited Newport, Rhode Island where he met up with John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart. In 1825, he painted a portrait of Marquis de Lafayette. His talent was very diversified, and in 1857, at an exhibition of his works at Charleston, there were shown 313 miniatures and 139 landscapes and other pieces by him. He was also a frequent orator in Charleston. For instance, he delivered the dedication address at Magnolia Cemetery in 1850.Charles Fraser, Address Delivered on the Dedication of Magnolia Cemetery ... (Charleston, Walker & James 1850).

A consensus All-American in high school, Foster was regarded as the best linebacker prospect of his class before committing to Alabama, where he played from 2014 to 2016. In his final season there he was awarded the Butkus Award, which is given to the nation's best linebacker. He was then drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft. During his professional career, Foster has been involved with a number of legal issues and other controversies, including multiple arrests, which led to his release from the 49ers in just his second season. He was claimed off waivers by Washington shortly after, a move that was met with criticism. High school career A native of Roanoke, Alabama, Foster moved across the border to LaGrange, Georgia, after sixth grade. He attended Troup County High School, where he played high school football and was teammates with Quan Bray and J. C. Copeland. During his freshman year in a game against Columbus (GA) Carver, Foster had a heralded performance against blue chip running back Isaiah Crowell. \\"That was my coming out party. That's when they started calling me 'freakish freshman'\\", said Foster. He completed his freshman season with 110 tackles, and added 112 as a sophomore. Foster finished his junior season at Troup County High School with 185 tackles, including 34 tackles for loss and 18 sacks. In February 2012, Troup County head coach Charles Flowers was dismissed, allegedly due to a rumor that he paid a football player to move from Lanett, Alabama, to West Point, Georgia, in order to play for Troup. Immediately afterwards, Foster announced his intention to transfer to another high school for his senior season. Foster eventually moved back to Alabama and enrolled at Auburn High School in April 2012, where he became teammates with Rashaan Evans. Along with the transfer came a switch in commitment from Alabama to Auburn, which triggered an NCAA investigation. In his senior year at Auburn High, Foster recorded 80 tackles (70 solo) and two sacks, helping the Tigers advance to the quarterfinals of the Class 6A playoffs. Auburn High School lost 7‚Äì8 in a grueling, defensive battle to rival Opelika High School at Duck Samford Stadium. Foster participated in the 2013 Under Armour All- America Game, finishing with six tackles and 2.5 for loss, earning Defensive MVP honors. =Recruiting= Regarded as a four-star recruit by ESPN, Foster was listed as the top inside linebacker of his class.247sports.com Composite Rankings ILB 2013, 247sports.com; accessed July 13, 2017.Rivals.com ILB 2013 Ranking, yahoo.com; accessed July 13, 2017. Chris Yeager, who coached the Alabama All-Stars in the 2012 Alabama-Mississippi Classic, compared Foster to Cornelius Bennett. Since his sophomore year, Foster was recruited by a number of SEC schools. In July 2011, Foster verbally committed to Alabama, citing the NFL pedigree of head coach Nick Saban and defensive coordinator Kirby Smart as the decisive factor. However, Foster was not firm on his commitment, so other schools continued to recruit him. After transferring to Auburn High School prior to his senior year, Foster decided to de-commit from Alabama, and switched to Auburn University. \\"At the end of the day, I feel like Auburn University is the place for me and my family. I am 100 percent confident with my final decision\\", said Foster. He went so far to have the Auburn University emblem tattooed on his right arm. Foster's commitment to the Tigers, however, only lasted until December 2012, when Auburn dismissed head coach Gene Chizik, and assistant coach Trooper Taylor, to whom Foster had developed a personal relationship. Foster went through January looking at different schools, including Alabama, Auburn, South Carolina, Georgia, Washington, Miami (FL), and LSU, with Georgia believed to be the favorite. On National Signing Day however, Foster re-committed to Alabama.Reuben Foster commits to Alabama Crimson Tide despite Auburn Tigers tattoo, espn.go.com; accessed July 13, 2017. College career Foster debuted as a true freshman for Alabama in the season-opener against Virginia Tech, registering one assisted tackle. He appeared in a total of nine games over the season, registering 12 tackles (four solo), including one tackle for a loss of yardage. Competing to fill the vacancy at inside linebacker left by Butkus Award winner C. J. Mosley, Foster was injured during spring practice on April 5, 2014. The starting linebacker job eventually went to Reggie Ragland, but Foster still played in 11 games and had the third-most special teams tackles on the team with eight. He made his first career start at the middle linebacker position against West Virginia, compiling seven total tackles with two solo stops and a tackle for loss (‚àí2 yards). Foster finished his sophomore season with 22 tackles including 11 solo stops, two tackles for loss (‚àí5 yards) and one sack (‚àí3 yards, against Texas A&M;). In his junior year, Foster took over as starting inside linebacker from Trey DePriest, and finished second on the team with 73 total tackles, eight for a loss (‚àí24 yards), on the season. He also registered two sacks (‚àí7 yards), three quarterback hurries, and nine pass breakups. Returning for his senior season, he was widely regarded as one of the best linebackers in college football. Sports Illustrated, USA Today, The Sporting News, and numerous other outlets named him a midseason All-American. After the season, he was awarded the Butkus Award, given to the nation's best linebacker. As a senior in 2016, Foster finished with 115 tackles, 13 for losses, and five sacks. Professional career On January 18, 2017, it was reported that Foster and Alabama teammate Jonathan Allen declined their invitations to play in the 2017 Senior Bowl. On February 13, 2017, it was revealed that Foster underwent surgery on his right shoulder to repair a torn rotator cuff. Foster was one of 19 collegiate linebackers to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana, but was sent home after getting into a heated argument with a student hospital worker while receiving his medical examination at the combine. Foster objected to the way he was being treated and was sent home before being able to meet with team representatives from any NFL teams. During the combine, it was announced that Foster had failed a drug test. On March 8, 2017, Foster attended Alabama's pro day and set scheduled private meetings with NFL teams to discuss the incident that took place at the combine. On April 20, 2017, it was revealed that Foster's urine sample was reported as dilute, which is treated like a positive test. At the conclusion of the pre- draft process, Foster was projected to be a first round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the top inside linebacker prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, was ranked the top linebacker by NFL analysts Mike Mayock and Gil Brandt, and was ranked the second best linebacker (behind Temple's Haason Reddick) by ESPN. =San Francisco 49ers=2017 The San Francisco 49ers selected Foster in the first round (31st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the third inside linebacker, behind Haason Reddick and Jarrad Davis, and the fifth linebacker selected in 2017. Foster was also the first of two linebackers drafted by the 49ers in 2017, along with Pita Taumoepenu. On June 9, 2017, the 49ers signed Foster to a four-year, $9.03 million contract with $6.87 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $4.71 million. He joined a revamped linebacker corp that consisted of NaVorro Bowman, Ahmad Brooks, Elvis Dumervil, and Malcolm Smith. Foster was slated to backup newly acquired free agent Malcolm Smith, but was named the starting right outside linebacker after Smith suffered a torn pectoral during training camp. He made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the San Francisco 49ers' season-opener against the Carolina Panthers and recorded three solo tackles and deflected a pass during their 23-3 loss. He left the game after suffering an apparent ankle injury. He suffered the injury in the first quarter while pursuing Christian McCaffrey and was inactive for the next five games (Weeks 2-6). Foster's first career tackle came on the first drive after he tackled McCaffrey on a seven-yard reception. He returned in Week 7 and was named the starting middle linebacker after the 49ers released the veteran NaVorro Bowman. Foster finished the 49ers' 40-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys with five combined tackles, but left in the third quarter after suffering a rib injury. On November 5, 2017, Foster recorded a season- high 14 combined tackles in the 20‚Äì10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He finished his rookie season with 72 combined tackles (59 solo) and a pass deflection in ten games and ten starts. Pro Football Focus gave Foster an overall grade of 90.7 for 2017. His overall grade ranked first among all rookie linebackers and fourth amongst all linebackers. 2018 On July 3, 2018, Foster was suspended two games for violating the league's personal conduct policy, stemming from a weapons offense and a misdemeanor drug offense. Following another arrest for domestic violence on November 24, 2018, Foster was released by the 49ers. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the decision was made as the arrest and all other previous issues made him \\"very hard to trust\\". =Washington Redskins / Football Team= Foster in 2019 Foster was claimed off of waivers by the Washington Redskins on November 27, 2018. Regarding the decision to claim him, Redskins senior vice president of player personnel, Doug Williams, stated that he and the rest of the team were fully aware of the allegations that led to his arrest, adding that Foster would have to go through the legal process and accept any other punishment, from the league or elsewhere, before ever he could play in a game for them. He added that the Redskins decided to take a chance on him after consulting with a number of his ex-Alabama teammates on the team, and hoped that being around them would provide him with the \\"best possible\\" environment to succeed on and off the field. He was then placed on the commissioner's exempt list by the league. Head coach Jay Gruden further added that it was not guaranteed he would ever play for the team, saying that Foster had \\"a lot of work to do\\" before they would accept him playing for them. In April 2019, an internal NFL investigation found no evidence to support him being suspended, with him being reinstated to the team's active roster. Instead, he was fined two game checks and put into an accountability plan developed in conjunction with the NFLPA and the Redskins, which included counseling, a living arrangement, weekly meetings, and community service, to help him avoid future incidents. During his first practice with the team in May 2019, Foster fell and suffered a torn ACL and LCL, and was subsequently placed on injured reserve. Foster was placed on the physically unable to perform list on July 27, 2020 and activated on August 9, 2020, before being placed on injured reserve again on September 5, 2020. Personal life Foster was born to Inita Berry Paige and Danny Foster on April 4, 1994. His parents were estranged in November 1995 when Foster shot Paige in the back. She was holding her 18-month-old son, Reuben Foster. Danny Foster was indicted by a grand jury in 1996 but fled the state before being arrested in California. He was extradited to Randolph County but escaped from jail in December 1996. He took on a new identity in Miami but was arrested after spending 16 years on the run and was extradited to Randolph County, Alabama.Father of Alabama signee arrested after 16 years on run , sportsillustrated.cnn.com; accessed July 13, 2017.Arrested fugitive is Alabama football signee Reuben Foster's father, espn.go.com; accessed July 13, 2017. Foster has a daughter, A‚ÄòZyia, who was born in 2009.http://auburn.scout.com/2/1201917.html =Legal issues= On January 13, 2018, Foster was arrested in Alabama by the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office for possession of marijuana. On February 11, 2018, Foster was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, threats, and assault weapon possession charges. On April 12, he was charged with felony counts of multiple domestic violence, possession of a weapon, and infliction of bodily harm. On April 25, Foster's girlfriend through her lawyer made a statement saying ‚Äú(Foster) did not strike her, injure her or threaten her,‚Äù and that the domestic violence claims were made after Foster attempted to end the relationship after she told him her injuries resulted from a fight with another woman. On May 17, Elissa Ennis testified under oath that she had fabricated the story \\"as a money scheme\\". On November 24, 2018, Foster was arrested again on probable cause misdemeanor domestic violence charges, and was released by the 49ers the following day. Shortly after his release, he was claimed off waivers by the Washington Redskins, a move that was criticized by many. In January 2019, the State Attorney's Office in Florida dropped the charges, claiming that there was insufficient evidence against Foster after reviewing the case.

In most cases it can be effectively controlled by interruption of the complement cascade. Particular monoclonal antibodies, discussed later in the article, have proven efficacy in many cases. AHUS is usually caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a branch of the body‚Äôs immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti‚Äìfactor H antibodies. Prior to availability of eculizumab (Soliris), an estimated 33‚Äì40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (despite the use of supportive care, e.g. plasmapheresis) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI). Signs and symptoms Clinical signs and symptoms of complement-mediated TMA can include abdominal pain, confusion, fatigue, edema (swelling), nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. aHUS often presents with malaise and fatigue, as well as microangiopathic anemia. However, severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are unusual. Laboratory tests may also reveal low levels of platelets (cells in the blood that aid in clotting), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage), decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells), anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (indicative of kidney dysfunction), and proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury). Patients with aHUS often present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, or coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, kidney, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression. For example, approximately 1 in 6 patients with aHUS initially will present with proteinuria or hematuria without acute kidney failure. Patients who survive the presenting signs and symptoms endure a chronic thrombotic and inflammatory state, which puts many of them at lifelong elevated risk of sudden blood clotting, kidney failure, other severe complications and premature death. =Comorbidities= Although many patients experience aHUS as a single disease, comorbidities are common. In one study, 25% (47/191) of patients with no known family history of aHUS were found to have a coexisting disease or condition. Comorbidities in this study included malignant hypertension (30%), TMA with a history of transplant (23%), TMA associated with pregnancy (21%), glomerulopathy (17%), systemic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) (6%), and malignancy (1%). The presence of mutations in complement regulatory proteins, or of disease-associated variations in the genes encoding these proteins (i.e., in most patients with comorbid conditions as well as in patients with aHUS as a single disease), suggests that deviations from the normal genetic coding of these factors could result in a genetic predisposition to TMA. Individuals so predisposed could have aHUS episodes precipitated by one of the known disease triggers (e.g., infection, pregnancy, surgery, trauma) as well as by other systemic diseases (e.g., malignant hypertension, SLE, cancer). Mechanisms In healthy individuals, complement is used to attack foreign substances, and the complement system is highly regulated to prevent it from damaging healthy tissues and organs. However, in most patients with aHUS, it has been demonstrated that chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement can result from production of anti- factor H autoantibodies or from genetic mutations in any of several complement regulatory proteins (e.g., factor H, factor HR1 or HR3, membrane cofactor protein, factor I, factor B, complement C3, and thrombomodulin). This results in platelet activation, damage to endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels), and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), damage to multiple organs, and often, death. Diagnosis aHUS is not the only condition that causes systemic TMA, a fact that makes differential diagnosis essential. Historically, the clinical diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases was grouped into a broad category that (in addition to aHUS) included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). However, it is now understood that although aHUS, STEC-HUS, and TTP have similar clinical presentations, they have distinct causes and specific tests can be conducted to differentiate these diseases. In addition, there are other conditions that can cause TMA as a secondary manifestation; these entities include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, also known as scleroderma), the pregnancy-associated HELLP (hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and low platelets) syndrome, and toxic drug reaction (e.g., to cocaine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus). Nevertheless, aHUS should be suspected in patients presenting with systemic TMA, and appropriate diagnostic work-up should be undertaken. The neurological and kidney-related signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of TTP. However, unlike aHUS, TTP is primarily an autoimmune disorder in which the presence of an inhibitory autoantibody results in severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWf), a large protein involved in blood clotting, into smaller pieces. (TTP also can be a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This congenital cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency is called Upshaw-Sch√ºlman syndrome.) A lab test showing ADAMTS13 activity levels of ‚â§5% is indicative of TTP. Similarly, the gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of STEC- HUS. Stool samples from patients with diarrhea or other GI symptoms should be tested for STEC and the presence of Shiga-toxin. However, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin, which is required to diagnose STEC-HUS, does not rule out aHUS. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin makes aHUS very unlikely. Treatment=Plasma exchange/infusion= Although plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI) is frequently used, there are no controlled trials of its safety or efficacy in aHUS. Even though PE/PI often partially controls some of the hematological manifestations of aHUS in some patients, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in terms of inducing total disease remission. PE/PI is associated with significant safety risks, including risk of infection, allergic reactions, thrombosis, loss of vascular access, and poor quality of life. Importantly, terminal complement activation has been shown to be chronically present on the surface of platelets in patients with aHUS who appear to be clinically well while receiving chronic PE/PI. Guidelines issued by the European Paediatric Study Group for HUS recommend rapid administration of plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI), intensively administered daily for 5 days and then with reducing frequency. However, the American Society for Apheresis offers a \\"weak\\" recommendation for plasma exchange to treat aHUS, due to the \\"low\\" or \\"very low\\" quality of evidence supporting its use. Although some patients experienced improvements in red blood cell and platelet counts, plasma therapies generally did not result in full remission. =Monoclonal antibody therapy= Eculizumab (Soliris) appears to be useful for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In September 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an orphan drug to treat people with aHUS. This approval was based on two small prospective trials of 17 people and 20 people. In the UK, NICE issued guidance on the use of Eculizumab for treating aHUS, based on five evidence sources, including those used by the FDA No randomised controlled trials were identified. All prospective studies were phase 2, open‚Äëlabel, non‚Äërandomised, single‚Äëarm studies that included patients with different clinical baseline characteristics. The prospective studies lasted 26 weeks; however, patients were allowed to continue treatment with eculizumab in a long‚Äëterm extension study. Ravulizumab-cwvz (Ultomiris) is a second generation monoclonal antibody for aHUS made by Alexion pharmaceuticals, Inc. The target of ravulizumab-cwvz is the same eculizumab (Soliris) with changes to the structure of the antibody resulting in a longer serum half life and therefore reduced dosing regimen. =Dialysis= Patients with aHUS who have ESRD are generally consigned to lifelong dialysis, which carries a 5-year survival rate of 34‚Äì38%, with infections accounting for 14% of deaths. These patients also remain at ongoing risk of non-kidney systemic complications of the disease. =Kidney transplantation= Despite its history of use in patients with aHUS, kidney transplantation does not address the continued and uncontrolled complement activation that leads to progressive, systemic TMA. As many as 90% of patients with aHUS experience TMA in the transplanted organ, leading to transplant failure. Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are still at continued risk of neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular complications and, importantly, premature mortality. Following kidney transplantation, the ongoing, uncontrolled, chronic complement activation associated with aHUS causes graft loss in 66% of children and 55% of adults, as well as continued inflammatory and TMA insult to other organs. Combined liver-kidney transplantation is only available to very few patients, due to the limited supply of solid organs. In addition, there is a substantial near-term risk of mortality, which many physicians and patients consider excessive. In recent years, some transplant centers have begun to administer eculizumab to patients with TMA who receive a kidney transplant. This strategy has been effective in preventing TMA recurrences in these patients. Prognosis Patients with aHUS have an extremely poor prognosis. Among those with the most commonly identified aHUS genetic mutation, the proportion of patients experiencing negative outcomes (e.g., need for dialysis, permanent kidney damage, death) within the first year rises to 70%. However, sudden morbidity and mortality can occur regardless of mutational status. aHUS can arise at any age, with more than 40% of cases first reported after 18 years of age. The oldest presentation in one study was at age 83. As noted above, kidney transplantation for aHUS patients with ESRD was rarely considered because of a high incidence of graft loss due to TMA recurrence in the transplanted organ in up to 90% of patients. Consequently, most aHUS patients with ESRD undergo chronic dialysis, which is associated with significant morbidities and worsened prognosis. Combined liver-kidney transplantation has been attempted in patients with aHUS, although this high- risk procedure has a mortality rate approaching 50%. Quality of life is very poor for patients with aHUS, who are burdened with fatigue, renal complications, hypertension, neurological impairment, gastrointestinal distress, clotting at the site of venous access, and ultimately, death. PE/PI is also reported to be associated with significant safety risks and is highly disruptive to patients‚Äô lives due to the requirements for extensive vascular access and frequent administration. Since the approval of eculizumab (Soliris) the prognosis for aHUS patients has improved greatly. Risk of relapse is present after discontinuation of eculizumab treatment and close monitoring is required. Epidemiology aHUS can be inherited or acquired, and does not appear to vary by race, gender, or geographic area. As expected with an ultra- rare disease, data on the prevalence of aHUS are extremely limited. A pediatric prevalence of 3.3 cases per million population is documented in one publication of a European hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) registry involving 167 pediatric patients. Society and culture=Naming= Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has also been referred to as diarrhea- negative hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D‚àí HUS). =Research directions= Patient advocacy groups have been helping to determine research priorities.

It was produced by Aaron Spelling Productions. Premise The series follows the stories of Christine Broderick, a supervisor of student nurses, portrayed by Suzanne Pleshette, and her five nursing students: Sam (Chelsea Field), Bridget (Susan Walters), Yolanda (Roxann Dawson), Becky (Kristy Swanson), and Allyson (Kim Johnston Ulrich). Other hospital personnel include Christine's love interest, Dr. Paul Petrillo (Gil Gerard); the head nurse, Lenore Ritt (Fran Bennett); and the chief of staff, Dr. Garrett Braden (Barry Newman). Sam also has a daughter, Megan (Taylor Fry). Production The series was developed from a pilot television movie, also titled Nightingales, that was directed by Mimi Leder and originally aired in June 1988. Field, Walters, Swanson, Bennett, and Jennifer Rhodes (as Effie Gardner) are the only members of the cast to appear in both the film and the series.  Reception  The series was described in the Chicago Tribune as portraying nursing students as women who \\"don't spend much time studying...[but] do hang around in their underwear a lot\\". Nightingales was criticized for \\"demeaning the nursing profession...by portraying five student nurses as lusty bimbos\\", and the American Nurses Association initiated a letter-writing campaign that prompted several of the show's sponsors to withdraw their advertising. The series was cancelled after 13 episodes. Aaron Spelling briefly revived it in syndication as the 1995 series University Hospital.

Biography His parents were of modest means, but when he showed artistic aptitude, they sent him to Segovia to study. This was followed by an apprenticeship in Madrid, at the workshop of the sculptor, Juan Alonso Villabrille y Ron. There, he established his style, participated in several commissions, and was ale to open his own workshop in 1731. That same year, he married Custodia Fern√°ndez and they had four children. She died in 1759 and he married again; to Antonia Ros, who died barely two years later. His first commissions as a professional involved stone work at several public buildings and sculptures for the Royal Palace (1750-1753). At the Royal Court, he made acquaintances who were involved in planning the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando and, after its opening in 1752, he and Juan Pascual de Mena were named the Lieutenant-Directors of sculpture. His popularity was widespread and he worked in several locations outside Madrid, including Guip√∫zcoa, Seville and Navarra. Although he had numerous assistants, it appears that they were closely supervised and that he provided the finishing touches to each work himself. Among those who trained with him were his son, Bruno, who accompanied several scientific expeditions as an artist, his nephews Manuel and Juan Antonio, who became well-known engravers, and the sculptor Francisco Guti√©rrez Arribas. In 1764, he was forced to reduce his work load, due to a serious illness. Contemporary sources described him as being so beset by \\"melancholy\\" that he could make only the most feeble efforts. This condition was aggravated by increasing difficulties with his sight, which eventually resulted in blindness. In 1765, he was forced to resign from his position at the Academia, and he died two years later.

The Roger Chapman Band, the Big Town Playboys and his own band Steve Walwyn and Friends. Early career Walwyn states his inspiration to become a guitarist was Rory Gallagher's album Live in Europe. Although he did not start to learn to play the guitar until he was 17, he formed his first band, Hands Off, whilst still at school. Upon leaving school he worked for the Civil Service for four years, whilst still playing with Hands Off. In 1978, he became a professional musician when he was asked to join a band performing under 2 different names. Cupid's Inspiration were a pop-act, who had had a No 4 single with \\"Yesterday has Gone\\" and a No 33 with \\"My World\\", both in 1968, but subsequent records had failed, and they were tired of the \\"one hit wonder\\" tag. The band had moved to Leamington Spa and were also writing their own rock songs, which they performed as '4 Wheel Drive', a name they soon changed to 'Chevy'. As 'Chevy' they toured supporting bands such as Alvin Lee, Hawkwind and Gillan. As well as recording one of their two BBC In Concert Programmes, whilst Walwyn was a member, Chevy also issued three singles: \\"Too much loving\\"/\\"See the light\\", \\"The Taker\\"/\\"Life on the run\\" and \\"Just another day\\"/\\"Rock on\\" and one album The Taker in September 1980. The album received good critical reviews,\\"with the dual guitars of Paul Shanahan and Steve Walwyn creating an extra depth that obviates the need for the turgid, monotonous rifferama that lesser bands perforce adopt\\" (Paul Suter, Sounds, 06/12/80) but did not sell well. In 1982, Walwyn briefly joined The Mosquitos, with Brian Helicopter, and recorded their only single, \\"Somethin' Outta Nothin'\\", before joining Leicester band The DTs. Whilst with the DTs Walwyn appeared on three albums, The DTs, Shakin' and Stirred and Messing with the Blues. Steve Marriott, formerly of the Small Faces and Humble Pie, saw The DTs in 1987, and was so impressed he asked them to join him, forming the band Steve Marriott with the DTs, who also performed as the Steve Marriott Band, until Marriott left to rejoin Peter Frampton in the US in 1989. Dr. Feelgood Both the DTs, and the Steve Marriott Band, had been the support act for Dr. Feelgood on several occasions, and the Feelgoods had admired his guitar playing. On the departure of Feelgood's guitarist, Gordon Russell, in Spring 1989, Lee Brilleaux asked Walwyn to audition. He was accepted at the audition and joined the band almost immediately. Walwyn fitted in with \\"surprising ease\\", and after just two warm-up gigs, was thrown in at the deep end, playing The Town & Country Club, a gig which was filmed for TV and issued as the LP Live in London. After another European tour, the band recorded their album Primo, during the recording of which, bassist Phil Mitchell left and was replaced by Dave Bronze. In 1992 Walwyn and Bronze wrote several tracks for the new album The Feelgood Factor, during the recording of which, in early 1993, Brilleaux was confirmed as having lymphoma. The band were laid off while Brilleaux received chemotherapy. Walwyn was part of the briefly reformed band, for Brilleaux's last two concerts, in January 1994, which were recorded and issued as Down at the Doctors, shortly after Brilleaux's death, on 7 April 1994. During the hiatus, Walwyn played with Eddie and the Hot Rods, The Roger Chapman Band and the Big Town Playboys. Steve Walwyn in Belgium 2009 A year after Brilleaux's death, the Feelgood's manager Chris Fenwick was still being asked if the band would reform, so he asked drummer Kevin Morris to consider this. Morris approached Walwyn and Mitchell, who were both up for it, but they had trouble finding a vocalist until they auditioned Pete Gage, who fitted in well. They went back on tour in summer 1995 and recorded On the Road Again including some more Walwyn and Bronze compositions, which was released in August 1996. In 1999 Robert Kane took over as vocalist, and the band released Chess Masters in 2000 and Repeat Prescription in 2006. As of 2018, Walwyn is still playing with Dr. Feelgood. Side projects Walwyn has played numerous sessions for other artists, such as Lawrence, appearing on his Denim on Ice album.

Its aim is to support evidence-based policy and practice decisions where pharmacists are employed or medicines are prescribed or used.Sheri L Koshman, What is Pharmacy Research?

Goals Illustration of a doctor and pharmacist from Medicinarius (1505) by Hieronymus Brunschwig. The goals of pharmacy practice research are to support the clinical and effective use of medicines, while ensuring that the risks of adverse drug reactions are minimised. It is generally concerned with the delivery of and equitable access to pharmaceutical care and other services delivered by pharmacists and related health care providers. It is undertaken by researchers, often based in universities, from a wide range of health care disciplines. These may include multidisciplinary groups of pharmacists together with statisticians, physicians, nurses, health psychologists, social scientists, health economists and epidemiologists, among others. Areas of pharmacy research may include, for example:World Health Organization, Medicines: Areas of work. Accessed 30 April 2014. *Medicines policy and governance *Quality assurance and safety *Medicine access and rational use *Quality, safety & standards (e.g. vaccines and biologicals). Approaches The approaches taken in pharmacy research can be summarised under the broad areas of understanding and describing the way care is accessed and delivered, identifying areas for improvement and evaluating new service models using rigorous research approaches. Pharmacy practice research often challenges traditional professional boundaries, reflecting the shift in the balance of care currently observed in health care delivery. For example, many conditions that were once primarily managed solely in a hospital setting are now managed in primary care settings, and many roles particularly delivered by doctors are now being delivered by other health care professionals including pharmacists. Pharmacy research aims to understand the clinical, humanistic and economic impact of these changes from the perspectives of pharmacists, patients and other health care professionals. Findings from pharmacy practice research have supported health policy changes affecting pharmacy. In some instances they have been the driver for a new service to be delivered through pharmacy, such as smoking cessation or repeat dispensing.Sinclair, H.K., Bond, C.M, Stead.

This piece is called a bomb carrier. On any turn, instead of moving, a player may say \\"Boom!\\" and overturn their bomb carrier. All pieces of either color on squares adjacent to the bomb carrier are removed from the game, as well as the bomb carrier itself.

Indeed, a letter to the British medical journal The Lancet praised a previous Esperanto medical journal, the Internacia Revuo Medicina, which was multilingual with a monthly publication schedule, saying: \\"That Esperanto is adequate for the purposes of medical literature can be learned from the study of one number of the Internacia Revuo Medicina. Thanks to the number of international words in medical writings any practitioner ought to be able to read this Revuo with no better aid than a halfpenny key to Esperanto.\\" W. Winslow Hall, letter to The Lancet, August 3, 1907 pp 319-20. Another early Esperanto medical journal was Kuracisto: Internacia Revuo Medicina edited by Wilhelm R√≥bin and published in Warsaw from 1912 to 14. The Medicina Internacia Revuo, founded in 1923, was first published in Budapest, appearing \\"irregularly, as funds permit.\\" British Esperantist, issue 244, 1925, page 93 , with Karlo Mezei as editor. The first issue appeared in September of that year, took up 16 pages, and had a subscription price (in Britain) of ten shillings. The journal appears to have been the first official publication of the UMEA (or its predecessor, the Tutmonda Esperantista Kuracista Asocio, the International Esperanto Medical Association). The British Esperantist, page 98 1922. At that time, \\"Internacia Medicina Revuo  long heralded  is devoted solely to translations from other languages into Esperanto of notable medical articles. It will not occupy itself with the propaganda of Esperanto, but stick to its task. American medical men should find in it the best means of keeping in touch medical advances of the non-English world.\\" L'Amerika Esperantisto, volume 30, page 6, 1922. . In 1926, it was stated that the journal \\"continues to appear bi-monthly. it is a large magazine, brilliantly edited, and well worthy of support by all interested in medicine.\\" The British Esperantist (1926) number 256, page 44 . The journal's editorial offices later moved to Lille, with Maurice Briquet, a French radiologist, and Julien Vanverts, a French surgeon, serving as editors. One coeditor of the journal was Leon Zamenhof, a Polish otolaryngologist, and brother of L.L. Zamenhof, the founder of Esperanto. Andrzej Wincewicz, Mariola Sulkowska, Marcin Musiatowicz, and Stanislaw Sulkowski \\"Laryngologist Leon Zamenhof  Brother of Dr. Esperanto\\" American Journal of Audiology vol. 18 iss. 3-6 (2009), pp 3-5. Due to the collapse of the European economy, the journal \\"one of our best technical magazines\\" switched to monthly publication. The British Esperantist issue 309, 1930, page 2-3 In 1949, a donation of back issues was made by Dave Hennen Morris to the New York Public Library. Bulletin of the New York Public Library Volume 53, 1949, page 111 The journal was subsequently moved to Tiba (Japan), where Saboroo Tamazoe served as an editor. In June 1994, Medicina Internacia Revuo moved to its current offices in Poland, where is it published by the Jagellonian University.

The sandstone mural facade depicting the origins of Freemasonry was carved by William M. McVey. Holland Lodge #1 at its current location in Houston, Texas Lodge history=Founding of Holland Lodge= In March 1835, Anson Jones, John Wharton, Asa Brigham, James Phelps, and Alexander Russell, wishing to formally meet as an organized masonic lodge, met under the Masonic Oak near the burial ground of General John Austin and petitioned the Grand Lodge of Louisiana for dispensation to organize a lodge in the Texas territory. On December 27, 1835, the dispensation was granted by John Holland, Grand Master of Louisiana. Holland Lodge No. 36 of Louisiana was instituted and opened on the second floor of the old courthouse in Brazoria, Texas. Meetings continued here until March 1836, when Brazoria was abandoned due to events related to the Texas Revolution. During this time, the official charter issued to Holland Lodge #36 was delivered to Texas and presented to Anson Jones just before the Battle of San Jacinto. This document arrived safely in Brazoria after the battle, but the brethren had dwindled in number post-revolution.Chatham, Walter A. \\"A History of the Masonic Building Association of Houston.\\" 1974.Jones, Anson. \\"Free Masonry in Texas: A Reminiscence of its Early History.\\" Reprinted in The Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Texas, Vol. I, pp. 6-7; by A.

Waco, Tx: Comm. on Masonic Education & Service, Grand Lodge of Texas, A.F. & A.M. =Original Brazoria Courthouse= In November 1837, Anson Jones assembled Masons living near Houston in the Senate Chamber of the original Capitol building (the site of the Rice Hotel and currently the Rice Lofts) and opened Holland Lodge regularly at this location until October 27, 1838. On November 13, 1837, the lodge appointed a committee to meet with members of Nacogdoches and San Augustine to organize the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas. This convention occurred on December 20, 1837 in the Senate Chamber meeting place, presided over by Sam Houston, and included representatives of Milam No. 40 and McFarland No. 41. The Grand Lodge's first session was opened on April 24, 1838 at which time Texas lodges were renumbered according to the dates of dispensation. Thus was established Holland Lodge No. 1, Milam Lodge No. 2, and McFarland Lodge No. 3. By November 1838, other lodges formed under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas, including Temple No. 4 (Houston), St. Johns No. 5 (Brazoria), Harmony No. 6 (Galveston), Matagorda No. 7 (Matagorda), and Phoenix No. 8 (Washington). =The Old Capitol Building= On November 8, 1838, Holland Lodge, Temple Lodge, and the Grand Lodge of Texas (all previously meeting in the crowded Senate Chamber) secured lodge rooms in the upstairs apartments of Kesler's Arcade at 910 Congress Avenue. After a dispute over the rent, the bodies were barred from the building in September 1839 and could not resume labor until February 1840, when they met once again in the Senate Chamber. On June 10, 1840, Holland Lodge agreed to a six-month contract for rooms in the CC Dibble Building at 201 Main Street. During this time, officers of the lodge made a new contract with the heirs of Mr. Kesler and returned to the arcade apartments between February 1841 and January 1847. The Old Capitol Building on the original site of the Rice Hotel After the turbulent first decade of masonry in Texas, members of Holland Lodge sought to establish a permanent building. Brothers William Marsh Rice and Nichols offered the second story of their new building at 1011 Congress Avenue for five years for the interest on a payment of $1100 which was eventually returned to the lodge. This facility was dedicated on January 16, 1847 and served as the home of Holland Lodge, Houston Chapter #8, and Houston Council #10 until November 23, 1852. In May 1851, a committee was formed of members from Holland Lodge, Washington Chapter #2, and Ruthven Commandery #2 and submitted a plan for a new three-story building for lodge rooms and a school. By March 1852, a lot had been purchased at the corner of Capitol and Main streets for $600. The erection of the three-story building was contracted for $2500 and completed in October 1852. As planned, the first floor was rented as a school for $20 per month, and the associated bodies met in this new hall until it was destroyed by fire in October 1862.

She has used a wheelchair since 1983 when she broke her back in a car accident. Campbell started playing table tennis socially in 2000 and shortly afterwards decided one of her aims was to play the game at Paralympic level. After the disappointment of failing to qualify for the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, Campbell made the Great Britain team for the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. In the women's class 1‚Äì3 team event at London, Campbell and Head faced the Turkish team made up of pairing Nergiz Altintas and Hatice Duman. They both lost their opening individual matches, but then turned that result around when they switched opponents to level the game 2‚Äì2. The British team won the deciding doubles set to win the match 3‚Äì2 and take them into the semi-finals.

Lasting between 1946 and 2002, the army corps-strength FBA-BSD formed part of the NATO force guarding Western Europe against Warsaw Pact during the Cold War. At its height, 40,000 soldiers were serving with the unit with several thousand civilians also living in the Belgian zone around Cologne. History Belgian base near Eschweiler in 1969 In the aftermath of World War II, Belgian troops were deployed to Germany as part of the Allied occupation force. From 1 April 1946, three Belgian infantry brigades of I Corps were present. Shortly after, the Belgians were given their own zone with operational autonomy in the sector controlled by the British. The territory in question covered the cities of Aachen, Cologne, Soest, Siegen and Kassel in North Rhine-Westphalia. There was also a Belgian garrison in Bonn until 1949 when West Germany was created. By the 1950s, West Germany was on the frontline of the Cold War. Once West Germany joined NATO in May 1955, the mission of the FBA-BSD changed from being an \\"army of occupation\\" to being an \\"army of protection\\", guarding a -wide strip of German territory from the border with East Germany to the German- Belgian border against Warsaw Pact attack. It was assigned to NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG). At its height, 40,000 Belgian soldiers were stationed in Germany and a total of 70,000 Belgian nationals lived in the zone. At the end of the Cold War in November 1989, there were 24,000 soldiers in the FBA-BSD. A large number of those who served were conscripts deployed to the force as part of their national service. Map showing the area of West Germany occupied by Belgian forces after the Second World War Because of the presence of large numbers of Belgian citizens, both soldiers and their families, the region was seen by some as a \\"tenth province\\" (dixi√®me province) of Belgium. Over the course of the Belgian occupation, hundreds of thousands of Belgian citizens lived in the area with their families. Plans for the evacuation of families in event of war were also drawn up. A newspaper, entitled Vici, was published for the unit. At the end of the Cold War, the Belgian government launched a plan to restructure the entire Belgian army between 2000 and 2015. Belgian forces in Germany began a period of staged withdrawal known as \\"Reforbel\\". The final Belgian barracks (Troisdorf-Spich) was shut on 31 August 2004. Some soldiers remained in Vogelsang Camp, across the frontier, until 2005. 450 \\"mixed\\" Belgian-German families opted to remain in Germany after the military withdrawal. Today a museum in Soest, Germany is dedicated to the history of the FBA-BSD.

It was built in 1793 and is situated between Fishergate and Winckley Square on Chapel Street.Jesuits in Preston Dedication The church is dedicated to Wilfrid (c.633-c.709), an English bishop and saint. He founded a monastic community in Ripon and was Bishop of Northumbria from 664-668 and 714-732. Saint Wilfrid must have had a particular devotion in Preston, because the original parish church, the present-day St. John's Minster, was originally called St Wilfrid's. However, it changed its dedication to St. John the Baptist in 1581, and again to St. John the Evangelist in 1770, meaning that when St. Wilfrid's church was built in 1793, there was no confusion between the two. History=Founding= The first post-reformation Catholic church in Preston was established by Jesuits in 1761, St Mary's in Friargate. This church, now demolished, soon became too small and was replaced by St Wilfrid's which was begun in April 1792 and finished 14 months later and cost ¬£4000.St Wilfrid's History Page The church was built before the Restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy, which probably explains why such a large church is relatively discreet in the landscape of Preston city centre. Instead of being at right-angles to the street, it is parallel and does not have a surrounding green space or a spire to make it more distinctive. The driving force behind the building of the church was Father Joseph 'Daddy' Dunn, a Jesuit who continued ministering as a Catholic priest during the suppression of the Society of Jesus. The first stage of building the church was to have plain brick edifice with a balcony around the three sides facing the altar inside. However, soon the congregation outgrew the church and it was decided not only that the church needed expanding, but it needed to be grander. =Remodelling= left In 1878 a new 'sodality' chapel and confessionals were added and the inside of the church was remodelled. One of the architects of this remodelling was in fact a Jesuit priest, Fr. Ignatius Scoles SJ, son of the architect Joseph John Scoles, who designed the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street in London, St Ignatius Church in Preston and the Church of St Francis Xavier in Liverpool. This new stage of building work was finished in 1880. Ten years later stone cladding and terra-cotta and stone carvings were added to the exterior and elaborate marbles from all over Europe were fixed to the interior walls and columns. The final church, after renovations of 1996, still looks fresh and bright. Unusually for a Catholic church today, St Wilfrid's was never really re-ordered for the post-Vatican II liturgy. It retains the altar rails and high altar with very little modification. Ministry The church is still administered by the Society of Jesus whose community is next door on Winckley Square, and who ran the nearby Preston Catholic College until its closure in 1978. The church itself is open daily during shopping hours and is a place of quiet and prayer for young and old alike. The adjacent parish centre hosts various activity groups, such as the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and Christian Life Community.St Wilfrid's Parish Groups It also houses a sanctuary bookshop which sells religious items such as rosaries, missals and crucifixes.

A common and widespread species‚Äîone of the most widespread fungi in the genus Lepiota‚Äîit has been reported from Europe, northern Asia, North America, and New Zealand. It fruits on the ground in disturbed areas, such as lawns, path and road edges, parks, and gardens. The species produces fruit bodies characterized by the flat, reddish-brown concentric scales on the caps, and an unpleasant odour resembling burnt rubber. Similar Lepiota species can sometimes be distinguished from L. cristata by differences in cap colour, stipe structure, or odour, although some species can only be reliably distinguished through the use of microscopy.  Taxonomy and naming  Lepiota cristata was first described as Agaricus cristatus by the British naturalist James Bolton in his 1788 work An History of Fungusses, Growing about Halifax. The type collection was made from a garden in Warley Town (England) in 1787. This name remained until 1871 when German mycologist Paul Kummer moved the species into the genus Lepiota, where it gained its current name, Lepiota cristata. MycoBank lists several varieties of L. cristata. These are: *L. cristata var. adextrinoidea E.Valenz. & G.Moreno (1994) *L. cristata var. congolensis Beeli (1927) *L. cristata var. cristata P.Kumm.(1871) *L. cristata var. exannulata Bon (1981) *L. cristata var. felinoides Bon (1981) *L. cristata var. macrospora (Zhu L.Yang) J.F.Liang & Zhu L.Yang (2011) *L. cristata var. pallidior Boud. ex Bon (1981) *L. cristata var. viridispora Kyde & J.L.Peterson (1986) Lepiota cristata var. sericea, described from the Netherlands in 1922, is now considered synonymous with Leucoagaricus sericifer. L. cristata var. exannulata, L. cristata var. felinoides and L. cristata var. pallidior may be of an uncertain taxonomic status, as despite being listed as varieties of L. cristata the same databases also include these three taxa as synonyms of L. cristata. Lepiota castaneidisca was once considered a synonym of L. cristata until molecular analysis showed it to be a distinct species. The specific epithet cristata means \\"crested\\". Vernacular names for the mushroom include \\"malodorous lepiota\\", \\"\\"brown-eyed parasol\\", the \\"burnt-rubber lepiota\\", and the \\"stinking dappling\\".  Description  The fruit body produced by Lepiota cristata has a cap with a white to cream base colour, covered with concentrically arranged reddish-brown scales; at maturity the cap diameter ranges from across. The center of the cap is a darker reddish-brown than the rest of the cap. The cap is initial bell-shaped to convex, then later flattens out and develops an umbo. The crowded gills of Lepiota cristata are white to cream, free from attachment to the stipe, and darken/become brownish as the mushroom ages and the spores mature. The stipe is usually between , and thick. With a stipe which is nearly smooth and a pale white-tinged flesh colour, L. cristata also has a transient ring, which is membranous and deciduous. The flesh is thin and white. The dorsal spur on the spores of Lepiota cristata gives them a triangular or wedge shape; they measure 7‚Äì8.5 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm. These spores are slightly dextrinoid, meaning they stain deep red to reddish brown with the application of Melzer's reagent. The cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) in L. cristata are club-shaped and measure about 15‚Äì25 by 8‚Äì14 ¬µm; there are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia); the pileipellis is a hymeniform layer of hyphal cells about 30‚Äì50 by 10‚Äì25 ¬µm. When the spores fall onto a surface, the powdery deposit they leave behind (the spore print) is white, apart from in L. cristata var. viridispora where the spore print is greyish green, similar to that of false parasol (Chlorophyllum molybdites). Lepiota cristata has been described as having a strong, distinctive and unpleasant odour‚Äîit has been described as rubbery, fishy, pungent, foul, fungusy, fruity, mealy and sweet. Despite this, L. cristata has been described as having a mild and pleasant taste. =Similar species= Several have been described‚Äîin North America, Europe, and Asia‚Äîthat are similar in appearance and morphology to Lepiota cristata. Biogeographical evidence suggests that L. cristata and similar species may form a widespread species complex with a wide range of variation. It can be confused with other Lepiota species, such as L. ignivolvata, though L. ignivolvata can be distinguished from L. cristata as it has a ring, bright orange or red-brown in colour, low down on the stipe. The rare, toxic species L. lilacea has a morphology similar to L. cristata but has purple to purple-brown colours. The lookalike L. saponella, found on the west coast of France, is distinguished from L. cristata by its soapy smell, dingy buff-coloured gills, and smaller scales on the cap surface. Microscopically, its spores are more triangular than those of L. cristata. Lepiota cristatanea, a southwestern Chinese species named for its similarity to L. cristata, has smaller fruit bodies and smaller spores, typically measuring 4.0‚Äì5.5 by 2.5‚Äì3.0 ¬µm.  Ecology, habitat and distribution  Lepiota cristata is a saprobic species, deriving nutrients through decomposing dead or decayed organic material. saprobic behaviour by L. cristata has been observed on the soil of broadleaved and conifer (Pinopsida) trees. L. cristata can be found growing either singly or in small groups and in multiple habitats including woodlands, gardens (especially shady and damp ones), garden waste, short grass, leaf litter, paths, ditches, and other areas of disturbed ground. Lepiota cristata is one of the most widely distributed Lepiota species, and can be found in North America (north of Mexico), throughout Europe, and northern Asia. It is also found in New Zealand.  Toxicity  Whilst it is unknown for sure whether Lepiota cristata is poisonous to humans or not, mycologists at least regard it as suspect ‚àí this suspicion comes from the fact that many other small species of Lepiota are poisonous. It has been said that L. cristata causes gastrointestinal symptoms. Up until recently, there was a potentially injurious confusion pertaining to the toxicity of L. cristata, as in Great Britain dapperlings were commonly referred to as parasols. A parasol mushrooms is one from the parasol family (Macrolepiota, or sometimes used specifically to refer to Macrolepiota procera) and these are, unlike L. cristata, edible. This frequent misidentification may have added to the incidence of poisoning.

It was built in around 1766 and underwent significant alteration in around 1850. The north wing was demolished in the 1960s. It is a Grade II listed building. History The manor of Bathealton Court was mentioned in the Domesday Book when it was the property of Sir William Moahun, Baron of Dunster Castle. The present house was built in about 1788. The alterations of 1850 were at the hands of Henry Gorges Moysey, who also paid for the construction of Bathealton church in 1854. This had some fine painted glass by John Toms of Wellington. it remained owned by the Moysey family until 1923, when sold by Charles Moysey.In 2006 it again changed hands, being put up for auction. At this time the estate consisted of 141 acres of garden, parkland and woodland and included a farmhouse, stables and lodge. The house Bathealton Court was built in about 1766, probably on the site of, and incorporating the structure of, an older building. It is a rendered stone house, with a moulded cornice, slate roofs, and rendered chimney stacks. It originally had a U-shaped plan, but the north wing was demolished in the 1960s. It consists of two storeys plus attics, with single storey bays at either side, giving it a 1:2:3:2:1 bay configuration. The sashed windows have moulded architraves, and the central window on the ground floor is pedimented. The main door is in the single storey porch to the left, and the similar bay on the right has a window and balustrade. The interior has some fine decorative plaster ceilings, a late eighteenth century barley-sugar twist staircase and plain panelling in several rooms. The house was designated as a Grade II listed building on 25 January 1956. The gardens Bathealton Court is set in rural surroundings and has an extensive view of the surrounding countryside. The gardens include lawns and kitchen gardens and there is a cottage behind the house previously inhabited by the gardener.

The verb to calendar means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory. The term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind. Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a table of dates. British tradition In the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a \\"carefully controlled, rigorously consistent pr√©cis\\".Harvey 2001, pp. 56‚Äì59. All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a primary source in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements (\\"common form and unnecessary verbiage\\") are omitted; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full.Hunnisett 1977, pp. 52‚Äì66. Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other finding aid. Calendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and early modern sources include the Calendar of Charter Rolls (1903‚Äì1927); the Calendar of Close Rolls (1900‚Äì1963); the Calendar of Patent Rolls (1891‚Äì); the Calendars of State Papers (Domestic and Foreign) (1856‚Äì); the Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers (1868‚Äì1962) (all from material now in The National Archives); the Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland (published by the Public Record Office 1896‚Äì1960, and by the Irish Manuscripts Commission 1978‚Äì); the Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII (1864‚Äì1932); and the \\"Reports and Calendars\\" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. One advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a pr√©cis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or facsimile.Hunnisett 1977, pp. 14‚Äì16. This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original. In Irish historiography, the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland during the Irish Civil War means that calendars made before 1922 are often the most complete surviving records. Paul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring \\"is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed\\"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be \\"significantly harder than straightforward editing\\". North American tradition In the North American tradition, a \\"calendar\\" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a finding aid to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.Stevens and Burg 1997, pp. 67‚Äì69.

He established himself early as a prolific dancer, specialised in breakdance and in Street dance. At the age of 15 he moved to Stockholm. Together with his longtime companion Aleksander Maksic he traveled to New York at the age of 16. There they eagerly took part in the frantic club life of New York. It was here that Bucchieri's love for Vogue was discovered, at various ballroom dances. Bucchieri is educated at the Ballet Academy of the Opera of Stockholm and at the Royal Dramatic Theatre ÃÅs acting school. He has been a dancer at the royal Swedish Ballet and in the Cullberg Ballet, where he danced the Prince in Mats Ek's Sleeping beauty and Romeo in Birgit Cullberg's Romeo and Juliet. He has been a dancer and actor in the acclaimed choreograph Pontus Lidberg‚Äôs movies the Rain (2008) and the Labyrinth Within (2011) together with New York city ballet‚Äôs star Wendy Whelan. In 2010 Bucchieri choreographed his first dance work for Stockholm 59 degree North 1 ballet Cantus: In memory of the dancing queen. ‚ÄùThe work is a somber and stylised reflexion of human relationships, effectively accompanied by Bach‚Äôs Passion According to St Matthew by J.S Bach, reinterpreted electronically.\\" La Nueva Espana - Diaro Independiente de Asturias, 2010 \\"Cantus in memory of the dancing queen is somber from the beginning to end, but its refined aesthetics render it subtle than cumbersome.\\" It possesses a stamp of decadence, the requiem of a dream (the end of a career). One senses that the spell has faded and that it is time for the next way for the Grande Dame to appear.

Convinced from an early age that he might not last that long, he has intensely been documenting his life - both behind and in front of the camera. Filming has been a way to preserve memories. Music is the most essential part of Bucchier‚Äôs life, and he desperately needs to play the piano each day. He moves with ease between serious music and popular music. For Bucchieri, Kate Bush and the avant-garde filmmaker and choreographer Maya Deren is almost as great influences as JS Bach. High art and popular culture is often mixed in the works of Bucchieri. Thus he has a broad spectrum of artistic expression. This Bucchieri will show in 2012 - 2013 as he is to release a synthesis of his entire production in the form of music, dance and film. Bucchieri is about to release a record with his new band Sister, together with his closely knit collaborators Stefan Levin and Aleksander Maksic. They are all part of the Sister family. On the 27th of April, Bucchieri‚Äôs piece \\"Come you daughters\\" premiered at the Royal Swedish Opera (together with Alexander Ekman and Pontus Lidberg). \\"The greatest surprise is Giovanni Bucchieri‚Äôs \\"Come you daughters\\", which is performed by five dancers with Nadja Sellrup as the main character.

Richtmyer and given annually by the American Association of Physics Teachers. Its recipients include over 15 Nobel Prize winners. Establishment and award criteria Floyd T. Richtmyer (1881‚Äì1939) was one of the first presidents of the American Association of Physics Teachers and his work helped shape the development of physics in the United States. The Richtmyer Award was established in 1941, and is typically given to educators who have made outstanding contributions as teachers in their fields. It is awarded to those who have not only produced important current research in physics, but to those who have, by means of communication to both students and other educators, imparted information and motivation to participants in the field. The effective use of a teaching method in order to pass on information, and to stimulate interest in physics, is seen as being worthy of recognition in its own right, in addition to the importance of the production of new research. Recipients of the award deliver a Keynote Address, the annual Richtmyer Lecture, which is designed for communication with non-specialist audiences, during the AAPT Winter Meeting. Recipients Past recipients of the award include \\"a long list of giants in the field of physics\\" such as UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau (1989); Steven Chu of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1990), who also is a UC Berkeley professor of physics and a physics Nobelist, and who has been the 12th United States Secretary of Energy since 2009; and physicists Charles Townes (1959), Emilio Segr√® (1957), J.

It was founded in 2011 by communist and socialist activists in an attempt to organise the people of the radical left in Cyprus. Due to internal disagreement between its various factions ERAS was eventually dissolved in 2014, with one faction forming the bi-communal group ŒîŒ°ŒëŒ£œÖ-Eyelem and participating in the Cypriot European Elections of the same year.Worker's Democracy (Newspaper), Issue 147, June - July 2014, page 10. Political Views ERAS identified itself as a communist political party. It claimed to hold a strong position in favor of the welfare state and supported the permanent nationalisation of the banking sector. It supported the reduction of Defense expenses and the duration of conscription in the National Guard. It held a strong anti-austerity position concerning the austerity measures agreed upon between the Troika and the government of Cyprus. It chose not to support any candidate in the 2013 presidential elections, stating that \\"within the current conditions, we should have had our own candidate in order to strongly express the ideas and strength of the radical left\\" but that \\"since ERAS is a recently founded committee, we deemed that we do not have at the moment the organisational capacity or the resources to undergo an electoral campaign\\". The Committee also stated that the AKEL-backed candidate, Stavros Malas, does not \\"guarantee in any way the defense of the interests of the people and the working class and promotes the delusion that it is possible in the conditions of this crisis to retain the social interest without opposition to the central decisions of the bourgeoisie.\\" ERAS has also stated support for the abolition of benefits of high-ranking state officials, the right to abortion, the decriminalisation of cannabis and the right of civil partnership recognition for homosexual couples. Activities New Internationalist Left protesting against austerity outside of the House of Representatives in Nicosia, in 2012. On 8 November 2012, ERAS organised the first protest against austerity and the Troika negotiations that were still taking place. Protesters were gathered outside the House of Representatives holding banners and shouting slogans against austerity. Leaflets with alternative proposals for the economy were distributed in the protest, with proposals including the nationalisation of banking, the reduction of the army and the freezing of the army budget, and the increase of the corporate tax. Members of the New Internationalist Left (NEDA) also participated in the protest.

CloudFS consists of a cluster file system called ASM Cluster File System (ACFS), and a cluster volume manager called ASM Dynamic Volume Manager (ADVM) initially released in August 2007.  Features  ACFS is a standard-based POSIX (Linux, UNIX) and Windows cluster file system with full cluster-wide file and memory mapped I/O cache coherency and file locking. ACFS provides direct I/O for Oracle database I/O workloads. ACFS implements indirect I/O however for general purpose files that typically perform small I/O for better response time. CloudFS is designed to scale to billions of files and supports very large file and file systems sizes (up to exabytes of storage). CloudFS is built on top of Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) and Oracle clustering technologies to provide cluster volume and file services to clients. ADVM and ACFS leverage ASM striping, mirroring and automatic I/O rebalancing features to manage volumes that are dynamically resizable. Starting with the latest release in Oracle Database 12c, ACFS supports Oracle database files as well as general purpose files. ACFS supports space efficient read-write snapshots, asynchronous file system replication, tagging for aggregate operations, fine grain security and encryption for higher security.

It had been one of the objects with the highest impact threat on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale.  Discovery  It was discovered on 24 January 2011, by a team of astronomers at Pan-STARRS, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System at Haleakala Observatory on Hawaii, United States. The discovery was made using a 1.8-meter Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope. At the time of discovery, the object had an apparent magnitude of 22.  Orbit  Before the 2013 recovery it had an observation arc of 41 days with an uncertainty parameter of 7. Due to precovery images from 2007 it now has an observation arc of more than 5 years. It makes close approaches to Earth and Mars. On 28 December 2013, it passed from Earth. The December 2013 passage was studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network and further refined the orbit. = Impact risk = While listed on the Sentry Risk Table, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 71,000 chance that the asteroid could impact Earth on 5 January 2080. In 2013 it had the 5th highest impact threat on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 17 June 2013. With a 2080 Palermo Technical Scale of ‚àí3.58, the odds of impact by in 2080 were about 3800 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. JPL Horizons shows that the nominal pass will be on 17 January 2080 at a distance of from Earth.  Physical characteristics  This near-Earth object is characterized as a common, stony S-type asteroid by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL). = Fast rotator = In January 2014, a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the CS3-Palmer Divide Station () in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 0.109138 hours (393 seconds) with a brightness amplitude of 0.61 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the CALL and JPL's impact-risk table, this near-Earth object measures 136 and 150 meters, respectively. For its size estimate, CALL uses a standard for stony asteroids of 0.20 with an absolute magnitude of 21.7.  Naming  As of 2017, this minor planet remains unnamed.

Controversy and confrontation In February 2012, Faraone debated conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart on WRKO, a talk radio station in Boston, over the legitimacy and motives of the Occupy movement. The exchange turned heated and a second debate was to follow, but Breitbart died shortly after the first debate. After Breitbart‚Äôs death, Faraone told the Boston Herald, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt miss Breitbart‚Äôs rhetoric, but I‚Äôm also not dumb enough to think that it will end with him. If anything, I found his hustle inspirational.‚Äù 99 Nights with the 99 Percent Faraone's first book, 99 Nights with the 99 Percent, features previously unpublished work, features, profiles, photos, illustrations and more about the Occupy movement. It was released in March 2012. The book was generally well received. The Economist published a review declaring the book to be \\"absolutely pro-Occupy,\\" while retaining critical perspective. Justin Peters, of the Columbia Journalism Review, wrote, \\"He has covered Occupy like a one-man swarm: embedding full-time at Boston‚Äôs Dewey Square encampment; visiting other movements around the country; juggling feature stories, blog posts, radio spots, and Twitter fights.\\" According to The Boston Globe, Faraone \\"spent more time at the encampment here than any journalist,\\" covering the Occupy movement. Heartbreak Hell In the weeks following the Boston Marathon bombings, Faraone released Heartbreak Hell, an ebook consisting of essays and unreported stories from Boston and the scenes of the attack. According to The Metro, the book \\"chronicles Faraone‚Äôs experiences reporting the attack on the marathon ‚Äî both as a journalist and a self-appointed Bostonian ‚Äî over many sleepless hours fueled, by his own admission, by a lot of drugs and a lot of heart.\\" Awards Faraone has won multiple awards for his reporting on a variety of subjects.

The genre of their music has also been referred to as post-rock and electronica. The band says their focus is on ‚Äúmelodies‚Äù and ‚Äúdark lyrics‚Äù; their name comes from the idea of alchemy creating gold from available materials, or in their case, music from diverse styles. History Hearts of Black Science was formed in November 2005 by two childhood friends: Daniel √Ñnghede (also vocalist in UK supergroup Crippled Black Phoenix) and Tomas Almgren (ex-horror movie director). In April 2006, the band released a self- financed EP with a limited run of 200 copies that sold out within just 2 months; a second EP was released the following month. The band was signed shortly after the A&R; scout from Club AC30 saw them performing their second gig ever at the Water Rats Theatre in London. The debut album The Ghost You Left Behind was released by the London-based label in the spring of 2007. It was also released in Japan as a special edition by Quince Records. The full- length album was accompanied by two singles: Empty City Lights and Driverlights. √Ñnghede left the band for a period while Almgren continued writing; he created the demos that together they made into their next album, The Star In The Lake, released on Swedish label Wonderland Records in 2009. Hearts of Black Science have toured in the U.K.; BBC radio invited the duo twice to perform live on air on the Gideon Coe and Tom Robinson shows. Their first two albums have been praised by both international press and their fans: Sweden's Zero Music Magazine gave the debut 9 / 10 and the follow up 8 / 10; U.S.-based Virus Magazine gave it 8 / 10. In 2013, the band released an EP named We Saw the Moon and also a digital album called B-Sides & Remixes collecting their B-sides and hard to find remixes along with several unreleased tracks. After several delays, the band released their third full- length album, Signal, on November 20, 2015 through Swedish label Progress Productions. The new album includes guest appearances by Chrysta Bell, Justin Greaves (of Crippled Black Phoenix), and Heike Langhans (of Draconian).

It was released on 27 May 2013 through Century Media Records. A music video for \\"Uniformity\\", directed by Patric Ullaeus, was released on 10 May 2013. The album was written during what the band described as their \\"darkest period\\" and drew critical praise for its melodrama and darkness. Construct would be the band's last studio album with founding member guitarist Martin Henriksson as he left the band in early 2016 due to loss of passion for playing music. Background Prior to recording the music for Construct, bassist Daniel Antonsson departed on amicable terms and guitarist Martin Henriksson (who originally played bass for Dark Tranquillity before switching to guitars beginning with Projector in 1999) filled in for the recording session. Mikael Stanne described Antonsson as \\"a great guy and an awesome musician\\" but acknowledged that he was not \\"on the same page\\" as the rest of the band due to his desire to be \\"like a band leader. He wants to be the one in charge, but there‚Äôs no way to be in charge in our band [as] we're all democratic and close to each other after playing together for so long\\". Two songs, \\"Sorrow's Architect\\" and \\"A Memory Construct\\", were recorded during the making of this album, but were instead released on the \\"A Memory Construct\\" limited tour single. Lyrics Stanne noted from where both the lyrical themes and the album title originated: In another interview, Stanne said \\"I want people to be sceptical and be able to think for themselves. The herd type of behaviour of many I find quite disturbing...I like people to be pure and unbiased and free any preconceptions when they encounter other people. The utter ignorance and bigotry of some people really gets to me\\".http://www.ghostcultmag.com/the-science-of-noise-an-interview-with-dark- tranquillity/ Niklas Sundin elaborated that \\"Our brains have evolved to find patterns and connections where there are none, but ‚Äì as they say ‚Äì extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I rarely want to talk about non-musical stuff in interviews, but as a science buff and skeptic I have to take the opportunity to recommend every UFO or conspiracy theorist to read Carl Sagan‚Äôs The Demon Haunted World\\".http://newnoisemagazine.com/interview-dark-tranquility-explain-the- blueprints-of-construct-and-the-possibility-of-alien-life/ Songwriting The songwriting process departed from Dark Tranquillity's typical method. Henriksson reduced his role in arranging the songs, while keyboardist Martin Brandstrom, guitarist Niklas Sundin, and drummer Anders Jivarp served as the principal songwriting team. Stanne commented about this method: Stanne attributed the album's sharp departure from previous albums to the band's struggle with \\"writer's block\\" and the alternate songwriting configuration that eventually enabled the band to create the new album: \\"The material we had was pretty emotional. It was written during this period where we were struggling...Most of the material was emotional and sad and heavy. That's what the album became. The stuff we wrote during our darkest period was put together in the most creative way we had done in many years.\\" Their previous album, We Are the Void had not been as positively received as their previous albums, and the group had experienced troubles in the creation of the album, such as in-fighting. The band commented on the style of the album, saying, \\"While still bearing the unmistakable mark of the Dark Tranquillity, the record is probably our most different and diverse offering since 1999's Projector\\". Mikael Stanne described the album as being both \\"melody driven\\" and a \\"reaction\\" to the band's recent work. Chad Bowar of About.com noted \\"the darkness and sadness in the composition of many of the songs\\", which he attributed to the more collaborative songwriting approach. However, Sundin stated in an interview that \\"Most likely, the upcoming 500 years will be a patchwork of great tragedy and suffering as well as major advance and improvement, just like the past 500 years have been. But metal lyrics are often about polarizing. You don‚Äôt sing about being mildly sceptical of a certain amount of people behaving in a slightly disagreeable way and that you would prefer if they please could consider changing their behaviour. You sing about throwing the whole of humanity in a sea of fire and brimstone and laughing while doing it\\". Reception Describing the band as \\"legendary\\", Chad Bowar of About.com remarked, \\"it's no surprise that Dark Tranquillity has delivered another quality album with Construct. It's one of their most creative and diverse releases in quite a few years.\\" James Christopher Monger of Allmusic noted that the album pulled back on the intensity in favour of an approach that \\"retains the chilly elegance of the band's best work while dialing back on the more punishing aspects, resulting in an expansive, world- weary, and windswept racket\\". Kyle Ward of Sputnikmusic compared Construct with the band's 1999 album Projector, due to the character of the experimentation, and praised the album's atmosphere as \\"the most palpable and poignant of their entire discography, due in large part to its focus on dark, melodramatic tones in the synths and the swift, tight melodies that make up the guitar leads\\". On 15 June 2013 the album entered the US Billboard 200 chart at number 171.http://www.billboard.com/charts/2013-06-15/billboard-200?page=8 Track listing All lyrics written by Mikael Stanne = Notes = # That song is an instrumental. # That song is from the We Are the Void reissue. # That song is from the We Are the Void reissue and the Zero Distance EP. # That song is a Radio Edit version of its original song.

Bland in Carnmoney in Ireland. It is credited as the first aeroplane to be designed and constructed by a woman. Background Lillian E. Bland was a sports journalist and photographer. While taking a series of colour photographs of birds on an island off the west coast of Scotland in 1909, she received a postcard bearing an illustration of the Bl√©riot XI aircraft. Already excited by the soaring flight of the gulls she was photographing, she was inspired by the postcard to attempt to construct her own aircraft. Design and development Mayfly schematics Lillian Bland started construction of the Mayfly in the stables of her home during 1909, after making a series of tests with large-scale model gliders. The Mayfly was an equal-span biplane resembling the Farman III in general layout, with a front- mounted elevator and a rear-mounted empennage carried on booms. The full size aircraft was first flown as a glider from Carnmoney Hill early in 1910, initially unmanned.Miss Lilian E. Bland's Biplane \\"Mayfly\\" Flight, 19 February 1910 and with an undercarriage consisting of a pair of skids. These tests being successful, modifications were made to enable an engine to be fitted, and at the same time ailerons were fitted on the rear interplane struts. Bland collected the Avro engine from the Avro works in Manchester in mid 1910. When first fitted she had not received the petrol tank, and initial ground trials were conducted by feeding petrol from a whisky bottle via her aunt's ear- trumpet, the only tubing to hand.The \\"Mayfly\\" Gets its Engine Flight 16 July 1910 Trials of the powered aircraft took place at the Deerpark in Randalstown. The completed Mayfly was a small pusher configuration equal span biplane. Ash was used for the wing spars and the skids, spruce for the ribs and interplane struts, bamboo for the booms carrying the elevator and tail surfaces and the engine mounting was American Elm.\\"The Bland Mayfly\\"Flight, 17 December 1910 The wings were covered in unbleached calico, which was laced to the wing structure, allowing it to be tightened when it stretched. Dope was not developed until 1911 It was powered by a air-cooled horizontally-opposed two- cylinder engine made by Avro, who also supplied the propeller and various metal fittings used.\\"The Bland Mayfly\\" Flight, 17 December 1910 The forward- mounted elevator was divided into two halves and carried on three pairs of converging booms: behind the wings two paired booms carried a small rectangular fixed tailplane with an elevator either side, and a small fin and rudder. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids bearing a pair of unsprung wheels upon which the aircraft rested: in front of these was a large nosewheel. Miss Bland wrote a detailed account of the Mayfly for Flight, where she estimates her expenses as totalling less than ¬£200, despite extensive rebuilding and having to replace the propeller, broken when a wire snapped. The power installation was responsible for most of her expenses: only ¬£3-4 was estimated as being necessary for wood, and around ¬£6 for the wheels. Sculpture of the Mayfly in the Lilian Bland Community Park, Glengormley The powered aircraft was first flown in August 1910, and was successfully used by Bland until early in 1911, when her father, concerned about her safety, offered to buy her a car if she gave up flying. In 2017, Sinead Morrisey recounts one of Bland's flights in her poem The Mayfly. Realising that the aircraft was underpowered and too frail to accept a larger engine, and having made her point that aeronautics was not a male preserve, she accepted the bribe. The engine was sold and the airframe given to a boy's club for use as a glider.Lilian Bland and the MayflyFlight International 23 January 1964 Glengormley Park in Newtonabbey was renamed Lillian Bland Community Park in August 2011; at the same time a stainless-steel sculpture of the Mayfly was unveiled.

She holds a cornucopia and a rudder affixed to the globe Fortuna Redux was a form of the goddess Fortuna in the Roman Empire who oversaw a return, as from a long or perilous journey. Her attributes were Fortuna's typical cornucopia, with her specific function represented by a rudder or steering oar sometimes in conjunction with a globe.Carlos F. Nore√±a, Imperial Ideals in the Roman West: Representation, Circulation, Power (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 140.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 157. Origins The cult of Fortuna Redux was introduced to Roman religion in 19 BC, creating a new holiday (feriae) on October 12 that originally marked the return of Augustus to Rome from Asia Minor in 19 BC. From that time, she received annual sacrifices from the pontiffs and Vestals at an altar dedicated to her (Ara Fortunae Reducis). After the death of Augustus, the holiday was known as the Augustalia, and was a major development in the complex of religious observances involving Imperial cult.John Scheid, \\"To Honour the Princeps and Venerate the Gods: Public Cult, Neighbourhood Cults, and Imperial Cult in Augustan Rome,\\" translated by Jonathan Edmondson, in Augustus (Edinburgh University Press, 2009), p. 288, and \\"Augustus and Roman Religion: Continuity, Conservatism, and Innovation,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Augustus (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 190. Places of worship The altar of Fortuna Redux was inaugurated on October 12, and dedicated on December 15.Scheid, \\"To Honour the Princeps,\\" pp. 288‚Äì289. It was probably adjacent to the Temple of Honor and Virtue near the Porta Capena. The altar is pictured on several coins, and appears to have been \\"relatively modest\\". Domitian built a temple for the goddess, following a triumphal return from war in Germany in 93 AD.Martial 8.65 The temple most likely stood on the slope of the Capitoline Hill overlooking the Porta Triumphalis. It has been identified with a temple on a panel depicting an arrival ceremony (adventus) on the Arch of Marcus Aurelius. The pictured temple has symbols of Fortuna in the pediment, and a tetrastyle and prostyle design of the Corinthian order. There is some possibility that it is the tetrastyle temple on a fragment of the Severan Marble Plan. Coins indicate that the cult statue was standing, and held the rudder and cornucopia that are her usual attributes. Cult Fortuna Redux was widely disseminated in the Western Empire as the tutelary of the emperor's safe return to the city when he traveled abroad, an event that reaffirmed Rome as the center of the Imperial world.Nore√±a, Imperial Ideals in the Roman West, pp. 138, 140. In Cirta, Numidia, an inscription preserved a dedication to Fortuna Redux Augusta by a local official, with the epithet Augusta marking the goddess's relation to Imperial cult..Nore√±a, Imperial Ideals in the Roman West, p. 261. She was the most common manifestation of Fortuna depicted on Imperial coins. In 211 AD, for instance, coinage with Fortuna Redux commemorated the return of Caracalla and Geta from Britannia.Erika Manders, Coining Images of Power: Patterns in the Representation of Roman Emperors on Imperial Coinage, A.D. 193‚Äì284 (Brill, 2012), p. 249. She also appears on coins issued by Septimius Severus, Gallienus, and other emperors.Manders, Coining Images of Power, p. 301. Although her cult was established as part of state religion in Rome, the goddess received personal devotion from individuals elsewhere in the Empire, as indicated by inscriptions in fulfillment of a vow (votum) expressing gratitude for a safe return. An inscription from Glanum records a votive altar dedicated by a military veteran of the Legio XXI Rapax for Fortuna Redux along with the Celtic deities Glanis and the Glanicae.AE 1954, 0103; see also 1959, 0009.

They are situated in Ma≈Çopolska Province, at the western tip of the long Carpathian range extending east beyond the Dunajec River for some . The Gorce are characterized by numerous ridges reaching in all directions for up to with a series of higher elevations cut by deep river valleys. The range is dominated by about a dozen gentle peaks including Turbacz (the highest, at above sea level) in the centre, and ‚Äì facing east: Jaworzyna Kamienicka (), Kiczora (), Kud≈Ço≈Ñ (), Przys≈Çop, Czo≈Ço and Gorc Kamienicki. The south-eastern ridge of the Gorce reaches the Pieniny range (cut off by the Ochotnica pass), with Luba≈Ñ () as its tallest peak followed by Pasterski Wierch, Runek and Marsza≈Çek. The north-west ridges include Obidowiec, and the peak of Suhora (1,000 m (3,300 ft)) featuring an astronomical observatory owned and operated by the Pedagogical University of Krak√≥w. There are a number of smaller caves in the Gorce, carved out in sedimentary rock and its conglomerates which form the Carpathian Flysch Belt. High annual rainfall is caused by the air forced up by the mountains and accumulating into clouds. Rain water flows fast in all directions due to dense ground and ; feeding the Raba river on the north-west side of the Gorce, and the Dunajec on the south-east side. Other rivers, formed by the mountains include the Kamienica ( in length), the Ochotnica () and the Porƒôbianka (), as well as large streams such as the Turbacz, the Gorcowy and the ≈Åopuszna among others. The main city is Nowy Targ on the Dunajec below in the valley of Podhale, with large recreational villages including Kro≈õcienko nad Dunajcem, Szczawa and Ochotnica. Geography A Lynx in Gorce National Park A Fire salamander in its natural habitat Part of the Gorce Mountains are protected within Gorce National Park (), a bird sanctuary and a biodiversity conservation area designated in 1981 by the Ma≈Çopolska Province, with strictly protected zone covering 3,611 hectares, out of the total park area of , in the highest part of the Gorce. Wildlife include almost 50 mammal species, with wolf and lynx at the top; less frequent brown bear, and lutra (rare European otter), as well as marten and badger often found digging under pasture fields. The Hazel and the Forest dormouse along with the Edible dormouse are all strictly protected. There are over 200 Red deer counted in the park area, as well as Roe deer and Wild boar, fox, wildcat, hare, skunk, and stoat (the ermine). Reptiles and amphibians include the fire salamander (, the only amphibian (one of two Salamandridae) that give birth to fully formed offspring at high elevations; the symbol of the Park), as well as over ninety species of breeding birds including owl, eagle, hawk, grouse, black stork and others. In the Gorce, there are hundreds of species of plants, including Alpine and Subalpine plants, which grow in meadows and open areas. Forests cover about 65% of the mountains, in four distinct levels according to elevation. The most common species of trees are beech, spruce and fir, with the average age of up to 100 years. The Gorce landscape has been altered by human activity. Early settlers appeared in the Gorce area in the 12th century. The first monastery was erected in Lud≈∫mierz by Cisterian monks in 1234. During the reign of Casimir III the Great (Kazimierz Wielki) the first castles were built, including in Czorsztyn, and more new settlements, such as town of Kro≈õcienko (1348) and villages: Kluszkowce (1307), Grywa≈Çd (1330), and Tylmanowa (1336), were established along the border with Kingdom of Hungary, followed by increased commercial logging and transport. However, the Gorce forests suffered most in the 19th century during the imperial rule of Austria-Hungary. Trees were cut on a large scale, especially in easily accessible areas. The Gorce Mountains are a popular tourist area, with forty well-marked trails for hiking trips two-to-four hours long, split into different levels of difficulty with the maximum distance of (Raba Ni≈ºna-Turbacz Trail, which is twice the average length). Notably, the colors of trail blazes (signs, installed by PTTK for hikers and skiers alike) do not imply levels of difficulty, but rather primary and secondary trails with different length and orientation, for example: the red and blue colors signify trails in east-west and north-south directions, while shortest loops generally use yellow blazes. # 24px Red, the longest trail, traversing the entire range: from easternmost Kro≈õcienko nad Dunajcem, to Rabka-Zdr√≥j at its western end. # 24px Blue trails, from Snozka Pass (Prze≈Çƒôcz Snozka) in the south, to Kamienica (north). # 24px Green trails, from Tylmanowa, Nied≈∫wied≈∫, Nowy Targ (district capital) across the highest peaks (Turbacz, Luba≈Ñ). # 24px Yellow trails, from Ochotnica G√≥rna, Porƒôba Wielka, Raba Ni≈ºna to PTTK mountain chalets usually. # 24px Black trails; from Szczawa, Lubomierz, ≈Åopuszna, Mszana Dolna, Rabka-Zdr√≥j across various meadows and passes.

A Republican, she also served as Secretary of Administration under James G. Martin, 1985‚Äì87. Early life and education Rohrer was born Grace Jemison on June 14, 1924, in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were Howard A. Jemison and the former Caroline Elmore Bishop. Rohrer attended high school in Cranford, New Jersey, then graduated from Western Maryland College with a B.A. degree in 1946. She would return to school later in life after her first husband died and receive her M.A. from Wake Forest University in 1969. Early career Rohrer became an elementary school teacher after graduating from Western Maryland College. She excelled in arts promotion in Forsyth County, North Carolina, being a member of the Winston-Salem Symphony Guild. She also served as a singer and choir member for St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Winston-Salem as well as the Singers' Guild in Winston-Salem. Political career Rohrer became active in civic affairs while in Winston-Salem and in the 1960s started working with local Republican party committees. Rohrer ran for a seat on the Forsyth County School Board as a Republican, but lost. She moved up in party hierarchy over time, even getting her father involved: Howard Jemison served several terms in the North Carolina House of Representatives for Forsyth County. In the early 1970s, there was a growing split in the North Carolina Republican Party between supporters of James Holshouser and James Gardner for governor in 1972. Rohrer, a Holshouser supporter, was beat out for the chairmanship of the party by Gardner supporter Frank Rouse. Rohrer then became vice chairman of the party and during 1972 was interim chair when Rouse decided to temporarily step aside to campaign for Gardner. She was instrumental in helping resolve the rift between the two party factions. Her first try for statewide office also came in 1972. That year, Rohrer ran for North Carolina Secretary of State. She would wind up losing to long-time Democratic incumbent Thad A. Eure in the general election, 55.92%‚Äì44.08%. Actively encouraging more women to participate in politics, she became one of three candidates short-listed for the Nixon administration's choice for Treasurer of the United States in 1974. Francine Irving Neff was chosen for that position. =Secretary of Cultural Resources= After she lost the race for Secretary of State, newly elected governor Jim Holshouser decided to choose Rohrer to be head of the Department of Art, Culture and History. He also set about a program of government reorganization and renamed the department to be the Department of Cultural Resources. She served in the position from January 5, 1973 to January 10, 1977. Upon her appointment to the position, Rohrer became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level position in North Carolina. During her time in office, she created the Grassroots Arts Program, which helps bring arts programs to all 100 counties of North Carolina. This program still exists and is managed by the North Carolina Arts Council. After leaving office, she became active in several community projects and was hired as an executive at Duke University. In between her serving as DCR Secretary and the North Carolina Secretary of Administration, she also served as an instructor at Salem College and as an executive with the American Musical Theater Center in Durham, North Carolina. =Secretary of Administration= When a Republican next won the governorship of North Carolina, it was James G. Martin who appointed Rohrer as his Secretary of Administration (another state cabinet-level post). She had just previously been a director at the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television. After leaving office, she took a position with Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, in 1988, serving there until 1994. =Women's rights= Rohrer had been a lifelong proponent of both the arts and women's rights. She was very vocal in her support for North Carolina's passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, testifying before state legislative committees in support of the amendment. North Carolina did not, however, ratify the amendment. She was active in creating the Women's Forum of North Carolina in 1976 and, the next year, she led North Carolina's delegation to the National Women's Conference held in Houston. Personal life Rohrer was married to Robert H. Rohrer who was a business executive and had three sons with him. He died in 1964, leaving Grace Rohrer to raise the three children alone. She later married Don Huff and moved to Kennebunk, Maine with him until he died. She died on October 12, 2011, at her home in Boone. Awards In 1989, Rohrer received a Distinguished Women of North Carolina Award from the North Carolina Department of Administration and the North Carolina Council on the Status of Women. Governor Jim Martin presented the award. ReferencesExternal links  Grace J.

His work has focused on malaria; however he has worked with other agents as well. In particular, he is interested in understanding within host genetic diversity of malaria infections, as each infection may contain multiple genetically different parasite strains, and the impact of this diversity on drug and vaccine efficacy. His work in this area has called into question some of the current practices of how clinical trials for malaria are conducted. He has been the recipient of several awards including the Merle A.

The workshop was part of the Natural History Museum, and later was called La Specola. The first modeler was Giuseppe Ferrini. Susini joined the wax-modelling workshop in 1773. He was given medical direction by Fontana. Susini had become the chief modeler at the workshop by 1782. His work included models of animals as well as of human anatomy. In 1780 Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, brother of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, visited the museum. He was profoundly impressed by the models, perceiving the value they would provide to students of medicine, and ordered a set of models. The work was undertaken between 1781 and 1786, and consisted of about 1000 wax sculptures. The models were based in part on anatomical drawings, in part on corpses dissected by anatomists such as Felice Fontana and Paolo Mascagni. These were carried by a train of hundreds of mules to Vienna, where they were exhibited at the \\"Josephinum\\", the Museum of the Medical University of Vienna. They still may be seen there. As the result of the Austrian commission, Susini's work became much in demand from surgeons and anatomists. Susini organized his workshop to produce large volumes of models, which were shipped throughout Italy and beyond. The use of iron supports rather than natural skeletons let the workshop produce models more quickly and economically than other workshops. In 1799 Susina was appointed a professor at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence, where he taught the drawing of nudes, while continuing to run his workshop. He was employed by the anatomist Paolo Mascagni to model Mascagni's many discoveries of the anatomy of the lymphatic system. Susini died in 1814. He had made or overseen the production of more than 2,000 models. Of these, the Josephinum in Vienna holds 1,192 wax models in six rooms. Another major collection, formerly held by the University of Cagliari, is now held by the Museo archeologico nazionale in the Piazza Arsenale of Cagliari, Sardinia, where they are on display in a pentagonal room. Work The \\"Venerina\\", displayed in the Museum of Palazzo Poggi, Bologna Susini's models present anatomy, as understood at the time, in a highly realistic form. Some of his figures are also quite artistic sculptures. His obituary praised him for \\"the beauty which he gave to the most revolting things.\\" In 1780 his models drew praise for their accuracy from Adolph Murray, professor of anatomy at Uppsala University, while the neo-classical sculptor Antonio Canova praised them for their artistic merit. Georges Didi-Huberman considered that Susini's V√©nus anatomique was more an artistic masterpiece than a medical one. The Venerina (\\"little Venus\\"), at the Anatomy and Obstetrics Museum in the Palazzo Poggi, Bologna, is a sensual model of the body of a young pregnant woman whose trunk holds removable layers that reveal her internal organs. Another group of models held in Bologna show the hearing and lymphatic systems. Some of Susini's most important works are in Cagliari, created from dissections by the anatomist Francesco Antonio Boi of the University of Cagliari. They highlight the nerves and, unlike Susini's less accurate earlier models, do not show lymphatic vessels in the brain. It is clear that Susini and Boi worked closely together to ensure a high level of anatomical accuracy. The Cagliari models, with their expressive faces, are also artistic masterpieces.

It was founded in 1962 by Frieda Rapoport Caplan. It was the first wholesale produce company in the United States to be founded, owned, and operated by a woman. Caplan died on January 18, 2020, at the age of 96. Frieda's Inc. is credited with introducing many produce items to the U.S. including the kiwifruit, alfalfa sprouts, spaghetti squash, jicama, shallots, mangos, Donut¬Æ peaches, and various Asian and Latin specialties. History In 1956, Frieda Caplan first worked as a bookkeeper at Giumarra Bros. Fruit Co. Later on, she began selling Brown Mushrooms, which were a specialty item in those days. After the success of selling mushrooms, Caplan opened her own company in 1962 with mushrooms as the primary item. She started with a small stand at the Los Angeles wholesale produce market. Once titled the ‚ÄúQueen of Kiwi,‚Äù Caplan gained international recognition from bringing the Kiwifruit to the United States. This fruit was discovered in New Zealand and originally known as \\"Chinese gooseberries\\". Although some in the U.S.A. believe Caplan renamed this fruit after the country's flightless bird, the Kiwi, the name was actually proposed by New Zealander Jack Turner in June 1959 at a management meeting of Turners and Growers in Auckland, New Zealand. She convinced California growers to plant the fruit and soon California had more than 700 Kiwifruit growers. She played a key role in popularizing Kiwifruit in the United States by convincing supermarket produce managers to carry the odd-looking fruit. Caplan's elder daughter, Karen Caplan, was promoted to President and CEO in 1986. That same year the company had annual sales of $US13 million. Jackie Caplan Wiggins, Frieda's younger daughter, serves as Vice President and Business Chief Operating Officer. In 1990, Karen Caplan and Jackie Caplan Wiggins became owners of Frieda's, Inc. In that same year, the name of the company changed from Frieda‚Äôs Finest/Produce Specialties Inc. to Frieda‚Äôs Inc. As of 2019 one of Karen Caplan's daughters, Alex Berkley, joined the firm as a sales manager. In 2015, the film Fear No Fruit was released. The film chronicles Caplan's influence on American cuisine. Products Frieda's Inc. distributes more than 600 exotic produce and specialty gourmet items to grocery stores and foodservice distributors. Hundreds of the products are labeled with detailed descriptions, usage and handling tips, and offers for free recipes via mail or email. Frieda's, Inc. has a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. For every consumer complaint, the company will issue a full refund, plus postage to any customer who is dissatisfied with Frieda's products.

It was completed in 1935. An addition to the west was completed in 1940. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 2008. The courthouse was designed to house the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama and the United States Customs Service. The customs service later vacated the building and the courts expanded into their space. This building replaced an earlier antebellum-era structure that served the city and region. The building is built in an austere blending of the Renaissance Revival and Art Deco styles. The fa√ßade is clad in white limestone with a granite base. History Construction of the John Archibald Campbell United States Courthouse began in 1934 on the north half of a city block facing Saint Joseph Street, then adjacent to the 1916 United States Post Office building. The block is encircled by Saint Joseph, Saint Louis, North Conception, and Saint Michael streets. Having a monumental scale and finer materials than most of the surrounding structures, this ensemble created a strong presence for the federal government in downtown Mobile. The new courthouse building was designed by the Mobile architectural firm of Carey and Dowling, with Louis A. Simon as the federal Supervising Architect. Initial construction was completed in 1935. A new expansion of the building to the west was built between 1939 and 1940. It was designed the Office of the Supervising Architect under Simon to seamlessly match the existing structure. =Prior building= The old United States Custom House and Post Office building in Mobile during 1894. The new courthouse replaced an earlier United States Custom House and Post Office building that was located at the corner of Saint Joseph and Saint Francis streets. It was a three-story, granite, Neo-Renaissance structure, designed by renowned architect Ammi B. Young. Completed in 1856, this building originally housed the custom house, post office, and federal courthouse. The United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of Alabama met in the old building until that court was replaced by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in 1912. It then housed that court until the new courthouse was completed in 1935. The post office relocated in 1916, when the new post office building was completed. The old Custom House and Post Office was demolished in 1963 and the First National Bank Building was built on the site. Architecture The courthouse in 1935, prior to the 1939‚Äì40 expansion to the rear (west). The courthouse features a blending of the Renaissance Revival and Art Deco styles. The east fa√ßade, which is the primary elevation, is divided thirteen bays on every floor except the fifth, which has eleven. The north elevation originally featured ten bays on the first through fourth floors and eight on the fifth. The 1940 expansion brought this number up to eighteen bays on the first through fourth floors and seventeen bays on the fifth. The first floor on this elevation has a bronze gate that takes up three of the bays, with windows set into the remainder. A bronze gate is situated at the point where the 1940 expansion starts. It originally provided access to a central light courtyard. The first floor is separated from the upper floors by a molded projecting course of stone that runs horizontally around the building. It is relatively devoid of ornament, with doors set into the central three bays. Granite steps with cheek walls lead to the entry. Stylized Ionic pilasters on the exterior of the second and third floors separate each bay. The center five bays of these floors are recessed with windows that have carved limestone panels underneath each. Solid panels are substituted for windows in each bay to either side. Each of these solid panels feature a carved limestone plaque and a bronze flagpole projecting from the fa√ßade. The windows on these floors are separated vertically by spandrel panels cast from bronze. They feature fluted panels on each side of a vine motif. The fourth floor is stepped back atop the lower floors. Each bay here is separated by a simple limestone pilaster. The fifth floor is devoid of ornament and is stepped back from the fourth floor. Significant interior spaces in the building that still have their original characteristics include the main lobby, entry vestibule, the second floor west courtroom, second floor lobby, judge's suite, and second floor east courtroom lobby. The main lobby, entry vestibule, and flanking hallway are all Art Deco in style, with walls clad in corbeled travertine. Corbeled pilasters decorate the wall surfaces. The ceilings are corbeled plaster. Doors are walnut. Floors are terrazzo, accented with a white and pink double marble border. The second floor west courtroom and judge's suite are notable for their walnut woodwork. The second floor east courtroom lobby also features wood paneling and terrazzo floors.

He maintained his father's extravagant lifestyle while immersing himself in Torah study and mysticism. He was considered the greatest Rebbe of his era,Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 28. attracting hundreds of thousands of Jews as well as prominent Christian leaders to his court. Early life Avrohom Yaakov Friedman was born in the town of Ruzhyn, Ukraine to Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn (1797‚Äì1851), founder of the Ruzhiner dynasty, and his wife, Sarah. He was the second of six sons and had four sisters.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 18. He married Miriam, the daughter of Rabbi Aharon of Karlin.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 22. As Rebbe In 1840 the Ruzhiner Rebbe was forced to flee Russia due to persecution by the Tsar. He moved his family to the town of Sadigura, Bukovina, in Austria (Carpathian Mountains). The Ruzhiner Rebbe lived in Sadigura for ten years, building a palatial home and a large synagogue and attracting tens of thousands of Hasidim.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 15. (footnote 24) When the Ruzhiner Rebbe died at the age of 54 on 9 October 1850, each of his sons moved to different towns to establish their own courts. His eldest son, Rabbi Sholom Yosef Friedman (1813‚Äì1851), remained in Sadigura to continue leading the court his father had founded, but died ten months later. At this point, the Ruzhiner Rebbe's second son,Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20.

The Sadigura Rebbe maintained the extravagant lifestyle of his father's court, with its lavish accoutrements and showy dress, and also immersed himself in the mysticism of Kabbalah, as did his father. This combination of earthly royalty and spiritual depth attracted both Jews and Christians to his court.Ewen, Isaac. \\"The Golden Dynasty: Rebbe of Sadeger\\", in The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe, Lucy S. Dawidowicz, ed. Syracuse University Press, 1967, pp. 195‚Äì196. Hundreds of thousands of Jews sought his wisdom and counsel. He was admired and visited by many of the great Torah scholars and rebbes of his generation, including Rabbi Yitzchok of Vurka, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (the first Gerrer Rebbe), the sons of Rabbi Mordechai Twersky of Chernobyl, and the disciples of the Chozeh of Lublin and the Sar Shalom of Belz. The Rebbe also entertained visits from prominent Christians, including princes, counts, and writers who published articles about him in newspapers in Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Prague, and other cities.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 30. In the 1870s he received a visit from Laurence Oliphant, who wanted to establish a fund to buy Palestine from the Ottoman Empire for the purpose of Jewish colonization. Oliphant believed that the Rebbe was the \\"leader of world Jewry\\" and could help him. The Rebbe demurred, saying that he was a Turkish citizen living on a Turkish passport.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 30‚Äì31. Theodor Herzl, the visionary of a Jewish state, visited the Rebbe in Sadigura and suggested that the \\"Wonder Rebbe\\" move to Palestine to serve as its spiritual leader. In his diary entry of June 16, 1896, Herzl described his vision of the Jewish state as \\"a destination for the civilized world which will come to visit as it now visits...Sadigura\\". The Rebbe rejected Herzl and his ideas.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 358. The Sadigura Rebbe was widely known and respected for his wisdom, intellect, and witty speech. Presiding as he did over a court filled with beauty and splendor, giving inspiration to the downtrodden Jews of Galicia, Romania and Ukraine,Brayer, The House of Rizhin, pp. 358‚Äì359. the Rebbe aroused the envy of the local maskilim, who sought to topple him as they had done his father. In 1856, the maskilim defamed him to the authorities, claiming he was in partnership with a Jewish forger taken into custody by police. The forger was in possession of a letter from the Rebbe blessing him in all his endeavors. The Rebbe was incarcerated for 15 months in a damp, cold cell with scanty food, seriously damaging his health. Upon his release, his brothers and Hasidim staged massive prayer sessions for him. One young Hasid, Mordechai Mishel of Linsk, offered to take on the Rebbe's illness in return for a share in the World to Come. The Hasid fell ill that evening and died shortly after, while the Rebbe's health improved and he lived for many more years.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 22‚Äì25.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 357. The Sadigura Rebbe encouraged and abetted Jews to settle in the Holy Land. He chaired the Kolel Vohlin and completed the fund- raising for the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue, the Ruzhiner synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem initiated by and named after his father. The synagogue was completed in 1872.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, pp. 260-263.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 11‚Äì12. He also purchased the privilege of lighting the main bonfire at the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in Meron, Israel on Lag BaOmer from the Sephardi guardians of Meron and Safed. The Sadigura Rebbe bequeathed this honor to his surviving eldest son, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman, the first Boyaner Rebbe, and his progeny. Final years and legacy In 1881 the Sadigura Rebbe lost his eldest son, Rabbi Shlomo Friedman (1843‚Äì1881) and, two years later, his son-in-law, Rabbi Nochum Ber (1843‚Äì1883), both promising young men. Long accustomed to eating a minimal diet, the Rebbe stopped eating altogether and died on September 12, 1883 (11 Elul 5643). His yahrtzeit coincided with that of his elder brother, Rabbi Sholom Yosef, who died on 11 Elul thirty-two years earlier.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, pp. 357‚Äì358. He was buried in the same plot as his father, the Ruzhiner Rebbe, and his brother, Rabbi Dov Ber of Lieov (1822‚Äì1876), in Sadigura.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 16.Assaf, The Regal Way, pp. 323‚Äì324. After his death, his two sons, Rabbi Yitzchok (1850‚Äì1917) and Rabbi Yisrael (1852‚Äì1907), assumed joint leadership of their father's Hasidim. Although they were content with this arrangement, many of the Sadigura Hasidim preferred to have one Rebbe, and in 1887, the brothers agreed to draw lots to determine who would stay in Sadigura and who would move out. The lots fell to Rabbi Yisrael to remain as the second Sadigura Rebbe, while Rabbi Yitzchok moved to the neighboring town of Boiany (Boyan) and established his court there, becoming the first Boyaner Rebbe.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 76.

Contributions to poetry Called \\"the Emily Dickinson of the 20th Century\\" by Chad Walsh, distinguished poet and writer, in The Saturday Review,Walsh, Chad. \\"Cadence for Our Time,\\" Saturday Review, Vol. 48, Jan. 2, 1965, pp. 28-30.Commendations from letters, pre-publication correspondence, and other records and documentation preserved in the Elizabeth Bartlett Collection, Archive for New Poetry, Mandeville Department of Special Collections, University of California, San Diego. Elizabeth Bartlett's concise lyrics have been praised by Allen Tate, William Stafford, Ted Weiss, Maxine Kumin, Josephine Jacobsen, and Robert M. Hutchins, among others, and commended by musicians and composers. Bartlett is a widely recognized poet, the author of 16 published books of her own poetry and more than 1,000 individually published poems, as well as essays, short stories, collections of poetry edited by her, and poetry translations by her from other languages.Elizabeth Bartlett Collection held by Rare Books, Archives and Special Collections, University of Louisville . She has gained international attention for her many publications, the creation of a new form of poetry, the twelve-tone poem, and as founder of the international non-profit organization, Literary Olympics, Inc., which has sought to reinstate the role of literature in the Olympic Games as originally conceived by the Greeks. = Bartlett's poetry = Bartlett's poetry is lyrical, disciplined in structure, expressing a heightened consciousness of word sounds and symbolism, and infused with \\"delicate nuance, a sort of reticent and abstracted reverie that could nevertheless, at its best, be extremely moving.... [Her poetry] bucked the trend in modern literature toward the precise and realistic description of detail and the confessional flavor....\\"Webb, J. F.. \\"Bartlett's Poetic Legacy Will Be Felt for Decades to Come,\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune, Sept. 6, 1994, p. E-3. = Twelve-tone poems = Bartlett created and developed the twelve- tone form of poetry, adapting Arnold Schoenberg's musical system to the verbal, accented sounds of language. Twelve-Tone Poems, her first book that introduced this form, was published in 1968.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Twelve-tone Poems. Santa Barbara, CA: Sun Press, 1968. In Bartlett's words: \\"The 12-tone poem is a new form.... It was inspired by Arnold Schoenberg's musical system. The poem consists of 12 lines, divided into couplets. Each couplet contains 12 syllables, using the natural cadence of speech. The accented sounds of the words are considered tones. Only 12 tones are used throughout the poem, repeated various times. As a result, the poem achieves a rare harmony that is purely lyrical, enriching its imagery and meaning.\\"Bartlett, Elizabeth. Around the Clock. Laurinburg, NC: St. Andrews Press, 1989, p. iv. About this work, Allen Tate wrote: \\"The new form is most interesting, the poems quite beautiful and distinguished.\\" Encouraged by this and other commendatory responses to her twelve-tone poems by poets, musicians, and composers including Stephen Sondheim, Bartlett continued to develop the new form. The House of Sleep, published in 1975, was the result, consisting of 68 poems related to dreams and written in the new form.Bartlett, Elizabeth. The House of Sleep. Colima, Mexico: Autograph Editions, 1975. Of these poems, William Stafford wrote: \\"There is a trancelike progression in these poems, in which all unfolds quietly, with a steady holding of a certain pervasive tone.\\"Commendation from book cover: Bartlett, Elizabeth. The House of Sleep. Colima, Mexico: Autograph Editions, 1975. Robert M. Hutchins wrote: \\"I am much impressed. The poems seem to me what is called an important contribution, and a beautiful one.\\" A third collection of twelve-tone poems, In Search of Identity, was published in 1977,Bartlett, Elizabeth. In Search of Identity. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1977. further establishing the diversity and versatility of ways in which Bartlett was able to make use of the new form. A fourth collection of twelve-tone poems was published in 1981, Memory Is No Stranger.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Memory Is No Stranger. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 1981. = Literary Olympics = In her mission to bring the work of leading poets to public awareness, Bartlett founded the international non-profit organization, Literary Olympics, Inc. Like Marianne Moore, \\"Bartlett ... [was] a member of that small group of men and women who, during this century, have furthered the art of others at no small cost to themselves in time, money and sleepless nights. People such as Harriet Monroe, whose small journal Poetry furthered the careers of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot; Sylvia Beach, owner of the Paris bookstore Shakespeare and Company, who championed James Joyce in the face of the most rabid censors; Edward Marsh, the much-pilloried editor of the Georgian Poetry anthologies; and others.\\" Until her death in 1994, Elizabeth Bartlett devoted twelve years to this project whose goal was to reinstate the role of literature, and specifically of poetry, in the Olympic Games as originally implemented by the Greeks.Perrottet, Tony. The Naked Olympics: The True Story of the Ancient Games. New York: Random House, 2004. To this end, she served as founder and CEO of Literary Olympics, Inc., an international non-profit project that brought together every four years in conjunction with the summer Olympic Games a published anthology containing the work of leading poets from many countries. She coordinated and directed the work of associate editors in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, East, North, and West Europe, Great Britain, Latin America, and the United States. The first Literary Olympics poetry anthology was published in 1984 to coincide with the Games of the XXIII Olympiad held in Los Angeles, and included the work of poets from nine countries.Bartlett, Elizabeth (Poetry Ed.). Literary Olympians: 1984. Westlake Village, CA: Crosscurrents, 1984. The publication of the second anthology, to coincide with the 1988 Olympic Games held in Seoul, South Korea, grew to represent more than 30 nations.Bartlett, Elizabeth (Poetry Ed.). Literary Olympians II. Westlake Village, CA: Crosscurrents, 1987. By 1992, coinciding with the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the Literary Olympics anthology had grown to represent 132 poets from 65 countries and 55 languages.Bartlett, Elizabeth (Ed.). Literary Olympians 1992: An International Anthology. Boston: Ford-Brown & Co., 1992. Second printing, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000. These anthologies shared the intent to recognize and to honor the creative work of the world's leading poets in a way that was true to the original spirit of the Greek Olympic Games. Each volume was published in a multi-language format, with non-English poems translated into English by well-qualified poetry translators. Recognition and importance Bartlett's poetry came to the attention of leading poets, writers, and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark Van Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert Hillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard Eberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins, Kenneth Rexroth, William Stafford, and others. Over the years, Bartlett maintained an active and extensive correspondence with eminent poets, writers, and literary critics; evident throughout this collected literary correspondence are strong statements attesting to the importance of her work. About her first book of poetry, Poems of Yes and No, published in 1952,Bartlett, Elizabeth. Poems of Yes and No. Mexico City: Editorial Jus, 1952. Marianne Moore wrote: \\"I surely find good in the Poems of Yes and No.... The clearness of the book is certainly beautiful.\\" Wallace Stevens was impressed by Poems of Yes and No and wrote: \\"Your poems give one a sense of intelligence and sensibility.\\" Alfred Kreymborg was enthusiastic about the book: \\"You have found a style of your own and developed it. I say yes to your poems of yes and no. This is a distinguished volume as a whole. I wish you well with this warm book. Any poet might envy the courage and artistry of what you say, or rather sing, there.\\" Further commendation came from Robert Hillyer, who wrote: \\"Your poems are moving and unusual.... A distinguished achievement!\\" A few years later, Moore took it upon herself to submit Bartlett's second book manuscript, Behold This Dreamer, to John Ciardi, then editor of Twayne. Although Ciardi judged the poems to be \\"taking and moving poems,\\" Twayne turned the work down because the publisher felt the book of poetry would not be commercially profitable. Ciardi wrote \\"corn flakes being easier to sell than a good book of poems.\\" Moore then wrote about Behold This Dreamer: \\"I believe in ability. It always belies annoyance.\\" Despite this initial response, Behold This Dreamer was published in 1959.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Behold This Dreamer. Mexico City: Editorial Jus, 1959. By 1961, Jonathan Williams was saying: \\"Your language is cultivated, employed consistently and lucidly. To my observation, it seems fair to say that you belong with the best of your generation, which I would say includes May Swenson, Denise Levertov, Garrigue, et al.\\" Louis Untermeyer added his voice: \\"I particularly like your fusion of observation and whimsicality, as well as your avoidance of the poetic stereotypes.\\" Rolfe Humphries was intrigued by Bartlett's poetic techniques: \\"I enjoyed your poems and admire many....\\" About Behold This Dreamer, Gustav Davidson wrote: \\"I enjoyed reading these poems. I was impressed by their precision, clarity, and technical competence.\\" About the same work, critic Paul Jordan-Smith wrote: \\"Your poems were begotten of a strong, imaginative sense. My congratulations on this beautiful collection.\\" Behold This Dreamer was followed by the publication of Poetry Concerto, also in 1961.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Poetry Concerto. Vagrom Chap Book No. 7. Flushing, NY: Sparrow, 1961. Meanwhile, Bartlett had published more than 200 poems in literary reviews and anthologies, and felt encouraged to bring out a collection of her poetry. She sent the manuscript of the new work to Moore, who wrote: \\"You have here what is indeed a conspectus of experience, and I thank you for the book. It seems an anomaly that it is not in 'hard covers,' in shops where all might buy. This must be corrected. As I may have said before, you must not be acquiescent under neglect, nor deterred by polite evasion or any kind of inability to make headway.\\" This collection, titled It Takes Practice Not to Die, was published soon after, in 1964.Bartlett, Elizabeth. It Takes Practice Not to Die. Santa Barbara, CA: Van Riper & Thompson, 1964. For the book cover, Marianne Moore offered this comment: \\"The poems are the result of a discipline that assuredly justifies the writer, and should console the right readers (if anything can).\\"Commendation from book cover: Bartlett, Elizabeth. It Takes Practice Not to Die. Santa Barbara, CA: Van Riper & Thompson, 1964. From the beginning, Richard Eberhart expressed his admiration for Bartlett's work: \\"You have a fresh, swift, lyrical impulse.\\" About It Takes Practice Not to Die, he wrote: \\"I have read these poems with pleasure.... [M]ature, they have a bite to them.\\" Praising the same book, Mark Van Doren wrote: \\"These poems are clear, swift, and strong; and witty, too, in the best sense of that word.\\" James Schevill added: \\"I have read your book and there is no doubt of your ability as a poet. Time and again, you strike off a powerful line!\\" Twelve-Tone Poems, published in 1968, introduced the new twelve-tone form of poetry. It was followed by the publication of Threads, also in 1968.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Threads. Santa Barbara, CA: Unicorn Press, 1968. Conrad Aiken wrote: \\"I like the poems; they think, and they mean what they say.\\" About this book, Kenneth Rexroth wrote: \\"It is certainly an impressive work.\\" The House of Sleep followed in 1975, and then In Search of Identity in 1977, about which Richard Wilbur wrote: \\"I like her work very well. It has force, economy, genuineness, and distinctness of tone.\\" Also in 1977, Bartlett's one-act play in verse, Dialogue of Dust, was published,Bartlett, Elizabeth. Dialogue of Dust. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1977. and then recorded by the Fairhaven Radio Theatre in Bellingham, Washington. In 1979, Dufour Editions, distinguished for its publication of leading British and European writers, published Bartlett's volume of poems, Address in Time.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Address in Time. Introduction by Kenneth Rexroth. Chester Springs, PA: Dufour Editions, 1979. Bartlett was the first American author to be included on the Dufour list. For this book, Kenneth Rexroth provided the Introduction. In it, he wrote: \\"Elizabeth Bartlett's poems are good examples of the change, or one of the changes in poetry since World War II. They are poems of direct statement. They are poems of personal communication. They are overt judgments of life, of people, of value relations.... [As with the poems] of Francis Jammes, Verhaeren, ...Sandburg, ...Gertrude Stein, Laura Riding, or Reverdy...[t]hese are the kinds of poetry coming back today, a poetry I value and find here in this book..., [poetry that is concerned with the] relationships of the self to nature, of self to self, of selves to the world.... She has said clearly, 'This is the way I handle life'‚Äîand does so, superbly.\\"Rexroth, Kenneth. \\"Introduction,\\" in Bartlett, Elizabeth; Address in Time. Chester Springs, PA: Dufour Editions, 1979, pp. 9-10. Bartlett's book, A Zodiac of Poems, was also published in 1979.Bartlett, Elizabeth. A Zodiac of Poems. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1979. In 1981, Ohio University Press published Bartlett's Memory Is No Stranger, a fourth collection of her twelve-tone poems, calling it \\"an important publishing event.... [W]e believe we have taken an important step towards honoring her unusual and original twelve-tone poems.\\"Commendation from book jacket: Bartlett, Elizabeth. Memory Is No Stranger. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 1981. Bartlett had showed the form to be adaptable for single lyrics, multi-part poems, narratives, group sequences, dramatic compositions, chorales, elegies, and odes. Memory Is No Stranger was then followed by The Gemini Poems (1984)Bartlett, Elizabeth. The Gemini Poems. Brandon, Canada: Pierian Press, 1984. and Candles (1987, 1988),Bartlett, Elizabeth. Candles. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1987 (first edition); 1988 (second edition). about which Josephine Jacobsen wrote: \\"I have been simply mesmerized by this beautiful book. There is a magic sort of unity and progress which refuses to release the reader. I have read and reread the poems with increasingly pleasure.\\"Commendation from book cover: Bartlett, Elizabeth. Candles. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1987 (first edition); 1988 (second edition). William Stafford was equally impressed by the work: \\"I have read it page to page, gaining from its sequence, its natural forwarding, your attaining to continuity between poems and at the same time varying the way of going forward.\\" Bartlett's last published book of poetry, Around the Clock, appeared in 1989.Bartlett, Elizabeth. Around the Clock. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1989. Maxine Kumin commended the book with these words: \\"Elizabeth Bartlett enumerates the eternal questions that preoccupy us 'while we try to sleep / on the rough floor of our hearts.' In the strictest of forms [i.e., the twelve-tone form], she examines the human condition; the poetry is pitiless, yet redemptive.\\"Commendation from book cover: Bartlett, Elizabeth. Around the Clock. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1988. Similarly, Josephine Jacobsen praised this work: \\"Elizabeth Bartlett understands that the very large and the very small are siblings. Perceptive and emotionally vital, her poems ask all our own questions, poems in an original and lucid form.\\" In addition to her published books of poetry, more than 1,000 individually published poems by Bartlett appeared in such magazines as Harper's, Saturday Review, Literary Review, Malahat Review, Prism International, Windsor Review, Harper's Bazaar, Denver Quarterly, Virginia Quarterly Review, Tamarack Review, Pierian Review, North American Review, Beloit Poetry Journal, Canadian Forum, Dalhousie Review, Antigonish Review, Women's Studies, and many others, as well as overseas in England, France, and India. Her poems were anthologized in numerous collections, including Golden Years P. S. A., American Scene, Golden Quill, New Voices, Poets West, Encounters, New Poems by American Poets 2, American Literary Anthology 3, Contemporary Women Poets, Life and Literature, American Women's Anthology, Yearbook of American Poetry, California Bicentennial, Encounters, Second Coming, Where Is Vietnam?, The Writing on the Wall, Peace Is Our Profession, Anthology of American Verse, Against Infinity, Muse Anthology, Parthenon Anthology, and others.  Poetry readings and recordings  Bartlett gave many dozens of individual poetry readings in addition to readings of her poetry during regular teaching appointments. She gave readings as Visiting Poet at Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, Fairhaven College, the University of the Pacific, Loyola University in Los Angeles, the University of Florida, and the University of Houston, as well as for public libraries and museums across the country. Taped recordings of her readings were made for the Library of Congress, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Fairleigh Dickinson University, the University of California, Santa Barbara, the University of California in San Diego, the University of California in Los Angeles, the University of California in Riverside, San Diego State University, Fairhaven College, San Jose State University, the University of Houston, Santa Clara University, Georgia Tech, St. Andrew's College, Agnes Scott College, Claremont College, and for FM radio stations in Atlanta, Richmond, San Francisco, and San Diego.  Other writings and art  In addition to her many poetry publications, Elizabeth Bartlett was an author of fiction, essays, literary criticism, translations, and reviews. Among these, her short stories were published in such literary reviews as Accent, Arizona Quarterly, Queen's Quarterly, Kenyon Review, New Story, Dreamworks, Crosscurrents, Phantasm, Writers Forum, Prospice, Footwork, The Artful Dodge, Facet, Stone Drum, South Carolina Review, Short Story Digest, etc. Essays by Bartlett appeared in ETC: A Review of General Semantics, Crosscurrents, New Orleans Review, National Forum, Letters, and others. Her reviews were published in the L. A. Times, the New York Times, Dallas News, New Orleans Review, ETC: A Review of General Semantics, National Forum, Windsor Review, and other metropolitan newspapers and magazines. Bartlett's many poetry readings were often accompanied by exhibits of her original art. Her husband, Paul Alexander Bartlett, was an accomplished fine artist whose paintings and illustrations were widely exhibited in the U.S. and Mexico. Elizabeth Bartlett shared with her husband a deep interest in art. Influenced by the Bauhaus School, her art has been exhibited by numerous museums, galleries, and art and poetry festivals in New York City, Richmond, Atlanta, San Juan Capistrano, the Love Library of San Diego State University, the Carlsbad Library, the San Diego Central Library, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Athenaeum Library, San Jose Central Library, Grossmont College, etc. Her fine art won awards for original designs in scratchboard, brush and ink, and pen drawing. She experimented in a wide variety of media, and developed a style that is at once abstract and lyrical. Much of her art was intended and used to illustrate her published books of poetry. Some of her art pioneered a new technique created by her, which she called wax painting. It involves a controlled flow and manipulation of poured colored molten wax onto canvas, board, or paper. She also used techniques of cut paper and collage in her art, often supplemented by India ink and acrylics. The subjects she focused on in her art were drawn from her rich, symbolic imagination and dream life. She developed a preference for \\"primitive\\" art, whose unassuming simplicity she felt was capable of representing the images she wished to portray.  Later years  In 1983, Elizabeth Bartlett placed her own creative work to the side to begin a project that was to occupy her for the last dozen years of her life. She was aware that the summer Olympics was scheduled to take place in Los Angeles the following year. The Olympic Games in ancient Greece had honored outstanding athletes, but also recognized poets for excellence of mind and literary talent. Bartlett therefore founded Literary Olympics to bring the cultural component back into the Olympics. She directed the work of internationally distinguished associate editors located in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, East, North, and West Europe, Great Britain, Latin America, and the United States. The international organization was granted status as a non-profit corporation under IRS Code 501(c)(3) in 1991. Through Bartlett's leadership and editorial effort, beginning in 1984 three international anthologies of poetry were published in conjunction with the Olympics, and included the work of eminent contemporary poets, including Yehuda Amichai, Thorkild Bj√∏rnvig, Eavan Boland, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Odysseas Elytis, Oscar Gonz√°les, Yannis Ritsos, Ewald Osers, Zbigniew Herbert, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Octavio Paz, Eug√©nio de Andrade, among others. Literary Olympians: 1984 contained poetry from nine countries. Literary Olympians II included poetry from 34 countries and was published in conjunction with the 1988 Olympic Games held in Seoul, Korea. Bartlett was brought to the Seoul Olympiad as a guest and honored by Park Seh-jik, President of the Seoul Olympics Organizing Committee, by Sook Hee Chun, President of the Korean P.E.N., and by leading Korean poet Kim Nam Cho. President Park Seh-jik contributed the introductory essay, \\"Greetings,\\" published in Literary Olympians II. Bartlett was similarly the honored guest at the 1992 Olympiad XXV held in Barcelona, Spain. Literary Olympians 1992 was published to coincide with the Barcelona Games and now included the work of 130 poets from 64 countries. In all the Literary Olympics anthologies, the poetry was published in the original languages in which it was written, accompanied by facing-page professional translations into English. Gold, silver, and bronze Literary Olympics medals were awarded in 1992 by an international panel of distinguished scholar-judges who included J. D. McClatchy of Yale University, M. L. Rosenthal of New York University, Ivar Ivask of the University of Oklahoma, Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye, and Paul Engle of the University of Iowa Translation Program. The Gold Medal in Poetry was awarded to Yehuda Amichai of Israel, the Silver Medal to Thorkild Bj√∏rnvig of Denmark, and the Bronze Medal to Eavan Boland of Ireland. Nobel Laureate Odysseas Elytis of Greece was the anthology's Guest of Honor. An impressive group of Nobel Laureates contributed to the project, including Vicente Aleixandre, Saul Bellow, Odysseas Elytis, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Eugenio Montale, Octavio Paz, and Jaroslav Seifert. Numerous heads of state endorsed the Literary Olympics, among them Hon. Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada; Hon. Hedy d'Ancona, Minister of Culture of the Netherlands with the approval of H. M. Queen Beatrix; Hon. Juan A. Yanez-Barnuevo, Ambassador of Spain to the United Nations; Alfredo F. Cristiani, President of El Salvador; Hon. Lazhar Haoum, Cultural Attach√© of Algeria; Hon. Marja-Leena Rautalin, Director, Finnish Literature Centre, Helsinki with the endorsement of Mauno Henrik Koivisto, President of Finland; Gladys Ram√≠rez de Espinoza, Director of the Institute of Culture of Nicaragua; Dr. Rodrigo Pacheco L√≥pez, Vice-Minister of Culture, Costa Rica; and others. At the time of Bartlett's death in 1994, she was nearing the completion of the fourth international anthology to be published to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games to be held in 1996 in Atlanta. Prof. Dasha ƒåuliƒá Nisula of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at Western Michigan University agreed to complete the editorial task for this international collection. The anthology was published as a memorial volume to honor Bartlett. It contained the work of leading poets from 20 countries, writing in 15 languages, published with facing-page translations by professional poetry translators.Nisula, Dasha ƒåuliƒá. Leading Contemporary Poets: An International Anthology. Kalamazoo, MI: Poetry International, 1997. As a legacy to the future of poetry, Elizabeth Bartlett endowed a time-leveraged \\"Benjamin Franklin trust\\" for a period of one hundred years for the international benefit of poetry. At the end of the one hundred-year term, the initial funding will have grown by compounding to provide for a self-perpetuating endowment to make it possible to continue to honor outstanding international contributions to poetry.

Aulus Cornelius Cossus was a member of the patrician gens Cornelia. During the war against the Etruscan city of Veii, Cossus became one of only three Roman generals ever to be awarded the spolia opima for killing an enemy leader in single combat. According to Livy, Cossus unhorsed the Veientes' King Lars Tolumnius and struck him down. After taking the linen cuirass off Tolumnius' body, he decapitated the corpse and put the head on a lance and paraded it in front of the enemy, who retreated in horror. Cossus donated the captured armour, shield and sword to the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitoline Hill, where as late as the reign of Emperor Augustus it could be seen. In 428 BC Cossus was elected consul together with Titus Quinctius Pennus Cincinnatus.Livy, IV, 17-20 Cossus was elected a consular tribune (tribunus militum consulari potestate) in 426 BC. According to Livy, Cossus held the command in the city while the other three tribunes (Gaius Furius Pacilus Fusus, Marcus Postumius and Titus Quinctius Pennus Cincinnatus) led the army to Veii. Due to infighting and divided command they were defeated by the Veientes. Because of the defeat the public demanded the appointment of a dictator. After consultation of the augurs whether it was appropriate for a magistrate other than a consul to appoint a dictator, upon receiving a positive reply Aulus Cornelius Cossus nominated Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus as dictator, and was himself nominated by him as his master of the horse. Cossus later served as pontifex maximus.Livy, IV, 30-34 Together with Lucius Furius Medullinus, Aulus Cornelius Cossus was elected to a second consulate in 413 BC,Livy, IV, 51 although both Diodorus Siculus and Cassiodorus state that Marcus Cornelius Cossus was elected.Broughton, pg. 76 See also *Cornelia (gens) ReferencesSources * T.

Biography Wolfgang was a soldier in World War II and participated in the Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war he studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where his principal teacher was Thorsten Sellin. At Penn, Wolfgang took his MA (1950) and PhD (1955) in sociology/criminology. Until his death in 1998 he was a professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1964, he published The Measurement of Delinquency, which was the first study of the true impact of crime on society. Three years later, he completed The Subculture of Violence: Towards an Integrated Theory in Criminology, which focused on high rates of violence among blacks and the influence of a black subculture. Wolfgang wrote over 30 books and 150 articles throughout his life. His most famous work, Delinquency in a Birth Cohort, was published in 1972. This book marked the beginning of large-scale studies of crime and delinquency. It was a study of over 10,000 boys born in Philadelphia in 1945. The purpose was \\"to determine which members of the cohort had official contacts with the police, to compare delinquents with nondelinquents, and to trace the volume, frequency and character of delinquent careers up to age 18.\\" The data revealed that of 9,945 boys, 3,475 had at least one recorded police incident. Other statistics showed that offender rates increased gradually from ages 7 to 11, increased rapidly from 11 to 16, and declined at age 17. The study concluded that a small number of offenders account for most of the offenses committed. It also stated that \\"the juvenile justice system has been able to screen the hard core offenders fairly well, but it has been unable to restrain, discourage, or cure delinquency.\\" Wolfgang won many awards, including the Hans Von Hentig Award from the World Society of Victimology in 1988, the Edwin Sutherland Award from the American Society of Criminology in 1989, the Beccaria Gold Medal from the German, Austrian, and Swiss Society of Criminology in 1997; in 1993, the Wolfgang Criminology Award was established in his name. Wolfgang spent the later years of his life showing his opposition to issues such as the death penalty and the use of a gun against a perpetrator in articles such as \\"We Do Not Deserve to Kill\\" and A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed. in which he says he does not like their conclusions that having a gun for self-defense \\"can be useful\\" but cannot fault their methodology. \\"\\"What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. [\\"Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self- Defense with a Gun,\\" by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, published in that same issue of The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology] The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator. ...I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence. The National Crime Victim Survey does not directly contravene this latest survey, nor do the Mauser and Hart Studies.... the methodological soundness of the current Kleck and Gertz study is clear. I cannot further debate it.... The Kleck and Gertz study impresses me for the caution the authors exercise and the elaborate nuances they examine methodologically. I do not like their conclusions that having a gun can be useful, but I cannot fault their methodology. They have tried earnestly to meet all objections in advance and have done exceedingly well.\\" His career was cut short by pancreatic cancer, and he died on 12 April 1998. He is survived by his wife, his two daughters, and his two grandsons.

They finished the season 6‚Äì7, 4‚Äì5 in Pac-12 play to finish in a tie for fourth place in the North Division. Washington State became bowl eligible for the first time since the 2006 season, when they went 6‚Äì6.

They played the Colorado State Rams in the New Mexico Bowl on December 21, 2013, losing by the score of 48‚Äì45. The game was noted for an egregious error by head coach Mike Leach, who instead of electing to kneel down the ball three times when the Rams were out of time outs, instead ran a play which resulted in a turnover.

It is chiefly known for parasitizing Halyomorpha halys (brown marmorated stink bug). It deposits eggs into the eggs of the stink bug, and as the wasp larvae develop, they kill the stink bug eggs. A single adult wasp emerges from each stink bug egg.  Taxonomy  Trissolcus japonicus was originally described by American entomologist William Harris Ashmead in 1904, and transferred to the genus Trissolcus in 1968. All species within the genus Trissolcus are egg parasitoids of Pentatomoidea (stink bugs and their allies). Trissolcus halyomorphae was in use from 2009, but has since been classified as a junior synonym of Trissolcus japonicus.oviposit in the eggs of brown marmorated stink bug. T. japonicus specimens on a US dime.  Description  Trissolcus japonicus adults are small black wasps with orange and black legs and antennae. The samurai wasp is about 1/8th of an inch, and does not sting people. https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/7-things-to-know-about-samurai-wasps-a- natural-enemy-of-brown-marmorated-stink-bugs  Distribution  The samurai wasp is native to Eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In 2014, two adventive populations were found in the United States during surveys to identify which North American parasitoids might be attacking brown marmorated stink bug. Subsequent genetic testing showed these wild populations were self-introduced: they were not related to each other, or to the laboratory strain of parasitoids housed in quarantine for biosafety testing since 2007. An adventive European population was discovered during similar surveys in Switzerland in 2017.  Biological control  Trissolcus japonicus is currently the subject of biological control programs against the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) in the US, Europe, and New Zealand. In the United States, it will likely take years for the wasps to build up large enough densities in the wild to have a measurable impact on BMSB populations, but efforts are under way to augment wild populations with laboratory reared specimens. Recent redistribution efforts of Trissolcus japonicus in New York State also engages Citizen Science project participants in reducing urban BMSB populations.  Life cycle  In its native range, the samurai wasp is able to complete up to 10 generations per year, while its primary host, brown marmorated stink bug, completes up to 2. Female wasps lay on average 42 eggs, preferring to oviposit into host eggs younger than 3 days old. Males hatch first and mate with their sisters.

Picture post card, 1910. The equestrian monument dedicated to Giuseppe Garibaldi is an imposing equestrian statue placed in Rome on the highest point of the Janiculum hill on the square Piazza Garibaldi. It was designed by Emilio Gallori in 1895, and has been referred by the title \\"the Hero of the Two Worlds\\". History The monument consists of a bronze statue portraying the hero riding a horse, which is placed on a big marble base; on each side are engraved allegorical figures of Europe and America and bas-reliefs that commemorate the landing in Marsala, the resistance of Boiada, the defence of Rome and the group of liberty. On the steps up right the monument Ettore Ferrari had created a crown, in order to remember that Garibaldi was the first Master of Italian Freemasonry. During Fascism it was replaced by fascist symbols and a copy of it was put in place only in 1943. The monument was inaugurated on September 20, 1895 by Enrico Gallori. The placement of the monument gave rise to several politic interpretations, as it was inaugurated in the period when relationships between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See were still suspended. The official version declared that the Hero directs his gaze to the Vatican. After the Lateran Treaty in 1929, the statue was turned around to face the city of Rome. A very popular Roman legend underlines that, in this way the horse now offers its backside to the Holy See. The monument was restored by the Municipality of Rome in 1990.

Life He was born and educated in Edinburgh. Leaving Scotland as a young man, he became usher of a school in Hedge Lane, London, in succession to Andrew Henderson, author of a well-known history of the rebellion of 1745. In 1754, he published, 'The Chronology and History of the World, from the Creation to the Year of Christ 1753, illustrated in fifty-six tables.' It was dedicated to the lord chancellor (Hardwicke), and was published by subscription. In the preface he acknowledged great obligations to the Earl of Bute. The plan and scope of the work originated with Dr. Hugh Blair's scheme of chronological tables. The 'Chronology' was reprinted in 1756, 1768, and 1814. It was revised and enlarged 'by Willoughby Rosse in Bohn's 'Scientific Library,' 1856. In 1768, Blair published 'Fourteen Maps of Ancient and Modern Geography, for the illustration of the Tables of Chronology and History ; to which is prefixed a dissertation on the Rise and Progress of Geography.' The dissertation was separately republished in 1784. Blair's first book was well received. In 1755 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in its 'Transactions' appeared a paper by him on the 'Agitation of the Waters near Reading'Phil. Trans. x. 651, 1755 He had previously obtained orders in the church of England, and in September 1757 was appointed chaplain to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha and mathematical tutor to the Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany. In March 1761, on the promotion of Dr. Townshend to the deanery of Norwich, Blair was given a prebendal stall at Westminster. Within a week the dean and chapter of Westminster presented him to the vicarage of Hinckley. In the same year he was chosen fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In September 1763 he left with the Duke of York on a tour on the continent, and was absent until 1764. In 1771 he was transferred, by presentation of the dean and chapter of Westminster, to the vicarage of St. Bride, London, and again to the rectory of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, in April 1776. He was also rector of Horton (Milton's Horton) in Buckinghamshire. He died on 24 June 1782.

Career In the mid-1920s, Costello was stage manager for the Wright Players in Louisville, Kentucky. Later in that decade, he acted with the Majestic Players in Elmira, New York. Costello entered films in 1935 and in 1939 was put under contract with MGM. Known for his wicked sense of humor, Costello oftentimes played the role of a menace or a tough guy. He is probably best known for his role as Lefty in the movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941). He appeared in 37 movies (31 times credited), including Another Thin Man (1939), Johnny Eager (1941) and The Blue Dahlia (1946). Accidental Death According to the obituary of the actor published in the Los Angeles Times on October 26, 1945, Costello died of an overdose of sleeping tablets. His wife Louise found him dead in the bedroom of their home at 13424 Valley Vista Street, Sherman Oaks. He had earlier complained of being unable to get to sleep.

Founded in 1987 and located in the Tongass National Forest, its mission is the rehabilitation of sick and injured eagles, hawks, falcons, owls, ravens, hummingbirds and other avian wildlife brought in from Juneau and Southeast Alaska. The JRC is licensed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to handle eagles and migratory birds, and is governed in part by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Actand the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The Juneau Raptor Center is a private, 501(c)(3), nonprofit organization which relies on donations for its financial survival and day-to-day operation, accepting donated funds and food. Contributions have included US$10,000 from the US Fish and Wildlife Service toward its building fund, and food for the recovering birds' dietary requirements.  Services  Lady Baltimore, a bald eagle in Alaska who survived a poaching attempt, in her Juneau Raptor Center mew, on 15 August 2015 In 2012, the center received and treated 145 birds, of which 40 were raptors and 105 non-raptors. Birds brought to the center are treated by an all volunteer staff, who keep them in their homes during the birds' treatment and rehabilitation. In addition, the center operates an education and viewing center at the top of the Mount Roberts Tramway. The small structure, independent of the main Tram building, includes a shelter for birds too injured to release back into the wild, and a viewing platform for visitors. Center volunteers on duty answer questions from the public and provide information on the bird's life cycle, habitat, and the treatment which the bird has received.  Diversity of bird species treated  Juneau Raptor Center staff have treated and released a wide variety of birds over the years. Despite the Raptor Center's name, rescues are not limited to eagles or other birds of prey; the JRC staff accept any species of bird brought to them for treatment. In August 1998, Center staff were notified of a juvenile bald eagle which had collided with an automobile. The staff crated the bird, and took it to the home of a JRC volunteer, who found it to be uninjured. On 3 May 2008, the Juneau Raptor Center released three bald eagles in a single day. The eagles, which Center staff named Truston, Gus and Pete, were all brought to the JRC on different dates and treated by staff members. The eagles' injuries ranged in severity, and included failure to thrive, torn muscle tissue, and \\"crop stasis\\", an inability to digest food. All were successfully treated and released. In July 2010, children reported to the Center that they had found a hermit thrush stranded in the Mendenhall River and in danger of drowning. The uninjured but at risk thrush was cared for and fed by Center staff, who successfully released it two weeks later. In August 2010 the JRC rescued three young barn swallows which had fallen out of a nest. Two of the swallows died, but the Center staff were able to save the third, which they named Clinger. Clinger was fed, treated, and successfully released into the wild.

The current music director is Josep Caball√© Domenech. The Philharmonic performs at the Pikes Peak Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado and offers several series each season, including classical and pops music. History The Colorado Springs Philharmonic was formed in 2003 following the bankruptcy of the Colorado Springs Symphony in March of that year. To fund the first season of the Philharmonic, a fund-raising drive was conducted between June and November, raising $834,986 from nearly 2,000 people. An additional $290,000 consisted of matching funds from the El Pomar Foundation, the Pikes Peak Community Foundation, the Joseph Henry Edmondson Foundation and the Bee Vradenburg Foundation. It maintained the musicians and musical director from the symphony with a \\"leaner and more innovative\\" business plan. In 2008, Nathan Newbrough was made Executive Director. He focused on season ticket sales, types of performances and staffing to grow the Philharmonic. By 2011, the orchestra had begun to see improvements in audience size and more performances. Newbrough had increased the staff from 2 to 7 and offered family season tickets at discounted rates to draw in first-time audience members. The Philharmonic increased programming to exceed that of similarly sized cities. In addition, according to the League of American Orchestras, the Philharmonic had 70% more programming than other orchestras with the same budget. Newbrough credits the success of the organization on its music director, staff, and contributors like the El Pomar Foundation. Lawrence Leighton Smith, the music director, stepped down in 2011 due to a diagnosis of Binswanger's Disease, a form of dementia. He had announced in 2009 his intention to step down at the end of the 2010/2011 season. He had been the conductor since 2002. About 46% of the annual budget for the Philharmonic comes from contributions, and only about 2% of the contributions come from corporations. To increase involvement from local businesses and illustrate the value of cultural activities to the business community, the Philharmonic established the Business Partners Initiative in January, 2013. An advisory committee is led by Frank Caris, CEO of dpiX and board member of the Philharmonic. Caris said of the initiative: \\"Leaders in business share an interest in quality of life, essential to attracting and retaining a creative and driven workforce... The Philharmonic does so much to promote the quality of life in our region.\\" Performance series Each season, the Philharmonic presents three primary series: El Pomar Foundation Masterworks, Philharmonic Pops, and Vanguard Performances. Masterworks, consists of seven classical music performances per season, sponsored by the El Pomar Foundation. Philharmonic Pops presents a broader spectrum of music designed to appeal to a variety of listeners, including pieces from Broadway and Hollywood. The Philharmonic Pops series has six concerts per season. The Boeing Vanguard Performances pairs genre-changing classical repertoire with film, acting, multimedia and photography. The Vanguard Performances comprise three concerts per season. The Holiday series includes 3-4 concerts each season. In 2013, four free summer symphony concerts in June and July were made possible due to donations by five organizations: El Pomar Foundation, the City of Colorado Springs, El Paso County Enterprise Zone, and the Anschutz Foundation. To commemorate the one year anniversary of the Waldo Canyon fire, a concert was performed on June 26, 2013, organized by Colorado Springs Together, a fire relief organization. Enterprise Zone status In 2009 the Philharmonic received Enterprise Zone status, which means that federal and state tax credits are given to donations. For instance, a $10,000 donation could be reduced to a net cost of $3,600 due to the tax credits. The credits encourage donations to Colorado nonprofit and business organizations, which help them to build infrastructure, hire and retain employees and make capital improvements.

The band's expansive guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as \\"drop- tuned, slow, repetitive, heavy, dreamy, and undeniably ear-wormy\\". True Widow has been known for contrasting alternation between male and female vocals. To date, the band has released four albums, their eponymous album True Widow (2008), As High As the Highest Heavens and From the Center to the Circumference of the Earth (2011), Circumambulation (2013), and after extensive touring, they released Avvolgere (2016). Biography Phillips formerly served guitar and lead vocal duties in the more indie rock-oriented Dallas band Slowride. Following the disbandment of Slowride, he soon decided to take a break from music, and moved away from his native Texas to Massachusetts where he shifted his focus to wood art exclusively for two years. After returning to Dallas, Phillips had aspired to a more heavier sound and recruited Estill as a singer-bassist, with Starks on drums, and then they formed True Widow. The band, which describes its own style of slow, heavy, cerebral music as \\"stonegaze\\", or dubbed \\"doomgaze\\" by the media, formed in November 2007. True Widow's self-titled debut album was released in 2008 on the Texas independent record label, End Sounds. They toured the US in early 2011 opening for Surfer Blood and ‚Ä¶And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, and later in 2011 opening for Boris and Asobi Seksu. On May 26, 2011, True Widow released their second record titled As High As the Highest Heavens and From the Center to the Circumference of the Earth, via Kemado Records. BBC music critic, Mike Diver, wrote that \\"taking cues from grunge, slowcore, stoner-rock and shoegaze, the Texan trio have crafted a nine-track opus which is as exquisite of elegant detail as it is exemplary of skull-rumbling riff\\". In May 2012, they toured with Kurt Vile. True Widow's third album, Circumambulation, was released in July 2013 on Relapse Records, which signed the band in January 2013. It was recorded in November 2012 at the Echo Lab studio in Argyle, Texas, with record producer and sound engineer Matt Pence, who also produced their sophomore album. On September 23, 2016, the group released their fourth album, Avvolgere, via Relapse Records, which was recorded by Matt Pence.

In addition to adventure stories, non-fiction aviation articles and aviation news were added, as were articles related to model airplanes. The magazine's tagline became \\"Fiction, Model Building, Fact ‚Äî Three Aviation Magazines in One\\".cover of the January 1937 issue of Flying Aces magazine The Flying Models Era During World War II, the magazine had been subtitled \\"Magazine of the Flying Age\\". The content focused on the war effort, with little advertising, and late in the war the name changed briefly to Flying Age. In later years, model airplane construction features started appearing more regularly and became more and more dominant, until finally in 1947, the magazine was renamed Flying Models. It was sold to Carstens Publications in 1969 which began to publish the title without the fiction content.Marshall, p. 147 Flying Models was set apart from its competition as it featured in-depth model construction features and new product reviews, and catered to specific interests within the model airplane construction hobby, such as soaring, control line, and stunt flying. The magazine also reported on the latest technology related to radio control, ducted fan, and electric flight. Editors Fanelli and Wiggin were both active hobbyists themselves, having built and flown many models of their own over the years.

She is best known for her freelance news photographs, particularly of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, and portraits of places such as Bohemian Greenwich Village. Her trademarks were her self-described \\"ability to hustle\\" and her tenacity in overcoming gender barriers in her profession. Early life and education Beals was born Jessie Richmond Tarbox on December 23, 1870, in Hamilton, Ontario, the youngest child of John Nathaniel Tarbox and Marie Antoinette Bassett. John Tarbox was a sewing machine manufacturer, and his partnership with the largest sewing machine company in Canada made the Tarbox family wealthy. When Beals was seven, however, her father lost all of his savings in a bad investment and began drinking heavily. He eventually left home at the insistence of Beals's mother, who then embroidered and sold some of the family's belongings to keep the family income going. Beals was a \\"bright and precocious child\\" and did well in school. At age fourteen she was admitted to the Collegiate Institute of Ontario, and at seventeen received her teaching certificate. Beals began teaching at a one-room schoolhouse in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where her brother Paul was also living at the time. In 1888, Beals won a subscription prize camera through the Youth's Companion magazine.New York Times (May 31, 1942) ‚ÄúJESSIE BEALS DIES; Photographer, 71. 1942.‚Äù The New York Times (accessed January 10, 2013) The camera was small and somewhat rudimentary, but Beals began to use it to take photographs of her students and their surroundings. Beals soon bought a higher quality Kodak camera and set up Williamsburg's first photography studio in front of her house, although photography largely remained her side hobby.  Photography career  In 1893 Beals took a new teaching position in Greenfield, Massachusetts and visited the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. At the Exposition, Beals' interest in traveling and photography was sparked having met Frances Benjamin Johnston and Gertrude K√§sebier. In 1897, Beals married Alfred Tennyson Beals, an Amherst graduate and factory machinist. In 1899, Beals received her first professional assignment when she was asked by The Boston Post to photograph the Massachusetts state prison. Beals taught Alfred the basics of photography and the couple set out to work as itinerant photographers in 1900, with Alfred as Beals's darkroom assistant. That year, Beals also received her first credit line for her photographs in a publication, the Windham County Reformer. By 1901, the Beals' funds were depleted and they resettled in Buffalo, New York. Later that year, Beals was hired as a staff photographer by the Buffalo Inquirer and The Buffalo Courier, after impressing the editor with a photograph of ducks waddling in a row entitled \\"On to Albany.\\" This position made her the first female photojournalist and was well-regarded by the papers and citizens of Buffalo and worked at the publications until 1904 when she left to take photos of the World's Fair. Photojournalism was physically demanding, often risky work, but Beals could be seen carrying out assignments in her ankle-length dresses and large hats, with her 8-by-10-inch glass plate camera and 50 pounds of equipment in tow. During one assignment for the lurid murder trial of Edwin L. Burdick in Buffalo, Beals broke a rule that forbade photographs of the trial by climbing a tall bookcase to a window to snap a picture of the courtroom before she was detected.

In 1904, Beals was sent to the opening of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. There, Beals persuaded officials to give her a late press permit for the pre-exposition, climbed ladders and jumped into a hot air balloon just to get photographs that interested her. She was greatly interested in the Indigenous peoples which resulted in capturing many spontaneous images that didn't necessarily fit into the predominate narrative of racial and developmental progress. She had a different style than most news photographers of the day, focusing on series of pictures that would later be used to write stories, rather than vice versa. Beals's display of her signature \\"hustle\\" earned her the position of official Fair photographer for the New York Herald, Leslie's Weekly and the Tribune, as well as the Fair's publicity department, producing over 3,500 photographs and 45,000 prints of the event. In addition to photographing the various exhibits at the Fair, Beals also captured a candid photograph of President Theodore Roosevelt. This initial encounter earned her a special pass to photograph Roosevelt and the Rough Riders at their reunion in San Antonio, Texas in 1905. = A studio on Sixth Avenue = In 1905 Beals opened her own studio on Sixth Avenue in New York City. Beals continued to take on a variety of photograph assignments, ranging from shots of auto races and portraits of society figures, to her well-known photographs of Bohemian Greenwich Village and the New York slums.Hagen, Charles (September 2, 1994) ‚ÄúVillage bohemians from another era.‚Äù The New York Times (accessed January 10, 2013) Over the years Beals also photographed several presidents and celebrities, including Presidents Coolidge, Hoover and Taft; Mark Twain; Edna St. Vincent Millay; and Emily Post. While Beals' career flourished, her marriage became troubled. In 1911, Beals gave birth to a daughter, Nanette Tarbox Beals, most likely from another relationship. Beals finally left her husband in 1917. = A studio and a gallery in Greenwich Village = She moved to Greenwich Village and opened a new photography studio and gallery in 1920. For a few years, Beals juggled working and caring for Nanette, who also suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and was frequently hospitalized, eventually deciding to send Nanette to camps and private boarding schools throughout the year. Nanette would later go on to live semi-permanently with one of Beals' old friends. Later years As the number of female photographers increased during the 1920s, Beals shifted her focus to giving public talks and specializing in photographing suburban gardens and estates of wealthy East Coasters. By 1928, she and Nanette moved to California, where Beals photographed Hollywood estates. The Great Depression brought Beals and Nanette back to New York in 1933, where Beals lived and worked in Greenwich Village. Beals gradually fell into poverty, years of lavish living and the effects of the Depression having taken their toll. She died on May 30, 1942 at Bellevue Hospital, at the age of seventy- one. Her photographs and prints are in collections at the Library of Congress, Harvard University, the New-York Historical Society, and the American Museum of Natural History. In 1982, the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe received Beals' papers and pictures from her daughter, Nanette Beals Brainerd. NotesReferences Breitbart, Eric.

It connects the Edsviken sea inlet, to the west, with the Lilla V√§rtan strait and eventually the Baltic sea, to the east. The strait also forms the border between the suburb of Stocksund in Danderyd Municipality, to the north, and the suburb of Bergshamra in Solna Municipality, to the south. The strait is approximately long and varies in width between and , whilst its depth varies between and . Stocksundet is supposed to have received its name from the logs (Swedish: \\"stock\\") which used to be laid out in the water to stop invading ships in the early Middle Ages. This name then led to the place name of Stocksund, on the north side of the sound, and to the heraldry shield of the then Stocksund Municipality between 1955 and 1966. By the 1400s, the road between Roslagen and Stockholm crossed Stocksundet, and by the 17th century, a ferry was provided. In 1716 the first bridge across the Stocksundet was built, principally to facilitate the movement of troops to the west in the event of an attack by Russia. Since then, there have been a total of seven bridges built across the strait. Bridges The 1936 road bridge, seen with its 1826 predecessor and the 1885 railway bridge, viewed from the east The new railway bridge for the Roslagsbanan over Stocksundet. From west to east, the strait is spanned by a bridge for the Stockholm metro, a road bridge for the European route E18, and a bridge for the Roslagsbanan narrow gauge commuter railway. Over time there have been seven bridges across the Stocksundet: * The first bridge was built in 1716 the first bridge was built. It was a floating bridge with a drawbridge that could be opened to allow boat traffic to pass. Despite needing frequent repairs, the bridge lasted until September 1824, when it was destroyed in a violent storm. * In 1825-1826 a new long bridge was built in five sections between stone caissons and including a swing section. The bridge was superseded as a road bridge with the opening of a new bridge in 1936 but remained in use a pedestrian and bicycle bridge until the winter of 1957/8. The land ends of the bridge are still visible, along with the bridge house. * In 1885 a railway bridge was constructed to carry the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan. The bridge carried a single track, and was long, and comprised two fixed spans of together with a pivoting span. This bridge was replaced by a new bridge, on a different alignment, in 1996, and was demolished two years later. One of the bridge piers still exists within the state, and the land ends of the bridge are visible. * Between 1934 and 1936, a modern concrete arch bridge was built a little further west than the 1826 road bridge. It had a span of and was wide, carrying two walkways, two bicycle lanes, and a carriageway. This bridge had a relatively short life and was replaced in 1990, being demolished in order to make way for its replacement. * In 1978 a bridge was built to carry the extension of the Stockholm metro to M√∂rby centrum station. The bridge is long, and consists of a four-span curved concrete structure, with a navigation clearance of . The bridge carries twin tracks, and the line runs in a tunnel at each end of the bridge. * By the 1980s, the 1936 road bridge was no longer able to carry the increasingly intensive road traffic, and it was decided to replace it with two new parallel bridges for the Norrt√§lje road (E18) (one for north and one for south-traffic). The first of these bridges was completed in 1990, enabling the 1936 bridge to be demolished to make way for the second new bridge, which opened in 1992. The bridges have two large and one small span each, with the largest span of , with a navigation clearance of . The bridges are respectively and wide, carrying three northbound and four southbound lanes, together with pedestrian and cycle facilities. * In 1996 a new railway bridge was built for the Roslagsbanan, located west of the 1885 bridge, as part of the reconstruction of the line to double track. The new alignment necessitated the relocation of Stocksund station. The new bridge was designed by architect and is a concrete structure with four spans. It is long and has a navigation clearance of , somewhat lower than the adjacent road and metro bridges.

Studies to date have shown that when numerous families are studied, simple modes of inheritance are not statistically supported. The majority of studies analyzing for the mode of inheritance have concluded that a multifactorial threshold mode is most likely.
