Established in 2004, the school is the result of a collaboration between the University of Greenwich and the University of Kent. Its campus is part of a shared facility on Chatham Dockyard in Medway, Kent. History Medway School of Pharmacy was established as a collaboration between the British universities of Kent and Greenwich, in response to a \\"shortage of qualified pharmacists\\" in the south east of England. The School admitted its first students after it received approval from the RPSGB. In September 2004: its first graduates completed Foundation degrees in June 2007 and in July 2008, the first cohort of MPharm students graduated from the school. The campus was originally the home of the former Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham (also known as HMS Pembroke). In 1994, the University of Greenwich established a campus on the upper level, investing heavily over the next decade to improve and expand its facilities. In 2003, architects RMJM started work to create a shared campus which combines the historic nature of the site with contemporary architecture. In particular, the Grade II listed Drill Hall is now a learning resource center, incorporating a library with teaching space and ICT facilities. Medway may be a location name, but it is actually an administrative area comprising the various towns as they are known locally, namely Chatham, Rochester, Gillingham and Strood and takes its name from the strategically placed river set halfway between London and the Channel ports. Organisation The School's academic staff are grouped by subject, covering: * Clinical and Professional Practice * Chemistry and Drug Delivery * Biological Sciences The school offers the Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) undergraduate master's degree, a four-year programme which enables application for entry into pre-registration training leading to registration as a pharmacist. The school also runs short courses, undergraduate foundation and BSc degrees and postgraduate degrees. The school is offering a new BSc (Hons) Pharmacology and Physiology Programme, including integrated foundation year to launch in September 2015. Appointed in August 2007, the Head of School is Professor Iain Cumming. RESEARCH Medway School of Pharmacy has over twenty academic research staff arranged in the three primary research groups that are listed above^. Research Excellence Framework (REF) The school has over twenty academic research staff and a large number of research students. \\"According to Times Higher Education (January 2015), this school's Research Intensity ranking was in the top 10% of submissions to Unit of Assessment 3, Allied health professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy\\". Medway Pharmacy Students' Association Established in January 2008, Medway Pharmacy Students' Association represents pharmacy students at Medway School of Pharmacy. GK UNIONS GK Unions stands for the Greenwich & Kent Students' Unions Together (previously Universities at Medway Students Association, UMSA). It is the representative body and service provider for all students studying at the Chatham Maritime campus. Students are automatically a member of the association if they are a registered student of the University of Greenwich or University of Kent. Campus The School is based on the Universities at Medway campus, on the site of the former HMS Pembroke naval barracks at Chatham Dockyard. It benefits from the shared facilities at the campus. It is currently the biggest higher education initiative in the UK. Accommodation Prior to Fall 2013, there was 6 student housing blocks which offered single en-suite or studio flats. Starting in the 2014‚Äì2015 academic session, students pursuing a degree at the Medway School of Pharmacy have the choice of living either in halls of residence provided by the University of Greenwich or those provided by the University of Kent. University of Greenwich at Medway Halls of Residence Located on the Medway Campus itself, the accommodation consists of flats with shared kitchen/dining facilities for 4-6 students. University of Kent at Medway Halls of Residence This accommodation, which is owned and managed by Liberty Living, is arranged in clusters of flats for 5-8 students.

The aluminium component in Minol significantly prolongs the explosive pulse, making it ideal for use in underwater naval weapons (e.g. naval mines, for which it was developed, depth charges, and torpedoes) where munitions with a longer explosive pulse are more destructive than those with high brisance. Minol cannot be used in weapons fired from gun barrels (e.g. artillery shells) because there is a risk of detonation when subjected to over 250 gs of acceleration. Typically, four different Minol formulas were used. All percentages shown are by weight: * Minol-1: 48% TNT, 42% ammonium nitrate, and 10% powdered aluminium. * Minol-2: 40% TNT, 40% ammonium nitrate, and 20% powdered aluminium. * Minol-3: 42% TNT, 38% ammonium nitrate, and 20% powdered aluminium. * Minol-4: 40% TNT, 36% ammonium nitrate, 4% potassium nitrate, and 20% powdered aluminium. Since the 1950s, Minol has gradually been superseded by more modern PBX compositions, due to their superior explosive yield and stable storage characteristics. As a result, Minol is regarded as obsolete. Generally, any Minol-filled munitions encountered will be in the form of legacy munitions or unexploded ordnance dating from before the 1960s.

The first power project executed by the Jammu and Kashmir Power Development Corporation, it was conceived in 1992 and approved in 1996, with construction begun in 1999. The project was estimated to cost US$1 billion. The project consists of two-stage of 450MW each. The first stage of the project was completed in 2008-09 and was dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. The second stage of the project was completed in 2015-16, and was subsequently dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Baglihar Briefing, Kashmir Life, 11 November 2015.  Indus Waters dispute  After construction began in 1999, Pakistan claimed that design parameters of the Baglihar project violated the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. The treaty provided India with exclusive control over three eastern rivers while granting Pakistan exclusive control over three western rivers, including Chenab River. However, it contained provisions for India to establish run-of- the-river power projects with limited reservoir capacity and flow control needed for feasible power generation. Availing this provision, India established several run-of-the-river projects, with Pakistan objecting to these. Also in the case of the Baglihar and Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plants, Pakistan claimed that some design parameters were too lax than were needed for feasible power generation and provided India with excessive ability to accelerate, decelerate or block the flow of the river, thus giving India a strategic leverage in times of political tension or war. During 1999-2004 India and Pakistan held several rounds of talks on the design of projects, but could not reach an agreement. After the failure of talks on 18 January 2005, Pakistan raised six objections to the World Bank, a broker and signatory of Indus Water Treaty. In April 2005 the World Bank determined the Pakistani claim as a ‚ÄòDifference‚Äô, a classification between the less serious ‚ÄòQuestion‚Äô and more serious ‚ÄòDispute‚Äô, and in May 2005 appointed Professor Raymond Lafitte, a Swiss civil engineer as a neutral expert, to adjudicate the difference. Lafitte declared his final verdict on 12 February 2007, in which he upheld some minor objections of Pakistan, declaring that pondage capacity is reduced by 13.5%, height of dam structure be reduced by 1.5 meter and power intake tunnels be raised by 3 meters, thereby limiting some flow control capabilities of the earlier design. However, he rejected Pakistani objections on height and gated control of spillway declaring these conformed to engineering norms of the day. India had already offered Pakistan similar minor adjustments for it to drop its objection. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 divided the Indus river ‚Äî into which the Chenab flows ‚Äî between the two countries and bars India from interfering with the flow into Pakistan while allowing it to generate electricity. However, the key issue that any dam constructed by India should be strictly run of the river was rejected. Pakistan government expressed its disappointment at the final outcome. Both parties (India and Pakistan) have already agreed that they will abide by the final verdict. The verdict acknowledged India's right to construct 'gated spillways' under Indus water treaty 1960. The report allowed pondage of 32.56 million cubic meters against India's demand for 37.5 million cubic metres. The report also recommended reducing the height of freeboard from 4.5 m to 3.0 m. The verdict permitted drawdown flushing to prevent silt accumulation in the reservoir which has enhanced the life of the reservoir to above 80 years. Without drawdown flushing, the reservoir would have been completely silted in 13 years period by 2017. On 1 June 2010, India and Pakistan had a meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission, where they resolved the issue relating to the initial filling of Baglihar dam. According to PTI, \\"the two sides discussed the issue at length without any prejudice to each other's stand...Indian and Pakistani teams resolved the issue relating to the initial filling of Baglihar dam after discussions.\\" Pakistan also agreed not to raise the issue further.

PA 901 east of Minersville became a divided highway in the 1960s. The route was rerouted and extended northwest to PA 61 in 1971 and extended south to PA 183 in the 1980s. Route description PA 901 in Mount Carmel Township PA 901 begins at an interchange with PA 61 east of the city of Shamokin in Coal Township, Northumberland County, heading south on a two-lane undivided road. The route passes some development and curves southeast into forested areas, running to the east of the Shamokin Valley Railroad and following Shamokin Creek. The road passes over the railroad line and continues east, running to the south of the tracks and passing through Excelsior. PA 901 crosses into Mount Carmel Township, running through more forests and reaching an intersection with PA 54. At this point, PA 901 turns south to form a concurrency with PA 54 on Locust Gap Highway, passing through a forested gap in Mahanoy Mountain and running to the west of a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line. The road curves southeast and passes through the residential community of Locust Gap, heading east through more forests at this point. PA 901 splits from PA 54 by turning southeast to remain along Locust Gap Highway, a three-lane road with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. PA 901 in Coal Township PA 901 crosses into Butler Township in Schuylkill County and becomes Fairgrounds Road, which has two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane, and continues through more forested mountain areas. The route turns to the east as a two-lane road before curving south into the community of Lavelle, where it passes homes and businesses. The road heads into a mix of farms and woods with some residences, becoming a three-lane road with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. PA 901 becomes two lanes again as it crosses the Mahanoy Creek into Barry Township and becoming Sunbury Road, passing through more rural areas. The route gains a second eastbound lane and curves east into more forested areas, ascending Broad Mountain. The road turns southeast into Foster Township and narrows back to two total lanes as it reaches an interchange with I-81 near the Schuylkill County Airport. PA 901 winds through more wooded areas with some fields and development, passing through Mount Pleasant and Buck Run. The road turns east and runs through more forested areas of Broad Mountain, entering Cass Township. The route turns south into wooded residential areas and passes through Primrose. PA 901 curves east again through more woods and heads into the borough of Minersville and becomes Sunbury Street, passing several homes. The route runs through the commercial downtown before turning south onto Pottsville Minersville Highway, a four-lane divided highway. The road heads through business areas, running to the west of a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line and the West Branch Schuylkill River. The route continues into Branch Township and continues southeast, reaching an intersection with US 209. At this point, US 209 joins PA 901 and the two routes continue through forested areas with some development, curving to the east. The road becomes West Market Street and crosses over the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line before crossing the West Branch Schuylkill River into the city of Pottsville. At this point, PA 901 splits from US 209 by turning south onto two-lane undivided Gordon Nagle Trail. The route heads along the east bank of the river through forested areas, crossing into North Manheim Township and curving to the east. The road passes through an area of fields prior to running through more forests and heading through Glenworth. PA 901 turns southeast and crosses forested Second Mountain. The road heads into areas of residential and commercial development, where it forms a concurrency with PA 183 Truck, before crossing into the borough of Cressona. PA 901 becomes Sillyman Street and, along with PA 183 Truck, reaches its terminus at an intersection with PA 183, where the road continues south as part of that route. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 901 was not given a number. PA 901 was designated in 1928 as a loop off US 209 running between Llewellyn and west of Pottsville along an unpaved road, bypassing Minersville to the south. By 1930, the road between east of Shamokin and Locust Gap was an unnumbered, unpaved road. In the 1930s, US 209 and PA 901 swapped alignments. PA 901 routed to head northeast from US 209 in Llewellyn along Minersville Llewellyn Highway to Minersville, where it turned southeast on Pottsville Minersville Highway to end at US 209 west of Pottsville. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved. By the 1930s, the remainder of the present alignment of the route was paved but remained unnumbered. The stretch of PA 901 between Minersville and US 209 west of Pottsville was widened into a divided highway in the 1960s. In 1971, PA 901 was rerouted at Minersville to head northwest to a newly-completed interchange with PA 61 east of Shamokin, with the route designation removed between Llewellyn and Minersville. The section of PA 901 between Lavelle and I-81 was built on a new alignment to replace a winding stretch of road. This extension was made to provide a route for traffic from the Minersville/Pottsville and Shamokin/Mount Carmel areas to the interchange with I-81 northwest of Minersville. In the 1980s, the route was extended south to PA 183 in Cressona.

Nandy had received the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2007. In 2008 he appeared on the list of the Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll of the Foreign Policy magazine, published by The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Early life and education Nandy was born in a Bengali Christian family at Bhagalpur, Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of Pritish Nandy. Later, his family moved to Calcutta. Nandy's mother was a teacher at La Martiniere School, Calcutta and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries ‚Äì India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed. Nandy quit medical college after three years before joining Hislop College, Nagpur to study social sciences. Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad. While a professed non- believer, Nandy identifies with the Bengali Christian community.\\"But as a Christian, do you identify with your community? Yes, I do, even though I am not a believer. I have been a nonbeliever from my teens, much to the sorrow of my parents, who were devout Christians. But I am a product of the Bengali Christian family and culture. I identify with it. I don‚Äôt disown it, particularly because it is such a small community. I do not belong to the majority community, which is 82% of the country‚Äôs population but some of them still feel and behave like a minority. [Laughs]\\" Academic career Nandy joined the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating clinical psychology and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures. He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of Public Culture, a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press. Ashish Nandy in the library of the CSDS. Nandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the World Futures Studies Federation, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the People's Union for Civil Liberties. Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the Wilson Center, Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the University of Hull, and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, University of Edinburgh. He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, University of Trier, in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the Indian Council of Social Science Research. Professor Nandy is an intellectual who identifies and explores numerous and diverse problems. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism, talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Through his prolific writing and other activities supported by his belief in non-violence, Professor Nandy has offered penetrating analysis from different angles of a wide range of problems such as political disputes and racial conflicts, and has made suggestions about how human beings can exist together, and together globally, irrespective of national boundaries.

It was reported that he said, Rajasthan Police lodged an FIR under the SC/ST Act against Ashis Nandy for his statement regarding corruption among the SC/ST and OBCs. After Nandy's lawyer moved the Supreme Court to quash all the allegations against him, the Court issued a stay order on his arrest on 1 February 2013. The subaltern scholar Dr. Satyanarayana has challenged Nandy's remarks and expressed shock at the vociferous support he received for this from the Indian media and academia, asking rhetorically, \\"Is Prof. Nandy a holy cow?\\". Scholars say Nandy was at his satirical best when he made the comment but the sarcasm was lost on his detractors. They took this as an opportunity to attack him. But Nandy's sarcasm is well known in academic circles who were not surprised by the comment. In fact, he found support from academic quarters. Interestingly, three years later, in 2016-17, he received the KK Daomdaran Award from the Sree Narayana Mandira Samiti, Mumbai for his lifetime achievement as a scholar and intellectual, and for his contribution to the cause of the marginalised communities and castes. In 2019 he received the prestigious Hans-Kilian Award from Kohler Foundation in Germany for \\"research and advancement of meta-cultural humanisation\\".  Views on Narendra Modi  During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy began a series of interviews with RSS members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known BJP functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy said, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. Nandy said: > \\"Modi was a fascist in every sense. I don‚Äôt mean this as a term of abuse. > It‚Äôs a diagnostic category.\\" Interviews * Ashis Nandy in conversation with Gurcharan Das * Ashis Nandy in conversation with Vinay Lal See also * Science and technology studies in India References Sources *Sardar, Ziauddin and Loon, Borin Van. 2001.

There are eight species divided among two orders: the Amiiformes, represented by a single living species, the bowfin (Amia calva); and the Lepisosteiformes, represented by seven living species in two genera, the gars. Further species are to be found in the fossil record and the group was thought to be regarded as paraphyletic. However, a recent study proves that the Holostei is a sister group of the Teleostei, both within the Neopterygii. This was found from the morphology of the Holostei, for example presence of a paired vomer. Holosteans are closer to teleosts than are the chondrosteans, the other group intermediate between teleosts and cartilaginous fish, which are regarded as (at the nearest) a sister group to the Neopterigii. The spiracles are reduced to vestigial remnants and the bones are lightly ossified. The thick ganoid scales of the gars are more primitive than those of the bowfin. Characteristics Holosteans share with other non- teleost ray-finned fish a mixture of characteristics of teleosts and sharks. In comparison with the other group of non-teleost ray-finned fish, the chondrosteans, the holosteans are closer to the teleosts and further from sharks: the pair of spiracles found in sharks and chondrosteans is reduced in holosteans to a remnant structure: in gars, the spiracles do not even open to the outside;Ontario. Game and fish commission the skeleton is lightly ossified: a thin layer of bone covers a mostly cartilaginous skeleton in the bowfins. In gars, the tail is still heterocercal but less so than in the chondrosteans. Bowfins have many-rayed dorsal fins and can breathe air like the bichirs. The gars have thick ganoid scales typical of sturgeons whereas the bowfin has thin bony scales like the teleosts. The gars are therefore in this regard considered more primitive than the bowfin. The name Holostei derives from the Greek, holos meaning whole and osteon meaning bone: a reference to their bony skeletons.  Orders  Holostei consists of two orders, Lepisosteiformes and Amiiformes. Lepisosteiformes includes 1 family, 2 genera, and 7 species that are commonly referred to as gars. Amiiformes includes 1 family, 1 genus, and only 1 species that are commonly referred to as bowfins. In the cladogram below you can see Holostei branching off from the common ancestor Neopterygii with Teleostei. Gars and bowfins are found in North America and in freshwater ecosystems. The differences in each can be spotted very easily from just looking at the fishes. The gars have elongated jaws with fanlike teeth, only 3 branchiostegal rays, and a small dorsal fin. Meanwhile the bowfins have a terminal mouth, 10-13 flattened branchiostegal rays, and a long dorsal fin. Phylogeny Cipactlichthys scutatus holotype fossil, from the Lower Cretaceous Tlayua Formation of Mexico The cladogram shows the relationships of holosteans to other bony fish, the great majority of which are teleosts, and to the terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) that evolved from a related group of fish.

Jan Ullrich, linked to Fuentes by the newspaper, threatened to sue El Pa√≠s. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said Astana-W√ºrth were to be accepted in the Tour. The Spanish authorities lifted the secret of summary two days before the start of the 2006 Tour, formally involving all 56 riders found in Fuentes' lists. Because Ullrich and √ìscar Sevilla were in the lists, T-Mobile suspended them.Jeff Jones, Ullrich, Sevilla and Pevenage suspended, The list gets longer, CyclingNews, 30 June 2006 The example was followed by Ivan Basso's Team CSC and Francisco Mancebo's AG2R Pr√©voyance. ASO demanded all riders involved be withdrawn by their teams, even though Astana-W√ºrth had received the support of the CAS. The day before the Tour, Astana-W√ºrth yielded to pressure. Five of their riders had been excluded by ASO for involvement in the scandal, leaving only four of the six riders required. Francisco Mancebo, fourth the previous year and involved in the case, ended his career, according to his directeur sportif Vincent Lavenu. As a result, none of the riders who finished in the top 5 of the 2005 Tour de France started in the 2006 edition. On 3 July, W√ºrth also withdrew sponsorship of the team. They had planned sponsorship only if it were not excluded from a race. Six days later, T-Mobile fired Rudy Pevenage, directeur sportif, because he was also involved. On 21 July, the team suspended Ullrich and Sevilla, effectively sacking them. On the same day, Spanish cycling newspaper Meta2Mil listed codenames used by Fuentes which had not been deciphered by police. = Additional leaks = In November 2006, El Mundo claimed that an anti-doping laboratory in Barcelona which analyzed 99 bags of blood plasma seized in Operaci√≥n Puerto found \\"high levels of erythropoietin (EPO)\\". This suggested athletes working with Fuentes had been boosting their performance in ways other than blood doping. El Mundo suggested those implicated had delegated their cheating to Fuentes, and would not have been able to control the level of EPO they were taking. After studying the Barcelona lab's report, El Mundo described Fuentes's program as: riders would visit Fuentes a few weeks before a race and have blood removed. Fuentes would run the blood through a centrifuge, separating the blood plasma from the red blood cells. The cells would be re-injected shortly before competition, boosting resistance to fatigue. If haematocrit levels (volume of red blood cells) got dangerously high, they would re-inject plasma as well, enhanced with EPO, to dilute the red blood cells and avoid detection. The Barcelona lab did not identify any athlete responsible for any of the 99 tested bags of blood.Associated Press, EPO found in bags of blood seized in doping investigation, International Herald Tribune, November 24, 2006 = Legal repercussions = On 26 July 2006, five Astana riders were cleared by Spanish courts.

Julia Santamaria, the judge presiding the trial, told Fuentes that he was not under obligations to name any athlete other than the cyclists implicated. Fuentes stated that he supplied athletes in other sports with drugs and said: ‚ÄúI could identify all the samples [of blood]. If you give me a list I could tell you who corresponds to each code on the [blood] packs.‚Äù On the 30 April 2013 Fuentes was found guilty and given a one-year suspended prison sentence. The judge also ruled on a request to hand over blood bags to the Spanish Anti-Doping Agency. The judge ordered the blood bags destroyed, but the anti-doping agency has appealed. Additional appeals were filed by the Union Cycliste Internationale, the Italian National Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency, as well as by the prosecution. On 14 June 2016, the original verdict against Fuentes was overruled and he was cleared of all charges. However, 211 blood bags from his laboratory are set to be handed over to anti-doping authorities for investigation.

Solo Cup Company is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, and in 2006 had sales of $2.4 billion. On May 4, 2012, Solo Cup Company was acquired by Dart Container. History A basic 16 ounce (473 mL) Solo cup The world's largest \\"paper\\" cup in front of what was once the Lily-Tulip manufacturing company, later Sweetheart Cup CompanyLily-Tulip Cup Corporation, Springfield-Greene County Library, Springfield, Missouri which was in turn acquired by Solo. Actually made of poured concrete, the cup stands about tall. Leo Hulseman, a former employee of the Dixie Co. in the 1930s, created the \\"Solo Cup\\", a paper cone he made at his home and sold to bottled-water companies. He founded the Solo Cup Company in 1936, and developed other products, like wax-coated cups and the plastic Cozy Cup. The wax-coated cups were added to its lineup in the 1950s, as fountain sodas gained popularity. In the 1970s, Hulseman's son, Robert Leo Hulseman, came up with the now-ubiquitous (in the United States), red Solo cup. The red Solo cups are made of thick, molded polystyrene. They are known for being able to withstand drops, easily stackable, and disposable while price accessible. Their characteristic red color may conceal the drinking contents. On March 1, 2004, Solo acquired Sweetheart Cup Company for $917.2 million, in part with public debt. Sweetheart was founded by Joseph Shapiro and his four brothers, emigrants from Russia. It became the largest consumer packaging company in the world and was sold several times before being acquired by Solo Cup. Following the acquisition, Solo Cup's finances suffered, and Standard & Poor's lowered their credit rating from B to CCC+. In late 2006, Solo Cup was reported to be $1.1 billion in debt. In 2005, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City added a Solo Cup Traveler's Lid to its permanent collection.Canadean. (Feb. 6, 2014) Solo Cup Company [Company profile]. Retrieved from http://www.lexisnexis.com/ The lid was featured because it symbolized innovation and progress in basic product design. Solo Cup Company closed its longstanding facility in Highland Park, Illinois, in December 2009 and relocated to Lake Forest, Illinois. On May 4, 2012, Solo Cup Company was acquired by Dart Container. Management =Founder= Leo Hulseman (1898‚Äì1989) was an active polo player. His wife, Dorothy Donahoe Hulseman (1900‚Äì1988), better known by her stage name Dora Hall , was a singer whose records were given away free of charge through Solo promotions. Leo Hulseman was also the founder and owner of Premore Inc. Premore was a television production company on the Culver Studios lot for many years in the 1970s and 1980s, and later moved to North Hollywood. Premore produced children's TV shows including Tony the Pony (like the later Barney & Friends) and The Cliffwood Avenue Kids (like Our Gang). Other programs produced at the Premore facilities included Greystone's The Real West and Candid Camera. Premore's television studio stage, remote truck, and post production were used for Dora Hall's shows and rented for television specials and sports. Dora Hall was most noted for and seen on the Dora Hall TV Show (1979), and she played Rose On Broadway with Frank Sinatra Jr., Donald O'Connor and Scatman Crothers. She also had a TV special called \\"Once Upon a Tour\\". Her songs are found on the Premore, Reinbeau, and Cozy Records labels. Premore Inc. was closed in 1993, four years after the death of Leo Hulseman. =Subsequent management= Robert Leo Hulseman, son of the founder Leo Hulseman and the creator of the iconic red solo cup, served as President. Hulseman died December 21, 2016. Current CEO Robert M. Korzenski took over from Robert Hulseman in August 2006. Korzenski had worked for Sweetheart Cups for over 10 years. Customers Solo Cup customers include Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Cos√¨, Walmart, Whole Foods Market, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Publix, and Tim Hortons, as well as many universities. The red plastic cups are notably used in American college and university games such as beer pong and flip cup. This usage is referenced in Toby Keith's 2011 country music song \\"Red Solo Cup\\". The red party cup outsells the blue variety by a wide margin. In part because of its cultural significance, many other manufacturers now produce similar looking red cups. The company is also known for its Jazz cup design, acquired through Sweetheart and sometimes known as \\"Solo Jazz\\".

Kennedy Collegiate is a secondary school (grades 9 through 12) located in central Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Greater Essex County District School Board (GECDSB). Mrs. Rocheleau is the current principal and Mr. Wesley Arther is the current vice-principal. The school is located in the heart of Windsor, Ontario along Tecumseh Road and just east of Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. It is affectionately called 'The Castle' because of its prominent location and its distinctive turreted architecture. Opened in October 1929, Kennedy Collegiate was named after the Honourable William Costello Kennedy, a Windsor politician who had served as Minister of Roads and Canals. Athletics Kennedy Collegiate is renowned throughout Ontario for its outstanding swim program. The Kennedy swim team has experienced twenty three consecutive WECSSAA championships from 1978 to 2001 and ten overall provincial OFSAA championships from 1991 to 2001. The Kennedy swim team holds the record for the greatest number of OFSAA team championships banners (30) won of all high school swim programs. The Kennedy swim program has also developed national record holders such as Mike McWha, a representative of Team Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The Kennedy swim team's success is the product of the program set in place by Coach Dave Pells, now retired, who was involved with Kennedy for 37 years. The team was then overseen by Head Coach and former swimmer Michel Eastman, and assistant coaches Adam Mailloux, David Law, and Lindsay Tome. However, with the pool closed and there is no longer a team. Kennedy has also had a very successful Cross Country team. In 2006, the team tied for the WECSSAA AAA/A team championship even though Kennedy is considered an AA/A school. Kennedy's senior girls' A-team won the gold medal for both WECSSAA and SWOSSAA. All of this was possible thanks to Coach Hnidei. Kennedy also has had a very successful Senior Boys Soccer team. In 2005, the team won the University of Windsor Tournament by beating L'Essor in the final by a score of 5-0. The Senior Boys Soccer team also won the OFSAA championship in 2010. They were the hosts of the tournament and won it in their home field. In addition, they won the WECSSAA AAAA/AAA championship by defeating Brennan in the final, 7-1, even though Kennedy is considered an AA/A school. They succeeded in beating St. Patrick's of Sarnia in the SWOSSAA AAA final by a score of 4-3, which allowed them to compete in London for the AAA OFSAA championships. The following year (2006), they won the Essex Raiders Indoor tournament and made it to the WECSSSA final where they placed second. In the 2007 season, the team won the WECSSAA A/AA championship by going undefeated through the regular season and the play-offs. In the 2011-2012 school year KCI's junior and senior football teams won the WECSSAA championships. Activities Kennedy is well known for many of its community activities like the Children's Christmas Party (CCP) for underprivileged grade school kids from the feeder schools. Kennedy students have annual Multicultural nights to promote diversity within the Windsor community. Clippers also participate in the annual Terry Fox run/walk for cancer research, in smaller events including food drives and toy drives.  KennedyCACHE  In 2015, Mr. D. Platt and Mr. D.

It began to find its voice in the early 19th century. The major works published in Cuba during that time were of an abolitionist character. Notable writers of this genre include Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda and Cirilo Villaverde. Following the abolition of slavery in 1886, the focus of Cuban literature shifted. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos√© Mart√≠, who led the modernista movement in Latin American literature. Writers such as the poet Nicol√°s Guill√©n focused on literature as social protest. Others, including Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz, Jos√© Lezama Lima and Alejo Carpentier, dealt with more personal or universal issues. And a few more, such as Reinaldo Arenas and Guillermo Cabrera Infante, earned international recognition in the postrevolutionary era. Most recently, there has been a so-called Cuban \\"boom\\" among authors born during the 1950s and '60s. Many writers of this younger generation have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to perceived censorship by the Cuban authorities. Many of them fled abroad during the 1990s. Some well-known names include Da√≠na Chaviano (USA), Zo√© Vald√©s (France), Eliseo Alberto (Mexico), Pedro Juan Guti√©rrez (Cuba), Antonio Orlando Rodr√≠guez (Cuba) and Abilio Est√©vez (Spain). Cuban literature is one of the most prolific, relevant and influential literatures in Latin America and all the Spanish-speaking world, with renowned writers including Jos√© Mart√≠, Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda, Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia, Nicol√°s Guill√©n (the National Poet of Cuba), Jos√© Lezama Lima, Alejo Carpentier (nominee for the Nobel Prize for Literature and previously the Premio Cervantes winner in 1977), Guillermo Cabrera Infante (Premio Cervantes, 1997), Virgilio Pi√±era and Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz (Premio Cervantes, 1992), among many others.  History  Spanish language literature began in the Cuban territory with the Spanish conquest and colonization. The conquistadors brought with them cronistas who recorded and described all important events, although they did so with the Spanish point of view and for the Spanish reading public. The most important cronista to arrive in Cuba in the 16th century was Bartolom√© de las Casas, a friar who authored, among other texts, the History of the Indies. The first literary work written on the island dates to the 17th century, when in 1608 Silvestre de Balboa y Troya de Quesada (1563‚Äì1647) published Espejo de paciencia, a historical epic poem in royal octavo that narrates the capture of the friar Juan de las Cabezas Altamirano by the pirate Gilberto Gir√≥n. Cuban writing began with poetry, and there were few other significant works written in the 17th century. = 18th century = It was not until 1739 that the first play by a Cuban appeared in Sevilla under the title El pr√≠ncipe jardinero y fingido Cloridano (\\"The Garden Prince and the Hypocritical Cloridano\\") by Santiago Pita. It is a comedy portraying the artificial expressions of the time, with occasional reminiscences of Lope de Vega, Calder√≥n de la Barca and August√≠n Moreto. True Cuban poetic tradition began with Manuel de Zequeira y Arango and Manuel Justo de Rubalcava toward the end of the 18th century, despite the fact that Espejo de paciencia had been published a century and a half earlier. This can be affirmed not only by the quality of their respective works, but also by their typical Cuban style, which had already grown apart from that of Spain. The ode to indigenous nature became the tone and primary theme of Cuban poetry. Among the best inaugural poems are the ode \\"A la pi√±a\\" by Zequeira and \\"Silva cubana\\" by Rubalcava. = 19th century = Cuban neoclassicism (ca. 1790‚Äì1820) was characterized by the use of classic forms similar to those of ancient Greece, with equaled invocations of Greco-Latin gods but with a singular prominence given to nature with the clear intention of distancing itself from Europe. Francisco Pobeda y Armenteros was a poet who can be placed midway between \\"high culture\\" and \\"popular culture\\" and whose style was one of the first to initiate the process of \\"Cubanization\\" in poetry. Soon afterward, Domingo del Monte attempted to do the same, proposing the \\"Cubanization\\" of romance. Del Monte also set himself apart by his fundamental work in the organizing and correspondence of literary circles. Romanticism matured in Cuba due to one figure with continental status whose poetic works broke with Spanish-language tradition (including that of classical Greece), dominated then by varying levels of neoclassicism. Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia was born in Santiago de Cuba in 1803 and died in Toluca, Mexico in 1839, and besides being the first great Romantic poet and Cuban exile, he was an essayist and dramaturge. He founded the critical and literary newspaper El Iris in 1826 together with the Italians Claudio Linati and Florencio Galli. He also founded two magazines: Miscel√°nea (1829‚Äì1832) and La Minerva (1834). Among his best known poems are two descriptive-narrative silvas: \\"En el teocalli de Cholula\\" (written between 1820 and 1832), which admires the great Aztec ruins of Cholula in Mesoamerica and reproves pre-Hispanic religion, and \\"Al Ni√°gara\\" (1824), which covers the imposing and wild waterfalls of Niagara and develops a new voice: the romantic \\"I\\" attributed to nature. Other notable romantic authors were Gabriel de la Concepci√≥n Vald√©s (\\"Pl√°cido\\") and Juan Francisco Manzano. Among the adherents to American regionalism was Jos√© Jacinto Milan√©s, while Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda, a distinguished figure of Hispanic American Romanticism, triumphed on foreign soil and was criticized by the orthodoxy of Cintio Vitier in the 20th century. The next milestone of Cuban poetry came with the rise of two poets: Juan Clemente Zenea (1832‚Äì1871) and Luisa P√©rez de Zambrana (1837‚Äì1922), who, like Merecedes Matamoros, achieved high literary qualities in their works. Therefore, when the Modernist generation erupted on stage, there already existed a Cuban poetic tradition, but one that could be said to lack the degree of universality that was brilliantly reached by Jos√© Mart√≠ (1853‚Äì1895). Foreign influences, French above all, came together in another essential poet: Juli√°n del Casal. Most notable in his work was the cognitive, artistic production of word as art, not exempt from emotions, from tragedy or from the vision of death. The 19th century saw Cuban philosophers and historians such as F√©lix Varela, Jos√© Antonio Saco and Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero paving the way for the period of independence. Cirilo Villaverde, Ram√≥n de Palma and Jos√© Ram√≥n Betancourt wrote abolitionist literature. Meanwhile, a national literature flourished with Jos√© Victoriano Betancourt and Jos√© C√°rdenas Rodr√≠guez and a late Romanticism with the so-called \\"reacci√≥n del buen gusto\\" (\\"reaction of good taste\\") of Rafael Mar√≠a de Mendive, Joaqu√≠n Lorenzo Luaces and Jos√© Fornaris. Noteworthy as a literary criticism was Enrique Jos√© Varona. = 20th century = The 20th century opened with an independent republic mediated by U.S. occupation that, with the repeal of the Platt Amendment in 1933, began to create its own institutions. Cuba had finished a bloody war of independence from Spain with the help of the United States, by which Cuban literature in the first half of the century continued to be marked, not only with the influx of great writers such as Juli√°n del Casal and Jos√© Mart√≠, the first Cuban modernists, but also with a contradictory consolidation of Spanish culture with national identity. The American government had a positive in influence in Cuba as it helped the Cubans with the task of building a new nation.  Poetry  Above all, Casal was the great canonic figure of Cuban poetry at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. \\"His energy, apart from that which he had in late-19th century modernism, which was decisive, reached to the level of Regino Boti and, above all, Jos√© Manuel Poveda ‚Äì the latter dedicated his ‚ÄòCanto √©lego‚Äô to him\\" ‚Äì and even to the level of R√∫ben Mart√≠nez Villena and Jos√© Zacar√≠as Tallet. \\"How would the lyrical exoticism of Regino Pedroso, the symbolist intimacy of Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz, the poetic sentimentality of Eugenio Florit, the refined and solitary purism of Mariano Brull [...] or the neo-Romanticism of Emilio Ballagas and the part-romantic, part-modernist vein in some of Nicol√°s Guill√©n‚Äôs poetry be understood without an antecedent like Casal?\\"Jorge Luis Arcos, Prologue to Las palabras son Islas. Introducci√≥n a la poes√≠a cubana del siglo XX. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1999. Before the definitive arrival of the vanguards, the 1920s brought the development of a kind of poetry that anticipated the social and human unrest of the next decade. In this category, Agust√≠n Acosta, Jos√© Zacar√≠as Tallet and Rub√©n Mart√≠nez Villena stand out. Acosta was the most relevant of these poets, primarily for his work La zafra (1926), which poeticizes in pastoral verse the reality of working in the fields. Acosta furthered himself from Modernism with this poem, yet he still did not enter into the radicalism of some vanguards. Modernism is considered to have ended with Poemas en menguante (1928) by Mariano Brull, one of the principal representatives of pure poetry in Cuba. Two nearly divergent lines developed in the course of the avant-garde: 1) the realist line of African, social and political themes in which Nicol√°s Guill√©n excelled and 2) the introspective and abstract line that had its most recognized representatives in Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz and Eugenio Florit. Midway between both tendencies lies the work of Emilio Ballagas, the poet who, according to Luis Alvarez, caused the neo-Baroque of Jos√© Lezama Lima. In 1940, the magazine Revista Or√≠genes, which concentrated on both Cuban and universal topics, was launched by a group led by Lezama Lima (1910‚Äì1976) that included √Ångel Gaztelu, Gast√≥n Baquero, Octavio Smith, Cintio Vitier, Fina Garc√≠a Marruz and Eliseo Diego. Other distinguished poets of this generation were Lorenzo Garc√≠a Vega, Samuel Feij√≥o and F√©lix Pita Rodr√≠guez, but Lezama Lima was by far the central figure of Cuban poetry by mid-century. Dense metaphors, complex syntax and conceptual obscurity define the Baroque poetic environment, which consisted in a struggle to reach a vision through which life would not continue seeming like \\"a yawning succession, a silent tear\\". Lezama Lima's work spans various volumes of poetry, including Muerte de Narciso (1937), Enemigo rumor (1947), Fijeza (1949) and Dador (1960). The so- called \\"Generation of the Fifty\\" (authors born between 1925 and 1945) looked to master poets \\"del patio\\", such as Lezama Lima and Florit, although they broke off in different currents, including neo-Romanticism, in order to cultivate what would by the 1960s be the last current of the 20th century, as clearly accepted by numerous poets: colloquialism. However, it is important to mention first the absurd and existential tone of Virgilio Pi√±era, the Creole sense conveyed by Eliseo Diego and Fina Garc√≠a Murruz, the late but effective outcome of Jos√© Zacar√≠as Tallet's book La semilla est√©ril (1951), the dialogue with the common man in the second part of \\"Faz\\" by Samuel Feij√≥o, the intertextuality reached by Nicol√°s Guill√©n in \\"Eleg√≠a a Jes√∫s Men√©ndez\\", the aforementioned conversational emphasis of Florit in \\"Asonante final\\" and other poems (1955), and finally the then-closed intimacy of Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz with her distinctive work \\"√öltimos d√≠as de una casa\\" (1958). It is said that poetry began to \\"democratize\\" by exploring the \\"common dialogue\\" or that it tried to discover lyrical referents with epic notes. \\"In the initial years of the Revolution, the intimate tone predominate in the previous decades seemed insufficient, and preceding social poetry (of protest, complaint and combat) was no longer appropriate for the new social circumstances.\\"Muestrario Antol√≥gico de la poes√≠a cubana. Cien poetas (CubaLiteraria ). Virgilio L√≥pez Lemus, prologue. The use of conversational tone converged with a dose of epic style with symbolic interests. This class of poetry narrated everyday life circumstances while exalting a society engaged in social revolution. A politicized poetry began to form that avoided tropology and traditional uses of meter. It lasted at least two decades, although it was still practiced throughout the 20th century by poets who did not change their discursive attitude. Almost all major writers and poets from the class of 1930 to 1940 (Fayad Jam√≠s, Pablo Armando Fern√°ndez, Rolando Escard√≥, Heberto Padilla, C√©sar L√≥pez, Rafael Alcides, Manuel D√≠az Mart√≠nez, Ant√≥n Arrufat, Domingo Alfonso and Eduardo L√≥pez Morales, among others) were essentially colloquialists. Notable women poets of this era included Emilia Bernal, Dulce Maria Loynaz, Carilda Oliver Labra, Rafaela Chac√≥n Nardi, and Serafina N√∫√±ez. The first class of poets (the Generation of the Fifty born between 1925 and 1929) had neo-Romantic, Origenist and even surrealist traits. These included Cleva Sol√≠s, Carilda Oliver Labra, Rafaela Chac√≥n Nardi, Roberto Friol and Francisco de Or√°a. The third class, born between 1940 and 1945, were not much different from the more radical prose writers and some of them identified with such writers. Colloquialism survived strongly at least until the mid-1980s in writers such as Luis Rogelio Nogueras, Nancy Morej√≥n, V√≠ctor Casaus, Guillermo Rodr√≠guez Rivera, Jes√∫s Cos Causse, Ra√∫l Rivero, Lina de Feria, Delf√≠n Prats, Magaly Alabau and F√©lix Luis Viera. The class of poets born between 1946 and 1958 were marked by two tendencies: those who followed the meter (mainly d√©cimas and sonnets) and those who employed free verse with lines of individual ranges. Both tendencies moved toward a formal, linguistic experimentalism, but the conversational tone was maintained as is evident, for example, in the works of Osvaldo Navarro, Waldo Gonz√°lez, Alberto Serret, Ra√∫l Hern√°ndez Nov√°s, Carlos Mart√≠, Reina Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez, Alberto Acosta-P√©rez, Virgilio L√≥pez Lemus, Esb√©rtido Rosendi Cancio, Ricardo River√≥n Rojas, Le√≥n de la Hoz, Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez-Larrea and Roberto Manzano. A new generation of poets made themselves known during the latter half of the 1980s, when those born after 1959 began to publish. This generation was also identified by their diversity and existed on equal terms with the preceding generations. This was a notable phenomenon‚Äîthe confluence of poets born after 1959 with many of those born in the 1940s and 1950s, all of whom continued contributing to a revitalized poetry, as can be seen, for example, in books by Mario Mart√≠nez Sobrino, Roberto Manzano and Luis Lorente. The stylistic and formal sign most distinctive of this last generation of poets had been decisively influenced by the poetic giants Jos√© Lezama Lima and Virgilio Pi√±era, to whom the majority of these poets recognize as maestros. Other writers who reached full maturity during these times were Sigfredo Ariel, Chely Lima, Jes√∫s David Curbelo, Antonio Jos√© Ponte, Rita Mart√≠n, Orlando Rossardi, Emilio Garc√≠a Montiel, Carlos Alfonso, Frank Abel Dopico, Damaris Calder√≥n, Teresa Melo, Nelson Sim√≥n, Juana Garc√≠a Abas, Ronel Gonz√°lez, Le√≥n Estrada, Reinaldo Garc√≠a Blanco, Rito Ram√≥n Aroche, Caridad Atencio, Ismael Gonz√°lez Casta√±er, Carlos Esquivel Guerra, Alpidio Alonso Grau, Alberto Sicilia Mart√≠nez, Ricardo Alberto P√©rez, Manuel Sosa, Sonia D√≠az Corrales, Norge Espinosa, Pedro Llanes, Edel Morales, Ar√≠stides Vega Chap√∫, Francis S√°nchez, Ileana √Ålvarez, Rigoberto Rodr√≠guez Entenza, Berta Kaluf, Luis Manuel P√©rez Boitel, Laura Ruiz, Odette Alonso, Dolan Mor, Alberto Lauro, William Navarrete, Carlos Pintado, Alfredo Zald√≠var, Yamil D√≠az and Edelmis Anoceto Vega. In the 1990s, a new current of Cuban lyric rose that broke with the colloquialism of the generation before and explored traditional verse forms and free verse with its rhythmic and expressive possibilities, in accordance with the work of preceding authors such as Jos√© Kozer. The canon of new poetry appeared in the independent magazine J√°cara, particularly the issue in 1995 that compiled an anthology of the generation. There were many young authors who participated in what amounted to a revolution of Cuban literature that distanced itself from political themes and created a clearer and more universal lyric. These poets included Luis Rafael, Jorge Enrique Gonz√°lez Pacheco, Celio Luis Acosta, Jos√© Luis Fari√±as, √Åsley L. M√°rmol, Aymara Aymerich, David Le√≥n, Arl√©n Regueiro, Liudmila Quincoses and Diusmel Machado. \\"The work of poets who emigrated from Cuba generally reflected the creative threads developed by the evolution of poetry taking place within Cuba. Many of these poets belonged to the Generation of the Fifty, such as Heberto Padilla, Belkis Cuza Mal√©, Juana Rosa Pita, Rita Geada, Jos√© Kozer, √Ångel Cuadra, Esteban Luis C√°rdenas and Amelia del Castillo. The majority of the most active authors were born between 1945 and 1959, and as a general rule they adopted the conversational tone and usually distanced themselves from the themes of aggressive, political militancy. Furthermore, they treated the island home with the nostalgia so typical of Cuban emigration poetry from Heredia to the present day. Any political components were very discreet. As a rule, they did not write a poetry of militancy against the Revolution like that which can be found in the lyrical work of Reinaldo Arenas, for example. Also, varieties of form, style and content were prominent, mostly because the territorial centers of these poets were more dispersed than those of the island, the central cities of immigrant Cubans being Miami, New York, Mexico City and Madrid. Two maestros of Cuban poetry, Eugenio Florit and Gast√≥n Baquero, were a part of this emigration, as well as Agust√≠n Acosta, Jos√© √Ångel Buesa, √Ångel Gaztelu, Justo Rodr√≠guez Santos and Lorenzo Garc√≠a Vega, among other figures of the national lyrical tradition.\\" Among the poets born after 1959, especially in the 1960s, and who resided outside Cuba were Antonio Jos√© Ponte, Mar√≠a Elena Hern√°ndez, Damaris Calder√≥n, Dolan Mor, Alessandra Molina, Odette Alonso and Rita Martin.  Narrative literature  By far the highest figure of Cuban narrative literature in the 20th century was Alejo Carpentier (1904‚Äì1980). Novelist, essayist and musicologist, he greatly influenced the development of Latin American literature, particularly by his style of writing, which incorporates several dimensions of imagination‚Äîdreams, myths, magic and religion‚Äîin his concept of reality. He won a Miguel de Cervantes Prize, regarded as a sort of Spanish-language Nobel Prize in Literature, and was nominated for a Nobel Prize. Jos√© Lezama Lima and Guillermo Cabrera Infante were two other important Cuban novelists of universal stature. = Novels = Toward the end of the 19th century, with the publication of Cecilia Vald√©s (1882) by Cirilo Villaverde and Mi t√≠o el empleado (1887) by Ram√≥n Meza, the Cuban novel began to lose its semblance. However, during the first 30 years of the 20th century, the production of novels was scarce. The most distinguished narrator during this time was Miguel de Carri√≥n, who built a readership around the subject of feminism in his novels Las honradas (1917) and Las impuras (1919). Other distinguished novels of this period were Juan Criollo (1927) by Carlos Loveira and Las impurezas de la realidad (1929) by Jos√© Anotonio Ramos. The Cuban novel could be said to have experienced a revolution by the mid-20th century, at the pinnacle of which came the publication of El reino de este mundo (1949) and El siglo de las luces (1962), both by Alejo Carpentier, along with authors such as Lino Nov√°s Calvo, Enrique Serpa, Carlos Montenegro, Enrique Labrador Ruiz, Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz, and Virgilio Pi√±era. In early works by Lisandro Otero, Humberto Arenal, Jaime Sarusky, Edmundo Desnoes and Jos√© Soler Puig, social realism converged with magic realism, absurdism and the \\"marvelous reality\\" of Carpentier. Another significant moment for Cuban novel writing occurred in 1966 with the publication of Paradiso by Jos√© Lezama Lima, not to mention other notable novels of the 1960s, such as Pailock, el prestigitador by Ezequiel Vieta, Celestino antes del alba by Reinaldo Arenas, Adire y el tiempo roto by Manuel Granados and Miguel Barnet‚Äôs part-historical, part- literary novel Biograf√≠a de un cimarr√≥n. Between 1967 and 1968, a significant burst of literature took place inside and outside of Cuba with works such as Tres tristes tigres by Guillermo Cabrera Infante, El mundo alucinante by Reinaldo Arenas and De donde son los cantantes by Severo Sarduy. The 1970s was a period of digression in the overall development of the Cuban novel. With the exception of Alejo Carpentier in his twilight, Severo Sarduy and the return of Jos√© Soler Puig with El pan dormido, the Cuban novel entered a low period characterized by Ambrosio Fornet. However, the novel Antes que anochezca by Reinaldo Arenas, especially its film adaptation, had an international impact. Neither Manuel Cofi√±o nor Miguel Cossio were able to come close to the caliber of the previous period. The nascent police novel still was not producing good results, and beginning novelists were too constrained by the superficial division between the Revolution‚Äôs past and present. Toward the end of the decade, the novel form began to recover with the first books written by Manuel Pereira, Antonio Ben√≠tez Rojo and Alfredo Antonio Fern√°ndez, who turned their attention to the Latin American \\"boom\\", at which time another genre was born inside and outside of Cuba‚Äîla memoria novelada (\\"fictionalized memory\\")‚Äîwith De Pe√±a Pobre by Cintio Vitier and La Habana para un infante difunto by Guillermo Cabrera Infante. Between 1983 and 1989, another change was effected that again brought the Cuban novel to national and international interest. Works including Un rey en el jard√≠n by Senel Paz, Temporada de √°ngeles by Lisandro Otero, Las iniciales de la tierra by Jes√∫s D√≠az and Oficio de angel by Miguel Barnet received acclaim from critics and readers during the phenomenon of a rebirth of Cuban novel writing. With regard to the current scene, debated studies from the International Colloquium \\"El mundo caribe√±o: retos y din√°micas\\" (\\"The Caribbean world: challenges and dynamics), which took place in June 2003 at the Michel de Montaigne University Bordeaux 3, concluded that we are now encountering \\"a literature that does not shut up or stop joking, a literature of disenchantment and natural pessimism that is very realist, sometimes violent, and that touches on themes that beforehand were taboo, inhibited and censured, such as homosexuality, religious discrimination, marginality, the incidents of the war in Angola, the debacle of socialism, double standards, new riches, corruption of the white collar class, prostitution, drugs, the uncertain future, the pain of exile, etc.\\" The symposium's distinguished authors included Leonardo Padura, Fernando Vel√°zquez Medina, Abilio Est√©vez, Miguel Mejides, Julio Travieso, Jorge Luis Hern√°ndez, Alexis D√≠az Pimienta, Ronaldo Men√©ndez, Mylene Fern√°ndez, David Mitrani Arenal, Arturo Arango, Guillermo Vidal, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Salvador, Reinaldo Montero, Alberto Garrand√©s, Eduardo del Llano, Rodolfo Alp√≠zar, Jes√∫s David Curbelo, Raul Aguiar, Luis Cabrera Delgado, Andr√©s Casanova, Ena Luc√≠a Portela, Alberto Garrido and Francisco L√≥pez Sacha.Le monde cara√Øbe: d√©fis et dynamiques.

Sous la direction de Christian Lerat. Universit√© Bordeaux 3, p. 171. However, there are many exiled authors whose works have gained enormous recognition and have spread internationally, such as Eliseo Alberto Diego, Da√≠na Chaviano, Antonio Orlando Rodr√≠guez, Pedro Juan Guti√©rrez, Zo√© Vald√©s, Antonio Jos√© Ponte, Amir Valle, Jocy Medina, Armando de Armas, Norberto Fuentes and Jos√© Manuel Prieto. Also, Uruguayan-born Daniel Chavarr√≠a lives in Cuba and has won multiple international prizes for his writings. = Short stories = The first book of integral short stories by a Cuban author was Lecturas de Pascuas by Esteban Borrero, published in 1899. For the next forty years, the genre began a slow rise on the island, and few are the authors who belonged to it: Jes√∫s Castellanos with De tierra adentro (1906), Alfonso Hern√°ndez Cat√° with Los frutos √°cidos (1915) and Piedras preciosas (1924), Luis Felipe Rodr√≠guez with La pascua de la tierra natal (1928) and Marcos Antilla (1932), and Enrique Serpa with Felisa y yo (1937). The period of maturity began in the 1930s, with writers who included Virgilio Pi√±era and his Cuentos Fr√≠os (1956), Alejo Carpentier with La guerra del tiempo (1958) and Onelio Jorge Cardoso with El cuentero (1958). Onelio Jorge Cardoso portrayed the simple life of the countryside and has been dubbed El Cuentero Mayor (\\"The Best Storyteller\\"). Among other works published before 1960 are Cayo Canas (1942), by Lino Nov√°s Calvo, El gallo en el espejo (1953), by Enrique Labrador Ruiz and As√≠ en la paz como en la guerra (1960) by Guillermo Cabrera Infante. \\"‚ÄúLos a√±os duros\\" by Jes√∫s D√≠az. From 1966 to 1970, many short story collections were written, including Condenados de Condado (1968), by Norberto Fuentes, Tiempo de cambio (1969) by Manuel Cofi√±o, Los pasos en la hierba (1970) by Eduardo Heras Le√≥n, D√≠as de guerra (1967) by Julio Travieso, Escambray en sombras (1969) by Arturo Chinea, Ud. s√≠ puede tener un Buick (1969) by Sergio Chaple and Los perseguidos (1970) by Enrique Cirules. The years from 1971 to 1975 are known as the \\"Quinquenio Gris\\" (roughly \\"Five-year Grey Period\\"). The National Congress of Education and Culture, held from April 23 to April 30 in 1971, set out to establish a policy to abolish the inquisitive and questioning role of literature, which bore negative consequences for the short story writing of those times. Despite that, works published during the five-year period include El fin del caos llega quietamente (1971) by √Ångel Arango, Onoloria (1973) by Miguel Collazo, Los testigos (1973) by Joel James and Caballito blanco (1974) by Onelio Jorge Cardoso. The decade of the 1970s finished its course with works that included Al encuentro (1975) by Omar Gonz√°lez, Noche de f√≥sforos (1976) by Rafael Soler, Todos los negros tomamos caf√© (1976) by Mirta Y√°√±ez, Los lagartos no comen queso (1975) by Gustavo Euguren, Acquaria (1975) by Guillermo Prieto, El arco de Bel√©n (1976) by Miguel Collazo, Acero (1977) by Eduardo Heras Le√≥n and El hombre que vino con la lluvia (1979) by Pl√°cido Hern√°ndez Fuentes. Cuban short story writing continued to increase in the 1980s. Relevant books from this decade include El ni√±o aquel (1980) and El lobo, el bosque y el hombre nuevo by Senel Paz, Tierrasanta (1982) by Pl√°cido Hern√°ndez Fuentes, El jard√≠n de las flores silvestres (1982) by Miguel Mejides, Las llamas en el cielo (1983) by F√©lix Luis Viera, Donjuanes and Fabriles (1986) by Reinaldo Montero, Descubrimiento del azul (1987) by Francisco L√≥pez Sacha, Sin perder la ternura (1987) by Luis Manuel Garc√≠a M√©ndez, Se permuta esta casa (1988) by Guillermo Vidal, El diablo son las cosas (1988) by Mirta Y√°√±ez, Noche de s√°bado (1989) by Abel Prieto Jim√©nez, La vida es una semana (1990) by Arturo Arango and Ofelias by Aida Bahr. A true peak in publishing occurred from 1990 onward with the generation known as the \\"Nov√≠simos\\". Some of the members of this generation had already been published toward the end of the 1980s. They include Alberto Garrido, Jos√© Mariano Torralbas, Amir Valle, Ana Luz Garc√≠a Calzada, Rita Mart√≠n, Guillermo Vidal, Jes√∫s David Curbelo, Jorge Luis Arzola, Gumersindo Pacheco, Atilio Caballero, Roberto Ur√≠as, Rolando S√°nchez Mej√≠as, Sergio Cevedo, Alberto Rodr√≠guez Tosca and √Ångel Santiesteban. However, these writers only became established in the 1990s, a decade that gave rise to many authors: Alberto Guerra Naranjo, Alexis D√≠az-Pimienta, David Mitrani Arenal, Alberto Garrand√©s, Jos√© Miguel S√°nchez (Yoss), Ver√≥nica P√©rez K√≥nina, Ra√∫l Aguiar, Ricardo Arrieta, Ronaldo Men√©ndez, Eduardo del Llano, Michel Perdomo, Alejandro √Ålvarez, Daniel D√≠az Mantilla, Ena Luc√≠a Portela, Waldo P√©rez Cino, Antonio Jos√© Ponte, Karla Su√°rez, Jorge √Ångel P√©rez, Mylene Fern√°ndez Pintado, Adelaida Fern√°ndez de Juan, Anna Lidia Vega Serova, Gina Picart, Carlos Esquive Guerral, F√©lix S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez, Marcial Gala, Rogelio River√≥n, Jorge √Ångel Hern√°ndez, Lorenzo Lunar, Marco Antonio Calder√≥n Echemend√≠a, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Salvador, Pedro de Jes√∫s L√≥pez, Luis Rafael Hern√°ndez, Michel Encinosa and Juan Ram√≥n de la Portilla. Essays Cuba has an important tradition of essay writing that began in the first half of the 19th century and includes many world-famous authors. Some of the most renowned essayists were Alejo Carpentier, Jos√© Lezama Lima, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Ramiro Guerra, Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring, Cintio Vitier, Jorge Ma√±ach, Graziella Pogolotti and Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar. Before 1959, essayists who stand out are the ethnographer Fernando Ortiz, author of works including Az√∫car y Poblaci√≥n de las Antillas (1927) and Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el az√∫car (1940); Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring with works such as Cuba no debe su independencia a los Estados Unidos (1950); Jos√© Lezama Lima with Analecta del reloj (1953) and Tratados en La Habana (1958). Among many other writers of note are Jorge Ma√±ach, Ramiro Guerra, Juan Marinello, Medardo Vitier, Jos√© Antonio Portuondo, Carlos Rafael Rodr√≠guez and Ra√∫l Roa. During the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, the development of essay writing accelerated, with dozens of writers cultivating the genre: Cintio Vitier, Fina Garc√≠a Marruz, Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar,Roberto Friol, Rolando P√©rez (Cuban poet), Ambrosio Fornet, Graziella Pogolotti, Adelaida de Juan, Rine Leal, Leonardo Acosta, Justo C. Ulloa, Enrico Mario Santi, Rafael Rojas, Jorge Luis Arcos, Enrique Sainz, Luis √Ålvarez, Ra√∫l Hern√°ndez Nov√°s, Virgilio L√≥pez Lemus, Enrique Ubieta G√≥mez, Alberto Garrand√©s, Beatriz Maggi, Emilio Ichikawa, Madeline C√°mara, Rita Mart√≠n and Vitalina Alfonso. Women's literature =Post-Revolution= After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, writers of all backgrounds were challenged by the material constraints that immediately took place. Supplies such paper and ink were difficult to come by, and the lack of materials was compounded by the lack of publishing and binding houses. Though such companies had existed within the private sector, at the time of the Revolution, these businesses were in the process of being nationalized by the new Cuban government. The result was that immediately after the Revolution, no Cuban publishing houses existed that were capable of sustainably carrying out the publishing and binding needs of the Cuban body of writers, though some were available to do ‚Äúshort runs‚Äù of several hundred copies. This may help to explain why women writers in Cuba experienced a publishing lull, though creatively and culturally encouraged through the establishment of Casa de Las Am√©ricas and Imprenta Nacional in 1959. Despite these challenges, the establishment of free education allowed for a drastically higher literacy rate, so writers had wider and more diverse audiences than ever before. Such developments are thought to contribute to the \\"boom\\" in women's writing that occurred in the 1970s, especially among younger women writers.Davies, Catherine, A Place in the Sun?: Women Writers in Twentieth-Century Cuba. New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press. 1997, p. 117. Cuban women writers have been able to change Cuban national discourse by reexamining themes that many people thought the Cuban Revolution of 1959 had put to rest. Their writing is diverse, and no one perspective, technique, or medium can be said to be characteristic of women's literature in Cuba. Poetry is by far the most widely used genre for Cuban women writers, followed by the short story, although they work within genres such as testimonial literature, autobiography, essay, and the novel as well.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 124. Their subject matter and treatment of such are exceptionally varied. They do, however, hold in common several themes especially prevalent in their works. One such collection of themes is that of the social construction of motherhood, sexuality, and the female body. During the decades immediately following the Cuban Revolution, women were encouraged to embody ideals such as self-sufficiency and moral superiority as a mother figure.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), pp. 199-200. A growing trend in the depiction of motherhood is that of a mother and daughter pair alienated from one another, in which the writer rejects the assumption that a mother is perfect or that she is a symbol of home or nurturing love. Lina de Feria subverts the idea of the tender mother figure in her poem \\"Protected from the Years\\", in which the mother is a source of anxiety, and is someone whose accusations she must hide from to survive. Georgina Herrera speaks of a void between herself and her mother in \\"Mami\\", which scholar Catherine Davies characterizes as an overwhelming sense of \\"lack\\" surrounding the mother figure.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 205. Depictions range from merely distant to sometimes disparaging, but in doing so, these writers are asserting the freedom of the mother figure to be human, imperfect, and of her own free will or desire. This is not to say that all Cuban women writers illustrate mothers negatively‚ÄîNancy Morejon, for example, is known for her \\"matrilineal consciousness\\" which subverts the idea of the patriarchal male in its own right. She does this though her preference to trace ancestry and formation of identity through her mother, which reinforces a female solidarity.Adentro, Mirar. Looking Within. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2003, p. 31. Female eroticism in literature has been another tactic used to reinforce feminine subjectivity, even as early as the beginning of the 20th century, although the views of such literature, as well as the views expressed within it, have changed. Until as recently as the 1980s, topics such as female sexuality (especially if it was homosexual or happened outside of marriage) as well as female sexual desire were considered taboo.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 119. Women writers have attempted to empower themselves by expressing a woman's sexual desire, and showing her as an assertive and sometimes aggressive sexual partner. In Marilyn Bobes short story \\"Somebody Has to Cry\\", for which she won the 1995 Casa de las Am√©ricas Prize, differing points of view are utilized to discuss the stories of multiple characters. These characters deal with real problems, such as the tragedy of unwanted pregnancy from rape, or adultery. The story buzzes with sexual consciousness, focusing on women's views of their bodies, as well as the objectification that comes with beauty.Yanez, Mirta (ed.), Cubana: Contemporary Fiction by Cuban Women. Boston: Beacon Press, 1998, p. 22. Renowned poet Nancy Morejon is known for, among many other things, her depictions of lesbian love, further reorienting the perspective and asserting the right to agency. Afro-Cuban women writers found their voices after the revolution, fueled by the national effort to define Cuban culture. An additional factor to their booming success was the increased access to greater educational opportunities than ever before for all Cubans through the free education system. These works often seek to subvert the traditional stereotypes toward mulatto women, especially the idea of the exotic, sexualized mulatta that dominated representations of mulatto women before the revolution. An especially famous example is that of the 19th-century character Cecilia Vald√©s from the novel of the same name, who is also known as \\"the little bronze virgin\\". She embodies sexuality and sensuality, as well as the perceived danger to marriages and families that might be damaged by her seductive ways.Gonzales, Reynaldo, \\"A White Problem: Reinpterpreting Cecilia Valdes\\", in Pedro Perez Sarduy & Jean Stubbs (eds), Afrocuba: An Anthology of Cuban Writing on Race, Politics and Culture, New York: Ocean Press, 2005. 200. This has been combated by reorienting the perspective to that of the woman herself, which reinstates her subjectivity and denies such discourses that make her an object or commodity.Davies, Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 172. Often the writer identifies sources of strength through cultural means, such as in the poem \\"Ofumelli\\" by Excilia Salda√±a, in which a mulatto woman, prized as a sexual object, is able to fall back on her Lucumi religion as a source of power, and rains down curses against her oppressor.Gonzales, Reynaldo. \\"A White Problem: Reinpterpreting Cecilia Valdes\\", in Sarduy & Stubbs, Afrocuba (2005), p. 61. Another theme throughout AfroCuban women's literature is the idea of the African motherland. Mother Africa is sometimes depicted as a physical mother figure, such as Minerva Salado‚Äôs poem \\"Song of the Acana Tree\\" in which the author expresses kinship with Africa. With other writers, such as poet Nancy Morejon, mother Africa represents what Mirar Adentro calls the \\"theme of origin\\".Adentro, Looking Within (2003), p. 47. From this second perspective, Cuba is the homeland, and Africa is the historical root that helps to explain identity. A consciousness of the past, including African heritage and slavery, are part of the construction of character today, which is often expressed by Morejon's poetry. Two famous examples of such poetry by Morejon are \\"Black Woman\\" and \\"I Love My Master\\", which illustrate traits that are characteristic of Morejon's poetry: they call upon historical events and collective experiences to help establish identity as an AfroCuban and as a woman.Adentro, Looking Within (2003), pp. 196-203. Though such themes are prevalent among black and mulatta women writers, even white female writers often focus on themes of Africa and African cultural roots‚ÄîMinerva Salado is one example.Davies, A Place in the Sun?, (1997), p. 165. Some have explained this unique characteristic of Cuban literature as stemming from the fact that Cuban national culture is a transcultured one, in which neither the Spanish or African cultural elements are dominated or eliminated, but instead combined into a cohesive new culture.Ortiz, Fernando. \\"For a Cuban Integration of Whites and Blacks\\", in Sarduy & Stubbs, Afrocuba (2005), p. 29. This unique characteristic allows non-black Cuban women to identify with the themes of AfroCuban women, and Davies argues that the real question is simply to what extent each author identifies with Africa and how she identifies herself as a Cuban.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 170. The Special Period that began in the 1990s posed a considerable challenge to Cuban women writers. Paper and materials were scarce, and dwindling housing opportunities meant that many Cuban women had little personal space in which to write, as many lived in often cramped multi-generational homes. Hand-made ‚Äúplaquettes‚Äù have helped to keep women's literature afloat until joint publishing ventures could accommodate the needs of writers. Many Cuban writers endeavored to publish in other countries, such as France and Mexico. Despite serious setbacks, Cuban women writers have continued to write, develop, and go on to win national and international claim, including the National Critics Prize and the Casa de las Am√©ricas Prize.Davies, A Place in the Sun? (1997), p. 224. Children's literature Literature written for children and young readers in Cuba started around the beginning of the 19th century. In the works of two poets, Jos√© Manuel Zequeira and Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia, lyrical elements identified with this genre can be found, while Heredia's El ruise√±or, el pr√≠ncipe y el ayo was written completely for children. Others children's writers of the century include Cirilo Villaverde with El librito de los cuentos y las conversaviones (1847), Eusebio Guiteras Fonts with his reading books used as official texts in elementary education, and Francisco Javier Balmaceda with F√°bulas morales (1861). However, in the 19th century, the genre gained momentous value only with the works of Jos√© Mart√≠ and primarily his collection of poems entitled Ismaelillo (1882), besides other poems and short stories published in the magazine La edad de oro (1889). Literature for children and young people continued to be written in the first half of the 20th century. To this period belong Dulce Mar√≠a Borrero and her Cantos escolares, Emilio Bacard√≠ Moreu with Cuentos de todas las noches (published posthumously in 1950), Ren√© Potts with Romancero de la maestrilla (1936) and Emma P√©rez T√©llez with Ni√±a y el viento de ma√±ana (1938) and Isla con sol (1945). However, the most prominence was achieved by Hilda Perera Soto with Cuentos de Apolo (1947), a central work within children's literature in Cuba. The 1940s also saw Ra√∫l Ferrer and his Romancillo de las cosas negras y otras poemas. Dora Alonso became known in the 1950s, especially with the play Pelus√≠n del Monte, named after the main character, a puppet that went on to become a national icon. Two important authors appeared in the 1970s: Renee M√©ndez Capote, who wrote Memorias de una cubanita que naci√≥ con el siglo (1963), and Herminio Almendros with Otros viejos (1965) and Hab√≠a una vez (1968). Two paradigmatic books published in 1974 were Juegos y otros poemas by Mirta Aguirre and Caballito Blanco (short stories) by Onelio Jorge Cardoso. Afterward, other essential works were published, such as Por el mar de las Antillas anda un barco de papel (1978) by Nicol√°s Guill√©n, Palomar (1979) by Dora Alonso, El libro de Gabriela (1985) by Adolfo Mart√≠ Fuentes, Rueda la ronda (1985) by David Cherici√°n, So√±ar despierto (1988) by Eliseo Diego and La noche (1989) by Excilia Salda√±a. At present, Cuban children's literature has broadened and includes many others, such as Antonio Orlando Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Manuel Espino, Aram√≠s Quintero, Ivette Vian, Enid Vian, Emilio de Armas, Deysi Valls, Joel Franz Rosell, Julia Calzadilla, Julio M. Llanes, Freddy Artiles, Enrique P√©rez D√≠az, Alfonso Silva Lee, Luis Cabrera Delgado, Ren√© Fern√°ndez Santana, Emma Romeu, Nelson Sim√≥n, Ram√≥n Luis Herrera, Froil√°n Escobar, Esther Su√°rez, Jos√© Antonio Guti√©rrez Caballero, Omar Felipe Mauri, Niurki P√©rez Garc√≠a, Mildre Hern√°ndez Barrios, Nersys Felipe, Luis Rafael Hern√°ndez, Teresa C√°rdenas Angulo, Luis Caiss√©s and Magali S√°nchez. Afrocubanismo During the 1920s and 1930s Cuba experienced a movement geared towards Afro-Cuban culture called Afrocubanismo.Arnedo- G√≥mez, M. \\"Introduction\\", Writing Rumba. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2006, p. 1. The beauty of Afrocubanismo in literature is that is captures something indispensably Cuban. It incorporates the islanders‚Äô African roots while mixing it with their own creativity to produce something that is truly magical. They have all grown up with rhythm as a daily part of their life, so the incorporation of rhythm into literature was a rather smooth transition. The idea of introducing rhythm into literature was brought about by several Cuban composers who were also writers. Alejandro Garc√≠a Caturla, Amadeo Rold√°n, and Gilberto Vald√©s were all interested in supporting black culture as well as adding musical elements to written word. Composers Eliseo and Emilio Grenet also established a bridge between the literature and the music of the afrocubanismo movement. Using onomatopoeia, the goal of rhythmic literature is to get the reader to experience the reading like a dance without using actual instruments. Afro-Cuban music genres such as the rumba, afro and son were particularly important during the afrocubanismo movement. The claves, a percussion instrument, was the main inspiration for incorporating rhythm within Cuban literature.Garc√≠a, C. \\"Introduction\\", Cuban√≠smo! New York: Vintage Books, 2002: xiv. It sounds very different from Western percussion rhythm and was a way to introduce African rhythm into art. These characteristics of the clave and the importance of dance to the Cuban people became a catalyst for integrating musical patterns into their literature, especially within poetry.

Holland, one of the early developers of the area in which the station was located. It was originally built by the Long Island Rail Road at Holland Avenue and Beach 92nd Street between May and June 1880 along the Rockaway Beach Branch for the nearby Holland Hotel, and was also a trolley stop of the Ocean Electric Railway. It was rebuilt in 1899, and again in 1914 with a baggage storage facility. Like much of the Rockaway Beach Branch and part of the former Far Rockaway Branch, it was closed in 1941 and rebuilt as an elevated station in 1942, only to be purchased by the New York City Transit Authority on October 3, 1955 and reopened as a subway station on June 28, 1956.

It allowed people to send and receive money from a mobile device or desktop computer . In 2018, Android Pay and Google Wallet were unified into a single pay system called Google Pay. Google Pay Send, a feature included inside Google Pay, has replaced the Google Wallet service. Service Google Pay is structured to allow its patrons to send money to each other. To send money, a Google Pay user enters the email address or phone number of the recipient. The recipient must then link that phone number or email address to a bank account in order to access those funds. If the recipient also has a Google Pay account, the funds will post to that account directly. Users can link up to two bank accounts when the Wallet account is created. Received money goes to the Google Pay Balance and stays there until the user decides to cash out to a linked account. The Google Pay app is available for free from either Google Play or the App Store. After downloading the app, the user creates a four- digit personal identification number (PIN) for managing everything within their Google Pay account. The PIN verifies access to the Wallet app on the user's mobile device. Before it was discontinued on June 30, 2016, the Google Wallet Card was recognized by the Cirrus network operated by MasterCard (rather than the Plus network operated by Visa). In September 2017, Google launched its first major payments service outside the United States, in Tez, India. =Regional availability= Google Pay Send is available only in the US and India . History = Early history = Logo of former Google Wallet brand, used in 2015. Google demonstrated the original version of the service at a press conference on May 26, 2011. The first app was released in the US only on September 19, 2011. On May 15, 2013, Google announced the integration of Google Wallet and Gmail, allowing users to send money through Gmail attachments. While Google Wallet is available only in the United States, the Gmail integration is currently available in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.226x226pxThe physical Google Wallet Card was an optional addition to the app which allowed users to make purchases at point-of-sale (in stores or online) drawing from funds in their Google Wallet account, attached debit card account, or bank account. The card could also be used to withdraw cash at ATMs with no Google-associated fee, and could be used like a debit card for virtually any purpose, including such things as renting a car. The Wallet Card was discontinued on June 30, 2016, and replaced with Android Pay. The original version of Google Wallet allowed users to make point-of-sale purchases with their mobile devices using near-field communication (NFC) technology. As of September 2015, however, Google dropped NFC from Google Wallet, offering the technology only through Android Pay, which is a separate application available only to Android users. As a result, any gift cards, loyalty programs, and promotional offers stored in an older version of Google Wallet could no longer be used. For Android users, those outstanding offers and gift cards were automatically transferred to Android Pay. For iOS users, instructions were provided to export the offers for alternative use. There were no reported security problems with the NFC technology. = Distinction from Android Pay = On February 23, 2015, Google announced that it would acquire the intellectual property of the carrier-backed competitor Softcard and integrate it into Google Wallet, and that American mobile network operators AT&T; Mobility, T-Mobile US, and Verizon Wireless would bundle the Google Wallet app on their compatible devices. The effective merger resulted in the new service known as Android Pay, a competitor to Apple Pay and similar NFC mobile payment service. Separate from Android Pay, Google Wallet now allows peer-to-peer transactions for cases such as when people want to split the cost of shared expenses, reimburse each other, keep track of joint spending, or give money as a gift or loan. While Android Pay is only available to Android users, Google Wallet is available on iOS and via Gmail as well. For those using Android, the two products together (Android Pay and Google Wallet) offer a comprehensive payments management system, a ‚Äútool for staying in charge of the bank account.‚Äù Users can link their bank accounts or debit cards to Android Pay and to their Google Wallet app. With this approach, users can manage their money from one source, with the ability to: * Pay at point-of-sale by tapping their phone (via Android Pay) * Send and receive money to other individuals for free (via the Google Wallet app) * Keep track of spending (through the optional Google Wallet Card)  Business model  Google does not charge users for access to Google Wallet. Sending and receiving money is free, as is adding money to a Wallet Card through a linked bank account. There are limits on how much money users can add to their Wallet Balance, withdraw from the linked account or card, or send and receive to other individuals. These limits are set per transaction and within certain time periods. Previously, a 2.9% fee applied to funds added via debit card, although Google dropped that ability as of May 2, 2016. Funds sent from a Wallet balance, debit card, or linked bank account are generally available to the recipient immediately, and if the recipient has his or her own Wallet account and card, he or she can make an immediate withdrawal of those funds from an ATM. If the funds are drawn on the sender's Wallet balance, the balance will also reflect this change immediately. Any portion of funds drawn via a linked bank account will take two or three days to actually post to that account, though these funds will show as \\"pending\\" withdrawals on that account within 24 hours. While Google does not have revenue coming in from the Wallet ecosystem (the web service, app, and the Wallet Card), the product is part of a larger suite of e-commerce products, including Android Pay, which integrates loyalty programs and promotions from other businesses. Security Google Wallet protects payment credentials by storing user data on secure servers and encrypting all payment information with industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology. Full credit and debit card information is never shown in the app. All Google Wallet users are also required to have a PIN to protect access to their Wallet account. The payments PIN is used for: * Gaining access to the Google Wallet app on a mobile device * Making point-of-sale purchases with a Google Wallet Card * Withdrawing cash with a Google Wallet Card at an ATM Google also recommends having a general passcode on mobile devices for additional security. In some cases, users have to verify their identity in order to make certain transactions. If prompted to do so, the user will visit the Wallet website and follow steps to ensure their accurate identity. This is in adherence with US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation financial regulations that require payment providers to ensure customer identity. If a Google Wallet Card is lost or stolen, users can immediately cancel access to it by signing into myaccount.google.com. Google also offers the additional flexibility of temporarily locking the card if a user suspects that the card has simply been misplaced. In the event of unauthorized transactions, Google Wallet Fraud Protection covers 100% of verified unauthorized transactions made in the US reported within 120 days of the transaction. Only US residents who have Wallet accounts associated with a US address are eligible for coverage under this policy. =Criticism= Regarding an earlier version of Google Wallet (in 2012), an analysis by security company Nowsecure revealed that some card information stored by Google Wallet was accessible outside of the application. It is suggested that hackers could create a way to intercept data by eavesdropping on Google Analytics, which monitors apps used on the Android OS. A previous analysis by the same firm revealed a number of other exploits that have since been fixed.Kevin Fogarty, Even after rewrites, Google Wallet retains gaping security holes, mainly due to Android, itworld, February 10, 2012. Privacy Privacy concerns include the storing of data regarding payment information, transaction details, payment attempts and other information stored by Google indefinitely. The privacy policy for Google Wallet, called the Google Payments Privacy Notice, indicates that much of the data is stored but may not be shared outside Google except under certain circumstances. Information that may be collected upon signing up includes credit or debit card number and expiration date, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, or taxpayer ID number. Information that may be collected about a transaction made through Google Wallet includes date, time, and amount of transaction, merchant's location and description, a description of goods or services purchased, any photo the user associates with the transaction, the names and email addresses of sender and recipient, the type of payment method used, and a description of the reason for the transaction if included. The storage of such personal information about users' transactions is of significant financial value to a company that earns much of its revenue from data, but may be controversial to users aware of the policies.Harley Geiger, NFC Phones Raise Opportunities, Privacy and Security Issues, Center for Democracy and Technology, April 11, 2011. Information collected is shared with Google's affiliates, meaning other companies owned and controlled by Google Inc., which can be used for their everyday business purposes. They provide the option to opt out of certain sharing capacities with these affiliates. Google states that it will only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following circumstances: * As permitted under the Google Privacy Policy * As necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account * To complete your registration for a service provided by a third party  PayPal lawsuit  Shortly after the launch of Google Wallet's first iteration in 2011, PayPal filed a lawsuit against Google and two former employees of PayPal ‚Äì Osama Bedier and Stephanie Tilenius. The complaint alleges \\"misappropriation of trade secrets\\" and \\"breach of fiduciary duty\\". The lawsuit revealed that Google had been negotiating with PayPal for two years to power payments on mobile devices. But just as the deal was about to be signed, Google backed off and instead hired the PayPal executive negotiating the deal, Bedier. The lawsuit noted that Bedier knew all of PayPal's future plans for mobile payments, as well as an internal detailed analysis of Google's weaknesses in the area. Not only that, it accused him of storing \\"confidential information in locations such as his non-PayPal computers, non-PayPal e-mail account, and an account on the remote computing service called 'Dropbox'.\\" Google ran a competitor to PayPal, Google Checkout, from 2006 to 2013. In 2011, Google Wallet replaced Checkout's services, and development on Checkout was discontinued in 2013.

It is served by the Rockaway Park Shuttle at all times and ten daily rush-hour only A trains. It is the least-used station out of all 424 stations in the New York City subway system, serving 88,439 passengers in 2019, an average of less than 250 people per day.  History  This station previously had six different names. It was originally opened by the Long Island Rail Road in 1880 as Seaside Station (also an earlier name for Babylon) for the Rockaway Beach Branch at 102nd Street. It also included a trolley stop of the Ocean Electric Railway, as well as an OER spur to the Neponsit-Rockaway Beach Branch. A second station at Beach 104th Street became its replacement in April 1888, only to be burned on September 20, 1892. The third station was built in 1892 and burned on August 29, 1893 during a storm, which ended up sparing the neighborhood around it. The fourth station was built in 1894 and renovated between April and May 1899. Like many of the stations on the Rockaway Beach and Far Rockaway Branches, it burned for a third time in 1941 and replaced with an elevated railroad station that opened in 1942. A 1950 fire at The Raunt destroyed the trestle across Jamaica Bay, forcing the LIRR to reroute Rockaway Beach service along the Far Rockaway Branch through the Hammels Wye for the next five years. This station was closed on October 3, 1955, purchased by the New York City Transit Authority, rebuilt and reopened as a subway station on June 28, 1956. In 1985, the station had only 262 paying daily riders on a typical weekday, not counting farebeaters, making it one of the least used stations in the system. As part of the 2010‚Äì2014 Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Program, new crossovers will be built at this station in order to provide resiliency in the event of major flooding, like from Hurricane Sandy. The crossovers would allow the station to be used as a terminal in the event that the terminal at Beach 116th Street was unavailable. In addition to the construction of the switches, a relay room will be built and new signals will be installed. Design work on the project started in August 2017, and will be finished in January 2019. Construction will start some time afterwards. Station layout Eastern stairs This elevated station has two tracks and two side platforms on a concrete viaduct. Both platforms have beige windscreens and canopies with green support columns in the center and full height fences at both ends. South of this station, the IND Rockaway Line descends to ground level. =Exits= The station's only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. It has a station agent booth, turnstile bank, waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, two staircases to each platform at the center, and two staircases going down to either side of Rockaway Freeway between Beach 105th and Beach 104th Streets. The two southern staircases are connected to the station house with a canopied overpass. The Rockaway Park- bound platform had an exit at the north end, which has been removed.

The AFGA was founded in 1908 when a group of anglers and hunters first met in Calgary, Alberta. It now claims to have about 14,000 members province-wide. The AFGA is a founding member of a number of sister conservation organizations. In 1962, along with representatives of the 9 other provinces, it helped found the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF). At the time it was felt that the organized hunters and anglers of Canada needed a national organization that would represent conservation. Today, it is still only the AFGA and its sister organizations from across Canada that constitute voting members of the CWF, although a significant amount of funds are raised from non-voting members. In 1997, the AFGA was instrumental in the founding of the Alberta Conservation Association (ACA). The ACA acts as a delegated administration organization at arm's length from government, and administers funds received primarily from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses. At the time, the provincial government was going through a significant reorganization, and $18 million that were in a designated fund for conservation were being threatened to be absorbed by the provincial Treasurer. As a representative of the hunters and anglers who pay into this fund, the AFGA continues to be involved with the ACA.

Early life  Kretov was born on 25 December 1919 to a Russian peasant family in Malaya Nichka. After moving to the city of Minusinsk in 1933 he went on to graduate from his seventh grade of school in 1936, after which he returned to his hometown to work on a collective farm until 1937. After completing a course at the Kansk Agricultural College in 1938 he worked as a clerk at the Kansk district NKVD office, but he left the position in 1939 for the Red Army after graduating from the local aeroclub. Initially he attended the Chita Military Aviation School of Pilots until September 1939, then he attended the Balashov Military Aviation School of Pilots which he graduated from in August 1940 before being posted to the 228th Long Range Bomber Aviation Regiment. However, he soon transferred to the 21st Long Range Bomber Aviation Regiment in January 1941.  World War II  Despite the threat of being grounded from flying due to anosmia, he was eventually cleared to fly, allowing him to make his first combat sortie during the war in June 1941 on a DB-ZA heavy bomber. In September, he managed to bring his crippled plane back to his home airfield after an aerial battle that took out one engines and punctured much of the fuselage. On 1 December his plane was pursued by multiple Messerschmitt fighters after bombing a target in Taganrog and eventually shot down, forcing him to bail out with of the burning plane over the sea. Despite severe burns to his hands, he was able to hang on to a floating log with other survivors from his crew, and they eventually managed to swim to the safety of shore. He returned to flying only ten days after the incident. In September 1943 his regiment received the guards designation, resulting in it being renamed as the 24th Guards Long Range Aviation Regiment, and that same month Kretov was nominated for his first gold star for totaling 284 sorties, of which all but 20 were at night. By then he had reached the position of squadron commander, but the month before the title was awarded on 13 March 1944 he participated in a long-distance bombing campaign targeting Helsinki intended to force Finland to drop out of the war. But not long after receiving the award he was demoted from squadron commander to ordinary pilot due to disciplinary violations, and transferred to the 24th Guards Long-Range Aviation Regiment. By the end of the war he totaled 400 sorties on the BD-Za and Il-4, all but 31 at night, targeting enemy forces in Moldova, Ukraine, Rostov, Crimea, Leningrad, Belarus, Poland, Budapest, and Koenigsberg. On 21 May 1945 he was nominated for a second gold star, but he did not receive it until February 1948.  Postwar  Despite his demotion in May 1944, Kretov was made squadron commander in the 240th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment, previously designated as the 24th Guards Long-Range Aviation Regiment in September 1945. One year later he was made deputy squadron commander in the 108th Bomber Aviation Regiment, where be became a squadron commander before eventually leaving for the Higher Officers Flight and Tactical School of Long- Range Aviation in 1950. Upon graduation later that year he became the head of the flight department of the 50th Air Army of Long-Range Aviation, and in April 1953 he moved on to the 11th Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment as the head of the combat training department, where he remained until March 1959. From then until September 1959 he was posted as commander of the 335th Missile Regiment, after which he commanded the 151st Missile Regiment until July 1961, both part of the Strategic Missile Forces.

In Russian history, Mestnichestvo (, ; from –º–µÃÅ—Å—Ç–æ, a position) was a feudal hierarchical system in Russia from the 15th to 17th centuries. Mestnichestvo was a complicated system of seniority which dictated which government posts a boyar could occupy. It was based on the individual's seniority within an extended Russian aristocratic family on the one hand, and on the order of precedence of the families, on the other. The hierarchy of families was calculated based on the historical records of senior appointments, going back to 1475 (Razriady). For example, the Odoevskys clan was ranked higher than the Buturlins, but a senior Buturlin could be appointed to a position equivalent to that occupied by a junior member of the Odoevsky family. The mestnichestvo seniority system was most visibly represented in the order of seating of the boyars at the tsar's table. The clans jealously guarded their status. This often led to bitter disputes and physical violence among nobles about their ancestry and their services to the monarch. According to eminent Russian 19th-century historian Vasily Klyuchevsky, \\"you could beat a boyar up, you could take away his property, you could expel him from government service, but you could never make him accept an appointment or a seat at the tsar's table lower than what he is entitled to.\\" http://www.spsl.nsc.ru/history/kluch/kluch27.htm Because of the mestnichestvo, otherwise qualified people who could not boast of sufficiently extended ancestry had no hope of getting an important state post. Additionally, a boyar from an old and respected family could get an important promotion even if personally unqualified. With the developing autocracy, where the core principle was the creation of a central bureaucracy reporting directly to the tsar, the role of the mestnichestvo was progressively reduced. Moreover, increasing defense needs required that the top military posts be occupied by capable officers, not ancestry-proud but inept boyars. Consequently, the mestnichestvo was abolished in 1682 by Feodor III of Russia. The available genealogical data was made public as the so-called Velvet Book, whereas the ancient pedigree books were burnt, to the great consternation and dismay of established boyar families. The abolition made it easier later for Peter the Great to reform and govern the state. However, one can not neglect the positive effects as ensuring elite loyalty and thus political cohesion and stability. Also, the state may have had more flexibility in appointments than critics of the system have suggested. Tsars were able to make appointments outside the mestnichestvo system which created positions as bez mest, or \\"without [reserved] places\\".

It drew its support mainly from indigenous Fijians in the Province of Ba and other Western regions, who were uneasy about potential domination by powerful chiefs from Eastern Fiji. It subsequently merged with the Federation Party, which was supported almost entirely by Indo-Fijians, to form the National Federation Party (NFP). The NFP was dominated by personnel from the former Federation Party, which was much larger than the NDP. The merger did, however, make it possible for the NFP to appeal to a section of the indigenous Fijian electorate. Although it never received more than 10 percent of the indigenous vote, it did elect some indigenous members to what became the House of Representatives following independence in 1970, owing to cross-voting in the renamed national constituencies (seats allocated by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage).

In the 2001 election the party gained less than 0.1 percent of the popular vote and won no constituencies. With some 76 percent of Indo-Fijians voting for the Fiji Labour Party and 22 percent for the National Federation Party, the JFP was squeezed out. In the 2006 elections, the party intended to run candidates in all 19 communal constituencies allocated to Indo-Fijians, and on 3 April published a manifesto promising to petition the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations to press the United Kingdom and Australia to accept responsibility for bringing Indians to Fiji during the colonial era. It also promised a F$10 million scholarship for Indo-Fijian students. The party would also push for dual citizenship to be allowed for Indo-Fijians living in Australia and the United Kingdom, and for British passports to be restored to Indo-Fijians living in Fiji, JFP General Secretary Dildar Shah said. On 7 April, however, it was announced that the JFP had decided to merge with the multiracial National Alliance Party of Fiji under the leadership of Ratu Epeli Ganilau.

He served as intelligence minister from 1989 to 1997 under the presidency of Ali Akbar Rafsanjani. Early life and education Fallahian was born in Najafabad, Iran, in 1945. He is a graduate of Haqqani school in Qom. Career In 1987 Fallahian was appointed by Ruhollah Khomeini as chief prosecutor of the Special Court for the Clergy and led the trial against Mehdi Hashemi. Fallahian served as a member of the 3rd Assembly of Experts of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was also the minister of intelligence in the cabinet of then President Rafsanjani from 1989 to 1997. After Fallahian left office, his senior deputy, Saeed Emami, was arrested for the murders of four dissidents in 1998 and 1999, Emami subsequently died in prison in what the authorities declared a suicide. Fallahian began to work in the office of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. =Presidential candidacy= Fallahian was a candidate in the 2001 presidential election, which was won by incumbent reformist Mohammad Khatami. Fallahian came in sixth place, receiving 0.2 percent of the vote; some observers have hypothesized that the cleric only entered the election in an effort to clear his name, which has been associated with murder and political suppression. On 19 February 2013, in Birjand, Fallahian announced his candidacy for the Iranian presidential election, saying that \\"people's requests to me [had] reached a threshold\\". Running with the campaign slogan of \\"Advanced Islamic Country\\", he said that his top priority would be the economy, focusing on fighting inflation and lowering the unemployment rate. He specified that he planned on continuing the subsidy reform plan, which many experts fault for undermining local businesses and the economy. Regarding diplomatic relations with the United States, he implied that he would seek improved ties, even suggesting to put an end to the uranium enrichment program, saying \\"enough of nuclear\\", as Iran had \\"already mastered its knowledge\\". He added that he envisioned a \\"bright horizon\\" for cooperation between the two countries, especially in creating stability in Afghanistan, Iraq, Tunisia, and Egypt. His nomination was rejected by the Guardian Council.

He is now the Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy in the new Department of Justice section. Early life Eli Rosenbaum was born on May 8, 1955. He grew up in Westbury, New York, and graduated from W. Tresper Clarke High School. He graduated summa cum laude in 1976 from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, from which he also received his MBA degree. He came to the Justice Department through the Honors Program after his graduation from Harvard Law School in 1980. Rosenbaum's parents were Irving and Hanni Rosenbaum. His father was a World War II veteran of the North African and European Theaters. After the war, while still serving in the U.S. Army, he questioned former Nazis and collaborators (such as the filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl), some of whom were subsequently tried at Nuremberg and elsewhere. Later, Irving Rosenbaum was a Manhattan-based philanthropist and the Chairman of the former S.E. Nichols Corp.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_department_stores_of_the_United_States Co-founded by Irving's father, Nichols Corp. owned and operated discount department stores in the eastern United States, competing with Kmart, Walmart, and other companies in that retailing sector. The company went public via an IPO in 1969, and by 1977 it was the 33rd largest discount retailer in the United States as measured by annual sales ($204 million). Career Rosenbaum was a trial attorney with OSI from 1980 to 1984. In 1984, he left the Department of Justice to work as a corporate litigator with the Manhattan law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and then as General Counsel of the World Jewish Congress. He later returned to OSI in 1988 where he was appointed Principal Deputy Director and then Director. In introducing the Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009 on July 20, 2009, Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) stated on the floor of the Senate: \\"Due to OSI‚Äôs outstanding work, the U.S. is the only country in the world to receive an ‚Äò‚ÄòA‚Äô‚Äô rating from the Simon Wiesenthal Center for bringing Nazi war criminals to justice. I especially want to commend Eli Rosenbaum, who has worked at OSI for more than two decades and has been OSI‚Äôs director since 1995. OSI‚Äôs success is due in large measure to Mr. Rosenbaum‚Äôs leadership and personal dedication to holding Nazi perpetrators accountable.\\"Text of Senator Durbin's remarks in the Senate upon introducing the Human Rights Enforcement Act, The Congressional Record, July 20, 2009, page S7702, available at: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-07-20/pdf/CREC-2009-07-20-pt1-PgS7699-3.pdf. On June 19, 1997, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-NY) praised Rosenbaum's work, and that of others, in connection with the then-ongoing Senate Banking Committee inquiry into looted Holocaust-era assets. Rosenbaum has been considered a \\"Nazi hunter\\" in his professional career and personal life. British historian Guy Walters has termed Rosenbaum ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most successful Nazi hunter,‚Äù adding that because of the extensive self-promotion activities of self-styled ‚Äúprivate‚Äù Nazi-hunters, ‚ÄúIt is telling that most readers will not have heard of [him] despite the fact that he and his organization have more than one hundred Nazi ‚Äòscalps‚Äô ‚Äì which is considerably more than the combined total of Simon Wiesenthal and every other Nazi hunter.‚Äù In his book Useful Enemies: John Demjanjuk and America's Open-Door Policy for Nazi War Criminals (Delphinium Books, 2013), Richard Rashke wrote (page 537), \\"As new revelations about Nazi war criminals and their collaborators find their way into the media, Americans who do care will have Eli Rosenbaum and [former U.S. congresswoman] Elizabeth Holtzman to thank.\\" The U.S. Justice Department Nazi-hunter character in Jodi Picoult's 2013 novel The Storyteller (which reached #1 on the New York Times fiction bestseller list), about the pursuit of an alleged Nazi war criminal in New England, was based loosely on Rosenbaum. In a Washington Post interview, Picoult called him ‚Äúa modern-day superhero.‚Äùhttps://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-26/entertainment/37310136_1_nazi- hunter-concentration-camp-nazi-officer Under his leadership, OSI was called \\"the most successful government Nazi-hunting organization on earth\\" (ABC-TV News, March 25, 1995) and \\"the world's most aggressive and effective Nazi- hunting operation\\" (The Washington Post, August 27, 1995), and the Simon Wiesenthal Center characterized OSI as the world's only \\"highly successful proactive prosecution program\\" in Nazi cases. USA Today reported (January 29, 1997) that OSI possessed \\"a tremendous success record, [having] uncovered and won more cases than any other Nazi-hunting operation in the world.\\" In 1997, Rosenbaum was selected by the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School to receive the school's Honorary Fellowship Award, presented annually to one attorney \\"who has distinguished himself or herself in commitment to public service\\" by \\"making significant contributions to the ends of justice at the cost of great personal risk and sacrifice.\\" He has also received the Anti- Defamation League's \\"Heroes in Blue\\" award and the Assistant Attorney General's Award for Human Rights Enforcement and the Criminal Division's Award for Special Initiative. Cases investigated and prosecuted under Rosenbaum's direction have resulted in deportations to Europe of Nazi perpetrators subsequently convicted there of participation in tens of thousands of Holocaust murders. On January 11, 2008, he was profiled as the weekly \\"Making a Difference\\" feature on NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams. Kurt Waldheim controversy Rosenbaum directed the World Jewish Congress investigation that resulted in the worldwide 1986 exposure of the Nazi past of former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, arguably the most \\"sensational\\" uncovering of a Nazi in postwar history. Rosenbaum was the primary author of Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Kurt Waldheim Investigation and Cover-Up, a book which was selected for \\"Notable Books of 1993\\" by The New York Times and \\"Best Books of 1993\\" by The San Francisco Chronicle and which demonstrates that Waldheim was involved in the commission of Nazi war crimes while serving in the German military as an officer under the Nazi regime and postulates a Soviet-Yugoslav conspiracy to help whitewash his history. After the war, Waldheim became Austria's foreign minister and its United Nations ambassador. At the time of his exposure at the hands of Rosenbaum, Waldheim had served most prominently as Secretary General of the United Nations and was a candidate for the presidency of Austria (an election that he won in 1987 despite the exposure of his Nazi past). He was never officially considered to be a suspect by the Austrian Government in any war crimes, but he was banned from entering the United States as a result of a U.S. Government investigation in 1986-87 that concluded that he was complicit in the perpetration of Nazi crimes during World War II.http://www.justice.gov/criminal/hrsp/archives/1987/04-09-87waldheim-rpt.pdf Writing in The New York Times on February 16, 2014, Joseph R.

The centre hosted live shows and films of the arthouse and world cinema genres. It would have been flattened years ago if not for the work of Julian Wright in the 1980s and again, upon his return from abroad in the 2000s. In 2010, after a new Phoenix Square opened on the other side of the city centre, it became the Upper Brown Street Theatre, a music training and performance venue. It has since been re-branded as Sue Townsend Theatre, in honour of the late Leicester author and playwright, Sue Townsend.  History  In 1963 Leicester City Council (LCC), identifying a gap in cultural provision for live performances, built a 262-seat theatre in Leicester. The Phoenix Theatre was intended to be a temporary solution until a more permanent theatre could be established. Directors included Clive Perry, Michael Bogdanov, Chris Martin, Ian Giles, Sue Pomeroy, Graham Watkins, Paul Wetherby and Adrian Bean, and actors such as Richard Eyre, Nigel Bennett, Roberta Kerr, Heather Sears, Perry Cree, Anthony Hopkins and Greta Scacci have all performed in the venue. Its artistic philosophy was to be a theatre for the Leicester community, not only presenting \\"in house\\" productions but also touring Leicestershire with dance and small-scale theatre productions. Notable in the touring work were productions about the travelling community and about substance abuse. At its greatest strength in the early 1980s, employing around 80 people, the company consisted of a main acting troupe, a touring company called \\"Flying Phoenix\\", and a touring dance company, \\"Phoenix Dance\\". It developed new writers, notably Sue Townsend, and premiered many productions that went on to national acclaim in the 1980s, such as \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole\\". During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the theatre also played host to annual revues performed by the Leicester University Revue & Theatre Society (R.A.T.S.), featuring such cult comedy performers as Nick \\"Tubby\\" Griffiths. In 1973 a permanent theatre called the Haymarket Theatre (Leicester) was built. Continuing support for the Phoenix Theatre ensured that it remained functional. It was renamed the Phoenix Arts Centre and functioned alongside the Haymarket until 1987. At this time financial issues forced the LCC to reconsider the position of the Phoenix Arts Centre, but a decision for closure was averted in 1988 by support from Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University) and the LCC, and whilst the Phoenix stopped being a producing theatre, it continued as a venue for contemporary art, film and live performances. The Phoenix was due to close in the summer of 2009 and be replaced by a new building, Phoenix Square, in the Cultural Quarter of the city. However, local musician Julian Wright campaigned successfully in stopping Leicester City Council from selling the site. In June 2009, the Council asked for bids from arts groups for a five-year lease. Under the terms of the lease the showing of films and professional theatre productions would not be permitted, as they might compete with Phoenix Square and Leicester's new Curve Theatre respectively. The winning bid, announced on 12 November, was made by a group comprising Leicester College and four local music promoters. Social enterprise organisation Leicester Stride, a major element in one of the other bids, has been invited to play a part in the centre's future. On 6 March 2010, the Leicester Mercury announced that the centre had been renamed the Upper Brown Street campus of Leicester College. Leicester property developer Norman Gill gave ¬£25,000 towards the refurbishment through the Norman Gill Charitable Trust. The theatre re-opened in 2010. As well as performances from Leicester College learners on Performing Arts and Music and Sound courses, the Upper Brown Street venue hosts shows and acts from external performers. In 2011, Upper Brown Street saw its first full-scale musical production, Hairspray. The production was created by Leicester College students from all courses. Prior to this, first year students performed Stephen Sondheim's \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\\". In 2015, the theatre was once again re-branded as the Sue Townsend Theatre, which coincided with the opening of Curve's production of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. In honour of the late playwright, students produced a version of Womberang.

As a food additive, hypromellose is an emulsifier, thickening and suspending agent, and an alternative to animal gelatin.NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI: Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Its Codex Alimentarius code (E number) is E464. Chemistry Hypromellose is a solid, and is a slightly off-white to beige powder in appearance and may be formed into granules. The compound forms colloids when dissolved in water. This non-toxic ingredient is combustible and can react vigorously with oxidizing agents.Safety data for hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose Hypromellose in an aqueous solution, like methylcellulose, exhibits a thermal gelation property. That is, when the solution heats up to a critical temperature, the solution congeals into a non-flowable but semi-flexible mass. Typically, this critical (congealing) temperature is inversely related to both the solution concentration of HPMC and the concentration of the methoxy group within the HPMC molecule (which in turn depends on both the degree of substitution of the methoxy group and the molar substitution). That is, the higher the concentration of the methoxy group, the lower the critical temperature. The inflexibility/viscosity of the resulting mass, however, is directly related to the concentration of the methoxy group (the higher the concentration is, the more viscous or less flexible the resulting mass is).  Uses  There are many fields of application for hypromellose, including:Example properties and applications of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose * Tile adhesives * Cement renders * Gypsum products * Pharmaceutical * Paints & coatings * Food * Cosmetics * Detergents & cleaners * Eye drops * Contact lenses =Use in whole grain breads= Agricultural Research Service scientists are investigating using the plant-derived HPMC as a substitute for gluten in making all-oat and other grain breads. Gluten, which is present in wheat, rye, and barley is absent (or present only in trace quantities) in oat and other grains. Like gluten, HPMC can trap air bubbles formed by the yeast in bread dough, causing the bread to rise. =Use in construction materials= HPMC is used primarily in construction materials like tile adhesives and renders where it is used as a rheology modifier and water retention agent. Functionally HPMC is very similar to HEMC (hydroxy ethyl methyl cellulose) Trade names include Methocel and Walocel. The global leading producer is now DuPont, formerly manufactured under Dow Wolff Cellulosics GmbH. =Ophthalmic applications= Hypromellose solutions were patented as a semisynthetic substitute for tear-film.US Pat. No. 5,679,713 Its molecular structure is predicated upon a base celluloid compound that is highly water-soluble. Post-application, celluloid attributes of good water solubility reportedly aid in visual clarity. When applied, a hypromellose solution acts to swell and absorb water, thereby expanding the thickness of the tear-film. Hypromellose augmentation therefore results in extended lubricant time presence on the cornea, which theoretically results in decreased eye irritation, especially in dry climates, home, or work environments. On a molecular level, this polymer contains beta-linked D-glucose units that remain metabolically intact for days to weeks. On a manufacturing note, since hypromellose is a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, it is slightly more expensive to produce due to semisynthetic manufacturing processes. Aside from its widespread commercial and retail availability over the counter in a variety of products, Hypromellose 2% solution has been documented to be used during surgery to aid in corneal protection and during orbital surgery. =Excipient/tableting ingredient= In addition to its use in ophthalmic liquids, hypromellose has been used as an excipient in oral tablet and capsule formulations, where, depending on the grade, it functions as controlled release agent to delay the release of a medicinal compound into the digestive tract. It is also used as a binder and as a component of tablet coatings. Test methods Various benchmark tests are used to qualify hypromellose: * Viscosity * Degree of substitution (DS) * Molar substitution (MS) * Salt content * Moisture =Viscosity test methods= Because hypromellose solution is a non-newtonian solution and exhibits pseudoplastic, more specifically, thixotropic behavior, various test methods are available, and the results of different methods and viscosimeters do not necessarily correspond to each other. Also, due to viscometer acceptable ranges of error, viscosity is typically given as a mean, or as a range. Typical viscosity test will specify the following: *Solution concentration (1%, 2%, 1.9% bone dry, etc.) *Viscometer (RheoSense m-VROC and microVISC, Brookfield LV or RV, H√∂ppler falling ball, Haake Rotovisco, etc.) *Viscometer spindle number (1 ~ 4 for Brookfield LV, 1 ~ 7 for Brookfield RV, etc.) *Solution Temperature (20 ¬∞C, 25 ¬∞C, etc.) =Degree of substitution= Degree of substitution is the average level of methoxy substitution on the cellulose chain. Since there are maximum three possible sites of substitution with each cellulose molecule, this average value is a real number between 0 and 3. However, degree of substitution is often expressed in percentages. =Molar substitution= Molar substitution is the average level of hydroxypropoxy substitution on the cellulose chain. Since hydroxypropoxy base can be attached to each other on side chains and does not each require a base substitution site on the cellulose molecule, this number can be higher than 3. However, molar substitution is also often expressed in percentages. =Moisture= Since all cellulose ethers are hygroscopic, they will absorb moisture from surroundings if left exposed from original packaging. Thus, moisture must be tested and weight corrected to ensure adequate amount of dry active material are apportioned for usage. Moisture is tested by weighing a sample of X grams on an analytic scale, and drying the sample in an oven at 105 ¬∞C for 2 hours, then weighing the sample again on the same scale.

The erect trunk is slender and may be up to 3 m tall. Fronds are bipinnate and 1‚Äì2 m long. Characteristically of this species, the final pair of pinnae are usually reduced and occur towards the base of the stipe. These, along with the stipe bases, are persistent and retained around the trunk long after withering. The stipe itself is dark and covered with scales, which are either small, dull and brown or large, dark and glossy. Sori occur near the midvein of fertile pinnules and lack indusia. Fertile pinnules are notably smaller than sterile ones. A. atropurpurea is very similar to Alsophila ramispina and may in fact represent the same species. It differs only in its smaller pinnae and pinnules, as well as other frond details.

Plot summary During the siege of Richmond, Virginia, in the American Civil War, five northern prisoners of war decide to escape in a rather unusual way - by hijacking a balloon. The group eventually crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown (and fictitious) island, located in the South Pacific. They name it \\"Lincoln Island\\" in honour of American President Abraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, nitroglycerine, iron, a simple electric telegraph, and even a seaworthy ship. They also manage to find their geographical location. The mystery of the island seems to come from periodic and inexplicable deus ex machinas: the unexplainable survival of Smith from his fall from the balloon, a box full of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and so on. A crew of pirates arrives at the Lincoln Island to use it as their hideout. After some fighting with the heroes, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion, and the pirates themselves are found dead, apparently in combat, but with no visible wounds. The secret of the island is revealed when it turns out to be Captain Nemo's hideout, and home harbour of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo had been the savior of the heroes, sending a message about a fellow castaway, torpedoing the pirate ship.

In contrast, a port which rejects connections or ignores all packets directed at it is called a closed port.Pcmag.com encyclopedia term Ports are an integral part of the Internet's communication model ‚Äî they are the channel through which applications on the client computer can reach the software on the server. Services, such as web pages or FTP, require their respective ports to be \\"open\\" on the server in order to be publicly reachable. The above use of the terms \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" can sometimes be misleading, though; it blurs the distinction between a given port being reachable (unfiltered) and whether there is an application actually listening on that port. Technically, a given port being \\"open\\" (in this context, reachable) is not enough for a communication channel to be established. There needs to be an application (service) listening on that port, accepting the incoming packets and processing them. If there is no application listening on a port, incoming packets to that port will simply be rejected by the computer's operating system. Ports can be \\"closed\\" (in this context, filtered) through the use of a firewall. The firewall will filter incoming packets, only letting through those packets for which it has been configured. Packets directed at a port which the firewall is configured to \\"close\\" will simply be dropped in transit, as though they never existed. Some malicious software acts as a service, waiting for connections from a remote attacker in order to give him information or control over the machine. It is common security practice to close unused ports in personal computers, so as to block public access to any services which might be running on the computer without the user's knowledge, whether due to legitimate services being misconfigured, or the presence of malicious software. Malicious (\\"black hat\\") hackers (or crackers) commonly use port scanning software to find which ports are \\"open\\" (unfiltered) in a given computer, and whether or not an actual service is listening on that port.

There seems to be no authoritative account of the number of 78 rpm records of this recording sold by Victor; but it seems likely that the number would have exceeded the sheet music sales, making it the first million-selling record of Cuban (or even Latin) music.1931 in music#Top hits on record. Helio Orovio, in Cuban music from A to Z (2004 translation, p36, top) describes it as \\"selling a million copies for the RCA Victor label\\"; Don Azpiaz√∫'s son Raul suggested it sold 5-10 million copies: liner notes to Harlequin HQ CD 10 Don Azpiazu. However, this is not definitive, and the text is more reserved. The lyrics were in a style based on street vendors' cries, a preg√≥n; and the rhythm was a son, so technically this was a son-preg√≥n. On the record label, however, it was called a rhumba-fox trot, not only the wrong genre, but misspelled as well.perhaps to represent the Spanish pronunciation of 'u'. After this, the term rhumba was used as a general label for Cuban music, as salsa is today, because the numerous Cuban terms were not understood abroad. Rhumba was easy to say and remember. On the published score both music and lyrics are attributed to Simons, though there is a persistent story that they were written by Gonzalo G. de Mello in Havana the night before Montaner was due to record it in New York. Crist√≥bal D√≠az says \\"For various reasons, we have doubts about this version... 'El manisero' was one of those rare cases in popular music where an author got immediate and substantial financial benefits... logically Mello would have tried to reclaim his authorship of the lyrics, but that did not occur.\\" D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1988. Si te quieres por el pico divertir: historia del preg√≥n musical latinoamericano. Cubanacan, San Juan P.R. p238 [rough transl. by contributor] The second attack on the authorship of the lyrics came from none other than the great Fernando Ortiz. For Ortiz, the true author was an unknown Havana peanut seller, of the second half of the 19th century, who served as the basis for a danza written by Gottschalk.Ortiz, Fernando 1954. In Revista Bohemia, March 14. Of course, it may well be that elements of the song were to be found in real life. The English lyrics are by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Marion Sunshine; the latter was Azpiaz√∫'s sister-in-law, who toured with the band in the U.S.A. as singer. The English lyrics are, in the opinion of Sublette, of almost unsurpassed banality.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. Chapter 17, p398. \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" had a second life as a hit number when Stan Kenton recorded it with his big band for Capitol Records, in 1947. This was also a great and long-lasting hit, re-recorded by Kenton twice with the band, and played by him later in life as a piano solo. The Kenton version was entirely instrumental, with the rhythmic pattern emphasised by trombones. Legacy and influence The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times. Because of its cultural importance, in 2005 \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" was included into the United States National Recording Registry by the National Recording Preservation Board, which noted: :\\"It is the first American recording of an authentic Latin dance style.This claim is not correct, though it may be the first one noticed by the National Recording Registry! This recording launched a decade of 'rumbamania', introducing U.S. listeners to Cuban percussion instruments and Cuban rhythms.\\" The song was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. Several films included versions of \\"El Manisero\\". It appeared in The Cuban Love Song by MGM (1931), with Ernesto Lecuona as musical advisor; Groucho Marx whistled the tune in the film Duck Soup (1933); Cary Grant sang it in the film Only Angels Have Wings (1939); Judy Garland sang a fragment in the film A Star is Born (1954). The Peanut Vendor was used as the tune in an advertising campaign for Golden Wonder Peanuts in the 60s/70s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7vX8hBudcQ) More recently, it was featured in the Carnaval scene of Jose Luis Cuerda's La lengua de las mariposas (Butterfly 1999). The Peanut Vendor was played by Ska legend Tommy McCook and used in such classic reggae songs as \\"Top Ten\\" by Gregory Issacs. Its lead melody is also used in Flavour N'abania's song \\"Nwa Baby\\" (2011), including the remix.

Versions Argent recorded the song in 1971 during the sessions for their album All Together Now, but it originally did not appear as an album track until 1973's In Deep, and was released as a successful single at that time. The 1997 CD re-release of All Together Now has the track included as a bonus. The original lyrics include a reference to British pop singer Cliff Richard, known for his Christianity. The Christian rock band Petra first released a cover version of the song in their 1977 album Come and Join Us. This version had modified lyrics in the verses from the Argent original, while the chorus remained largely unchanged. Petra then re-recorded and released a somewhat updated version for their 1984 album Beat the System. In 1989, the British band the Truth released a version. The song has also been covered by Bride featuring rap group DOC and by Midtown. Unrest remade the song as \\"God Gave Rock & Roll To You II\\" for their 1992 Bavarian Mods EP. =Kiss version= God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You II was covered by the American hard rock band Kiss, with the track being released as a single in 1991 from the soundtrack to the movie Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. It was later included on Kiss' 1992 album Revenge. Though the power ballad covered the original Argent 1973 version \\"God Gave Rock and Roll to You\\", it had substantially modified lyrics in the verses, thus the reason behind the slight change in the name of the song. It is one of the few songs from Kiss' 'non-makeup era' to be played live since the band returned to wearing their trademark makeup in 1996.  Line-up  It was the last Kiss song to feature longtime drummer Eric Carr before his death three months later after it was released as a single. Although he was too ill to play drums on the track, he is featured on backing vocals during the a cappella break, singing the repeated line \\"...to everyone, he gave a song to be sung\\", as well as performing drums during the video for the song. The drum tracks were recorded by Eric Singer, who would become Kiss' full-time drummer following Carr's death. The single was also the first to feature Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley sharing lead vocals since \\"I\\" from 1981's Music from \\"The Elder\\". Video The video was filmed on 16mm film negative Van Nuys Airport, Van Nuys, California, on July 23 and 24, 1991 and was directed by Mark Rezyka for Mark Freedman Productions. The director of photography was Bernard Auroux. The video was produced by Joseph Sassone; production manager Jack Edward Sawyers; and edited by Scott C. Wilson. It features the band playing in an open space in an airplane hangar with flashbacks of Simmons and Stanley and their old bandmates Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent during the make-up era of Kiss's heyday. There were no prominent clips of Carr or Vincent during the make-up years featured in the video, only a few group clips even though Carr was a part of that era for three-and-a-half-years and Vincent for the entire Creatures of the Night tour. Even though future member Eric Singer plays on the track, Carr appears in the video which would prove to be his last official appearance with the band. During the Kissology Volume Two: 1978-1991 special aired on VH1 classic, Gene Simmons has stated that, \\"It's not just a cover song for a soundtrack, but a testament to Eric Carr, and I think a lot of people don't realize that.\\" Chart performance The song proved to be a big hit for the band in many parts of the world, including making the Top Ten in the United Kingdom and Germany. It reached number 21 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US, as well as its video receiving heavy rotation on music television channels. Versions The version released as a single and on the soundtrack to Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey differs slightly from that played in the film. In the film, a 40-second guitar solo is played by Steve Vai. It was later included on Steve Vai's album The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1 under the title \\"Final Solo\\". \\"God Gave Rock & Roll to You II\\" would also be included on the Kiss album Alive III, which was released in 1993.

Before each meeting about six or seven poems by one poet are typed, duplicated and distributed to the dozen or so participants. * The Movement poets as a group in Britain come to public notice this year in Robert Conquest's anthology New Lines. The core of the group consists of Philip Larkin, Elizabeth Jennings, D. J. Enright, Kingsley Amis, Thom Gunn and Donald Davie.

It starred Rob Brydon, Steve Coogan, David Walliams and James Corden. It was broadcast in 2002 and has since been released on BBC DVD. Written by Tim Firth, with additional material by Michael Marshall Smith and Peter Baynham, it told the story of a fan cruise held in honour of The Children of Castor, a fictitious 1980s post-apocalyptic sci-fi TV series, starring Andy Van Allen (Brydon) and Nick Lee (Coogan). Twenty years after the show's cancellation, Van Allen is the reluctant special guest on the fan cruise. For Van Allen, The Children of Castor was the height of his fame, whilst Lee went on to bigger and better things, currently Sherlock Holmes in Miami. Russell Brand also had a part in the drama but during filming clashed with Brydon, Coogan and Walliams in a variety of 'drug induced' incidents. This included leaving the ship and heading to a strip bar where Brand \\"masturbated three times.\\" After this incident that Brand was asked to leave the filming and is said to be the trigger behind him heading to rehab.

The company mainly produces products for customers to sell under their own brand names. As of 2006, West Liberty Foods was the 12th-largest turkey company in the United States. Each plant, located in the three Iowa towns of West Liberty, Mount Pleasant, and Sigourney, as well as Tremonton, Utah, focuses on specific aspects of the meat-packing process. The West Liberty plant participates in the entire process by slaughtering animals, further processing meats into products, and packaging finished products, and the Sigourney plant focuses on the further processing step only, and the Mount Pleasant plant only packages finished product. While West Liberty Foods has experienced growth and received industry recognition since its inception, it initially faced a difficult market for turkeys, and has experienced problems with labor discontent. Employees remain with the company for an average of nine years, with more than 1,500 employed. Information Main entrance to the company's plant in West Liberty, Iowa The company primarily provides meat for other marketing brands, producing 90% of its product for customers while selling only 10% under the West Liberty Foods brand name. In addition to slaughtering turkeys, the company produces prepared beef, chicken, pork, and turkey products. Company revenue has grown rapidly with US$65 million in sales during 1997, $120 million in 2000, and $200 million in 2003. Most recently, West Liberty Foods posted $442 million in revenue for 2006, making the company the 56th-largest meat-packing company by sales in the United States. Much of the company's sales come from large nationwide foodservice customers, and as of 2006, was Subway's largest supplier of sliced sandwich meat, providing the franchise with more than 1 million pounds per week. As a result of servicing national customers, the company is inspected more than other food manufacturers. West Liberty Foods' three plants have been ISO 14001 certified for meeting environmental management standards, and the West Liberty plant was the first turkey- processing plant in the United States to receive this certification. West Liberty Foods maintains separate facilities for research and development and laboratory testing services. They are housed in adjacent buildings several blocks from the plant in West Liberty. The R&D; facility includes testing space for both raw and cooked product, and can create test products from start to finish, including initial formulation, final slicing, and packaging. The lab conducts product quality testing for the three production facilities and uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for rapid bacteriological testing. This system can return results within 30 hours of production. History Prior to 1996, Louis Rich, the brand name for Oscar Mayer's turkey division, owned the processing plant in West Liberty. In early 1996, Oscar Mayer's parent company, Kraft Foods, announced that they would close the plant that December if no buyer purchased it. The Iowa turkey growers who sold to Kraft discussed purchasing the plant to ensure that demand for their birds remained. In May 1996, 47 of the turkey growers formed the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative (ITGC). ITGC purchased the plant from Kraft and took control of it in December. The growers hired meat industry veteran Ken Rutledge to be president and COO of the company. Oscar Mayer helped West Liberty Foods by promising to purchase half of the plant's output in 1997 and a quarter of the output in 1998 to help the startup company., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb Production under ITGC ownership began in January 1997. The company faced financial difficulty because the turkey market was oversupplied and prices hit historic lows. While financial projections assumed a price of US$1.92 per pound for turkey, prices averaged $1.46 per pound in 1997. During this time, four of the growers left ITGC. Turkey prices eventually rebounded, and the company was bolstered by sales to Sara Lee near the end of 1998. Since the rebound, West Liberty Foods‚Äô sales have grown steadily. In 2000, the company acquired a second plant in Sigourney, IA, from Pinnacle Foods to meet rising orders. The facility was sold in 2012. The company grew again in April 2003 when it opened a processing plant in Mount Pleasant, IA, which was later expanded in 2004. Company leadership changed in 2004 as Ed Garrett was named president and COO when Rutledge resigned to take a position with another growers' organization. In 2006, the company entered into a marketing alliance agreement with Midvale, Utah, based Norbest Foods. On April 9th 2020 three workers were infected with COVID-19 at the company's plant in West Liberty, Iowa resulting in a shut down until April 14th due to sanitization being done. Labor episode In 2004, workers at the West Liberty plant considered joining the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). On July 1, 2004, the workers voted on whether they would be represented by UFCW Local 431. An initial tally of votes came out 301 in favor and 299 against union representation. However, the count did not include 13 ballots which were disputed by UFCW. The ballots were challenged on claims that they were cast by management personnel who would not be union members. A National Labor Relations Board hearing to confirm or invalidate the vote was scheduled for January 5, 2005, but then postponed until February 16, 2005. On February 1, 2005 the company and UFCW settled their dispute. UFCW withdrew its objections, and West Liberty Foods posted a notice that they would not close the plant or fire workers if employees unionized. This resulted in a final vote count of 303 to 308 against union representation. UFCW Local 431 held a second vote at the West Liberty plant on July 15, 2005. The vote was 231 to 322 against unionization. In 2009, the company paid US$58,613.75 to Labor Information Services, an antiunion management services company connected to The Burke Group, to provide consultants who met directly with workers \\"either individually or in group meetings...regarding union issues.\\" Plants Locations of the three West Liberty Foods plants in Iowa West Liberty Foods' three plants combined can convert 4.5 million turkeys into product annually. This equals about 180 million pounds of product per year. =West Liberty plant= The West Liberty plant is a facility which slaughters and further processes turkey products. The slaughter operation converts around 20,000 turkeys per workday., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb Louis H. Rich purchased the West Liberty plant, a former tomato canning facility, in 1943, when he decided to expand the operations of the Rock Island Produce Company, located on 9th Street in Rock Island, Illinois. The plant was converted to a poultry, including chickens and turkeys, slaughter facility in 1946 and refocused by Rich's sons, Norman and Martin, on turkey in 1949. The plant was first expanded in 1960. Oscar Mayer acquired the plant, through its purchase of Louis Rich, Inc., in 1979 and used it for turkey production until selling the plant in 1996. =Mount Pleasant plant= The Mount Pleasant plant is a facility that is used for slicing cooked cheese, turkey, chicken, beef, pork, and other products. The plant employs roughly 500 people working in three shifts. A Millard Refrigerated Services facility is located adjacent to the Mount Pleasant plant. The two facilities are connected, and product is immediately transferred by conveyor from the plant to cold storage when packaging is complete. The design and operation of the Mount Pleasant plant was developed to decrease potential hazards to food safety. WLF representatives have stated that the goal of the Mount Pleasant plant is to create a pathogen-free environment. Because company officials believe that the food safety aspects of the plant are unique in the meat industry, they submitted the plant design for patent approval through the U.S. Patent Office. The Mount Pleasant plant is located about from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants. This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready-to-eat production. The Mount Pleasant facility consists of approximately 20 individual processing cells that are separated from one another and are set up so that they could operate as individual meat slicing facilities. Before antimicrobial flooring was poured, the cells were erected with stainless steel antimicrobial walls that are built into the floor. Each processing cell has independent refrigeration and drainage systems. The refrigeration systems filter the cell's air and maintain positive air pressure at , and the drainage systems are sealed off and flooded with sanitizers nightly. During operation, fully cooked meat or cheese logs arrive sealed in impermeable casings. The logs go through a casing sanitation step that involves being treated with a sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from the logs. The logs then undergo a postlethality treatment by passing through an infrared pasteurization tunnel to kill pathogens on the logs. The logs are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell. The mechanical transfers decrease the risk of product contamination by reducing handling of product by personnel . Food safety is a factor in hiring employees at the Mount Pleasant facility. Before applying, potential employees must complete a 16-hour food- safety training course through Iowa State University. The class includes written tests which each applicant must pass before completing the course. On the job, employees must don a sealed clean room suit before entering slicing cells. The suits are cleaned and sealed in a clean room laundry facility in North Carolina by the uniform company Cintas. Employees replace the clean suit each time they leave the cell so each employee averages five suits per day. =Sigourney plant= The Sigourney plant is no longer active, and has been closed. The remaining employees were released as of Wed. March 18, 2009. West Liberty sold the facility in 2012. =Tremonton, Utah, plant= As of 2006, West Liberty Foods plans to build a plant in Tremonton, Utah., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb The plant will not slaughter, but the facility will allot for processing and for slicing a variety of meat products. The company broke ground for the facility in October 2006. It is expected to begin production in July 2007. When completed, the plant will be the first in North America to slice slicing logs., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb The plant will initially have ten slicing cells allowing production of 150 million pounds per year and will eventually add ten more cells to double the plant's capacity. At full capacity, the plant will employ more than 500 people., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb Similar to the Mount Pleasant plant, a Millard Refrigerated Services facility will be built adjacent to the Tremonton plant for warehouse storage of refrigerated and frozen products. Initially, the company investigated sites for the new plant in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb It requested US$5.2 million in tax incentives from Utah to build in Pleasant View, Utah. On April 26, 2006 Utah's Department of Community and Economic Development approved a US$2 million tax-rebate over 10 years., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb The incentives were conditioned on the new jobs paying a certain level above the county median wage, offering health insurance, and the company staying in Utah for 10 years. Pleasant View offered another US$1.4-US$1.8 million in incentives. However, construction in Pleasant View became impossible when it was discovered that much of the site consisted of wetland areas., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb After this development, the state held the incentive offer open provided that West Liberty Foods could find another suitable site that met Utah's requirements., cited at Newsbank/Infoweb On July 29, 2006, the company announced that they would build the new plant in Tremonton, Utah. The tax incentives will total an 80% property tax break, but Tremonton is projected to experience a US$508 thousand financial benefit over 12 years after the plant is completed. Of the 500 jobs at the plant, 300 are expected to pay between US$21,500 and US$26,875. The rest of the jobs will pay more with about 100 paying around US$37,000.

called the Royal Chapel of St Stephen, was a chapel in the old Palace of Westminster which served as the chamber of the House of Commons of England and that of Great Britain from 1547 to 1834. It was largely destroyed in the fire of 1834, but the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the crypt survived. The present-day St Stephen's Hall and its porch, which are within the new Palace of Westminster built in the 19th century, stand on exactly the same site and are today accessed through the St Stephen's Entrance, the public entrance of the House of Commons. History House of Commons from St Stephen's Chapel. =As a Royal Chapel= According to Cooke (1987), King Henry III witnessed the consecration of the Sainte Chapelle in Paris in 1248, and wished to construct a chapel in his principal palace at Westminster to rival it. Work continued for many years under Henry's successors, to be completed around 1297.John Steane, The Archaeology of Medieval England and Wales (1985, ), p. 7 In the resulting two-storey chapel, the Upper Chapel was used by the Royal Family, and the Lower Chapel, by the Royal Household and courtiers. =Historical events= Two royal weddings are recorded as having been solemnised in St Stephen's Chapel. On 20 January 1382, King Richard II was married to Anne of Bohemia. The bridegroom was fifteen, the bride sixteen.Anne of Bohemia , Reformation Society website. Retrieved 11 July 2011. The other marriage occurred on 15 January 1478, between the younger of the two Princes in the Tower, Richard, Duke of York, and Anne Mowbray.Anne Mowbray, Duchess of York from Westminster Abbey website. Retrieved 11 July 2011. Being four years old, she was a year younger than Richard. At the age of eight, Anne died. Her coffin was discovered in a vault in Stepney in 1964, and her remains reinterred in Westminster Abbey. The body of Richard's father, King Edward IV, who died at the Palace of Westminster on 9 April 1483, was conveyed to St Stephen's Chapel the next day, and lay in state there for eight days before his interment at St George's Chapel, Windsor.\\"1483-The Year of Three Kings\\". Retrieved 11 July 2011. Thomas Cranmer was consecrated in St Stephen's Chapel as Archbishop of Canterbury on 30 March, 1533.Stephen Taylor, From Cranmer to Davidson: A Church of England Miscellany (1999, ), p. 3 After the death of King Henry VIII the Palace of Westminster ceased to be a royal residence. Henry's son, King Edward VI, instituted the Abolition of Chantries Act 1547 and St Stephen's Chapel thus became available for use as the debating chamber of the House of Commons.Kenneth R. Mackenzie, Parliament (1962), p. 29 Oliver Cromwell had the crypt whitewashed and used it to stable his horses.The gentleman's magazine and historical chronicle, vol. 80, Part 1 (1810), p. 4 On the night before the 1911 census, women's suffragist Emily Davison spent the night in a broom cupboard in the back of the crypt in order to be able to give her address as the House of Commons, despite not being allowed to stand for Parliament or vote.William Kent, An Encyclopaedia of London (1951), p. 639 A plaque was unofficially placed in the cupboard to commemorate this in around 1991 by the late Tony Benn MP. He put the plaque in place with his own hands and proudly showed it to visitors. He later installed a second plaque for a purpose which is now lost but the Palace authorities required him to remove it. The screw holes are still visible. =As the House of Commons chamber= The former chapel's layout and functionality influenced the positioning of furniture and the seating of Members of Parliament in the Commons. The Speaker's chair was placed on the altar steps ‚Äì arguably the origin of the tradition of members bowing to the Speaker, as they would formerly have done to the altar. Where the lectern had once been, the Table of the House was installed. The members sat facing one another in the medieval choir stalls, creating the adversarial seating plan that persists in the chamber of the Commons to this day. The old choir screen, with its two side-by-side entrances, was also retained and formed the basis of the modern voting system for parliamentarians, with \\"aye\\" voters passing through the right-hand door and \\"no\\" voters passing through the left-hand one.Kim Dovey, Framing Places: Mediting Power in Built Form (1999), p. 87 In order to suit the needs of the House of Commons, various changes to the chapel's original Gothic form were made by various architects between 1547 and 1834. Initial changes during the late 16th Century were relatively minor; the original chapel furnishings were replaced, the interior whitewashed and the stained-glass windows replaced with plain glass. More drastic alterations were undertaken by Christopher Wren in the 1690s. During that work the building was significantly reduced in height with the removal of the clerestory and vaulted ceiling while the great medieval windows were walled up, with smaller windows cut into the new stonework. Inside, the walls were reduced in thickness to accommodate extra seating and the addition of upper-level male-only public galleries along both sides of the chamber, and the remains of the medieval interior were concealed behind wainscoting and oak panelling. A false ceiling was installed in the chamber to help to improve its acoustics, the quality of which was important in an age without artificial amplification. The newly created attic space above the ceiling housed a ventilation lantern and was used as the ladies' gallery, although the view down into the chamber beneath through the lantern was severely restricted. More seating was later added for the extra members brought in by the Acts of Union with Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1800). By the 19th century, the chapel's interior had a very bland and modest look in contrast to its former medieval magnificence.GAnthony Emery, reater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300‚Äì1500, vol. 3 (2006), p. 256 Further alterations were made to the exterior by James Wyatt at the end of the 18th Century. =Fire and reconstruction= The fire of 1834 totally destroyed the main body of the chapel, with the crypt below, and the adjoining cloisters, barely surviving. Amongst the few furnishings rescued from the flames was the Table of the House, which is now kept in the Speaker's apartments at the palace. Although it was demolished shortly after the fire, the surviving stone shell of the chapel, with all its later additions burned away, attracted many visitors and antiquaries who came to view the original medieval decorations which had become visible once again. The historical importance of the chapel was realised in the design of the new palace in the form of St Stephen's Hall, the lavishly decorated main public entrance hall built on the same floor plan as the old chapel, with the position of the Speaker's chair marked out on the floor.J. N. Spellen, The Inner Life of the House of Commons (1854), p. 6 The crypt below St Stephen's Hall, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, which had fallen into disuse some time before the fire and had seen a number of uses, was restored, and returned to its original use as a place of worship. It is still used for this purpose today. Children of peers, who possess the style of \\"The Honourable\\", have the privilege of being able to use it as a wedding venue. Members of Parliament and peers have the right to use the chapel as a place of christening.Emma Crewe, Lords of Parliament: Manners, Rituals and Politics (2005, ), p. 97 The body of Margaret Thatcher was kept in St Mary Undercroft on the night before her funeral on 17 April 2013.BBC News 16-4-13  Further reading  *Maurice Hastings, St Stephen's Chapel and its Place in the Development of Perpendicular Style in England (1955) * Sir Robert Cooke, The Palace of Westminster (London: Burton Skira, 1987) References External links * explore-parliament.net ‚Äì shows various views of the chapel, notably this image. * https://www.virtualststephens.org.uk/ - including a section on 'Visualizing St Stephens' throughout its history Buildings and structures completed in 1297 Burned buildings and structures in the United Kingdom Palace of Westminster National government buildings in London Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster Gothic architecture in England ","title":"St Stephen's Chapel"},{"id":"5776223","text":"Beach 67th Street, signed as Beach 67th Street‚ÄìArverne By The Sea, is a station on the IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Freeway in Arverne, Queens, it is served by the A train at all times. The station is adjacent to Kohlreiter Square, a public green space on the north side of the station. History The station was originally built as Arverne for the Long Island Rail Road in 1888 at Gaston Avenue, by New York lawyer and developer Remington Vernam. The station and the development were named by his wife who admired the way he signed his checks. The station had a large tower, was shaped like a Victorian hotel and had a connection to the Ocean Electric Railway. Due to a quarrel between the LIRR and Vernam, another Arverne station was built at Straiton Avenue in 1892. From then on, it was known as Arverne‚ÄìGaston Avenue to distinguish it from the Straiton Avenue station. Arverne station was rebuilt on a new site with a simpler structure in May 1912. Like all stations along the Rockaway Beach Branch, it was closed and replaced with the elevated Gaston Avenue station on April 10, 1942, only to be transferred to the New York City Transit Authority on October 3, 1955 and reopened as a subway station on June 28, 1956.LIRR Station History In March 2010, Queens Community Board 14, which represents Arverne, voted in favor of renaming the station from Beach 67th Street‚ÄìGaston to Beach 67th Street‚ÄìArverne By The Sea.

In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program. Station layout There are two tracks and two side platforms. Trains that leave the station northbound reach the Hammels Wye, where it is possible to head north to Broad Channel (the usual service pattern) or traverse a short single-track segment onto the southbound Rockaway Park-bound branch of the line. This connection was used for the temporary H shuttle from Far Rockaway to Beach 90th Street following Hurricane Sandy, and was used by the Rockaway Park Shuttle for several months in 2018. =Exits= Street stair The only active station house beneath the platforms and tracks at the east end has four staircases: two to the street (one to each western corner of Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Freeway) and one to each platform. The mezzanine layout gives evidence that there were originally separate turnstiles for entry and exit. The entry turnstiles are all on one side of the booth while the exit turnstiles are on the opposite side. Since the elimination of the double fare, steel gates have replaced the turnstiles. A second exit is located at the west end of the Far Rockaway-bound platform which leads to the southeast side of Beach 69th Street and Rockaway Freeway.

A lubok (plural lubki, Cyrillic: ) is a Russian popular print, characterized by simple graphics and narratives derived from literature, religious stories, and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were woodcuts, followed by engravings or etchings, and from mid-19th century lithography. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern comic strip. Cheap and simple books, similar to chapbooks, Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History.

The Russian word lubok derives from lub - a special type of board on which pictures were printed. Background Russian lubki became a popular genre during the last half of the 17th century. Farrell, Dianne Ecklund. \\"Medieval Popular Humor in Russian Eighteenth-Century Lubok\\". pp. 552 Russian lubok was primarily influenced by the \\"woodcuts and engravings done in Germany, Italy, and France during the early part of the 15th century\\". Farrell, Dianne Ecklund. \\"The Origins of Russian Popular Prints and Their Social Milieu in the Early Eighteenth Century.\\" p. 1 Its popularity in Russia was a result of how inexpensive and fairly simple it was to duplicate a print using this new technique. Luboks were typically sold at various marketplaces to the lower and middle classes. This type of art was very popular with these two social classes because they provided them with an inexpensive opportunity to display artwork in their houses. Jahn, Hubertus F. \\"Patriotic Culture in Russia During World War I\\". Cornell University Press: Ithaca and London. p.12 A modern rural shed with lubok decoration The original lubki were woodcuts. The Koren Picture-Bible, 1692-1696 established the most prominent style, an \\"Old Russian\\" rendering of international iconography and subjects, most closely related to the frescos of the Upper Volga.A.G. Sakovich, Russkaia gravirovannia kniga Vasiliia Korenia, 1692-1696, Moscow, Izdatelstvo \\"iskusstvo\\", 1983. By mid-18th century, however, the woodcuts were mostly replaced with engraving or etching techniques, which enabled the prints to be more detailed and complex.Jahn, Hubertus F. \\"Patriotic Culture in Russia During World War I\\". Cornell University Press: Ithaca and London. p.12 After printing on paper, the picture would be hand- colored with diluted tempera paints. While the prints themselves were typically very simplistic and unadorned, the final product, with the tempera paint added, was surprisingly bright with vivid colors and lines. The dramatic coloring of the early woodcut prints was to some extent lost with the transfer to more detailed engravings. In addition to the images, these folk prints also included a short story or lesson that correlated to the picture being presented. Russian scholar Alexander Boguslavsky claims that the lubok style \\"is a combination of Russian icon and manuscript painting traditions with the ideas and topics of western European woodcuts\\". Typically, the lubok's artist would include minimal text that was supplementary to the larger illustration that would cover the majority of the engraving. Lubok genres Folklorist Dmitri Rovinsky is known for his work with categorizing lubok. His system is very detailed and extensive, and his main categories are: \\"icons and Gospel illustrations; the virtues and evils of women; teaching, alphabets, and numbers; calendars and almanacs; light reading; novels, folktales, and hero legends; stories of the Passion of Christ, the Last Judgement, and sufferings of the martyrs; popular recreation including Maslenitsa festivities, puppet comedies, drunkenness, music, dancing, and theatricals; jokes and satires related to Ivan the Terrible and Peter I; satires adopted from foreign sources; folk prayers; and government sponsored pictorial information sheets, including proclamations and news items\\". Jewish examples exist, as well, mostly from Ukraine. Many luboks can be classified into multiple categories. Image:Farnos (1).jpgA Joker and His Wife.

It is used to present Napoleon in a satirical manner while portraying the Russian peasants as the heroes of the war. This also inspired other Russians to help fight the war by attempting to, ‚Äú‚Ä¶redefine Russian national identity in the Napoleonic era‚Äù (Norris 2). The luboks presented a manner for the Russians to mock the French enemy, while at the same time display the ‚ÄòRussianness‚Äù of Russia. ‚ÄúThese war luboks satirized Napoleon and depicted French culture as degenerate‚Äù (Norris 4). The lubok was a means of reinforcing the idea of defeating the French invaders and displaying the horrible destruction Napoleon and his army caused Russia. To help rekindle the Russian spirit the luboks displayed ‚ÄúThe experience of the invasion and subsequent Russian winter rendered Napoleon and his troops powerless, and the luboks illustrated this view by depicting the French leader and soldiers as impotent when confronted by peasant men, women, and Cossacks‚Äù (Norris 9). All the different representation of the Russian heroes helped define and spread the belief in Russian identity.  Russo-Japanese War lubok  The Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905 began on February 8, 1904, at Port Arthur with a surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy. At the time, ‚ÄúRussia was an established European power with a large industrial base and a regular army of 1.1 million soldiers. Japan, with few natural resources and little heavy industry, had an army of only 200,000 men‚Äù.Albro, Walk. \\"Russo-Japanese War's Greatest Land Battle.\\" Military History 21.6 (2005): 58-65. Because of the staggering difference in military defense, Russia assumed itself to have the upper hand before the war ensued. Luboks depicting the overconfidence of the Russian army were created because censorship laws at the time did not allow satirical magazines to subsist. With the use of satirical, often racist cartoons, luboks displayed pictures such as, ‚Äúa Cossack soldier thrashing a Japanese officer, and a Russian sailor punching a Japanese sailor in the face‚Äù.Bryant, Mark. \\"The Floating World at War.\\" History Today 56.6 (2006): 58-59. These luboks, produced in Moscow and St. Petersburg, were anonymously created and recorded much of the Russo-Japanese War. Perhaps due to the Russians' overconfidence, ‚ÄúDuring the battle, the Japanese generals were able to size up their opponent and predict how he would react under certain circumstances. That knowledge enabled them to set a trap and defeat a numerically superior enemy‚Äù.Albro, Walk. \\"Russo-Japanese War's Greatest Land Battle.\\" Military History 21.6 (2005): 58-65. Therefore, the Russian government eventually stepped in with its censor laws and stopped the creation of more satirical luboks. All in all, around 300 luboks were created during 1904‚Äì05.

M. Flagg's 1917 poster, used to recruit soldiers for both World War I and World War II. Flagg used a modified version of his own face for Uncle Sam, and veteran Walter Botts provided the pose. During the World War I years, with Charles Dana Gibson as the acting president, Society members worked through the Committee on Public Information's Division of Pictorial Publicity, creating many original poster designs, including James M. Flagg's US Army iconic recruiting poster of Uncle Sam, as well as advertising of the massive War Bond effort. Photo journalism was impractical during these years and eight Society members, commissioned Captains in the Engineers, were sent to France to sketch the war. After the war, the Society operated the School for Disabled Soldiers. =1920‚Äì1930= In 1920, the Society was incorporated, and in 1922 women were allowed to become full members. The early history of the Society was documented in 1927 and 1939 by Norman Price. His hand written notes are held in the Society of Illustrators archives. During the 1920s and 1930s the Society presented the Illustrator's Shows, featuring artists and their models as actors, songwriters, set designers and painters. Professional talent such as the Cotton Club band and Jimmy Durante also performed. Through member and set designer Watson Barrett, the Illustrator's Show of 1925 was held at the Shubert Theatre, and the Shuberts purchased the rights to the skits for their Broadway productions of Artists and Models. In 1939, those funds allowed the Society to acquire its present headquarters, at 128 East 63rd Street. Norman Rockwell's Dover Coach became the backdrop for the bar on the fourth floor, donated by Rockwell in honor of the Society's new building. This painting currently hangs in the Members Dining Room. =World War II= During World War II the Society again contributed to the war effort with a massive campaign of posters. Society members visited veterans‚Äô hospitals to sketch the wounded, and these art works were sent to the families to boost morale. The Illustrator's Jazz Band was formed to entertain the wounded, and an ensemble by the same name plays at Society events up until the present. Poster illustration by Society Member Harry Morse, 1945 for the Office of War Information Poster illustration by Society Member C.W. Beuttey, 1943 for the Office of War Information =1950s= In 1948, the Joint Ethics Committee, of which The Society is a member developed the first Code of Fair Practice, which still serves today in addressing concerns of artists and art directors working in the graphic communications field where abuses and misunderstandings regarding usage rights and ownership of works of illustration and other works of art created for a wide range of public media. In 1954, the U.S. Air Force began sending Society of Illustrators members around the world to document its activities. This program continues today. Thousands of paintings have been contributed over the years. The year 1959 saw the Society hold its first Annual Exhibition, juried by Bob Peak, Bradbury Thompson, Stevan Dohanos and others. It opened with 350 original works of art and led to the publication of the first Illustrators Annual. =Present= Current Headquarters (2019) 2001 was the Society's centennial year, a 12-month celebration begun with the U.S. Postal issue, Great American Illustrators. That year was punctuated with the 9/11 Memorial Exhibition, Prevailing Human Spirit. The Society of illustrators continues to maintain an annual of illustration, student scholarship competitions and various awards honoring excellence in the field of illustration. The Society maintains outreach programs with The New York City Parks Department (2001‚Äìpresent), the New York City Board of Education (1999‚Äìpresent). Anelle Miller has been the director of the Society since 2007.  Society Presidents , the president of the Society of Illustrators is Tim O'Brien.

The Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (MoCCA) transferred its assets in August 2012 to the Society, which has continued the MoCCA Fest. The Society also has a gallery on the second floor dedicated to MoCCA that frequently hosts smaller exhibits of comic book art. Recognition The Society of Illustrators inaugurated the Hall of Fame program in 1958, to recognize \\"distinguished achievement in the art of illustration\\".https://www.societyillustrators.org/programs/hall-fame The first recipient was Norman Rockwell. Like other recognized artists, he was elected by former Society presidents for his contributions to the field of illustration. Every year since 1958, one or more illustrators have been added to the Hall of Fame. In 2001, two additional forms of recognition were added: Dean Cornwell Recognition Award and the Arthur William Brown Achievement Award, which may be awarded annually. In 1965, The Society established The Hamilton King Award, which is given annually to one society member, and is widely considered to be the most prestigious award in illustration. In 1981, The Society established the Student Scholarship Competition, which has continued annually to the present. The Highest Award presented to a student by the society is the Zankel Scholarship Award, established in 2006 in honor of Arthur Zankel, an advocate for higher education whose bequest made the scholarship possible.

These rivers are the Mad River, the Clear Fork River, Clear Creek, the Chagrin River, and the Rocky River. The Mad River Ohio's oldest trout stream is the Mad River. Stocking of this river began in the late 19th century with the introduction of Brook trout. In 1884 Rainbow trout were introduced to the stream. In 1931 the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife took control of the Rainbow trout project. The department continued to support the project until 1984 when the state introduced Brown trout in their stead. Today the stream is stocked annually with 6\\"-8\\" brown trout to supplement the population. Public access points can be found at various locations along the river which begins in Logan County near the city of Bellefontaine and runs southwest to Dayton where it flows into the Great Miami River. These access points are generally small and tend to be next to bridges where local roads cross the river. As there are hatches of mayflies, caddis flies, and other popular trout foods throughout the spring, summer, and fall months, fly fishing on the river is viable. Other popular methods of fishing include the use of in-line spinners such as Rooster Tails or Mepps, or the use of live bait rigs or Berkley Power Bait. The minimum size required to keep trout caught on the Mad River is 12 inches, and the daily catch limit is two fish. The Clear Fork River The Clear Fork River is located near the town of Loudonville, OH, about one hour north of the city of Columbus, OH. It is divided into two parts, the Upper and the Lower branches. It was first stocked in the early 1980s by local fishing clubs, and the ODNR began in 1992 to stock it annually with 6\\"-8\\" brown trout. Two of its tributaries, Cedar Fork on the Upper branch and Pine Run on the Lower branch, are also stocked. The Upper branch has limited accessibility and runs from the Clear Fork Reservoir East to Pleasant Hill Lake. The Lower Branch runs East from the Pleasant Hill Dam through Mohican State Park where it ends at the Mohican River. Fishermen who wish to visit this stream should go to the covered bridge at Mohican State Park. There is plenty of parking, a playground for the kids, a primitive campground just downstream, and easy access to the stream. Fly fishing is excellent as there are many open areas to cast and several nice holes with hemlock trees holding their branches over them waiting for the fisherman to drift a dry fly or a nymph under them. The stream has a great annual hatch of mayflies, including sulphers, light cahills, drakes, and lots of caddisflies, as well. Other popular methods include the use of in-line spinners and live bait. This is a very scenic river with great accessibility. The downfall is that in the late spring and summer months many other visitors are attracted to the stream such as rafters, tubers, and swimmers, which can negatively affect fishing as the water gets too disturbed. Other than that, this is a great place to fish for trout in Ohio. The daily catch limit is two fish and a minimum keep size of 12\\" is in effect. note=most of the swimmers, tubers, and rafters use the state park camping area for this activity, the best trout fishing for large browns is up stream from the covered bridge. Clear Creek Located just southeast of Lancaster in Clear Creek Metro Park lies Clear Creek, one of the newest streams in Ohio to receive the title of trout stream. Overseen by the ODNR, the river is stocked annually with 6\\"-8\\" Brown trout. It is the only trout stream in the Southeastern portion of Ohio. The fishable area runs throughout the entirety of Clear Creek Metro Park and access points can be found along the road that runs through the park. This trout stream has a minimum keep size of 12\\" for trout and a daily catch limit of two trout. The Chagrin River and the Rocky River A tributary in Geauga County of the Chagrin River, and the Rocky River and its tributaries, located in Medina County, are the host to populations of wild Brook trout in Ohio. The Chagrin tributary is the only remaining naturally occurring population of native Brook Trout in Ohio. Both of these rivers are located in Northeast Ohio. State regulations prohibit possession of trout from these waters. For this reason it is advisable to use barbless hooks when fishing for trout in either of these two rivers but it is legal to harvest steelhead trout from these two rivers.

Established in 1905 and incorporated into the city limits in 1912, it was developed for African-American workers who were employed at area hotels and other businesses. History In 1900, land developer George Currie plotted a strip of land in the north end of West Palm Beach to provide homes for African Americans forced to leave their living quarters in the \\"Styx\\" on South County Road on Palm Beach Island.Clarke, Everee Jimerson. Pleasant City West Palm Beach (Black America Series) Copyright 2005 Arcadia Publishing. He called the area Pleasant City, gave the streets pleasant-sounding names, and sold the 100 x 50 lots for $150 up. These families, numbering more than 1000, had come to Palm Beach in the mid-1800s to extend the Florida East Coast Railroad from Juno to West Palm Beach. They also built the Royal Poinciana Hotel and the mansion Whitehall (now -2017- the Flagler Museum), for Standard Oil magnate Henry Morrison Flagler. During the twenty years of living in the \\"Styx\\" these settlers married, started families, established businesses, churches, schools, civic and fraternal organizations that extended to Pleasant City. Pleasant City, the oldest African-American community in West Palm Beach, is a 27-block area that had a population close to 2800 residents. It is bordered on the north by 23rd Street, on the north by 15th Street, on the east by Dixie Highway and on the west by the Florida East Coast Railway, which made it a stronger business area. Once the hub of black business and beautiful single- family homes, the area has been on the decline for several years because of hurricane damage, poorly managed public housing, and politics. Most historic landmarks have been demolished by community redevelopment efforts to prevent them having historic designation.  Demographics  Map of Pleasant City  Culture  The Pleasant City Family Reunion Committee was established in 1993 and founded by Everee Jimerson Clarke to sponsor the first Pleasant City Community Reunion in conjunction with the West Palm Beach Centennial Celebration in 1994. Former residents, who had property and close ties to the area had been away more than 30 years found that life in Pleasant City had changed. Many residents became discouraged and moved away to seek opportunities elsewhere.  The Heritage Gallery  The Heritage Gallery was opened September 21, 1996 at 2315 N. Dixie Highway to create a lasting memorial to the Pioneers of Pleasant City. It was a reflection of the heritage, lifestyles, and interest of the Pioneers. It maintains a library of historic documents, oral histories, artifacts, photographs, art, and memorabilia available to the general public. The Heritage Gallery aims to serve as a resource center for the most of the African American Historic projects in Palm Beach County since 1996. The Heritage Gallery trains youth and sponsors historic events including The Living Legends of Negro Baseball, The Triple Nickles, Buffalo Soldiers, National Designers, Artists and honoring deserving Achievers. Heritage Gallery Programs includes: Heritage Gallery Tours, History Study Groups, Jazz Preservation Society, Inter-generational Society, Elegant√© International Teen Club, Computer Lab, Camp Heritage Trail, Special Events, Pioneer Days, Ms. Senior Queen Pageant, Father‚Äôs Day-Mother‚Äôs Day, Youth in Business, Youth Performing Arts, and Community Resource Center  Parks and Recreation   Crime  While the neighborhood is plentiful by historic means, it has suffered from urban decay. Pleasant City, and the surrounding communities of North Tamarind are classified as low-income because of high levels of poverty. This is also where the majority of the city's black population lives. Pleasant City is also known for being the hub of high level drug trafficking to the rest of South Florida. Many chains of organized crime have and are operating in the neighborhood, \\"Gangs in Palm Beach County\\", The Palm Beach Post, 2007. Retrieved on 2009-05-15.

Legend  Sava Savanoviƒá was said to have lived in an old watermill on the Rogaƒçica river, at Zaro≈æje village in the municipality of Bajina Ba≈°ta.Politika: Sava Savanoviƒá jo≈° ƒçeka da postane srpski brend It was said that he killed and drank the blood of the millers when they came to mill their grains. Although he is usually said to have been the first Serbian vampire, there are claims that he was pre-dated in Serbian folklore by Petar Blagojeviƒá from Veliko Gradi≈°te, who died in 1725.Folklore info about Sava Savanoviƒá on Zarozje.com Blagojeviƒá and the affair surrounding him came to European attention at the time, under the name Peter Plogojowitz, and represented one of the earliest examples of vampire hysteria. Still, Sava Savanoviƒá remains today as the best known vampire in Serbia.  Watermill  The watermill is located from the Bajina Ba≈°ta-Valjevo road, in the deep valley of the Rogaƒçica river. The location of the mill has been described as a \\"narrow and dark ravine\\". For the last several decades the watermill associated with Savanoviƒá has been owned by the Jagodiƒá family, and is usually called \\"Jagodiƒáa vodenica\\" (Jagodiƒái's watermill). It was in operation until the late 1950s. After its closure, it became a tourist site along with other attractions in Valjevo and nearby villages.Antistres vikend s vampirom, Blic By the early 2010s, the ownership problems were resolved and the local administration to reconstruct the watermill made of wood and stone, and adapt it into the proper tourist attraction. Plans also included that the watermill will be operational again, producing the flour named after Sava Savanoviƒá while the local farmers would sell honey and rakia. A construction of the proper road to which would connect it to the main one was also planned. Author of the reconstruction project was architect Aleksandar Gavoviƒá. The first finished project was the road, but just a month after it was completed, the mill collapsed in 2012. The municipal authorities issued a tongue-in-cheek public health warning, advising people that Savanoviƒá was now free to look for a new home. In 2011 it was evident that it may collapse soon, but local authorities hoped it will make it to the reconstruction. The project of recreating the watermill in its authentic form was made, but there was a lack of funding. Originally, only the roof collapsed (in 2012) but in the next years the wooden walls buckled, too. By December 2018, the mill was reconstructed and the access road was partially improved. The foundations and the pillars were reinforced and the new roof was built and tiled. Works are scheduled to continue in the spring of 2019 when the mill wheel, grinding stone and artificial widening of the stream will be finished. After this is completed, the mill should become operational again.  In culture  Sava Savanoviƒá appears in the story Posle devedeset godina (Ninety Years Later), written by the Serbian realist writer Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, and in the horror film Leptirica inspired by the story. He also appears in the novel Strah i njegov sluga (Fear and His Servant) written by Mirjana Novakoviƒá. In January 2010, city of Valjevo selected the mythical Sava Savanoviƒá as the touristic mascot of the city and the entire Kolubara region. Zaro≈æje and Valjevo are on the opposing sides of the Povlen mountain, but both claim Savanoviƒá as their brand. Local community of Zaro≈æje threatened to sue the city, but ultimately only reported to the police in Bajina Ba≈°ta that Savanoviƒá was \\"stolen from them\\".

The elevated station was opened on April 10, 1942, but was closed on October 3, 1955. It was purchased by the New York City Transit Authority along with the rest of the line west to Rockaway Park, which reopened it as a subway station on June 28, 1956.

Biography The son of a well-to-do cloth merchant family Six, Jan studied liberal arts and law in Leiden in 1634. He became the son-in-law of the mayor of Amsterdam, Nicolaes Tulp, in 1655, when he married Tulp's daughter Margaretha. Thanks to his father-in-law, he became magistrate of family law and various other appointments on the city council, eventually becoming mayor of Amsterdam himself in 1691 at the ripe age of 73\\\\. Six was good friends with the poet Joost van den Vondel and the painter Rembrandt van Rijn, during the forties. Six remained a devotee of the arts all his life and wrote plays himself, the most famous being Medea, published in 1648 (with an etching by Rembrandt), and Onschult (Innocence) in 1662. In the same year the Dutch translation of Baldassarre Castiglione's Il libro del Cortegiano was dedicated to Six. Six Collection Home of the Six Collection, Amsterdam His collection of paintings, drawings, etchings, and other artefacts (including many from his wife's family) were popular in his lifetime. This collection was eventually handed down generations later to the couple Lucretia Johanna van Winter (1785‚Äì1845) and Hendrik Six (1790‚Äì1847) whose extensive art collections were combined when they married in 1822 and are known collectively as the Six Collection, though 171 paintings were from the Van Winter family. Among the 76 Van Winter paintings collected by Lucretia Jans herself included a flower painting by Rachel Ruysch that she bought in 1820, The Milkmaid by Vermeer and the Serenade by Judith Leyster. The 171 paintings that Lucretia Jans took with her on her marriage, were only half of her father's extensive collection that itself had been known and put on display for a half century. The other half went to her sister Anna Louisa, who married Willem van Loon. A few of those paintings can still be seen in Museum Van Loon, but the rest of the other half of the Van Winter collection was sold by Van Loon heirs in 1877 to Gustave baron de Rothschild (son of James Mayer de Rothschild) in Paris. The Six collection has been the subject of controversy in the Netherlands for decades, because though the house on the Amstel received subsidy from the Dutch government and was open to the public for visiting hours, the house was always also used as a home, and the number of visitors was limited. The dispute has been resolved and the top pieces are lent to the Rijksmuseum several months every other year. The Six collection is still curated by descendants of Jan Six. Jan Six X is the present Baron, and has been curator since 2000. Jan Six XI is a well-known art historian and art dealer. In 2018, Six identified a painting, previously though to have been \\"school of\\" Rembrandt, as a painting by the master. The painting, called Portrait of a Young Gentleman, has been dated by the style of the lace then in fashion to c. 1634.

It was known by the aboriginal people of Illawarra as beeow-wang, as pooeet at Corranderrk Station in Victoria, and as nanga-nanga in Queensland. Taxonomy Alsophila australis was described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen collected on King Island in Bass Strait, off the coast of Tasmania. It is the type for the genus Alsophila. The specific epithet australis means \\"southern\\" and refers to this southerly location. Alsophila australis is a highly variable taxon. Individuals from the Norfolk Island subspecies, A. australis ssp. norfolkensis, are larger and more robust, differing primarily in scale characteristics. The subspecies is rare in cultivation. Further study is needed to determine whether this taxon represents a separate species or not. Description The massive erect trunk is usually up to 12 m tall, although specimens reaching 20 m have been reported from Queensland, Australia. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and may reach 4 m in length, occasionally even 6 m. These form a distinctive crown that is dark green above and lighter green below. It has quite adventitious roots, tubercles and hair- like follicles on its ‚Äòtrunk‚Äô.http://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2003/cyathea- spp.html Plants growing in southern Australia often lose their fronds by the end of winter, as is the case with Alsophila dregei in South Africa. Characteristically of this species, stipe bases are often retained around the trunk long after withering. They are covered with scales and conical, blunt spines towards the base. The scales range in colour from shiny brown to bicoloured (pale and brown) and are often distinctly twisted. The sori are circular and occur on either side of the fertile pinnule midvein. True indusia are absent, although reduced scales may encircle the sori. In its montane range, A. australis is ecologically important as it provides the nesting substrate for Exoneura robusta, a native species of reed bee. These bees almost exclusively build their nests in the pith of dead A. australis fronds.Cronin, Adam L. \\"Social flexibility in a primitively social allodapine bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae): results of a translocation experiment.\\" Oikos 94.2 (2001): 337‚Äì343. This species of bee is an important pollinator of other plants in southeastern Australia, so thus it can be seen how A. australis is indirectly supportive of other plants in its ecosystem. Traditional use Joseph Maiden recorded in 1889 that \\"The pulp of the top of the trunk is full of starch, and is eaten raw and roasted by the aboriginals. This whitish substance is found in the middle of the tree from the base to the apex, and when boiled tastes like a bad turnip. Pigs feed on it greedily.\\" Cultivation Alsophila australis is a robust tub plant and tolerant of salty winds. It is a popular cool climate hardy tree-fern, adaptable to a variety of climates and soils. It grows in moist shady forest, both coastal and montane, at an altitude of up to 1280 m, often in the company of Dicksonia antarctica. It is a relatively hardy species and a popular landscape and container plant. Provided moisture levels remain high, it will tolerate frost and full sun, or shade in warmer regions. Although well known in its native country, this species is not common in cultivation outside of Australia.http://www.angelfire.com/wa/margate/australis.html The 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records how the pulp of the top of the trunk was eaten raw and roasted by Indigenous Australians. This whitish substance is found in the middle of the tree from the base to the apex. Horticulture In the horticultural trade, most plants labeled as Alsophila australis are in fact Sphaeropteris cooperi. Much confusion has existed between the two, especially in the United States, despite the two species being quite distinct from one another. A. australis is relatively stout trunked and has a large number of closely spaced fronds emerging at one time, with a slower increase in trunk height. S. cooperi in contrast, grows more quickly with fewer fronds emerging each year and has a much narrower trunk, with the frond bases aligned vertically for some distance (\\"hugging\\" the trunk as it were) before arching outwards.

It commemorates the location of a critical log boom where, from 1856 to 1914, timber from upriver was sorted and stored before being dispatched to sawmills downstream. The site was developed as a roadside park along Minnesota State Highway 95 in the 1930s. In 1966 it was designated a National Historic Landmark for its national significance in the theme of industry. It was nominated for being the earliest, most important, and longest serving of the log storage and handling operations that supported Minnesota's major logging industry. Virtually no traces remain of the site's original buildings and structures. Origin The vast white pine forests of the St. Croix River Valley became a major target for logging in the mid-19th century. The St. Croix and its tributaries provided easy transport downstream. Moreover, the St. Croix flowed directly into the Mississippi River, making a convenient route to the burgeoning communities all down the length of the nation plus the numerous inland settlements they served. Since multiple logging companies sent their timber down the same waterway, each company had a distinctive \\"timber mark\\" or \\"owner's mark\\" they stamped into the bottom of each log. In the 1830s and 40s the St. Croix harvest was collected and sorted downstream on an honor system, but the increasing number of companies and logs soon necessitated a more official approach. In 1851 the Minnesota Legislature chartered the St. Croix Boom Company, granting them the right to collect all logs at a certain point on the river, sort them according to mark, and deliver them to the appropriate owners in return for 40 cents per thousand board feet (17 cent/m¬≥). The Boom Company's leadership was largely composed of men from Marine, Taylors Falls, and Osceola, so the boom was initially located near Taylors Falls. However, there were two major problems with this. One was that this was upstream from the mouth of the Apple River, the St. Croix's second-most productive tributary. The other was that Stillwater was already becoming the region's primary lumber town, and mills there had to pay extra to have their logs timber rafted downstream. In 1856 the Boom Company ran into financial trouble, so a syndicate of Stillwater-based lumbermen led by Isaac Staples seized their opportunity to purchase and relocate the operation. Staples, familiar with log booms from his native Maine, picked an ideal site for the new boom. It was north of Stillwater in a stretch of the river that was narrow, high-banked, and naturally divided into multiple channels by small islands. Operation The St. Croix Boom Site around 1886 The St. Croix Log Boom used a series of booms‚Äîlogs chained end-to-end across the river‚Äîto catch timber as it floated downstream. Workers called \\"boom rats\\" moved among the booms on catwalks, noting the timber marks stamped on the incoming logs and sorting them into holding pens. When enough of one brand were gathered, the boom workers would form them into a timber raft, which a \\"fitting-up crew\\" would steer downstream to the correct mill. Some receiving mills were as far south as St. Louis. The boom operation was designed in such a way that it could handle both heavy and light volumes efficiently. In mid-summer logs could be backed up for above the boom, and hundreds of workers put in long days. However, in slow times the whole operation could run with a skeleton crew, leading to considerable labor savings. In 1890 the Boom Company completed the Nevers Dam upstream from Taylors Falls to control the flow of logs even further and to prevent log jams like the 1886 St. Croix River log jam that had disrupted the business. Impact The massive volume of logs on the river and the centrality of the St. Croix Boom Company to the all-important lumber industry led to major regional impacts. At peak times the log-choked river was impassable to steamboats. Travelers couldn't move upstream or downstream, farmers couldn't ship their goods to market, and towns like Taylors Falls were starved economically. Jumbles of logs could block drainage, flooding riverside farms and homes. The Boom Company did endeavor to provide teams and wagons to portage passengers and goods around blocked areas, transferring them to small steamboats upstream so they could continue their journeys. In the 1860s and 70s the company worked on a shipping canal to bypass the boom site. Millers, dependent on the Boom Company to deliver their logs, complained bitterly about any delays as well as the cost of the service. When logs weren't coming in, work was scarce, money was tight, and everyone in the lumber towns felt the pinch. The Boom Company had such economic and political clout that it became known as \\"The Octopus\\". However the Boom Company made it possible for 150‚Äì200 lumber companies to work the St. Croix and its tributaries. Feeding all the lumberjacks, log drivers, and sawmill workers fueled the agricultural sector throughout the river valley. When the valley had been denuded of its salable timber, and the St. Croix Boom closed on June 12, 1914, it had processed over 15.5 billion feet of logs. Thanks to the quantity of timber, generous sorting fee enshrined in state law, and ability to scale labor efficiently, the St. Croix Boom was the most profitable in the entire Midwestern United States. Wayside history St. Croix Boom Site historical marker The St. Croix Boom Site was one of the state's first sites to receive a roadside historical marker when the Minnesota Department of Highways began collaborating with the Minnesota Historical Society around 1929. A few years later as the Department of Highways began establishing scenic waysides throughout the state, the Boom Site was developed into a historic and recreational Roadside Parking Area as part of the extensive roadside improvements targeted around Stillwater. The St. Croix Boom Site Roadside Parking Area was developed 1935‚Äì1939 using New Deal federal labor relief programs, which had been instituted to combat widespread unemployment during the Great Depression. Landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols designed the plans while construction was largely carried out by young men employed through the National Youth Administration (NYA). They constructed a more permanent historical marker, a picnic area, fire rings, toilets, a stone wall, a guardrail, and a staircase down to the riverbank. They also landscaped the site, planting trees and improving a natural spring. In 1966 the site was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Three years later the former Highway Department, renamed the Minnesota Department of Transportation (or MnDOT), modernized the wayside. At that time the original restrooms, retaining wall, and fence were replaced, a parking area was redesigned, and paved walkways, picnic tables, drinking fountains, and staircase railings were added. Further alterations over the years resulted in the removal of other NYA elements, including the spring enclosure, another guard rail, and several fireplaces. Although many of Minnesota's New Deal-era waysides are listed on the National Register in the own right‚Äîincluding the nearby Stillwater Overlook‚Äîthe Boom Site was deemed ineligible because the changes over the years had too greatly compromised its historic integrity. During the onset of the Great Recession in 2008, MnDOT closed 86 waysides around the state under the justification that they no longer served a transportation safety function. Two organizations, the Friends of Washington County and the Friends of the St. Croix Boom Site, led a successful campaign to reopen the site. In 2010 MnDOT transferred management of the property to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. In 2014 the two Friends organizations helped gather public input on proposed improvements to the site. Possible additions included an information kiosk, picnic shelters, and an enclosure for the portable toilets, all styled after the Boom Site's logging-era structures. Description The staircase leading to the riverbank In the present day the St. Croix Boom Site is a park with five distinct areas. At the northern end is a large parking and picnic area, signposted as the \\"wayside\\". A few hundred yards to the south, but separated by a gully, is a smaller parking area with the historical marker and a staircase down to the riverbank. south is a scenic overlook, which provides the clearest view of the river for motorists. The overlook abuts the private Boomsite Marina, but a short distance downstream is a separate public boat launch. Traces of log boom operation are scant, as most of the structures were removed when the business closed in 1914. The historical marker is located near the site of the mess hall. A shallow cave near the base of the river stairs was used as a natural root cellar. The cook shanty stood on the blufftop directly above, and a dumbwaiter was rigged through a hole cut in the cave roof to deliver food directly from its storage area. The scenic overlook rises above the point where the main log boom was chained across the river. Across the highway from the wayside parking area is a private home that was once the St. Croix Boom Company House and Barn, built circa 1885 as the residence of the on-site superintendent. It was long assumed that no other structures remained from the log boom era, but in 1975 a historical survey crew from the National Park Service rediscovered two buildings hidden by forest. One was identified as a crew office that also functioned as a winter warming hut.

A native Detroiter, Gray was a star pitcher at Highland Park High School. He signed with the Tigers in 1942 at age 17 and played the 1942 season with Winston-Salem in the Piedmont League, posting a 13‚Äì14 record and a 2.04 ERA. He briefly joined the Tigers at the end of the 1942 season but did not play. Gray enlisted in the Navy when he turned 18 after the 1942 season. Gray was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station where he pitched for the Great Lakes team managed by Mickey Cochrane. Tigers pitchers Schoolboy Rowe and Dizzy Trout also pitched for Cochrane's star-studded Great Lakes team. Gray was transferred to the New Hebrides in the Pacific Theater, where he continued pitching for the Navy. He won 12 straight games and averaged 17 strikeouts per game in his Navy career. In January 1945, he pitched for the Navy All Stars. He lost his first game against the Army All Stars 3‚Äì1 despite striking out 19 batters. In three games against the Army All Stars, Gray had a 1‚Äì2 record and a remarkable 46 strikeouts. After the series, The Sporting News reported: \\"You can‚Äôt tell any of the fellows in this war sector that when peace is restored, Ted Gray won‚Äôt match the records of Grove, Hubbell, Pennock, Newhouser and the other great .\\" (The Sporting News, February 22, 1945.) After the war, Gray played with Buffalo before joining the Tigers for a brief stay in 1946. He pitched only three games in the Major Leagues in 1946 (an 0‚Äì2 record) and was returned to the minors where he spent the balance of the 1946 season and the entire 1947 season. Gray returned to the Tigers in 1948, posting a record of 6‚Äì2. Though Gray never lived up to the expectations that were created by his wartime performance, he became part of the Tigers starting rotation from 1949 to 1953. In 1949, Gray won 10 games and had a career-best 3.51 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 118). Gray then got off to a phenomenal start in 1950, winning 10 games before the All-Star break. He was selected for the American League All-Star team but ended up as the losing pitcher in the 1950 All-Star Game after giving up a game-winning home run to Red Schoendienst in the 14th inning. After the All Star game, Gray failed to win another game for the remainder of the year, finishing with a 10-7 record. Gray reportedly suffered from chronic blisters that hindered his performance. In 1951, Gray's downward slide continued as he led the American League in losses with a record of 7‚Äì14. And in 1952, Gray was among the league leaders in losses with 17 (third most in the AL) and earned runs allowed with 103 (third most in the AL). Gray was a power pitcher who was known for his forkball and ranked among the American League leaders in strikeouts four consecutive years from 1950 to 1954. He had the second-highest rate of strikeouts per 9 innings in both 1951 (5.97) and 1952 (5.88). He was also among the league leaders in home runs allowed on three occasions, leading the league in home runs allowed in 1953 with 25. At the end of the 1954 season, Gray was traded to the Chicago White Sox with Walt Dropo. He was released by four teams during the 1955 season. Only two other players have played for four American League teams in one season: Frank Huelsman and Paul Lehner. Gray posted a career won-loss record of 59‚Äì74 with a 4.37 ERA in 222 career games.

A native of Ohio, he served in World War I before becoming an attorney in Oregon. Later he served as President of the Oregon State Senate (1951‚Äì1952) and the 26th Governor of Oregon (1952‚Äì1956). He was the first Governor of Oregon who was born in the 20th century, as well as the most recent one to die in office. Early life Patterson was born on July 18, 1900, in Kent, Ohio. His father was George A. Patterson, at the time attending college in Ohio, and Paul's mother was Ada Linton Patterson. After completing college, George became a Congregationalist minister, and moved the family to Portland, Oregon, in 1908. In his first job, young Paul would work as a newsboy on the streets of Portland, later working up to his own paper route. He completed his public education, a graduate of Portland's Washington High School (now closed). Patterson served briefly in the U.S. Army during the First World War in the artillery. After the war, Patterson enrolled in the University of Oregon, first earning his B.A. in business administration (1923), then a Juris Doctor (1926). While in college, he met Georgia Searle Benson, the daughter of a prominent Portland family. They would marry on May 16, 1927, and later would have three children. After graduating, Patterson passed the State Bar and set up a law firm in Hillsboro, Oregon, in 1926. He would remain involved in this private practice until 1952. Political career The law firm would launch Patterson's political career, starting with a position as the Deputy District Attorney of Washington County from 1926 until 1933. After serving in this capacity, he went on to serve (at various times) as the city attorney for Hillsboro, Beaverton, Gaston, Sherwood, and Tualatin. Such service gained him prominence throughout Washington County's political establishment. He chaired the Washington County Republican Party up to 1944. This is when he noticed an open local seat in the Oregon State Senate which had no candidates for office. He agreed to run for it himself, winning in the November 1944 election. He would hold his Senate seat from 1945 until 1952, the last year as President of the Senate. =Governorship= Governor Douglas McKay resigned in 1952 to accept President Eisenhower's appointment as U.S. Secretary of the Interior. At this time, Patterson, as president of the Senate, was next in line for the governorship. He was sworn in as Oregon's 26th governor on December 27, 1952. Governor Patterson assumed office with a low political profile statewide, but proved to be popular. He easily won the Republican gubernatorial nomination and election in his own right in 1954. As with his other Republican contemporaries, he was fiscally conservative, but accepted federal money for unemployment aid, transportation projects, and water management programs. He strongly supported the state's transportation infrastructure, and encouraged the development of the state freeway system. No increases in funding or expansion of social programs were proposed under his leadership. An enduring legacy of Governor Paul Patterson is his opposition to a state sales tax without a popular vote. Any move to legislatively implement a sales tax has been met with major opposition since his administration. Inside his own party, he was looked upon favorably by both the national and local interests. Patterson had the backing of Portland's influential Arlington Club, some of whose most powerful members assisted his election campaigns. =Bid for the Senate and unexpected death= Republicans hoped to pick up Senator Wayne Morse's seat in the 1956 election, and considered the popular governor as the party's best chance. Patterson announced his candidacy January 28, 1956, at a time when his popularity was highest. Three days later, after his first campaign speech, Patterson collapsed during a meeting with campaign advisers at the Arlington Club in Portland on January 31, 1956. He was reported as suddenly slumping over in his chair. When examined, it was determined that he had suffered a coronary occlusion. The deceased governor was provided a state funeral on February 3, 1956. Patterson‚Äôs ashes were interred at River View Cemetery in Portland. President of the Senate Elmo Smith was sworn in to succeed Patterson as governor. Sources Further reading * Klooster, Karl.

Hyperrealism is considered an advancement of Photorealism by the methods used to create the resulting paintings or sculptures. The term is primarily applied to an independent art movement and art style in the United States and Europe that has developed since the early 1970s.Bredekamp, Horst, Hyperrealism - One Step Beyond. Tate Museum, Publishers, UK. 2006. p. 1 Carole Feuerman is the forerunner in the hyperrealism movement along with Duane Hanson and John De Andrea. History Belgian art dealer Isy Brachot coined the French word Hyperr√©alisme, meaning Hyperrealism, as the title of a major exhibition and catalogue at his gallery in Brussels in 1973. The exhibition was dominated by such American Photorealists as Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Don Eddy, Robert Bechtle and Richard McLean; but it included such influential European artists as Domenico Gnoli, Gerhard Richter, Konrad Klapheck, and . Since then, Hyperealisme has been used by European artists and dealers to apply to painters influenced by the Photorealists. Among contemporary European hyperrealist painters we find Gottfried Helnwein (Austrian), Willem van Veldhuizen and Tjalf Sparnaay (Dutch), Roger Wittevrongel (Belgian), as well as the French Pierre Barraya, Jacques Bodin, Ronald Bowen, Fran√ßois Bricq, G√©rard Schlosser, Jacques Monory, Bernard Rancillac, Gilles Aillaud and G√©rard Fromanger. Charles Bell, Circus Act, Silkscreen on Paper, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 1995 Early 21st century Hyperrealism was founded on the aesthetic principles of Photorealism. American painter Denis Peterson, whose pioneering works are universally viewed as an offshoot of Photorealism, first usedThompson, Graham, American Culture in the 1980s, Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp. 77‚Äì79. \\"Hyperrealism\\" to apply to the new movement and its splinter group of artists.Jean-Pierre Criqui, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn interview, Artforum International, June 1, 2003Robert Bechtle: A Retrospective by Michael Auping, Janet Bishop, Charles Ray, and Jonathan Weinberg. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA (2005). Graham Thompson wrote \\"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper- realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\\" However, Hyperrealism is contrasted with the literal approach found in traditional photorealist paintings of the late 20th century.Mayo, Deborah G., 1996, Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 57‚Äì72. Hyperrealist painters and sculptors use photographic images as a reference source from which to create a more definitive and detailed rendering, one that often, unlike Photorealism, is narrative and emotive in its depictions. Strict Photorealist painters tended to imitate photographic images, omitting or abstracting certain finite detail to maintain a consistent over-all pictorial design.Chase, Linda, Photorealism at the Millennium, The Not-So-Innocent Eye: Photorealism in Context. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. New York, 2002. pp. 14‚Äì15.Nochlin, Linda, The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II, Art In America. 61 (November - December 1973). p. 98. They often omitted human emotion, political value, and narrative elements. Since it evolved from Pop Art, the photorealistic style of painting was uniquely tight, precise, and sharply mechanical with an emphasis on mundane, everyday imagery. Hyperrealism, although photographic in essence, often entails a softer, much more complex focus on the subject depicted, presenting it as a living, tangible object. These objects and scenes in Hyperrealism paintings and sculptures are meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a reality not seen in the original photo. That is not to say they're surreal, as the illusion is a convincing depiction of (simulated) reality. Textures, surfaces, lighting effects, and shadows appear clearer and more distinct than the reference photo or even the actual subject itself.Meisel, Louis K. Photorealism. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York. 1980. p. 12. Hyperrealism has its roots in the philosophy of Jean Baudrillard, \\"the simulation of something which never really existed.\\"Jean Baudrillard, \\"Simulacra and Simulation\\", Ann Arbor Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1981 As such, Hyperrealists create a false reality, a convincing illusion based on a simulation of reality, the digital photograph. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are an outgrowth of extremely high-resolution images produced by digital cameras and displayed on computers. As Photorealism emulated analog photography, Hyperrealism uses digital imagery and expands on it to create a new sense of reality.Horrocks, Chris and Zoran Jevtic. Baudrillard For Beginners. Cambridge: Icon Books, 1996. pp. 80‚Äì84. Hyperrealistic paintings and sculptures confront the viewer with the illusion of manipulated high- resolution images, though more meticulous.Bredekamp, Horst, Hyperrealism - One Step Beyond. Tate Museum, Publishers, UK. 2006. pp. 1‚Äì4. Style and methods Man in a Boat (2002), by Ron Mueck, is a hyperrealistic 1/3 scale sculpture. The Hyperrealist style focuses much more of its emphasis on details and the subjects. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are not strict interpretations of photographs, nor are they literal illustrations of a particular scene or subject. Instead, they use additional, often subtle, pictorial elements to create the illusion of a reality which in fact either does not exist or cannot be seen by the human eye.Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh The Visual Arts: A History, 3rd Edition. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. New York, 1991. pp. 680‚Äì710. Furthermore, they may incorporate emotional, social, cultural and political thematic elements as an extension of the painted visual illusion; a distinct departure from the older and considerably more literal school of Photorealism.Meisel, Louis K. Photorealism. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York. 1980. Hyperrealist painters and sculptors make allowances for some mechanical means of transferring images to the canvas or mold, including preliminary drawings or grisaille underpaintings and molds. Photographic slide projections or multi media projectors are used to project images onto canvases and rudimentary techniques such as gridding may also be used to ensure accuracy.Meisel, Louis K. Photorealism. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York. 1980. pp. 12‚Äì13. Sculptures utilize polyesters applied directly onto the human body or mold. Hyperrealism requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate a false reality. As such, Hyperrealism incorporates and often capitalizes upon photographic limitations such as depth of field, perspective and range of focus. Anomalies found in digital images, such as fractalization, are also exploited to emphasize their digital origins by some Hyperrealist painters, such as Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Bert Monroy and Robert Bechtle.Battock, Gregory. Preface to Photorealism. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 1980. pp. 8‚Äì10. Themes Magda Torres Gurza (oil on canvas, 90x140 cm). Subject matter ranges from portraits, figurative art, still life, landscapes, cityscapes and narrative scenes. The more recent hyperrealist style is much more literal than Photorealism as to exact pictorial detail with an emphasis on social, cultural or political themes. This also is in stark contrast to the newer concurrent Photorealism with its continued avoidance of photographic anomalies. Hyperrealist painters at once simulate and improve upon precise photographic images to produce optically convincing visual illusions of reality, often in a social or cultural context.Petra Halkes, \\"A Fable in Pixels and Paint - Gottfried Helnwein's American Prayer\\". Image & Imagination, Le Mois de la Photo √† Montr√©al, McGill- Queen's University Press, 2005, .Alicia Miller, \\"The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection at SFMOMA\\", Artweek, US, Nov. 1, 2000. Some hyperrealists have exposed totalitarian regimes and third world military governments through their narrative depictions of the legacy of hatred and intolerance.Jean Baudrillard, \\"The Precession of Simulacra\\", in Media and Cultural Studies : Keyworks, Durham & Kellner, eds. . Denis Peterson and Gottfried Helnwein depicted political and cultural deviations of societal decadence in their work. Peterson's work focused on diasporas, genocides and refugees.Robert Ayers, Art Critic, \\"Art Without Edges: Images of Genocide in Lower Manhattan\\", Art Info, June 2, 2006 . Helnwein developed unconventionally narrative work that centered on past, present and future deviations of the Holocaust. Provocative subjects include enigmatic imagery of genocides, their tragic aftermath and the ideological consequences. Thematically, these controversial hyperreal artists aggressively confronted the corrupted human condition through narrative paintings as a phenomenological medium.George Ritzer, The McDonaldization of Society (2004). These lifelike paintings are an historical commentary on the grotesque mistreatment of human beings.Robert Flynn Johnson, Curator in Charge, \\"The Child - Works by Gottfried Helnwein\\", California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, , 2004. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures further create a tangible solidity and physical presence through subtle lighting and shading effects. Shapes, forms and areas closest to the forefront of the image visually appear beyond the frontal plane of the canvas; and in the case of sculptures, details have more clarity than in nature. Hyperrealistic images are typically 10 to 20 times the size of the original photographic reference source, yet retain an extremely high resolution in color, precision and detail. Many of the paintings are achieved with an airbrush, using acrylics, oils or a combination of both.

Wholesaling is selling goods in large quantities at a low unit price to retail merchants. The wholesaler will accept a slightly lower sales price for each unit, if the retailer will agree to purchase a much greater quantity of units, so the wholesaler can maximize profit. A wholesaler usually represents a factory where goods are produced. The factory owners can use economy of scale to increase profit as quantities sold soars. Retailing is buying goods in a wholesale market to sell them in small quantities at higher prices to consumers. Part of this profit is justified by logistics, the useful distribution function of the retailer, who delivers the goods to consumers and divides those large quantities of goods into many smaller units suitable for many transactions with many small parties of consumers. Retailers can also benefit from economy of scale to increase profit, just like a wholesaler does. Bulk purchasing is when a consumer captures part of the benefits of economy of scale by doing with the retailer what the retailer does with the wholesaler: paying a lower price per unit in exchange for purchasing much larger quantities. This allows the consumer to satisfy more of his or her demands at a lower total cost by acquiring more use value per dollar spent. Consumer demand for savings by bulk purchase has led to the success of big-box stores. Although effected by marginal cost, the total cost does not increase.

It is prepared with goat meat, tomato, celery, spring onion, ginger, candlenut and lime leaf, its broth is yellowish in colour. In Indonesia, sup kambing is quite widespread as numbers of similar goat meat soup recipes can be found. However, it is mostly associated with Malay of Medan, Betawi and Madurese cuisine, although it is also common in Java. Nevertheless, Javanese are more likely to cook their goat meat as tongseng or Javanese-style soupy gulai instead. Traditionally, sup kambing together with gulai and sate kambing are quite widespread during Eid al-Adha, as large amount of goat meat and offals being distributed among people. In Malaysia, sup kambing is associated with Muslim Malaysian Indian community and believed to be of Indian origin. In Singapore, the dish is also associated with the Muslim Indian community of the island. History Despite its wide popularity in the region, the question of origin however, might be owed to the Arabs and Muslim Indian migrations into the Malay archipelago. In Indonesia, sup kambing is believed to be of Arab origin, brought by the influx of Arabs migrants into the archipelago between the 18th to 19th century, during colonial era. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Java. Around the same period, other mutton or goat-based dishes such as sate kambing, gulai kambing and tongseng also appeared in Java. The early Arab immigrants settled in coastal towns of Sumatra and Java, and subsequently influenced the culture of native ethnic groups including Sumatran Malays, the Betawis of Batavia (Jakarta), also Javanese and Madurese of East Java. The sup kambing was adopted by locals, and often linked to Islamic festival of kurban (Eid al-Adha), where large numbers of cattle ‚Äì including goats, are slaughtered and distributed among people. As the result, despite its Arab origin, today in Indonesia sup kambing is more associated with Malay, Madurese and Betawi cuisine. Indonesian sup kambing uses carrot, tomato and sometimes potato, which hints its European (possibly Portuguese or Dutch) influences. Tomato and potato are not available in Southeast Asia, until European colonials brought them from the Americas around the 17th century. The sup kambing from Medan in North Sumatra however, is more closer to the Malaysian version, since they commonly derived from Muslim Indian culture. Sup Kambing stall in Kuala Lumpur. In Malay Peninsula region, which today includes Malaysia and Singapore, the most popular version is sup kambing Mamak which is believed was invented by the Muslim Indian community there, where the use of typical spices is quite notable.AC There is no exact equivalent of this soup in Indian sub-continent, although the spices used and the style of cooking clearly demonstrates Indian influence. Sup Tulang Merah in Singapore was invented by Baharudeen, Abdul Hameed (mammaka) and Abdul Kadir who were migrants from a remote village Thopputhurai in Tamilnadu. These three shops located at Jalan Sultan, Beach Road. The dish is also adopted by native Malays in the country. Ingredients There are many versions of sup kambing recipes, however there are two main groups of sup kambing traditions; the Indonesian version are derived mainly from Arab, and to some extent, Dutch influences, while Malaysian and Singaporean version is often called as sup kambing Mamak which solely derived from Muslim Indian influences. Other main differences are the Malaysian and Singaporean version consists of the chunks of goat meat in yellowish, rather thick and oily broth with rich spices; while in Indonesian version, the goat meat often also includes its bones (ribs or leg bones), has a lighter broth and balanced spices, and it also contains slices of vegetables including tomato, leek, celery, carrot and sometimes potato. A simple sup kambing recipe uses goat meat, slices of tomato, leek, celery, and ground spices which includes; ginger, pepper, garlic, shallot and salt. However, another elaborate recipes might add more complex spices, which might includes cardamom, cinnamon, candlenut, nutmeg, clove and star anise to add aroma and taste. Variations In Indonesia the soup is prepared in rich savoury broth with spices and ingredients similar to other Indonesian favourite, sop buntut (oxtail soup). Common sop kambing uses goat meat, also its ribs; however, in Indonesia there is a more specific sop kambing called sop kepala kambing which uses offals of goat's head, which includes its tongue, ear, lips and cheek meats, eyes and sometimes brain. Another specific sup kambing is called sop kaki kambing which uses goat's trotters.

Life and career Hughes was born in Rhosllannerchrugog near Wrexham and was educated at Ruabon Grammar School and at the Royal College of Music, where he studied with Ralph Vaughan Williams and C. H. Kitson. Following his studies at the RCM he became organist at the church of St Philip and St James, Oxford, and in 1935 returned to Wales to join the staff of the BBC‚Äôs music department. His duties included a great deal of conducting, and he directed the first performances of many works by Welsh composers, including Grace Williams, David Wynne, and Alun Hoddinott. He was also called upon to compose, arrange and orchestrate music for live radio broadcasts. Hughes became Head of Music at BBC Wales in 1965, holding the post until his retirement in 1971. He was appointed OBE in 1969 for his services to Welsh music and for organising the music for the Investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales, in the same year. From 1978 until 1986 he was Honorary Music Director of the Llangollen International Eisteddfod. For many years Arwel Hughes conducted performances by the Welsh National Opera, and his own two operas, Menna, to a libretto by Wyn Griffith, a tragedy based on a Welsh folk legend; and Serch yw‚Äôr Doctor (\\"Love‚Äôs the Doctor\\"), a comedy adapted by Saunders Lewis from Moli√®re's L'Amour m√©decin, were produced by WNO in 1953 and 1960 respectively. These works played an important role in the development of opera in Wales, and demonstrate Hughes' lyricism and melodic originality. He is best remembered for his music for chorus and orchestra. The large-scale oratorios, Dewi Sant (Saint David) and Pantycelyn, exemplify his imagination and technical competence and combine the early twentieth century British tradition with his original harmonic language. Gweddi (A Prayer) is a shorter work containing haunting melodies which encapsulate the spirit of the composer, which is recognisably Celtic. The composer‚Äôs orchestral writing includes a Fantasia for Strings which has received many performances. From the 1940s onwards, he produced a stream of works for orchestra including Suite for Orchestra, Prelude for Orchestra (dedicated to the Youth of Wales), Anatiomaros, and a symphony. There are a quantity of songs and chamber music. Hughes was the father of the Welsh orchestral conductor Owain Arwel Hughes.

It ran for one season in 1995. The beginning of the series is much as in the novel. A group of refugees attempting to escape the American Civil War in a balloon wind up stranded on a remote Pacific island, where they are able to improvise a comfortable living for themselves while they wait for a passing ship. As time passes, they become suspicious that some unseen force is watching and directing their movements. The main difference between the protagonists of the series and those of the novel is the addition of a female character, the wife of Pencroft. The unseen watcher, Captain Nemo, is more active and less benevolent than in the novel. Able to monitor the island through steampunk-style closed-circuit television and other advanced devices, he treats the castaways as human laboratory specimens, influencing their environment to test their behaviour under stressful conditions. As the series progresses, his tests become more extreme as their continued co-operation threatens his preferred thesis that all humans are, at base, selfish and untrustworthy. In the series finale, Nemo apparently succeeds in breaking up the group; this proves to be a ruse by the protagonists, who are now certain of Nemo's existence. After they penetrate his hideaway, Nemo admits that the 'experiment' is ruined, and offers to return the castaways to civilisation in his submarine. In a final twist, he puts out to sea without them, apparently leaving them alone on the island, without his influence for good or ill.

Essentially, Schopenhauer claimed that as phenomenal objects appearing to a viewer, humans have absolutely no free will. They are completely determined by the way that their bodies react to stimuli and causes, and their characters react to motives. As things that exist apart from being appearances to observers (noumenon), however, human life can be explained as following from the freedom of will (though not in a way satisfying Christian and other theology, as he says in other worksCf. e.g. On Human Nature, c. 3.). Summary Schopenhauer began by analyzing the basic concepts of freedom and self-consciousness. He asserted that there are three types of freedom, namely, physical, intellectual, and moral (the terms were sometimes used in philosophy, as he shows in chapter four). *Physical freedom is the absence of physical obstacles to actions. This negative approach can also be expressed positively: only he is free who acts according to one's will and nothing else. (This is commonly thought to constitute freedom of the will.) But when this simple meaning is used in connection with the will itself and the answer \\"will is free\\" is assumedlike with the question \\"can you will what you willed to will?\\" (and so on, because then one can always ask for the source of \\"willing to will\\" and whether it was free)one eventually commits an error of infinite regress, because one always seeks an earlier will which the current one adheres to. Also the verb \\"can\\", when understood physically in the above question, does not really solve the problem satisfactorily, so other meanings were sought. *Intellectual freedom results when the mind has a clear knowledge of the abstract or concrete motives to action. This occurs when the mind is not affected by, for example, extreme passion or mind-altering substances. *Moral freedom is the absence of any necessity in person's actions. As \\"necessary\\" means \\"that what follows from a given sufficient basis\\"‚Äîwhereas, likewise, all sufficient bases act with necessity (because they are sufficient), and thus there is no possibility that a cause does not bring its effect‚Äîa will containing a free element (liberum arbitrium) and thus arising without necessity would imply the existence of something that has no cause whatsoever and is completely arbitrary and unaffected (liberum arbitrium indifferentiae, freedom of will not influenced by anything). This would be the undetermined part (whereas apart from that something could, possibly, still influence man). *Self-consciousness is a person's awareness of their own willing, including emotions and passions. In the course of the analysis Schopenhauer declares that the opposition of necessary is known as contingent or incidental,Zuf√§llig in his native German language, which combines all the meanings of fortuity, chance, randomness, incidentality and continency. See German edition, the 2nd paragraph of that page. which is normally encountered in the real world as just relative contingency (a coincidence) of two events‚Äîof which both still have their causes and are necessary with regard to them. Two things are incidental, or contingent, to each other when one does not cause the other. He then derives the concept of absolute contingency by extending the former term so that no sufficient basis exists whatsoever; such thing would not be incidental with regard to something, but with regard to all and everything. He concludes that liberum arbitrium indifferentiae would mean exactly such incident (a chance), an absolutely fortuitous or random occurrence. He notes that with such liberum arbitrium indifferentiae one would be equally capable of doing one thing or the other. According to Schopenhauer, when a person inspects their self-consciousness, they find the feeling \\"I can do whatever I will as long as I am not hindered.\\" But, Schopenhauer claimed that this is merely physical freedom. He asserted \\"You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.\\" Therefore, the Royal Society's question has been answered \\"No.\\" On the other hand, when a person observes the external world, they find that any change in a thing was immediately preceded by a change in some other thing. This sequence is experienced as a necessary effect and its cause. Humans experience three types of causes. *Cause in the narrowest sense of the word relates to mechanical, physical, and chemical changes in an inorganic object. Newton's laws of motion describe these changes. *Stimulus is a change that produces a reaction in an organism that is devoid of knowledge, such as vegetation. It requires physical contact. The effect is related to the duration and intensity of the stimulus. *Motivation is causality that passes through a knowing mind. The motive needs only to be perceived, no matter how long, how close, or how distinct it appears. For animals, the motive must be immediately present. Humans, however, can also respond to motives that are abstract concepts and mere thoughts. Therefore, humans are capable of deliberation in which a stronger abstract motive outweighs other motives and necessarily determines the will to act. This is a relative freedom in which humans are not determined by objects that are immediately present. Every human has a unique way of reacting to motives. This is called a character. It is the nature of the individual will. Human character has four attributes. *Individual ‚Äì Like intellectual capacity, each person's character is different. Acts can't be predicted by knowledge of motives alone. Knowledge of individual character is also required in order to predict how a person will act. *Empirical ‚Äì The character of other people or oneself can only be known through experience. Only by seeing actual behavior in a situation can character be known. *Constant ‚Äì Character does not change. It remains the same throughout life. This is presupposed whenever a person is evaluated as a result of their past actions. Given the same circumstances, what was done once will be done again. Behavior, however, can change when a character learns how to attain its goal through a different way of acting. The means change, but not the ends. This is the result of improved cognition or education. *Inborn ‚Äì Characters are determined by nature, not by the environment. Two people who have been raised in exactly the same environment will exhibit different characters. Virtue cannot be taught. The tendency toward good or evil is the result of inborn character. Are two actions possible to a given person under given circumstances? No. Only one action is possible. Since a person's character remains unchanged, if the circumstances of his life were unchanged, could his life have been different? No. Everything that happens, happens necessarily. Denial of necessity leads one back to the idea of absolute randomness, which can hardly be thought of; the world without universal causation would be \\"randomness with no sense in it\\". Through that which we do, we find out what we are. To wish that some event had not taken place is a silly self-torture, for this means to wish something absolutely impossible. It is an error to think that abstract motives do not have necessary effects because they are mere thoughts. This error results in the delusion that we can be conscious of having free will. In reality, the most powerful abstract motive necessarily determines concrete action. The fourth chapter deals with important predecessors of Schopenhauer in the topic. Amongst others, Thomas Hobbes is quoted, who shows that wherever one can speak of a necessary condition for a thing or an event (one they cannot happen without), that thing or event can be thought of as determined, occurring out of necessity, and having a well defined sufficient cause. That cause is precisely the sum of such necessary conditions; it does not lack anything which is necessary to bring its effect. (Theoretically, although Schopenhauer does not consider this, a specific realization of a random variable‚Äîlike the mentioned liberum arbitrium indifferentiae‚Äîcould perhaps still be amongst the set of conditions.) Christian writers and those of the Enlightenment are mentioned, as well as theodice and the problem of evil. After explaining how acts follow with strict necessity from a given character and its response to different motives, and after presenting various views of famous thinkers hitherto, Schopenhauer addressed the question of moral freedom and responsibility. Everyone has a feeling of the responsibility for what they do. They feel accountable for their actions. They are certain that they themselves have done their deeds. In order to have acted differently, a person would have had to be entirely different. Schopenhauer claimed that the necessity of our actions can coexist with the feeling of freedom and responsibility in a way that was explained by Kant. In his Critique of Pure Reason (A533‚Äì558) and Critique of Practical Reason (Ch. III), Kant explained this coexistence. When a person has a mental picture of himself as a phenomenon existing in the experienced world, his acts appear to be strictly determined by motives that affect his character. This is empirical necessity. But when that person feels his inner being as a thing-in-itself, not phenomenon, he feels free. According to Schopenhauer, this is because the inner being or thing-in-itself is called will. This word \\"will\\" designates the closest analogy to that which is felt as the inner being and essence of a person. When we feel our freedom, we are feeling our inner essence and being, which is a transcendentally free will. The will is free, but only in itself and other than as its appearance in an observer's mind. When it appears in an observer's mind, as the experienced world, the will does not appear free. But because of this transcendental freedom, as opposed to empirical necessity, every act and deed is a person's own responsibility. We have responsibility for our acts because what we are is a result of our inner essence and being, which is a transcendentally free will (its effects are the inborn characters of all people). We are what the transcendental will, which we are, has made us.

He has sometimes performed under the stage names Nick \\"The Greek\\" Gravenites and Gravy. Biography Gravenites was born in Chicago, into a Greek-speaking family; his parents were from Palaiochoriton, Arcadia, in Greece. After his father died, he worked in the family candy store before he was enrolled at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy; he was expelled shortly before he was due to graduate. He then attended the University of Chicago, met Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield, became a fan of blues music, and learned guitar. He regularly patronised clubs where Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy and other leading blues musicians played. Gravenites spent time both in Chicago and San Francisco in the early 1960s. He wrote the song \\"Born in Chicago\\", which became the opening track on the Paul Butterfield Blues Band debut album, and, with guitarist Bloomfield, co-wrote the title track of their second album, East-West; the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Gravenites played in clubs with Mike Bloomfield, Charlie Musselwhite and others, and settled in San Francisco in the mid 1960s. \\"Nick Gravenites\\", All About Blues Music. Retrieved 1 May 2020 In 1967 he formed the Electric Flag with Bloomfield. Gravenites also wrote the score for the film The Trip and produced the music for the film Steelyard Blues. According to author and pop music critic Joel Selvin, Gravenites is \\"the original San Francisco connection for the Chicago crowd.\\" Gravenites is credited as a \\"musical handyman\\", helping such San Francisco bands as Quicksilver Messenger Service and Janis Joplin's first solo group, the Kozmic Blues Band. He wrote several songs for Joplin, including \\"Work Me, Lord\\" and the unfinished instrumental track \\"Buried Alive in the Blues\\". Gravenites was the lead singer in the re-formed Big Brother and the Holding Company (without Joplin) from 1969 to 1972. He also worked extensively with John Cipollina after producing the first album by Quicksilver Messenger Service. He and Cipollina formed the Nick Gravenites‚ÄìJohn Cipollina Band, which toured throughout Europe. Gravenites produced the pop hit \\"One Toke Over the Line\\" for Brewer & Shipley and the album Right Place, Wrong Time for Otis Rush, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award. He and John Kahn produced the 1970 album Not Mellowed with Age, by Southern Comfort (CBS S 64125). Gravenites often used pianist Pete Sears in his band Animal Mind, including on his 1980 Blue Star album, on which Sears played keyboards and bass.Discogs entry for Bluestar. Retrieved 22 June 2020 In the early 1980s, Gravenites performed and recorded with a revolving group of San Francisco Bay area rock, blues, and soul musicians called the Usual Suspects. Their first album, The Usual Suspects, was released in 1981. Gravenites and Sears played together in front of 100,000 people on Earth Day 1990 at Crissy Field, San Francisco. Sears also joined him for a tour of Greece. Gravenites still performs live in northern California. He was inducted to the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003 for his song \\"Born in Chicago\\". He has toured with the Chicago Blues Reunion and a new Electric Flag Band. Gravenites is featured in the documentary film Born in Chicago, in which he and several other Chicago natives tell of growing up with blues music in Chicago. The film was shown at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, in 2013. He currently resides in Occidental, California.

The structure of a projective connection is modeled on the geometry of projective space, rather than the affine space corresponding to an affine connection. Much like affine connections, projective connections also define geodesics. However, these geodesics are not affinely parametrized. Rather they are projectively parametrized, meaning that their preferred class of parameterizations is acted upon by the group of fractional linear transformations. Like an affine connection, projective connections have associated torsion and curvature. Projective space as the model geometry The first step in defining any Cartan connection is to consider the flat case: in which the connection corresponds to the Maurer-Cartan form on a homogeneous space. In the projective setting, the underlying manifold M of the homogeneous space is the projective space RPn which we shall represent by homogeneous coordinates [x0,...,xn]. The symmetry group of M is G = PSL(n+1,R).It is also possible to use PGL(n+1,R), but PSL(n+1,R) is more convenient because it is connected. Let H be the isotropy group of the point [1,0,0,...,0]. Thus, M = G/H presents M as a homogeneous space. Let {\\\\mathfrak g} be the Lie algebra of G, and {\\\\mathfrak h} that of H. Note that {\\\\mathfrak g} = {\\\\mathfrak s}{\\\\mathfrak l}(n+1,{\\\\mathbb R}). As matrices relative to the homogeneous basis, {\\\\mathfrak g} consists of trace-free (n+1)√ó(n+1) matrices: :\\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\lambda&v;^i\\\\\\\\\\\\ w_j&a;_j^i \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right),\\\\quad (v^i)\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^{1\\\\times n}, (w_j)\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^{n\\\\times 1}, (a_j^i)\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^{n\\\\times n}, \\\\lambda = -\\\\sum_i a_i^i . And {\\\\mathfrak h} consists of all these matrices with (wj) = 0. Relative to the matrix representation above, the Maurer-Cartan form of G is a system of 1-forms (Œ∂, Œ±j, Œ±ji, Œ±i) satisfying the structural equationsCartan's approach was to derive the structural equations from the volume-preserving condition on SL(n+1) so that explicit reference to the Lie algebra was not required. :dŒ∂ + ‚àëi Œ±i‚àßŒ±i = 0 :dŒ±j \\\\+ Œ±j‚àßŒ∂ + ‚àëk Œ±jk‚àßŒ±k = 0 :dŒ±ji \\\\+ Œ±i‚àßŒ±j \\\\+ ‚àëk Œ±ki‚àßŒ±jk = 0 :dŒ±i \\\\+ Œ∂‚àßŒ±i \\\\+ ‚àëkŒ±k‚àßŒ±ki = 0A point of interest is this last equation is completely integrable, which means that the fibres of G ‚Üí G/H can be defined using only the Maurer-Cartan form, by the Frobenius integration theorem. Projective structures on manifolds A projective structure is a linear geometry on a manifold in which two nearby points are connected by a line (i.e., an unparametrized geodesic) in a unique manner. Furthermore, an infinitesimal neighborhood of each point is equipped with a class of projective frames. According to Cartan (1924), :Une vari√©t√© (ou espace) √† connexion projective est une vari√©t√© num√©rique qui, au voisinage imm√©diat de chaque point, pr√©sente tous les caract√®res d'un espace projectif et dou√©e de plus d'une loi permettant de raccorder en un seul espace projectif les deux petits morceaux qui entourent deux points infiniment voisins. ... :Analytiquement, on choisira, d'une mani√®re d'ailleurs arbitraire, dans l'espace projectif attach√© √† chaque point a de la vari√©t√©, un rep√©re d√©finissant un syst√®me de coordonn√©es projectives. ... Le raccord entre les espaces projectifs attach√©s √† deux points infiniment voisins a et a' se traduira analytiquement par une transformation homographique. ...A variety (or space) with projective connection is a numerical variety which, in the immediate neighbourhood of each point, possesses all the characters of a projective space and is moreover endowed with a law making it possible to connect in a single projective space the two small regions which surround two infinitely close points. Analytically, we choose, in a way otherwise arbitrary, a frame defining a projective frame of reference in the projective space attached to each point of the variety. .. The connection between the projective spaces attached to two infinitely close points a and a' will result analytically in a homographic (projective) transformation. .. This is analogous to Cartan's notion of an affine connection, in which nearby points are thus connected and have an affine frame of reference which is transported from one to the other (Cartan, 1923): :La vari√©t√© sera dite √† \\"connexion affine\\" lorsqu'on aura d√©fini, d'une mani√®re d'ailleurs arbitraire, une loi permettant de rep√©rer l'un par rapport √† l'autre les espaces affines attach√©s √† deux points infiniment voisins quelconques m et m' de la vari√©t√©; cete loi permettra de dire que tel point de l'espace affine attach√© au point m' correspond √† tel point de l'espace affine attach√© au point m, que tel vecteur du premier espace es parall√®le ou √©quipollent √† tel vecteur du second espace.The variety will be said to \\"affinely connected\\" when one defines, in a way otherwise arbitrary, a law making it possible to place the affine spaces, attached to two arbitrary infinitely close points m and m' of the variety, in correspondence with each other; this law will make it possible to say that a particular point of the affine space attached to the point m' corresponds to a particular point of the affine space attached to the point m, in such a way that a vector of the first space is parallel or equipollent with the corresponding vector of the second space. In modern language, a projective structure on an n-manifold M is a Cartan geometry modelled on projective space, where the latter is viewed as a homogeneous space for PSL(n+1,R). In other words it is a PSL(n+1,R)-bundle equipped with * a PSL(n+1,R)-connection (the Cartan connection) * a reduction of structure group to the stabilizer of a point in projective space such that the solder form induced by these data is an isomorphism.

The action marked the final phase of the British army's advance into the interior of Spain, before they began their harrowing retreat to the coast and ultimate evacuation by sea. Background Sir John Moore led a British army into the heart of northwestern Spain with the aim of aiding the Spanish in their struggle against French occupation. However, Napoleon had entered Spain at the head of a large army intending to reestablish French interests. This, together with the fall of the Spanish capital Madrid to the French, made the position of the British army untenable. Moore, whose headquarters was at Mayorga, was aware that he must retreat towards the coast in the face of the overwhelming odds ranged against him. However, he was also aware that Marshal Soult's apparently unsupported corps was nearby, on the Carri√≥n River, and before beginning his retreat he wished to make a strike against Soult. As part of this design the cavalry under Henry, Lord Paget were sent towards Soult, as a reconnaissance in force, ahead of the infantry.Hibbert, pp. 57-60. ;Forces The French fielded a brigade under C√©sar Alexandre Debelle composed of the 1st Provisional Chasseurs √† cheval and the 8th Dragoons. The British force was the 15th Light Dragoons (Hussars) from the brigade of Charles Stewart and the 10th Light Dragoons (Hussars) of John Slade's brigade, however, the latter regiment did not come into direct combat. Battle French 8th Dragoons On a bitterly cold night Lord Paget ordered the 10th Hussars to move through the town of Sahag√∫n, then occupied by a French cavalry force, whilst he made a sweep around Sahag√∫n with the 15th Hussars in order that the French might be trapped.Fletcher, p. 91 Unfortunately General John Slade was tardy in moving off with the 10th Hussars; the French cavalry became aware of the proximity of the British cavalry and exited from the town to the east unmolested.Fletcher, p. 91. Slade apparently harrangued his hussars with a lengthy and quite ludicrous speech, ending with the words: \\"blood and slaughter. March!\\" In the dawn light the French regiments, catching sight of the 15th Hussars to the south, formed up in two lines with the 1st Provisional Chasseurs (commanded by Colonel Tascher, a relative of the Empress Josephine - though he may not have been present) in front and the 8th Dragoons behind them. Unusually, the French cavalry received the charge of the British hussars whilst stationary and tried to halt it with carbine fire.Hibbert, p. 62. The 15th Hussars charged, over about of snowy, frozen ground, shouting \\"Emsdorf and Victory!\\"Emdsorf being an earlier action, 16 July 1760, in which the 15th had played a notable part. Not all of the 15th proved to be equally adept, it is reported that one clumsy hussar managed to shoot his own horse during the pursuit, Hibbert, p. 62. It was so cold the hussars wore their pelisses, rather than having them slung over their shoulders, and many had cloaks over all. Eyewitnesses also spoke of numbed hands hardly able to grasp reins and sabres. The impact when the hussars met the chasseurs was terrible, as one British officer recorded: \\"horses and men were overthrown and a shriek of terror, intermixed with oaths, groans and prayers for mercy issued from the whole extent of their front.\\" The impetus of the British hussars carried them through the ranks of the chasseurs and into those of the dragoons behind. The French force was broken, and it routed eastwards with the British in pursuit. Many French cavalrymen (though the chasseurs were largely of German origin) were taken prisoner at very little cost to the 15th Hussars.Fletcher, pp. 93-94 Two French lieutenant colonels were captured and the chasseurs, who lost many men captured, ceased to exist as a viable regiment.Fletcher, p. 95 The 10th Hussars came up during the pursuit, however, they were initially mistaken for French cavalry. This caused the 15th Hussars to break off their pursuit to re-form, ending the action.Glover, p. 80 Aftermath Contemporary British hussar private (7th Hussars) with mount, and horse furniture in foreground (a dozen men of the 7th Hussars fought at Sahagun, serving as Lord Paget's escort) News reached Moore that the main French forces were much closer to him than he had thought; therefore the attack against Soult was abandoned. The cavalry action at Sahagun marked the final advance before the British began their long, painful and almost disastrous retreat towards the port of Corunna on the Galician coast.Hibbert, pp. 64-65. The presence of the British army had, as Moore intended, focussed Napoleon's attention upon it allowing the Spanish forces some time to reorganise and regroup after the defeats they had suffered. The 15th Hussars' charge and subsequent victory meant that the French cavalry were reluctant to fight the British cavalry for the remainder of the campaign. The French 1st Provisional Chasseurs were so depleted by their losses at Sahagun that they were disbanded. The British Hussars were to gain one more victory over their French counterparts during the campaign when, on 29 December 1808, at Benavente they drove Napoleon's elite Chasseurs √† cheval of the Imperial Guard into the River Esla, capturing their commanding general, Lefebvre- Desnouettes. The 15th Hussars were awarded \\"Sahagun\\" as a Battle Honour, which is still celebrated today by The Light Dragoons and B Battery 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery.

Carr and a group of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers led by Tall Bull, who was killed during the engagement. The US forces were assigned to retaliate for a series of raids in north-central Kansas by Chief Tall Bull's Dog Soldiers band of the Cheyenne. The battle happened south of Sterling, Colorado in Washington County near the Logan/Washington county line. Battle After Pawnee Scouts under Major Frank North led his command to Tall Bull's village, Colonel Carr, a veteran campaigner known as \\"The Black-Bearded Cossack\\",The Handbook of Texas Online deployed his forces carefully so that they hit the unsuspecting camp from three sides at once. He had 244 men of the 5th United States Regiment of Cavalry and 50 Pawnee Scouts.Berthrong, p. 343 Captain Luther North of the Pawnee Scout Battalion related this incident in the book Man of the Plains: > About a half mile from and off to one side from our line, a Cheyenne boy was > herding horses. He was about fifteen years old and we were very close to him > before he saw us. He jumped on his horse and gathered up his herd and drove > them into the village ahead of our men, who were shooting at him. He was > mounted on a very good horse and could easily have gotten away if he had > left his herd, but he took them all in ahead of him, then at the edge of the > village he turned and joined a band of warriors that were trying to hold us > back, while the women and children were getting away, and there he died like > a warrior. No braver man ever existed than that 15 year old boy.North, p. > 114 Major Frank North saw an Indian rise from cover and take aim at him. He shot and killed the man, who turned out to be Chief Tall Bull. Meanwhile, the Pawnee surrounded 20 Cheyenne warriors who were sheltering in a ravine. Armed only with bows and arrows, the Cheyenne kept their attackers at bay until their arrows ran out, whereupon the Pawnees moved in and killed them all. According to the anthropologist George Bird Grinnell (who worked with George Bent in the 20th century on these accounts), in addition to Tall Bull and the twenty men in the ravine, nine other people were killed by members of the Pawnee Scout Battalion: two warriors (Lone Bear and Pile of Bones); a very old Suhtai woman on a slow pony; two Sioux women running on foot; a Cheyenne woman and two children (a boy and a girl); and an old Sioux woman whose horse fell and threw her.Grinnell, pp. 314-315, 317 Grinnell noted only four victims who were not attributed to the Pawnee Scout Battalion: the wife, mother-in-law and two young children of a man named Red Cherries.Grinnell, p. 316 Grinnell and Donald J. Berthrong identified 23 warriors, one fifteen-year-old boy, five women and two children killed by members of the Pawnee Scout Battalion, and two women and two children whose killers are not specified.Berthrong, p. 343 This gives a total of 35 people killed. It appears that, although the 5th Cavalrymen had the greater number of participants, the Pawnees were more successful in the killing. One Cheyenne escaped on Tall Bull's distinctive white horse. He was shot off it by Scout William Cody (Buffalo Bill) in a skirmish the next day, leading Cody to believe that he had killed Tall Bull. In his biography of Luther North, Grinnell footnoted this event, saying: > William Cody later claimed he had killed Tall Bull and Cody's protagonists > have stated that Luther North's account of the shooting was an invention. > However, while Frank was a partner with Cody in the cattle business, he > related the story of the shooting in detail essentially as Luther > recollected it.North, p. 128 Carr reported only a single casualty in his command (a trooper wounded) and claimed that 52 Indians had been killed. Seventeen women and children were captured, along with more than 300 horses and mules.

It was filmed in Thailand and directed by Russell Mulcahy. Plot summary During the Civil War six survivors escape from a prison camp in Richmond, Virginia by hot air balloon and find themselves on an uncharted island in the Pacific: leading the group is Cyrus Smith (Kyle MacLachlan). Far from any kind of known civilization, the island is inhabited by carnivorous giant insects and animals, bloodthirsty pirates, and mad genius Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart), who lives on the island for his own secretive ends. When Smith is rescued from drowning by Nemo's remaining crewman, he talks with Nemo about his role in the war and the atrocities committed by Nemo in his younger days; the rest of his group must try and survive without him, which becomes more difficult when one of them is eaten by a giant mantis. As Helen discovers a gold medallion with a strange map on it, Nemo tries to convince Smith to remain in his compound, but Smith refuses to abandon his friends to the island, convincing Nemo and Joseph to track and rescue the rest of the survivors from a giant ant... unaware that pirate Captain Bob Harvey is coming to the island, looking for a lost treasure said to be hidden on the island. Although Nemo refuses to allow the crew to leave, the survivors contemplate their next move while exploring the compound. Unaware of the pirates on the island, the survivors talk with Nemo about his role in the Indian rebellion, during which he reveals that his wife and daughter were killed by the British to try to find his location. Nemo reveals that he plans to prevent war by perfecting the ultimate weapon, capable of destroying an entire city, using an element unique to this island, thus making war impossible as the consequences would be too devastating if such weapons were used. He offers Smith the chance to work with him, but Smith rejects the offer, feeling that the consequences of revealing the weapon's existence would be too dangerous as there is no way to be certain how others would react to Nemo's demonstration, prompting Nemo to exile the survivors. While wandering the island, they are attacked by giant beetles, but manage to escape by jumping into a river. Following the river to the ocean, they find an old port and boat, but the boat is rotten and useless to them, and they are subsequently attacked by a giant scorpion that nearly kills Helen, Jane and Smith before Neb and Pencroff manage to kill it. Exploring the island, the survivors - after witnessing a stranger running through a wood - find a cave on a cliff which they make their new home. While out collecting food, Helen encounters Blake - one of the pirate crew left behind during an earlier raid - and shelters from a storm in the survivors' original cave with him, but he declines the offer to join them due to his past, although he advises her to conceal her medallion. Helen is later captured by a bird, but is rescued by Blake and the stranger, Blake recognizing him as Atherton, a former member of Harvey's crew who was abandoned after a mutiny. While attempting to construct a raft, they witness Harvey's ship arriving outside their cave, prompting Atherton to reveal that he was marooned rather than killed because he is Bob Harvey's brother. Helen attempts to locate and move the gold for safe keeping, but is captured by Harvey's men, prompting Blake to suggest a raid on the ship to rescue her. The rescue succeeds - the pirates' superior numbers being defeated by the element of surprise and Blake and Atherton's experience with the ship, allowing Pencroff to steal the amulet comprising the other half of the medallion's map -, but Blake is shot as they are escaping. Having returned to shore, the crew meet Joseph, who provides them with repeating rifles to use against a new wave of pirates. During the subsequent fight, the survivors manage to drive off the pirates when Atherton forces Harvey into a stand-off, but Joseph is shot while departing. Staggering back to Nemo's home, Joseph pleads with Nemo to realize that he needs the survivors to remind him of what it means to be human, noting that they are still innocents despite Nemo's disappointment with the rest of the human race. Angered at the survivors' defiance of him, Harvey begins to fire the ship's cannons at the cave house, destroying the raft the survivors were attempting to build, but the ship is destroyed by Nemo. As the others begin work on a new raft, Pencroff departs to try to find the treasure - needing the money to pay off his debts back in America-, but the cave where the treasure is kept is also home to gigantic spiders that kill him despite Neb's attempt to save him. As they attend Pencroff's funeral, Nemo appears to them, revealing that his equipment has detected seismic activity that suggests that the island's volcano is about to erupt. Although he provides them with the location of a boat at his compound, he attempts to recover his equipment and plans from the Nautilus, resulting in him being trapped in the Nautilus as a lava flow fills the cavern where the ship was kept, leaving the remaining survivors to retreat in the offered boat and hope that they will find a way home.

Biography Butler was born in Lancaster in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In 1770 he moved with his parents to West Windsor, Vermont. His mother died while he was still a boy, and, after living with his elder brother for several years, he engaged in agricultural pursuits in Claremont, New Hampshire, until he was an adult. He served in the Continental Army for six months in 1779 during the American Revolution. Career In 1775 Butler staked a claim, as the second settler in Waterbury, Vermont. He returned in 1776 with his wife, Tryphena Diggins, with whom he eventually had eleven children. In 1785, Butler studied law in Waterbury, Vermont, and after he passed the bar, in 1786, he practiced law, and served as Town Clerk in 1790. In 1790, he began to think seriously on religious subjects, became a Baptist in 1791, and in 1800 began to preach at Bolton, Vermont. A Baptist church was organized in Waterbury in 1800, and he was its pastor for more than thirty years. He did not allow his ordination to the ministry to interfere with his public career. Butler was one of the first three selectmen of Waterbury. He was elected member of the Vermont House of Representatives, an office he held from 1794 to 1797; from 1799 to 1804; in 1807; and in 1808. He was the first judge of the Chittenden County Court from 1803 to 1806; Chief Justice in Chittenden County from 1806 to 1811; and Chief Justice of Jefferson County from 1812 to 1825 (excepting periods of congressional service). He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Thirteenth Congress and a member of the State Constitutional Convention in 1822. Butler was elected as a National Republican Governor of Vermont from 1826 to 1828. During his tenure, lotteries were abolished, and legislation was passed to require the examination of teachers. In the 1832 election for President, Vermont was carried by Anti-Masonic Party candidate William Wirt. Butler was one of Vermont's electors, and cast his vote for Wirt.Vermont Secretary of State, Legislative Directory, 1888, page 77 Death Butler died in Waterbury on July 12, 1838, and is interred at Waterbury Cemetery.

Overview  Born in 1861 in K≈çchi Prefecture, Japan, Seito Saibara was the first Christian member of the Japanese Diet at a time when there was strong opposition to Christianity in Japan. Later Saibara would be asked to relinquish his seat in the parliament to become president of Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan. = Rice farming = In 1901 Saibara came to Hartford, Connecticut to study at Hartford Theological Seminary. He was then encouraged by Japanese Consul General Sadatsuchi Uchida, the Houston Chamber of Commerce and the Southern Pacific Railroad to travel to Texas to teach rice production to local farmers. In 1903 Saibara moved to Texas where he began the first Japanese-Christian colony in the state. His extended family (including his parents Hide and Masuya, and his son Kiyoaki) and 30 other colonists joined him in Webster, Texas to begin rice farming on a lease that Saibara later bought.City of Webster - Gateway to the future at www.cityofwebster.com The first crop, grown from seed imported as a gift from the Emperor of Japan and harvested in 1904, was primarily distributed as seed in Texas and Louisiana. At that time, the average rice yield using seed from Honduras or the Carolinas was 18-20 barrels an acre while the Japanese seeds yielded per acre. Seito and Kiyoaki Saibara are credited with building the multimillion- dollar Texas rice industry with their improved rice strains and production techniques. = Later Life & Death = Saibara left Texas with his wife and spent fifteen years in South America, where he established colonies along the Amazon River, before returning to Japan. Ill health caused him to return to Texas in 1937. He died, still a Japanese citizen, in Webster on April 11, 1939, and was buried at the Fairview Cemetery.

It is an invasive plant species in many tropical regions of the world, creating serious damage. Physical description Clidemia hirta is a densely branching long-lived (perennial) shrub normally growing 0.5-3 m tall, but sometimes reaching 5 m in height, depending on habitat. In more shaded habitats it grows much taller than it does in exposed areas, where it typically grows less than 1 m tall. The younger stems are rounded and are covered in large, stiff, brown or reddish-colored hairs (they are strigose). The oppositely arranged simple leaves are borne on stalks. They are oval or egg-shaped in outline with broad end at base, with pointed tips, and almost entire to finely toothed margins. Their upper surfaces are sparsely covered in hairs, similar to those found on the stems, while their lower surfaces and margins are more densely hairy. The leaves also have a somewhat wrinkled appearance and five distinct veins that run in an almost parallel fashion from the leaf bases to their tips. The flowers are arranged in small clusters at the tips of the branches. Each flower is borne on a very short stalk and has five white, or occasionally pale pinkish, petals. The base of the flower is swollen into a cup-shaped structure which is moderately to sparsely covered with a mixture of bristly and sticky hairs. The flowers also have five sepals, but these are very small, and five distinctive stamens that have a claw-like appearance. The small, rounded fruit are berries and are either dark blue, purplish or blackish in color. Each of these berries contains over 100 light brown colored seeds. These fruit are also covered in stiff spreading hairs, especially when they are young. In terms of economic uses, Clidemia hirta has been widely introduced as an ornamental plant. Ornamental plants are used for decorative purposes, such as gardens and houseplants.BioNET-eafrinet, keys and fact sheets. Clidemia Hirsta (Koster‚Äôs Curse). Web. Distribution and habitat Originally from the American Neotropics (Mexico to Paraguay as well as the Caribbean), it has been introduced broadly across Southern Asia and East Africa, and occurs in two isolated areas within Australia. It was introduced to Hawaii in the 1940s; by 1978 it had spread to over of land on Oahu. In 1972 Koster's curse was first spotted on the Big Island. In Sri Lanka it is quite invasive in wet zone and upcountry forests, especially invading gaps in the forest, preventing other native species from emerging.Lalith Gunasekera, Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka, Colombo 2009, p. 95‚Äì96. This species grows successfully in humid tropical climates and typically invades both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. It is a potential weed of wetter pastures, open grasslands, plantations, roadsides, wetter open woodlands, riparian zones (banks of watercourses), forest margins and rainforests.BioNET-eafrinet, keys and fact sheets. Clidemia Hirsta (Koster‚Äôs Curse). Web. https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/eafrinet/weeds/key/weeds/Media/Html/Clidemia_hirta_(Kosters_Curse).htm. Biology and ecology The plant grows tall, depending on habitat. The purple-brown to blue-black berries are up to long and taste a bit like a deeply flavored blueberry. Each fruit contains more than 700 tiny (0.5 mm) seeds. It flowers and fruits all year, if conditions are moist enough. A large plant can produce more than 1,000 fruits in a single year for a total of 700,000 seeds. The seeds are dispersed by birds, feral pigs, other animals, and humans. Sheep will not eat the plant, and the tannin inside the fruits is poisonous to goats. Biosecurity trials in Australia show that the seeds can remain viable in the soil for at least 12 years. The human edibility factor of this berry has not been fully explored. The tannin inside of the fruit is not harmful to humans and a delicious syrup may be made from the fruit. The syrup has a beautiful indigo blue color and may be used to enhance and remove the bitterness of teas such as yerba mate. Furthermore, the plant is used in Brazil to treat Leishmania braziliensis skin infections (Franca et al., 1996).CABI. ‚ÄúKoster‚Äôs Curse.‚Äù Datasheet. Name The epitheton hirta means \\"bristly\\" in Latin. \\"Koster's curse\\" is a commonly used name in places where the plant grows as a noxious weed, such as Hawaii. Koster was the man who between 1880 and 1886 accidentally introduced seeds of C. hirta to Fiji in coffee nursery stock, where its problematic nature was first noticed around 1920 (Paine, 1934; Simmonds, 1937). Originally only known as \\"the curse\\" for the damage it did to coconut plantations, its vernacular name became a model after which those of other invasive plants were patterned, such as Ellington's curse on Fiji, McConnel's curse in Australia, or Curse of India in East Africa. As an invasive species This species is native to much of tropical America, but is an invasive species in Southern Asia, East Africa, and some oceanic islands (like Hawaii and Australia) with warmer climates.BioNET- eafrinet, keys and fact sheets. Clidemia Hirsta (Koster‚Äôs Curse). Web. Koster's curse can form dense thickets that smother plantations, pastures and native vegetation. Disturbance is a key element in the establishment and invasion of Koster‚Äôs curse. Wildfires, landslides, windstorms and other forms of soil disturbance (such as pig rooting) accelerate the dominance of this weed (Smith Undated; Peters 2001). In its native environment plants are confined to open areas and only become dominant about twelve months after disturbance, such as in slash-and-burn agricultural areas (Burkhart Pers. Comm, in Smith Undated). All new range extensions in Hawaii begin along the open edges of trails or other disturbed areas.Global Invasive Species Database. Clidemia hirta (shrub). Web. 2006. In Hawaii, Koster‚Äôs curse is replacing the endemic species that formerly dominated the forests and threatens their extinction. Elsewhere, it is regarded as one of the most problematic invasive species in the Comoros Archipelago, on La R√©union, in the Seychelles and on Mauritius.BioNET-eafrinet, keys and fact sheets. Clidemia Hirsta (Koster‚Äôs Curse). Web. Control strategies/biological control In order to keep the weed out of an area the primary management objective should be to minimize and prevent disturbance (Smith Undated).Global Invasive Species Database. Clidemia hirta (shrub). Web. 2006.. Manually pulling plants out of the ground supplemented by herbicide application is an effective but temporary control method. The thrips species Liothrips urichi from Trinidad is being used to biologically control C. hirta; it was first employed on Fiji in 1930 (Simmonds, 1933). Controlling feral pig populations (Sus scrofa) has been widely suggested as an effective means to reduce the spread of C. hirta, as ground disturbance by these exotic mammals is strongly linked to the successful establishment of C. hirta, as well as a number of other invasive plants such as Morella faya. Although sheep have been shown to control most weeds in plantations, they will not eat C. hirta (Francis, 2004).CABI. ‚ÄúKoster‚Äôs Curse.‚Äù Datasheet. https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/13934..

The initial versions were introduced in 1914 at 160 hp, but a series of changes improved this to 170 hp in 1917, and 180 by mid-1918. These later models were used on almost all late-war German fighters, and its only real competition, the BMW III, was available only in very limited numbers. Compared to the Allied engines it faced, the D.III was generally outdated. Design and development The D.III was based on the same pattern as the earlier Mercedes D.II, suitably scaled up for higher power settings. Like most inlines of the era, it used a large aluminum crankcase as the main structural component, with separate cylinders made from steel bolted onto it. The technology for screwing a threaded cylinder of steel into an aluminum crankcase did not exist at that time. Jackets for cooling water covered the top 2/3 of the cylinder, feeding a radiator via connections at the back of the engine. The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders. The D.III featured a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single intake and exhaust valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft at the rear of the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The ignition cables were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank. Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking. Production variants Original 160 hp Mercedes D.III, with \\"side- slot\\" rocker-arm design SOHC valvetrain atop the cylinders. The original D.III was introduced in 1914. While it saw widespread use in early examples of the C-series of two-seat general-purpose biplanes, the D.III was too large for contemporary fighter designs and did not see use in that role. At the time, fighters were generally powered by lighter rotary engines of power output levels from 80 to about 110 hp, or by water-cooled inline engines in the 100 to 120 hp range such as the earlier Mercedes D.II. By 1916 new designs had grown in size and performance and the D.III became popular on new designs. By 1917 the D.III was being widely used in fighters, most notably on the famous Albatros D.I. Production of this version was essentially wound down by May 1917, with only a handful continuing to be delivered until October. British HP ratings being slightly different (with 746 watts = 1 hp) to the German PS or Pferdest√§rke standard of roughly 735 watts per PS horsepower, it is probable that this engine would have had a slightly higher rating under British HP numbers. Fuel consumption was 11.75 gallons per hour. Its compression ratio was 4.5:1. Development of the basic design led to the slightly modified 170 hp D.IIIa, which took over on the production lines in June 1917. The main change was to change the piston profile to have a flat head instead of the former concave one, thereby slightly increasing maximum compression to 4.64:1. Other changes were mainly in design details, notably a redesigned crankcase and new carburetor. Many of the accessories were also redesigned or moved around on the engine. This model was produced only briefly, for use on the Albatros D.III but there are indications that possibly some early Albatros (Alb.) made Fokker D.VII's were also equipped but probably had the engines upgraded or replaced as quickly as possible. This engine has been referred to in postwar British analysis as generating 180 hp. A more \\"radical\\" upgrade was the 180/200 hp D.IIIa√º, introduced in late 1917, the D.IIIa√º was a standardized refinement of the D.III and D.IIIa design and the √º designation was never official. This engine changed the pistons again, this time to a domed profile that further increased the maximum compression - the √º was for \\"√ºber\\", meaning \\"overcompressed\\". Additionally, a new altitude-compensating carburetor was added, which improved performance at higher altitudes. To support operations at these altitudes, water from the radiator was used to heat the air intake and prevent icing in the carburetor. The a√º model, which included upgraded D.III and D.IIIa engine blocks, was the most prolific German fighter engine of 1918 and designed into most fighter designs from late 1917 on. This included most of the entries in the First Fighter Competition at Adlershof in January 1918, notably the famed Fokker D.VII. In British post war evaluation the D.IIIa√º demonstrated 200 hp according to the British standards. A final version attempting to keep the D.III block competitive was the 200 hp (200-217 hp) D.IIIav (or av√º), introduced mid-October 1918. The av used slightly longer pistons made of aluminum (possibly a first for a production engine), increasing the compression yet again, while at the same time allowing them to move faster due to the reduced weight. The maximum allowable RPM increased from 1,400 in the earlier models to 1,600 in the av, accounting for most of the gains in power. It is unclear if any av's saw service use. The increased use of Benzol in German aviation fuel may have helped this final upgrade of power, its higher octane rating being better suited for the higher compression ratio. =External differences between models= Aft-end details of the original SOHC valvetrain for the German Mercedes D.III - note the rocker arm emerging from the \\"rocker box\\" through a slot in the box's side. Details of the later pattern SOHC Mercedes D.III valvetrain, using the relocated rocker box design, with rotary shafts to operate the fully exposed roller rocker arms. Closeup of a Liberty L-12's valvetrain details, almost matching the later D.IIIa design. All of the D.III series were generally very similar to other models, with the exception of the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIa√º. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIa√º standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier \\"side- slot\\" rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, rocker boxes, rocker arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier \\"side-slot\\" cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical \\"slotless\\" rocker- box overhead cam valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine. Confusingly, the \\"√º\\" was not an official part of the name. This leads to a number of problems in various references, which often confuse the IIIa with the IIIa√º, listing the former as a 180 hp engine. There are two D.IV engines ‚Äî from the IdFlieg aircraft powerplant class designations based on power output ‚Äî one the straight-eight based on the 140mm bore D.III pistons; and the later, six-cylinder Mercedes D.IVa with 160mm bore cylinders, which was essentially unrelated. The D.III line of engines would find themselves eclipsed in performance by the BMW IIIa of 185 and then 200 hp (British rated it at 230HP) in 1918, however, the small number of BMW's produced ensured that the Mercedes D.III series would be the primary German fighter engine up to the last month or two of the war and it would still be seen in very large numbers even at the end. At the end of the war the D.IIIa√º would still be the numerically predominant German fighter engine. As a result, the Fokker D.VII's (those not equipped with BMW IIIa's) and the Pfalz D.XII's would be engine-limited in performance (as opposed to \\"airframe-limited\\") and yet would still be formidable adversaries to their Allied counterparts. The D.IIIa√º was considered the optimum engine for the Roland D.VI, Pfalz D.IIIa, and Albatros D.Va fighters, whose airframes were of an earlier, \\"all-wood\\" generation in design.

Because of his successes in Spain and Liguria, he celebrated two triumphs.Oxford Classical Dictionary, \\"Fulvius Flaccus (2), Quintus\\" Although his political career was a success, he was plagued by controversy and suffered a mental breakdown that culminated in suicide. According to his recorded filation \\"Q. f. M. n.\\", Fulvius was the son of Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, four times consul beginning in 237 BC, and grandson of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, consul of 264 BC.E. Badian, \\"The Consuls, 179-49 BC\\", Chiron, 20 (1990), p. 374  Early career  As curule aedile in 184 BC, Fulvius Flaccus created a furor by actively campaigning for the praetorship vacated by C. Decimius Flaccus, who died early in his term. The holding of two magistracies in a single year was prohibited, and Fulvius further violated decorum by campaigning sine toga candida (\\"without a white toga\\"); as a magistrate, he was required to wear the toga praetexta and not the pure white garment of a candidate.Livy 39.39.1‚Äì15, but Livy says Fulvius Flaccus was only aedile designate; see Broughton, MRR1, p. 377, note 1, for a summary of the constitutional intricacies, based on Theodor Mommsen's arguments. The senate was so opposed to Fulvius' holding another curule office that it refused to hold elections. As praetor in Hispania Ulterior in 182, he waged war successfully against the Celtiberians, capturing Urbicua.Livy 40.16.7‚Äì10. His imperium was extended for two years as propraetor. In 180, he requested but was denied permission to bring his army home. He won another victory against the Celtiberi and earned a triumph.Livy 40.18.6, 40.30.1‚Äì33.9, 40.35.3‚Äì36.13, 40.40.15, 42.34.9, 43.4‚Äì7; Diodorus Siculus 29.28; Frontinus, Stratagems 2.5.8 (where Cimbrico is taken as an error for Celtiberico; Appian, Iberian Wars 42; Orosius 4.20.31.  Consul and censor  Fulvius was consul in 179; his colleague was L. Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus, his brother by birth. They were assigned the province of Liguria.Livy 40.44.3. During this period, many Ligures were being forcibly moved from their land and relocated to central Italy; Fulvius effected the resettlement of Ligurians from the mountains. He also helped block immigrants from Transalpine Gaul from settling in northern Italy.Livy 40.53.1‚Äì6; Florus 1.19.5. For these activities he was awarded a triumph.Livy 40.59.1‚Äì3. He fulfilled a vow for his victories in Spain by building a temple and holding games.Livy 40.44.8‚Äì12 and 45.6. His building of the temple was to prove fateful. Fulvius was censor in 174 BC with A. Postumius Albinus Luscus. They expelled nine members from the senate, including Fulvius's own brother,Livy 41.27.2; Valerius Maximus 2.7.5; Velleius Paterculus 1.10.6; Frontinus, Stratagems 4.1.32. and downgraded the rank of several knights. They named M. Aemilius Lepidus princeps senatus.Livy 41.27.1. The censors also carried out an extensive building program in Rome. Fulvius undertook additional projects in Pisaurum, Fundi, Potentia, and Sinuessa.Livy 41.27.1‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì13. The Augustan historian Livy says that when Fulvius built his temple to Fortuna Equestris (\\"Equestrian Luck\\"), he stripped the marble tiles for it from a temple of Juno Lacinia.Valerius Maximus (1.1.20) places this temple in Locri, Bruttium, but elsewhere correctly identifies its location as Croton, also in modern-day Calabria; see also Livy 42.3.1‚Äì11. The Temple of Fortuna Equestris was dedicated in 173.Livy 42.10.5.  A 'vile death'  In 180, Fulvius had been admitted to the College of Pontiffs, a lifetime appointment. Livy notes his priesthood in reporting the vile manner of his death (foeda morte). In 172 BC, Fulvius had two sons serving in Illyricum; he received word that one had died and the other was suffering from a life-threatening illness. The next morning, the household slaves found him hanging by a noose in his bedroom. Although Romans regarded suicide as honorable in some circumstances, Fulvius's was seen as evidence of his mental instability: Livy says that \\"grief and fear overwhelmed his mind\\" (obruit animum luctus metusque); rumor had it that the wrath of Juno Lacinia had driven him mad.Livy 42.28.10‚Äì12. Discussed at length by Hans-Friedrich Mueller, Roman religion in Valerius Maximus (Routledge, 2002), p. 35ff. online. The senate, according to Valerius Maximus, then had the marble tiles returned to the original temple to undo the deed of an impius (\\"consciously irreligious\\") man.Livy provides a practical detail: that the tiles were then left stacked within the temple precinct because there was no workman to restore them. The Via Fulvia is attributed to him, but doubtfully. This Q. Fulvius Flaccus should not be identified with the man of the same name who was suffect consul in 180 BC.

The spatial features in Oracle Spatial and Graph aid users in managing geographic and location-data in a native type within an Oracle database, potentially supporting a wide range of applications ‚Äî from automated mapping, facilities management, and geographic information systems (AM/FM/GIS), to wireless location services and location-enabled e-business. The graph features in Oracle Spatial and Graph include Oracle Network Data Model (NDM) graphs used in traditional network applications in major transportation, telcos, utilities and energy organizations and RDF semantic graphs used in social networks and social interactions and in linking disparate data sets to address requirements from the research, health sciences, finance, media and intelligence communities. Components The geospatial feature of Oracle Spatial and Graph provides a SQL schema and functions that facilitate the storage, retrieval, update, and query of collections of spatial features in an Oracle database. (The spatial component of a spatial feature consists of the geometric representation of its shape in some coordinate space ‚Äî referred to as its \\"geometry\\".) =Geospatial data features= The Oracle Spatial geospatial data features consist of: * a schema - MDSYS (as in \\"multi-dimensional system\\" ) - that prescribes the storage, syntax, and semantics of supported geometric data types * a spatial indexing system * operators, functions, and procedures for performing area-of-interest queries, spatial join queries, and other spatial analysis operations * functions and procedures for utility and tuning operations * vector performance acceleration for substantially faster querying and more efficient use of CPU, memory, and partitioning * support for parametric curves (NURBS) for mathematically precise representation of free-form curves that can be reproduced exactly for 2D and 3D data * a topology data model for working with data about nodes, edges, and faces in a topology * a GeoRaster feature to store, index, query, analyze, and deliver GeoRaster data (raster image and gridded data and its associated metadata) with virtual mosaics, raster-algebra operations, image processing, Java API, and GDAL-Based ETL Wizard * 3-dimensional data-types and operators including Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs), Point Clouds and LiDAR data sets with Spatial R-tree indexing, SQL operators and analysis functions, and metadata for visualization * geocoding that converts location and address data into formal geographic coordinates from point addresses and address ranges, and supports reverse geocoding * a routing engine that creates fastest or shortest routes with driving distances, times, directions and turn-specific geometries based on commercial and publicly available street network data, and restrictions and conditions for advanced routing, such as truck-specific routing * Open Geospatial Consortium-compliant Web Services for geocoding, routing, mapping, business-directory, catalog, and geospatial feature transactions *Spatial Visualization components to render data on maps. =Network Data Model= The Network Data Model feature is a property graph model used to model and analyze physical and logical networks used in industries such as transportation, logistics, and utilities. Its features include: * Persistent management of the network connectivity in the database * A data model for representing capabilities or objects (modeled as nodes and links) in a network with a PL/SQL API for managing network data. * User-determined link and node properties, such as costs and restrictions, including temporal properties. * Association of real world objects with network elements to simplify application development and maintenance. * A Java API for in-memory network path analytics, including shortest path, nearest neighbors, within cost, and reachability, with partitioned loading of large networks into memory. =RDF semantic= The RDF Semantic Graph feature supports the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) RDF standards. It provides RDF data management, querying and inferencing that are commonly used in a variety of applications ranging from semantic data integration to social network analysis and linked open data applications. Its features include: * An RDF triple store and ontology management with automatic partitioning and data compression. * Proven scalability to over 54 billion triples (LUBM 200K benchmark) with scalability to the 8 petabyte limit of Oracle Database. * High performance bulk loading with Oracle Database parallel and direct path loading and loading through Jena. * SPARQL and SQL parallel querying and updating of RDF graphs with SPARQL 1.1, SPARQL endpoint web services, SPARQL/Update, Java APIs with open source Apache Jena & Sesame, SQL queries with embedded SPARQL graph patterns, SQL insert/update. * Ontology-assisted querying of table data using SQL operators to expand SQL relational queries with related terms for more comprehensive results. * Native inferencing with parallel, incremental and secure operation for scalable reasoning with RDFS, Web Ontology Language (OWL 2 RL/EL), Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), user-defined rules, user-defined inference extensions, and an extensibility framework to plug-in special purpose reasoners, such as PelletDB, TrOWL. * GeoSPARQL support for storing / querying spatial data in RDF per Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC) specification. * RDF views on relational data to apply semantic analysis with support for automatic (Direct Mapping) and custom (W3C R2RML language) mapping of relational data to RDF triples. * Triple-level security that meets the most stringent security requirements with Oracle Label Security. * Integration with open source Apache Jena and Sesame application development environments. * Integration with XML-based tools, such as Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) for reporting and dashboards. * Integration with Network Data Model graph analytics for shortest path, nearest neighbors, within cost, and reachability. * Integration with Oracle Advanced Analytics features: Oracle Data Mining for exploiting predictive analytics and pattern discovery and Oracle R Enterprise for statistical computing and charting visualization of graph data. * Semantic indexing for text mining and entity analytics integrated with popular natural language processors. * Integration with leading commercial and open source tools for querying, visualization, and ontology management. Availability Oracle Spatial and Graph is an option for Oracle Enterprise Edition, and must be licensed separately. Free since December 5, 2019. It is also included in Oracle Database Cloud Service (High Performance Edition and Extreme Performance Edition). It is not included in Oracle Standard Edition or Oracle Standard Edition One. However, the latter two editions allow the use of a subset of spatial features (called Oracle Locator ) at no extra cost. An appendix of the Oracle Spatial and Graph Developer's Guide specifies the functions allowed in Locator. History The Oracle RDBMS first incorporated spatial-data capability with a modification to Oracle 4 made by scientists working with the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS). A joint development team of CHS and Oracle personnel subsequently redesigned the Oracle kernel, resulting in the \\"Spatial Data Option\\" or \\"SDO\\" for Oracle 7. (The SDO_ prefix continues in use within Oracle Spatial implementations.) The spatial indexing system for SDO involved an adaptation of Riemannian hypercube data-structures, invoking a helical spiral through 3-dimensional space, which allows n-size of features. This also permitted a highly efficient compression of the resulting data, suitable for the petabyte-size data repositories that CHS and other major corporate users required, and also improving search and retrieval times. The \\"helical hyperspatial code\\", or HHCode, as developed by CHS and implemented by Oracle Spatial, comprises a form of space-filling curve. With Oracle 8, Oracle Corporation marketing dubbed the spatial extension simply \\"Oracle Spatial\\". The primary spatial indexing system no longer uses the HHCode, but a standard r-tree index. Since July, 2012, the option has been named Oracle Spatial and Graph to highlight the graph database capabilities in the product - Network Data Model graph introduced with Oracle Database 10g Release 1 and RDF Semantic Graph introduced with Oracle Database 10g Release 2.

As is the case with traditional kroncong music, langgam jawa utilizes a variety of non-native instruments, such as the flute, guitar, ukulele, cello and violin. However, these instruments are performed using a seven-tone Javanese gamelan scale known as pelog. The cello typically plays the role of a gamelan ciblon drum, with the performer slowly plucking or slapping the strings in a percussive fashion. Langgam jawa's roots can be traced back to kroncong ensambles going back to the 1920s, but emerged as a style of its own in the 1950s. Among the leading exponents of the style is Andjar Any. He and his ensemble, Orkes Kroncong Bintang Nusantara, are said to have composed over 2000 songs in the langgam jawa style.

The title was altered to The Conqueror Worms when the paperback edition was released by Leisure Books, but the content (aside from minor spelling/grammatical alterations) was the same. Plot summary Teddy Garnett, an older man and war veteran, tells this story of a global flood that has left humanity in tatters. Holed up in his mountain home in West Virginia, Teddy and his buddy, Carl Seaton, struggle through daily life, puzzling over things even stranger than a 40-day rainstorm, including the giant slime-coated holes that keep showing up in Teddy's yard and the giant worm-like creature that ate a robin outside of Teddy's window. Meanwhile, Teddy is reeling over the loss of his wife Rose and the mysterious fate of his children and grandchildren. Before long, Teddy and Carl are fending off man-eating earthworms the size of buses. A helicopter crash nearby brings Kevin and Sarah, the last two survivors of an outpost in Baltimore, into Teddy's story; their tale makes up the bizarre second part of the book that explores the insanity doom can inspire. Kevin serves as the narrator for this tale and he tells about how he and a group of survivors faced off against all kinds of terror in Baltimore, including Satanists who make sacrifices to a mysterious beast known as Leviathan.

A breeches buoy is a rope-based rescue device used to extract people from wrecked vessels, or to transfer people from one place to another in situations of danger. The device resembles a round emergency personal flotation device with a leg harness attached. It is similar to a zip line. The breeches buoy was usually deployed from either ship to ship, or ship to shore using a rocket, kite system,Life-Saving Apparatus, Albert F. Rockwell, US434725 or a lyle gun, and allowed evacuations of one person at a time. A line is attached to the ship, and the person being rescued is pulled to shore in the breeches buoy which rides the line similar to a zip line. A child riding a breeches buoy Competition In Sea Scouts, use of a breeches buoy has become one of the events that are competed in at regattas such as the Old Salts' Regatta and the Ancient Mariner Sea Scout Regatta. The competition simulates an actual breeches buoy rescue situation. Before the event the crew sets up their equipment, which includes a thin shot line attached to the tower simulating the crow's nest of a sinking ship, a high line made of a hawser, a block and tackle, a deadman with a cleat, an endless whip with a block, a chair, and shear legs. Once the equipment is prepared, two scouts go up to the tower (these scouts must wear harnesses for safety in most of today's competitions). The coxswain calls the four or five scouts remaining on the ground to attention. No further talking is allowed by anyone except for the coxswain and the two participants in the tower. No communication other than yes and no arm signaling is allowed between the tower and ground. At the go signal, time begins and does not stop until the participant who is being rescued from the tower is on the ground and the coxswain calls the crew to attention again. One member of the ground crew ties the whip block tail to the shot line. The coxswain signals the tower, and the tower returns the affirmative signal. The tower then hauls the whip up to them on the shot line, and ties the whip block tail to the mast with a round turn and two half hitches.Personal experience of being a coastguard for thirty two years The tower signals to the coxswain who returns the signal. The ground crew attaches the high line through the chair to the endless whip and raises the high line to the tower. Once the high line reaches the tower, it is attached to the mast with a round turn and two half hitches and a signal is passed to the coxswain. The ground crew ties a bowline on a bight into the high line and hooks it to the blocks. The crew hauls on the blocks tightening the high line and secures it to the deadman with a cleat hitch. The shear legs are put in place. The chair is attached to the endless whip and raised to the tower. When everything on the ground is set, the coxswain signals the tower. One member of the tower crew gets in the chair and sits down, clips in, and signals the ground crew. The rider must be stopped in a controlled manner and removed from the chair. Time stops when the ground crew is called to attention by the coxswain. Judges are responsible for halting progress if they deem a situation unsafe, and for correcting the situation as well as assessing penalties for violations such as talking and crossing the water line.

It pronounces the historicity of humanity and its binding to tradition. Historist historiography rejects historical teleology and bases its explanations of historical phenomena on sympathy and understanding (see Hermeneutics) for the events, acting persons, and historical periods.

Historism is not to be confused with historicism,Historicism in the sense given to it by Karl Popper, namely the search for historical laws. nevertheless the English habits of using both words are very similar. (The term historism is sometimes reserved to identify the specific current called Historismus in the tradition of German philosophy and historiography.) Criticism Because of the power held on the social sciences by logical positivism, historism or historicism is deemed unpopular.Morera, Esteve (1990), Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation, Routledge, p. 11. Karl Popper, one of the most distinguished critics of historicism, criticized historism, too. He differentiated between both phenomena as follows: The term historicism is used in his influential books The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and Its Enemies to describe ‚Äúan approach to the social sciences which assumes that historical prediction is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history‚Äù.Karl Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, Routledge, 1993, p. 3 (italics in original). Popper wrote with reference to Hegel's theory of history, which he criticized extensively. By historism on the contrary, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits. Historism does not aim for the 'laws' of history, but premises the individuality of each historical situation. On the basis of Popper's definitions, the historian Stefan Berger proposes as a proper word usage: Notable exponents Notable exponents of historism were primarily the German 19th-century historians Leopold von RankeBeiser 2011, p. 366. and Johann Gustav Droysen,Colin Cheyne, John Worrall (eds.), Rationality and Reality: Conversations with Alan Musgrave, Springer 2006, p. 266. 20th-century historian Friedrich Meinecke,Beiser 2014, p. 133. and the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey.Koslowski 2006, p. 4. Dilthey was influenced by Ranke. The jurists Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Karl Friedrich Eichhorn were strongly influenced by the ideas of historism and founded the German Historical School of Law.

Ankersmit, Sublime Historical Experience, Stanford University Press, 2005, p. 404). were important European exponents of historism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Collingwood was influenced by Dilthey.Wallace and Gach 2008, p. 27.David Naugle, \\"R. G. Collingwood and the Hermeneutic Tradition\\", 1993. Ranke's arguments can be viewed as an antidote to the lawlike and quantitative approaches common in sociology and most other social sciences.Wallace and Gach 2008, p. 14. The principle of historism has a universal methodological significance in Marxism. The essence of this principle, in brief, is Georg G. Iggers is one of the most important critical authors on historism. His book The German Conception of History: The National Tradition of Historical Thought from Herder to the Present, first published in 1968 (by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, Ct.) is a \\"classic‚ÄùBerger 2001, p. 24. among critiques of historism. Another critique is presented by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose essay Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie f√ºr das Leben (On the Use and Abuse of History for Life, 1874; see The Untimely Meditations) denounces ‚Äúa malignant historical fever‚Äù. Nietzsche contends that the historians of his times, the historists, damaged the powers of human life by relegating it to the past instead of opening it to the future. For this reason, he calls for a return, beyond historism, to humanism.Friedrich Nietzsche: On the Use and Abuse of History for Life, first published 1874, translated 1909. Contemporaries 20th-century German historians promoting some aspects of historism are Ulrich Muhlack, Thomas Nipperdey and J√∂rn R√ºsen. Also the Spanish philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset was influenced by historism. See also *Heinrich Rickert *Historical school of economics Notes References * Georg G.

He was also the first editor of The Anglo-Welsh Review, a lecturer, critic, and non-violent campaigner for the use of the Welsh language.Raymond Garlick News and Events at the University of Wales, Bangor Early life and studies Raymond Garlick was born on 21 September 1926 at Harlesden in London, the elder son of an employee of the National Bank; but as a child he spent holidays at his grandparents' house in Deganwy in Conwy County Borough in Wales. When he was five years old a severe illness and operation left him with a permanently disabled foot. Just before World War II he was evacuated to Gwynedd, and was educated in Llandudno at the John Bright County School, where his interest in English language and literature was encouraged. He left school at the age of fifteen. Before he went on to study English literature at Bangor University he became interested in Christian theology, considered joining the Franciscan order, and studied for the Anglican presbyterate at the Community of the Resurrection near Leeds. At Bangor University he was taught by R. T. Jenkins, H. D. Lewis and Charles Davies, and became an admirer of the craftsmanship of the poets Dylan Thomas and Roy Campbell. He met the painter, Brenda Chamberlain, and when she separated from the artist John Petts and went to live on Bardsey island, he rented from her part of her cottage, Ty'r Mynydd. Career in literature Between 1948 and 1960 Garlick worked as a teacher at Bangor, Pembroke Dock and Blaenau Ffestiniog. In 1948 he married Elin Hughes, a first-language Welsh speaker and convert to Roman Catholic Christianity. He became a Catholic on the eve of his wedding, and learnt Welsh from his wife. He and Elin adopted two children ‚Äì Iestyn in 1952 and Angharad in 1958. The couple would remain together until the late 1970s. After teaching at Bangor he moved to Pembroke Dock in April 1949, to take up a post teaching English at Pembroke Dock County School, under Roland Mathias. That year, at the age of twenty-three, he became a co-founder of the review, Dock Leaves (from 1958 renamed The Anglo-Welsh Review) and from 1949 to 1960 was its first editor. As editor he made contacts with many writers of Welsh and English; and during this time he also began broadcasting for the BBC. These years saw the appearance of his first books of poems ‚Äì Poems from the Mountain House (1950), The Welsh-Speaking Sea (1954) and Requiem for a Poet (1954). In 1954 he moved to teach at Blaenau Ffestiniog, as he and Elin decided that they would like their adopted son to be brought up bilingual in English and Welsh. At Blaenau John Cowper Powys was one of his neighbours. In 1957 he published his poems, Blaenau Observed. In 1960 he left Wales, gave up his editorship of the Anglo- Welsh Review and began to teach at an international school at Eerde in the Netherlands. But in 1967 he returned to Wales, and eventually he became a Principal Lecturer, in charge of the Welsh Studies course, at Trinity College, Carmarthen (now part of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). There with enthusiasm he introduced his students to the works of such writers as David Jones, Idris Davies, Glyn Jones, Alun Lewis, Dylan Thomas, R. S. Thomas, John Ormond and Leslie Norris. His own poetry was influenced by the writings of Roy Campbell, and of R. S. Thomas and John Cowper Powys. During these years he published his A Sense of Europe (1968), A Sense of Time (1972) and Incense (1976), as well as his study, An Introduction to Anglo-Welsh Literature (1970) and the anthology, Anglo-Welsh Poetry 1480‚Äì1980 (1984) (which he edited with Roland Mathias). He also established a link with the Central University of Iowa, USA, for their module on Anglo-Welsh literature. He continued lecturing at Trinity until he retired in 1987, when his Collected Poems 1946‚Äì86 appeared. He continued to live at Carmarthen, until at the end of his life he moved to a care home in Cardiff. In the 1970s he and his family took part in non-violent campaigning for the use of Welsh-language road signs in Wales, and at one point his wife and son were arrested. Garlick was a lifelong pacifist. In the late 70s his wife chose to go and live in the Netherlands, and in 1982 he and she divorced. He lost his faith in Christianity (calling himself a 'Catholic Agnostic'), and he omitted his Christian poems from his Collected Poems of 1987. In his retirement Garlick brought out two more books of poems, Travel Notes (1992) and The Delphic voyage and other poems (2003). In 1995, during Swansea's Year of Literature, a portrait of Garlick was made by the painter, Gordon Stuart. He died on 19 March 2011 at Cardiff. An extensive archive of his manuscripts is held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. The poet Peter Finch, former chief executive of Academi (Literature Wales is the national company for the development of literature in Wales), described Raymond Garlick as one of the five best mid-20th century English writers in Wales ‚Äì along with R. S. Thomas, Leslie Norris, John Tripp and Harri Webb.

The plot of the film revolves around the exploration of a plateau in Venezuela inhabited by cannibals, dinosaurs, carnivorous plants, and giant spiders. The cast includes Claude Rains, David Hedison, Fernando Lamas, Jill St. John, and Michael Rennie. Plot Professor Challenger (Claude Rains), a celebrated biologist and anthropologist, reports to the London Zoological Society that he has discovered living specimens of supposedly extinct animals, including dinosaurs, on an expedition to the Amazon Basin and up a barely known plateau. Much to Challenger's dismay, he has attracted a few very unscientific people to join him on his second journey to the Amazon. This expedition group includes big game hunter Lord John Roxton (Michael Rennie), newsman Ed Malone (David Hedison) whose publisher advances $100,000 to pay for the expedition. The publisher's adventurous daughter, Jennifer (Jill St. John) and son David join the group at the head of the Amazon. Also, in the group is a Zoological Society bigwig (Richard Haydn), helicopter pilot Gomez (Fernando Lamas) and sidekick Jose Costa (Jay Novello). First night on the plateau, a dinosaur wrecks the helicopter. As the expedition proceeds, Malone chases a primitive jungle girl (Vitina Marcus) through cobwebs to a giant spider. Roxton argues with the others, and jealousies over Jennifer leads to a fistfight between Malone and Roxton. They discover a diary of a previous explorer, Burton, who was lost on the plateau. Roxton is mentioned several times in the diary. Roxton reveals that he had visited the plateau years before, and claims the plateau holds a bounty of diamonds. At one point, Malone and Jennifer are separated from the others and have a near death encounter with two battling dinosaurs. Cannibals kidnap the members of the party but before they can become dinner the jungle girl leads them to a passage that leads down the plateau. Along the way, they encounter Burton, now living as a blind hermit. More obstacles: the cannibals are chasing them, spider plants, the \\"graveyard of the damned,\\" and a dinosaur in a lava pit guarding the diamonds. During a volcanic eruption, they escape from the plateau carrying the egg of a Tyrannosaurus rex. The egg hatches when it is dropped by accident, and Professor Challenger decides to take the infant dinosaur back to London with them.

He wanted to make the film with Trevor Howard and Peter Ustinov in support of Rains, as well as Victor Mature and Gilbert Roland (who had been in the 1925 film). He hired Charles Bennett to help him adapt the book into a script and commissioned Willis O'Brien, who worked on the 1925 . film, to do the models. He said he wanted to start filming on 15 October 1959. Allen eventually received financing to make the film from Buddy Adler, head of production at 20th Century Fox. Special effects for the film were rather basic and involved monitor lizards, iguanas, and crocodiles affixed with miniature horns and fins. Director Allen later stated that though he wanted stop motion models, he could only work with lizards and live creatures in accordance with the studio's budget. Legacy Irwin Allen utilized stock footage from this film for episodes of his various TV series, including Land of the Giants, Lost in Space, The Time Tunnel, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. In 1966, Irwin Allen even tried to sell a TV series based on the film, as he had done with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, but was unsuccessful.James Van Hise, Hot Blooded Dinosaur Movies, Pioneer Books Inc. 1993 Pg.157 Stock footage was also used in the movie When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970).

Overview Pimento cheese has been referred to as the \\"p√¢t√© of the south\\", \\"Carolina caviar\\" and \\"the caviar of the South.\\" The basic recipe has few ingredients: sharp cheddar cheese or processed cheese (such as Velveeta or American cheese), mayonnaise or salad dressing, and pimentos, blended to either a smooth or chunky paste. Regional ingredients include horseradish, cream cheese, salt and pepper, Louisiana-style hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, paprika, jalape√±os, onions, garlic, and dill pickles. Pimento cheese can be served as a spread on crackers or celery, scooped onto corn chips or tortilla chips, mixed in with mashed yolks for deviled eggs, added to grits, or slathered over hamburgers or hotdogs. A pimento cheese sandwich can be a quick and inexpensive lunch, or it can be served as a cocktail finger food (with crusts trimmed, garnished with watercress, and cut into triangles) or rolled up and cut into pinwheels. It is also a common snack in the Philippines, where it is referred to as cheese pimiento. Pimento cheese sandwiches are a popular item at the Masters Tournament. Minor controversy ensued in 2013 when the Augusta National Golf Club switched food suppliers for the Masters and the new supplier was unable to duplicate the recipe used by the previous supplier, resulting in a sandwich with a markedly different taste.

System =Design= The RBS 56B BILL 2 was designed upon the original BILL 1 Anti-tank guided weapon that has been in the service of the Swedish Army since 1988. The BILL 2 is currently produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics, who are located in Karlskoga, Sweden. The BILL 2 comes with one 10.5 kg missile, a launching tube, tripod with x7 magnification day sight, and one thermal imaging sight. =Operation= The RBS 56B BILL 2 uses OTA or Overfly Top Attack to attack its target. The missile flies towards the target on a standard horizontal trajectory, but rather than directly hitting the target head on, it overflies it, detonating its warhead on top of an armored vehicle, where the armour is usually lighter. It also utilizes additional guidance accuracy via the installed rate gyro, which monitors the tracking movement of the launcher. It is designed primarily to attack armoured or unarmoured vehicles, but can also be used to attack helicopters or soft ground targets, such as light buildings. The BILL 2 can be mounted onto a variety of vehicles and then fired remotely from inside the vehicle. =Firing Modes= The BILL 2 has three firing modes that the launcher's operator can select, before launching the missile. * Basic - In this mode the missile will use both of its sensors to hit the armoured vehicle from the top. * Non-Armored - In this mode the missile uses no sensors and flies on a LOS or line-of-sight, while using the impact fuse. * Soft Target - In this mode the optical sensor is used, but the magnetic sensor is not. The missile then uses OTA to attack its target. Missile The BILL 2 Missile uses a SACLOS or semi-automatic command to line-of-sight guidance system, and is controlled via a communications wire that trails behind the missile from the launch tube. The BILL 2 warhead has an optical and magnetic sensor. The optical sensor serves to find the target's range, while the magnetic sensor detects metallic targets to determine the best point for the missile to detonate. The BILL 2 contains both a proximity fuse and an inertial impact fuse. The BILL 2 is armed with a pair of vertically striking Explosively formed penetrator warheads, which each direct a self-forging slug of metal downwards at extreme velocities using a high explosive blast. The 40mm frontal \\"precursor\\" warhead destroys any reactive armour protecting the target and leaves the 110mm rear warhead to penetrate the armour. Total penetration capabilities are classified, but are known to be at least 550mm in rolled homogeneous armor.

The car came with a straight-eight engine; it also featured disc wheels, with an extra pair mounted at the side as spares. The body was a hardtop, calibrated so that the driver could turn it into either a sedan or a touring car simply by rearranging the windows. Production models were to sell for $1800, but only the prototype was completed. The Colonial is chiefly remembered today because it was the first American car to feature four-wheel hydraulic brakes. The Mechanical Development Corporation announced in 1924 that the 1921 prototype would be put into production in a new $2.5 million factory which could build 12,000 cars a year, but these plans never eventualized.

Robert Nixon was a legendary prophet of Cheshire. Many accounts about him appear to be in conflict with each other. At least one account has Robert Nixon being born in c. 1467. In this account, he is the son of John Nixon during the time of Edward IV, who leased a farm in the parish of Over from Vale Royal Abbey. Another account of Nixon states that he was born during the reign of James I (1603‚Äì25) and that he was for some time in the service of Thomas Cholmondeley, master of Vale Royal after 1625. There are also two claimed homes for Robert Nixon: one says he was an illiterate boy who was born in Bark House on a hill between Over and Whitegate. Alternatively, another source claims Robert Nixon lived at Bridge House near the Forest of Delamere. He is the claimed source of various prophecies circulating in the early 18th Century and published in leaflet form. Some of his prophecies relate to Vale Royal Abbey. Prophecies * to an abbot of Vale Royal Abbey \\"When you the harrow come on high, Soon a raven's nest will be\\" :* The last Abbot was named John Hareware :* Sir Thomas Holcroft acquired the buildings of Vale Royal Abbey and some of the estates :* The crest of Sir Thomas was a raven * \\"Between a rick and two trees, a famous battle shall be\\" :* The Battle of St Albans, 1461 took place between Elstree, Edwinstree and Rickmansworth. However, this was probably before Robert Nixon was born and therefore could hardly be a prophecy. * \\"The weary eagle shall to an island in the sun retire, where leaves and herbs grow fresh and green. There shall he meet a lady fair\\" :* Napoleon was sent to St. Helena in 1815 :* The island has plentiful rare flora :* Helen of Troy was indeed a \\"lady fair\\" * \\"All sorts will have chimneys in their mouths\\" :* Cigarettes * foretold the result of the Battle of Bosworth Field. * \\"When an eagle shall sit on top of the house, then an heir shall be born to the Cholmondeley family\\" * \\"When a raven shall build in a stone lion's mouth, On a church top beside the grey forest: Then shall a King of England be drove from his crown\\". Summoned to the court of King Richard III, he refused, saying he would be \\"clemmed death\\", that is, starved to death. The King ordered him to be kept in the kitchen, but because he was always picking at food he was locked in the cupboard. The cook was called away and he starved to death. According to ‚Äò Witchcraft,the history and mythology‚Äò ‚Äú(king) Henry ordered that he be given all the food he wanted whenever he wanted. This was annoying to the kitchen staff, so whenever Henry left London he charged one of those officers with Robert‚Äôs safety. One day this officer was suddenly called away himself, so he locked Robert in the Kings own room for safekeeping. Unfortunately he forgot to tell anyone what he had done and when Robert was finally discovered, it was found that, as he predicted, he had starved to death.‚Äù A man for all seasons? Many of the prophecies relate to the family living at Vale Royal Abbey mansion at the time of the 1714 and 1745 Jacobite rebellions. It seems the prophecies of Robert Nixon were invented or modified to suit the political situation at the time.

(Eds) (2010). Achieving student success: Effective student services in Canadian higher education. Montreal, PQ: McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press.Patton, L. D., Renn, K. A., Guido, F. M., & Quaye, S. J. (2016). Student development in college: Theory, research, and practice (3rd ed.). John Wiley & Sons. Student development theory has been defined as a ‚Äúcollection of theories related to college students that explain how they grow and develop holistically, with increased complexity, while enrolled in a postsecondary educational environment‚Äù.(Patton et al., 2016, p. 6) Early ideas about student development were informed by the larger disciplines of psychology and sociology. Some student development theories are informed by educational psychology that theorizes how students gain knowledge in post-secondary educational environments. There are many theorists that make up early student development theories, such as Arthur Chickering's 7 vectors of identity development, William Perry's theory of intellectual development, Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, David A. Kolb's theory of experiential learning, and Nevitt Sanford's theory of challenge and support. Student developmental theories are typically understood within theoretical categories of psychosocial, cognitive-structural, person-environment, typology, maturity, social identity, integrative theories, and critical theory frameworks.Abes, E.S., Jones, S.R., & Stewart, D.L. (2019), Rethinking college student development theory using critical frameworks. Sterling, Virginia: Stylus Publishing.Jones, S.R. & Stewart, D.L. (2016). Evolution of student development theory. New Directions for Student Services, 154, 17-28. DOI: 10.1002/ss.20172 Student development theories can be understood as evolving across 3 generational waves. First wave developmental theories, often cited as foundational, tended to view student development as universal for all students. First wave theories primarily focus on students‚Äô psychosocial and cognitive-structural development, as well as examining the impact of the campus environment. Second wave theories advanced the developmental focus of the first wave to examine more closely the diversity of student populations and students experiences of social identities across gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity. Second wave theories brought attention to the socially constructed nature of social identities as well as to the historical exclusion of diverse groups of students from student development theories. Second wave theories may include, Marcia Baxter Magolda's theory of self-authorship, Carol Gilligan's theory of women's moral development, in addition to other social identity and multidimensional identity theories. Third wave theories re- examine student development theory through critical theory and post-structural perspectives. Critical frameworks are used to analyze structures of power, privilege, and oppression in order to call attention to systemic inequality, transformative practices, and social justice. Critical theoretical perspectives that have been used to re-examine student development theory have included, intersectionality, critical race theory, black feminist thought, feminist theory, queer theory, postcolonialism, and poststructuralism. Critical perspectives in the third wave also contribute to the ongoing growth and expansion of the body of student development theories themselves. Student development theories may be used by post-secondary educators and student affairs professionals to better understand and address student needs as well as to guide student affairs practices and policies that impact student development.  History  The earliest manifestation of student development theory‚Äîor tradition‚Äîin Europe was in loco parentis.Student Development Theory, University of Texas, Dallas, last accessed on 30 June 2006 Loosely translated, this concept refers to the manner in which children's schools acted on behalf of and in partnership with parents for the moral and ethical development and improvement of students' character development. Ostensibly this instruction emphasized traditional Christian values through strict rules, enforced by rigid discipline. As such, the primary objective of in loco parentis was on the conditioning of social and individual behavior, rather than intellectual cultivation. The second distinct shift toward a unified student development theory emerged in the late nineteenth century, through the first quarter of the twentieth century, marked by the growth of colleges and universities throughout Europe and the United States, simultaneous with the development of social science disciplines like psychology. By mid-twentieth century, behavioral psychologists such as B.F. Skinner and Carl Rogers influenced educational theory and policy, and a new paradigm emerged known as the Student Services paradigm. As the name indicates, the \\"student services\\" perspective said that students ought to be provided with the services that benefit knowledge acquisition. By the mid-twentieth century, the service paradigm started to be replaced with the student development paradigm. This paradigm was influenced by the growing body of psychological and sociological theories, reflecting the idea that students learn both in-class and out-of-class, and are influenced both by their genetics and social environment (see nature and nurture). Basic assumptions guiding the student development movement: # Each student is a different individual with unique needs. # The entire environment of the student should be taken into account and used for education. # Student has a personal responsibility for getting educated.  Student Development Theories  = Categories = Student development theories generally can be divided into five categories: # Psychosocial. Psychosocial theories focus on long-term issues that tend to occur in sequence and are correlated with chronological age, concentrating on individuals progress through various 'life stages' by accomplishing certain deeds. # Cognitive-structural. Cognitive- structural theories address how students perceive and rationalize their experiences. # Person‚Äìenvironment. Person‚Äìenvironment theories address interaction between conceptualizations of the college student and the college environment, looking at behavior as a social function of the person and the environment. Those theories are particularly common in career planning. # Humanistic existential. Humanistic existential theories concentrate on certain philosophical concepts about human nature: freedom, responsibility, self- actualization and that education and personal growth are encouraged by self- disclosure, self-acceptance and self-awareness. These theories are used extensively in counseling. # Student development process models. Student development process models can be divided into abstract and practical. There are dozens of theories falling into these five families. Among the most known are: * Arthur W. Chickering's theory of identity development * William Perry's cognitive theory of student development = Schlossberg's transition theory = Schlossberg's transition theory has been worked on over time and has changed some of it original context. This theory is mostly based on the individual and what they consider to be a transition in their life.Evans, Nancy J., Deanna S. Forney, and Florence DiBrito. Student development in college: theory, research, and practice. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1998. Print. This theory is used as a guideline from what steps should be taken during the transition to help the young adult to continue to work on and transition into what they need. We use different questionnaires to determine and assess the ability of a certain person to cope with the transition. Here is a quick review of the steps and ideas behind Schlossberg's theory: ;Transitions * Events or nonevents resulting in changed relationships, routines, assumptions, or even roles * Meaning for the individual based on  Type: anticipated, unanticipated, nonevent  Context: relationship to transition and the setting  Impact: alterations in daily life ;The transition process * Reactions over time * Moving in, moving through, and moving out ;Coping with transitions * Influenced by ration or assets and liabilities in regard to four sets of factors:  Situation: trigger, timing, control, role change, duration, previous experience, concurrent stress, assessment  Self: personal and demographic characteristics, psychological resources  Support: types, functions, measurement  Strategies: categories, coping modes = Kohlberg's theory of moral development = Using ideas of Piaget and cognitive development Kohlberg looks into the judgments of people and what they consider justifiable to determine about their ideas of Morality come into play. Using only these ideas, not culture, we see how people develop their own moral code and how it changes or stays the same over time. ;Stages of Kohlberg's moral development theory * Level I: Preconventional  Stage One: Heteronomous morality: Obeying rules so not to be punished (focus more on self than the other)  Stage Two: Individualistic, instrumental morality: Focusing on only following the rules that benefit themselves. * Level II: Conventional  Stage Three: Interpersonally normative morality: The person begins to start living up to the expectations of the important people around them. (i.e.: friends, parents, teachers)  Stage Four: Social system morality: We begin to realize that everyone has morals and we live in the society's morals established by the people in it. * Level III: Postconventional or Principled  Stage Five: Human rights and social welfare morality: Being able to depend on everyone around to carry out the social justices and entering groups to maintain these ideas that the individual holds as well.  Stage Six: Morality of universalizable, reversible, and prescriptive general ethical principles: Coming up with generalized morals that can apply to everyone and everything that the individual does. = Kolb's theory of experiential learning = Looking at how individuals learn is a huge part in the development of self according to Kolb and his model. By knowing what the individual needs to do to learn makes it easier for the individual to grow as a person. Using the different personality types and ways to learn, we become more self-aware and willing to learn from new ways. ;Kolb's cycle of learning * Concrete Experience (CE): Full and unbiased involvement in learning experience * Reflective Observation (RO): Contemplation of one's experiences from various perspectives * Abstract Conceptualization (AC): Idea formulation and integration * Active Experiment (AE): Incorporation of new ideas into action ;Kolb's learning style model * Accommodator (CE + RO):  Is action oriented and at ease with people, prefers trial-and-error problem solving  Is good at carrying out plans, is open to new experiences, adapts easily to change * Diverger (RO + AC):  Is people- and feeling-oriented  Has imagination and is aware of meaning and values, is good at generating and analyzing alternatives * Converger (AC + AE):  Prefers technical tasks over social or interpersonal settings  Excels at problem solving, decision making, and practical applications * Assimilator (AC + RO):  Emphasizes ideas rather than people  Is good at inductive reasoning, creating theoretical models, and integrating observations = Sanford's theory of challenge and support = Sanford's theory of challenge and support states that for optimal student developmental growth in a college environment, challenges they experience must be met with supports that can sufficiently tolerate the stress of the challenge itself. Nevitt Sanford, a psychologist, was a scholar who theorized about the process college students would encounter throughout their college development.Strange, C. (1994). Student development: The evolution and status of an essential idea. Journal of College Student Development, 35, 399-412 He addressed the relationship between the student and their college environment. Sanford proposed three developmental conditions: readiness, challenge, and support. # Readiness refers to internal processes associated with maturation or beneficial environmental factors. This condition of readiness can aid a student's developmental growth if he or she is physically or psychologically ready. If not, it could limit their developmental growth. #Challenge refers to situations in which an individual does not have the skills, knowledge, or attitude to cope. #Support refers to buffers in the environment that help the individual to successfully meet challenges. Sanford speculated that if students are met with too much challenge, they could regress in their developmental growth and give up on the challenge at hand. For example, in a review by the University of California, Los Angeles, Chaves discussed the juggling of multiple challenges that adult student learners encounter such as integration into an institution, commuting to campus, social integration, and absence from school for a number of years that cause adult student learners to regress in their time to graduation or not graduate at all.Chaves, C. (2006). Involvement, development, and retention: Theoretical foundations and potential extensions for adult community college students. Community College Review, 34(2), 139-152. If students are met with excessive support, they may not understand what they need and their development would be limited. For example, in a qualitative study grounded in constructivist theory methodology, Marx concluded that college campuses provided too much support, limiting students' forward movement in their ability to internally define their own beliefs, identity, and relationships during college.Marx, E. (2012). Advising to promote self- authorship: exploring advising strategies and advisor characteristics among new student affairs professionals (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of San Diego, California. In both studies, the research indicated that students were unable to reach optimal developmental growth without the appropriate amount of challenge or support. It is likely that most students will face an academic, social, or personal challenge during their postsecondary college or university journey. Research shows that challenges are different for traditional age students and adult student learners, various marginalized and majority identity groups,Alvarez, A. N. (2002).

Adding value: Learning communities and student engagement. Research In Higher Education, 45(2), 115-138. and numerous other characteristics. Research indicates that support for students can be in the form of mentoring and involvement from faculty, staff, family, and peers,Ong, A. D., Phinney, J. S., & Dennis, J. (2006). Competence under challenge: Exploring the protective influence of parental support and ethnic identity in Latino college students. Journal of Adolescence, 29(6), 961-979 ability to be involved in meaningful college activity, believing they matter, and designing their own curriculum or programs, among other support options. When challenges are met with appropriate support, students' developmental growth in a college environment is optimal. For example, a longitudinal study conducted by Ong, Phinney, and Dennis examined 123 Latinx college students attending an ethnically diverse urban university in southern California. These Latinx students faced challenges of being low socioeconomic status (SES), psychological stress, feelings of alienation, and low rates of college retention.Castillo, L. G., & Hill, R. D. (2004). Predictors of distress in Chicana college students. Journal of Multicultural Counseling & Development, 32(4), 234-248. However, these students were met with consistent parental support, family interdependence, and an affirmation of their membership in their ethnic group. The support correlated positively to an increased grade point average and greater academic achievement, resilience, and positive adaptation. Disability Identity Development In College Students The importance of accommodation for students with disabilities as grown substantially since the turn of the millennium. Disability was once viewed as resulting from a moral lapse, such as poor actions of parents, resulting in having a child with disabilities. Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. More recently institutions are beginning to view disability as a limitation of the social and physical environments and not a limitation of the individual. For example, stairs are a limitation for individuals who have mobility issues, but ramps are accessible to individuals with and without a mobility limitation. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result of a change in adopted model of disability. Stage Models of Disability Identity Gibson (2006) identified a three staged model to describe the trajectories of disabled students and how they come to understand themselves inclusive of their disability. Stage 1: Passive Awareness (childhood) ¬∑ Individual's medical needs are met however they avoid attention and avoids associating with other disabled individuals. Stage 2: Realization (Adolescence/ Early Adulthood) ¬∑ Begins to view themselves as having a disability and may experience self-hate, and become more socially aware of how their disability impacts the perceptions that others have of them. Stage 3: Acceptance (Adulthood) ¬∑ Begins to understand their differences in a positive way and integrate themselves into the able-bodied world. Will also incorporate other individuals with disabilities into their lives. These stages can be fluid, meaning movement from one stage to another does not mean it is a permanent move. For students in stage three an event such as moving to on campus residence and have to share a bedroom or bathroom may move them back to stage 2. Building off of this model proposed by Gibson (2006), Forber-Pratt and Aragon (2013) proposed a four staged model: Stage 1: Acceptance ¬∑ Student undergoes a process of accepting their disability which includes denial, anger, bargaining, depression and eventually acceptance. This includes acceptance of the disability from friends, family, and educators. Stage 2: Relationship Phase ¬∑ Begins to interact with students with disabilities and learn the norms and activities of the group. Creating connection to others with disabilities is the key component of this stage. Stage 3: Adoption ¬∑ Begins to internalize the core values of the disability culture. Being independent by navigating the world and managing personal hygiene and participating in social justice whether this be self advocacy or collective activism. Stage 4: Giving Back to Community Phase ¬∑ Become leaders in disability culture and demonstrate role modelling behaviour for other students with disabilities. = Combining theories = Student development theories, such as Sanford's theory of challenge and support, are not meant to be used alone in practice. It is important to acknowledge that multiple theories, such as Astin's involvement theory, Chickering's theory of identity development, Kohlberg's theory of moral development, Rendon's theory of validation, Schlossberg's theory of mattering and marginality, Schlossberg's transition theory, among others, can be cross pollinated in an individual student's situation. Often the intersection of many student development theories is what is most effective in working with postsecondary college or university student environments.

It is inhabited by the Serer and the Fulani. Geography and landscape The Ferlo Desert occupies an area of some 70,000 km2, over one-third of the country's total area. It forms part of the region of Djourbel which extends to within 45 miles (70 km) to the east of Dakar to the west and south of St Louis, known as \\"Baol\\" to the locals. The Senegal River flows through the region, and valleys occur in the Sine Saloum Delta north of The Gambia. There are endless plains and sand dunes, with scattered rocks and small valleys with clay soils in which small water bodies form. The plain is crossed by the courses of numerous tributaries of the Senegal River, which for most of the year are dry and fill with water only occasionally during the rainy season (July to September). The climate is very dry, characterised by a long dry season (which lasts for nine months a year), with winds from the very dry Sahara Desert. The wet season, in the period from July to September, is short and brings irregular rainfall brought by the humid air masses from the Gulf of Guinea. Due to the arid climate the region is sparsely populated; the area was also plagued by drought in the early 1970s and again in 1983-1984. Lingu√®re, with nearly 13,000 inhabitants, is the largest town in this region. Desertification has also contributed to a regional population decline. The semi-desert zone of the Ferlo is known for its baobab trees. Leguminous plants such as Zornia glochidiata and Alysicarpus ovalifolius and Graminaceae such as Cenchrus biflorus, Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Chloris prieurii, Eragrotis tremula, Aristida mutabilis and Schonefeldia gracilis have been observed. The national reserves Ferlo Nord Wildlife Reserve (R√©serve de faune du Ferlo Nord) (RFFN) and Ferlo Sud Wildlife Reserve (R√©serve de faune du Ferlo Sud) (RFFS) lie within the Ferlo desert region. Ferlo Nord Wildlife Reserve, established in 1971, covers an area of . Ferlo Sud Wildlife Reserve was established the following year, and is a little larger at . Economy This region of Senegal is destitute, and living conditions are difficult. The population are mainly engaged in ranching. The main crops cultivated are millet, cowpeas, peanuts, watermelons and squash and Acacia gum. The natural grasslands of the desert have undergone change. Until the mid-1950s the region \\"was visited by people and livestock only during the rainy season and at the very beginning of the dry season (July to November).\\" In 1953, J. G. Adam noted that the \\"groundnut cultivation has transformed the natural vegetation on sandy soils, to note, even at a distance from the water points, a climax, subclimax vegetation which has not been disrupted by cultivation, and hardly changed by grazing, since this has occurred only, until recent years, during the four summer months, where the vegetation is dense and close to standing water.\\" From the mid-1950s, boreholes were drilled and began to provide water to areas of the desert, which enabled pastureland to be used by the farmers all year round. By 1955, fifty wells were reported along the main trek routes to be providing water. Under better conditions, the population of livestock in the desert increased; by the 1990s, it supported livestock herding, cited as \\"a continuous extension of the desert steppe into the savanna\\" but one which was \\"not rich enough to attract herders from the north of the [Senegal] river.\\" Between 1969 and 1972, the \\"Study of Natural Pastureland in Northern Senegal\\" was conducted, assessing the borehole development in the desert and found that the boreholes were still on average 25‚Äì30 km apart, which meant that exploitation of land was generally restricted to a 5 km radius of them. Spate irrigation has since developed in the region, and temporary ponds may cover an area of several hectares during the wet season from July to October.

Early life Stratton Brooks was born in 1869 in Everett, Missouri. At the age of two, he and his parents moved to Michigan where his father, Charles Brooks, was a Sheriff in Isabella Co. Michigan (1878‚Äì82) Stratton Brooks graduated from Mt. Pleasant High School, Mt. Pleasant, Michigan class of 1887 Brooks was educated at the University of Michigan and held a master's degree from Harvard University. Prior to being appointed president of the University of Oklahoma, he served as the first superintendent of LaSalle-Peru Township High School (1898-1899), located in LaSalle, Illinois. Additionally, Dr. Brooks served as superintendent of Boston public schools. He also spent three months in 1906 as the superintendent of the Cleveland, Ohio public school system.Ptacek, Ted W. A Comprehensive Study of the Growth and Development of the Cleveland, Ohio, Public School System.p. 123. Kansas State Teachers College. Emporia, Kansas. May 1934.] Accessed November 17, 2018. University of Oklahoma When Brooks was first being courted for the position of OU president in 1911, he at first did not want the position. It was seen as a fledgling university and many on the East Coast were \\"still in shock\\" at the summary discharge of former president David Ross Boyd. He wasn't approached again until 1912 while at a national superintendent's meetings in St. Louis, Missouri. He was approached by William A. Brandenberg who was a member of the new Oklahoma State Board of Education. Again, Brooks refused the job but Brandenberg continued to pursue telling him that the Board desired to keep politics out of the selection process. Brooks still refused but gave advice on how to keep politics out of the process by saying that only the university president could appoint faculty and that the Board should have nothing to do with the administration of the university. Eventually, the Board agreed to these guidelines and was able to convince Brooks to accept the position. Brooks later said that, \\"Whatever was accomplished during my eleven years as president of the University, was possible only because the Board of Education that appointed me, and its successors, never violated the basic principles set forth in that first conference.\\" President Brook's inauguration in 1912 in front of Evans Hall. Brooks was inaugurated as president of the university in the spring of 1912. He immediately set to rebuilding the university. He found that many of Oklahoma's own citizens (over 1,500) were sending their children to out of state colleges. He immediately went about strengthening the faculty but he did not fire one individual brought in because of political connections if he was a good teacher. At the university, Brooks established a permanent faculty salary, sabbatical leave, and permanent tenure. He also acquired land around the university where the stadium and armory now stand. Brooks had a great reputation with the Board of Education (now the Board of Regents) and the Oklahoma legislature. During his years as president, many building were constructed around campus. =Accomplishments during WWI= Brooks' was also OU's first wartime president, have served during the duration of World War I. He made many efforts to see that the university was at the forefront of preparedness for all war needs. He imposed strict food regulations on the university and he established thirteen courses in seven different departments for the direct purpose of \\"training soldiers, training men who expect to become soldiers, and training people who take the place of soldiers in civil life.\\" Some of these courses included: wire telegraphy, wireless telegraphy, stenography and shorthand, oxyacetylene welding, orthopedic surgery, military field engineering, and first aid courses. Students under 21 were required to take special courses in the Student Army Training Corps. Barracks, an infirmary, bathhouse, guardhouse, and canteen were constructed. By the latter part of 1918, the university was practically a military base. All in all, 30 faculty members, 500 alumni, and 1,875 students were in military service during the war. =End of the line at OU= Brooks' situation changed dramatically after John C. (\\"Jack\\") Walton was elected Governor of Oklahoma in 1922. Gone was the close working relationship he had with previous governors. Walton felt that Brooks was not enthusiastic about promoting the new governor's political agenda. Some of Walton's political advisors felt that the university was a hotbed of anti-Walton supporters. Edwin DeBarr, the OU vice president, had openly supported Walton's rival in the primary. After both Brooks and the Board of Regents had written letters to the members of OU's faculty, cautioning them against taking part in the upcoming election campaign, DeBarr continued to take an active political role, making fiery speeches supporting Walton's rival for the governorship, Robert H. Wilson, the state superintendent of education.[Levy, David W. The University of Oklahoma: A History, Vol. II, 1917-1950. p. 66. 2015. . University of Oklahoma Press. Norman, Oklahoma. Accessed September 4, 2018. Walton, the Democratic nominee easily defeated Wilson, the Republican, in the general election of November, 1922, and was inaugurated in January, 1923. In May 1923, he abruptly dismissed four of the five existing regents from the board and replaced them with reliable supporters of himself and his agenda. The board quickly proceeded to terminate DeBarr's employment. Walton then retaliated against Brooks, whose son-in-law was then president of the Oklahoma School of Mines in Miami, Oklahoma. Although Brooks openly hoped the young man could remain undisturbed in that position, Walton abruptly replaced him with a supportive legislator from Ottawa County. Then, Brooks voted against Walton's nomination of another supporter to become superintendent of vocational agriculture. Walton became furious with Brooks, and again replaced the occupants of the state board. That day, the Daily Oklahoman printed the story with the headline, \\"Brooks' Neck Expected to Feel the Ax Next.\\" Walton explained his action to the press, \\"...the educational system must be removed as far as possible from political maneuvering,...(T)he university organization has been used against me by Yankee republicans and I believe that it should be in democratic hands.\\" University of Missouri The University of Missouri (UM) previously had indicated to Brooks that it would like to have him take the job as president. He had previously rejected the interest, because he had become interested in continuing in Norman. Besides, his wife loved the place, and even told him once that that was the place where she hoped to be buried after death. Regarding Walton's replacement of the regents, Brooks realized that he had no future in Oklahoma without top-level political support. He called UM and asked if the presidency was still open. The answer was, \\"Yes.\\" He travelled to Missouri to meet with the school officials. The next day, he received a formal job offer with an annual salary of $12,500. He gave them his verbal acceptance. When he got home he wrote a one-sentence letter of resignation to one of the regents, which was immediately accepted. The Brooks family bade goodbye to Oklahoma. Within six months, the Oklahoma legislature had enough of Walton's arbitrary behavior and roughshod power plays. They passed articles of impeachment and removed him from the Governor's office. The budgetary problems Brooks faced at UM were much the same as those he left in Oklahoma. At least the school had not developed into quite as big a mess as OU had when he arrived in Norman. Still, a bizarre incident in 1931 derailed his career. Some sociology professors allowed release of a \\"sex survey\\" that most of the regents and ordinary citizens found offensive to their social views. Brooks saw the document, which he called \\"sewer psychology\\" and wanted to fire the faculty members who had authorized sending it out without his prior approval. The American Association of University Professors joined in the uproar. The regents then blamed Brooks for misleading them and creating a national scandal. Unable to defend himself, he resigned, and moved to Kansas City, so that UM could find a new leader. Later life and subsequent death Looking for something very different to do, he accepted the job as president of the Order of DeMolay, a Masonic institution for young men. When his wife died in 1941, Stratton Brooks brought her body back to Norman for burial. He remained in Norman until his own death on January 18, 1949, after which, he was interred beside her.

The term recognizes a distinction between the real photo process and the lithographic or offset printing processes employed in the manufacture of most postcard images. History In 1903 Kodak introduced the No. 3A Folding Pocket Kodak. The camera, designed for postcard-size film, allowed the general public to take photographs and have them printed on postcard backs, usually in the same dimensions (3-1/2\\" x 5-1/2\\") as standard vintage postcards. Many other cameras were used, some of which used glass photographic plates that produced images that had to be cropped in order to fit the postcard format. In 1907, Kodak introduced a service called \\"real photo postcards,\\" which enabled customers to make a postcard from any picture they took. While Kodak was the major promoter of photo postcard production, the company used the term \\"real photo\\" less frequently than photographers and others in the marketplace from 1903 to ca. 1930. Old House Journal states that \\"beginning in 1902 Kodak offered a preprinted card back that allowed postcards to be made directly from negatives.\\" This technology allowed photographers to travel from town to town and document life in the places they visited. Old House Journal continues: \\"Local entrepreneurs hired them to record area events and the homes of prominent citizens. These postcards documented important buildings and sites, as well as parades, fires, and floods. Realtors used them to sell new housing by writing descriptions and prices on the back. Real photo postcards became expressions of pride in home and community, and were also sold as souvenirs in local drug stores and stationery shops.\\" On March 1, 1907, Federal legislation permitted senders, for the first time, to include a message on a portion of the back of a postcard. (Prior to that time, the address only was allowed on one side while the other side could present a photo or artwork.) The front side could then accommodate a full-size real photograph. The popularity of real photo postcards soared nationwide, and many people began collecting the cards in albums. No other single format has provided such a massive photo history of America, particularly of small-town and rural America where photography was often a luxury. Many real photo postcards were unique prints captured by amateur photographers, but others were mass-produced by companies such as the Eastern Illustrating and Publishing Company in Belfast, Maine. Real photo postcards were sometimes created and sold as mementoes at the scene of lynchings; they were also used to document such important events as the Mexican Revolution. Real photo postcards may or may not have a white border, or a divided back, or other features of postcards, depending on the paper the photographer used.

It comprises a sprawling series of dry-stone ramps, pedestals and platforms covering of a bluestone quarry. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Overview View of the monolith Fite, then a professor of sculpture and theater at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, purchased the disused quarry site in 1938, expecting to use it as a source of raw stone for his representational sculpture. Instead, inspired by a season of work restoring Mayan ruins in Honduras, he began creating a space to display the large carved statues he was beginning to create out of native bluestone. Using the rubble that had been left behind as the area was quarried. he built terraces, ramps and walkways to lead to the individual works, doing all the work by hand, and using the traditional hand tools that had been used by the local quarrymen before him. As the rampwork expanded, Fite realized that the 1.5-ton (1.36 tonne) statue, Flame, which had occupied the central pedestal, had become too small for the scale to which his work had grown, and he replaced it with a 9-ton bluestone pillar which he had found in a nearby streambed. This happened in 1964, more than 20 years after he had begun work on his quarry. Fite had originally planned to carve the new stone in place (Flame had been carved in Fite's studio), but once the stone was up, he realized that what he had originally conceived as a setting for sculpture had become a sculpture in its own right, and a new kind of sculpture, in which carved representational work was out of place. So he removed the other carved pieces, relocating them on the grounds nearby, and continued to work on this new sculptural concept for the rest of his life. In the early 1970s, after he had retired from 30 years as a professor at Bard College, Fite built the Quarryman's Museum on the grounds‚Äîa collection of folk tools and artifacts of the quarrying era. It was around this same time that he finally succumbed to the pressure to give his masterwork a name. At first a joke  ‚ÄúClassical composers don‚Äôt have to name things,‚Äù he would say, ‚Äúthey can just number them, Opus One, Opus Two, and so on‚Äù‚Äîhe eventually arrived at what was certainly an apropos name. Opus is the Latin word for work, and 40 refers to the number of years he expected he would need to complete the work. Fite died in 1976, in the 37th year of his creation. He died working on it, in a fall. He left some unfinished areas‚Äîbut, as his stepson, the writer Jonathan Richards, has observed, ‚ÄúOpus 40 is as complete as it ever would have been. It was the product of Fite‚Äôs ceaseless vision, and could only have been stopped by his death.‚Äù The following year, his widow, Barbara Fite, who had been a close aesthetic collaborator with him throughout his labors, created a nonprofit group to administer Opus 40, and opened it to the public. Barbara Fite died in 1986, and her family continues to administer the organization. Opus 40 remains a popular tourist attraction, as well as a wedding and concert venue. In 2001 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Occupancy The port station is located on the Gulf of Morbihan. The station has about 45 inhabitants in winter; the population can rise to more than 120 in summer. The location was selected in 1949 by the chief of mission Pierre Sicaud because of its sheltered position which was suitable for a runway that was never built. From 1955 to 1957, and using Australian equipment, a French slaughterhouse company called Sidap constructed a sealing factory. The factory opened following the first marriage on the islands, that of Marc Pechenart and Martine Raulin on 16 December 1957. The factory closed in 1960, and the equipment was sent to R√©union in 2005. Port-aux-Fran√ßais has a shallow seaport and a quay for unloading supply ships, including the Marion Dufresne. The station, in addition to logistics necessary to its operation, consists of scientific laboratories (biology, geophysics), technical installations (meteorology, telecommunications, satellite tracking, et cetera), a cinema and a small medical centre. Tidal gauges The base of Port-aux-Fran√ßais is equipped with a recently installed marigraphic station, having 3 measuring devices: * two tide gauges to measure pressure at sea bottom * a radar measuring the sea level. The two marigraphs and the radar send data to a local server, which relays them hourly to the Internet via the Argos satellite system.

His works, including the opera The Devil in Love, were played and recorded internationally. Biography Vustin studied composition first with Grigory Frid at a regional music college, and later with Vladimir Fer√® at the Moscow Conservatory, graduating in 1969. Between 1969 and 1974, Vustin worked as a music editor at USSR Radio. From 1974 he worked as an editor at the Kompozitor publishing house. Music Vustin composed from 1963, but regarded only works written since 1972 as valid. His musical language is distinctive by the remarkable organization of its musical texture. Vustin uses the twelve-tone technique, but in his own original way. His first notable compositions were written in the midst of the 70s: the eight-minute-long The Word (scored for ensemble of woodwinds, brass and percussion (1975)) was dedicated to Grigori Frid; and the three-minute long In Memory of Boris Klyuzner, for baritone and string quartet (1977) was set to the autobiographical text by Yuri Olesha. Another piece, Blessed are the Poor in Spirit for boy-soprano (or counter-tenor) accompanied by a chamber ensemble was composed in 1988 to the text from Matthew 5:3‚Äì8. His opera The Devil in Love, to the Russian libretto by Vladimir Khachaturov after the novel The Devil in Love by Jacques Cazotte, the result of 15 years of labour (1975‚Äì1989), is probably one of the most important of his works. Its musical material nourished the dozens of compositions written in around the same period. The world premiere of the opera took place at the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre on 15 February 2019, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski. The works of Alexander Vustin are often included in the programmes of major festivals, such as the \\"Kremerata Musica\\", Tage f√ºr Neue Musik (Z√ºrich), Holland Festival, the 14th Musik Biennale Berlin, Pres√®nce 93 (Paris), Melos-Ethos (Bratislava), Maraton Soudobe Hudby (Prague), Donaueschinger Musiktage and Deutsche Kammerphilarmonie (Germany), Kammermusikfest Lockenhaus (Austria), Moscow Forum, and Moscow Autumn (Russia). Among performers of his music are the conductors Vladimir Jurowski, Reinbert de Leeuw, Lev Markiz, Eri Klas, Igor Dronov, Alexander Lazarev, Vitaly Kataev, Gidon Kremer, Martyn Brabbins, and Cristoph Hagel. Ensembles include Kremerata Baltica, Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, Sch√∂nberg Ensemble, Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (Netherlands), the Mark Pekasky Percussion Ensemble, Studio New Music, Ensemble of Soloists of the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

He was born in Sprouston, Roxburghshire, the son of Andrew Mitchell Thomson, the minister of Sprouston Church. Portrait of John Thomson by William Smellie Watson Life Among the compositions that his younger contemporary Felix Mendelssohn admired when they met in Edinburgh in the summer of 1829 was a G minor piano trio of 1826, in which stormy and sometimes fierce passages are mixed with Schubertian warmth. Another favourite of Mendelssohn's was his lively rondo of 1828. They became friends and Fanny Mendelssohn is cited as saying that she liked Thomson \\"best of all the Britons I know\\". Thomson's C major trio is described as a fine work. He studied in Germany with a letter of introduction to the Mendelssohn family, and his Drei Lieder were published in Leipzig in 1838. John Purser contends that we have to look to Schumann to find anything comparable to these songs published two years before Schumann composed any songs in his mature style. The first song, Keiner von den Sch√∂nheit T√∂chtern, is based on the poem There be none of beauty's daughters by Byron, set in German by Thomson to match the other songs. Thomson became the first Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh in 1838. As a musicologist he edited the Vocal Melodies of Scotland, and he was one of the first conductors to provide his audience with a programme of his concerts giving a critical analysis of the works to be performed. His other compositions included a fine bagatelle for solo piano, a six-part Glee With Whispering Winds, three operas, a flute concerto and a flute quartet, and concert arias. However his career was cut short by his death in 1841. Subsequently, his work was little performed, but there has been a recent revival of interest with his work being featured in John Purser's Scotland's Music series, and a group of people in Kelso organised a bicentennial festival in 2005. Scores of some of John Thomson's compositions, including the G minor piano trio and flute quartet have been made freely available on Sibelius Music's website. More will follow in due course. Some scores are also being added to the International Music Score Library Project . A recording of the overture to Hermann, or the broken spear his third opera, can be found here In 2014, a steering committee of academics from The University of Edinburgh was formed to oversee transcription of the autograph of Hermann, or the broken spear into publishable form using the Sibelius (software) scorewriter and Derek WilliamsDerek Williams was appointed to the task with the intention of mounting a full performance of the piece.

Situated on a hill just east of I-35 that overlooks downtown Austin, just north of the Swedish Hill Historic District and south of Disch-Falk Field, the once-isolated site is now in the center of the city. History The cemetery dates from the mid-1850s. It may have begun even earlier, as legend states that its first tenants were victims of a Comanche attack whose bodies were laid to rest on the same hill. The cemetery was renamed Oakwood in 1907 per city ordinance. It spreads over , including an annex across Comal Street to the east, and includes sections historically dedicated to the city's black, Latino, and Jewish populations. Paupers were historically buried in unmarked graves on the cemetery's south side. Graves without permanent markers were subject to reburial after a given period. In 1914 the Oakwood Cemetery Mortuary Chapel was built on a design by Texas architect Charles Henry Page as a site for memorial services. The chapel was later renovated and remodeled in 1944 under the direction of local architect J. Roy White. The cemetery became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1972 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; its annex was added on October 30, 2003. The view of the Texas State Capitol from Comal Street in the center of the cemetery became one of the Capitol View Corridors protected under state and local law from obstruction by tall buildings in 1983. Despite its protected status, the cemetery has been subject to crime, vandalism, and decay for decades.

The character made his first appearance on June 1, 2004, and was introduced as a homeless teenager who is taken in by the Winters family, the core African- American family within the series. Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) sympathizes with Devon because she too was a product of the foster care system. Drucilla and her husband Neil (Kristoff St. John) raise Devon along with their daughter Lily (Christel Khalil) and legally adopt him in 2006. Unlike most young male characters whose stories typically centered around romance and teen angst, the character of Devon became a vehicle for social and human interest stories, focusing on the challenges of having a drug addict for a parent, being a product of the foster care system, and deafness. While Devon has a consistent love interest, the romance was rarely displayed and severely undeveloped. In 2009, the character was involved in a controversial storyline in which he had an affair with Tyra Hamilton (Eva Marcille), a woman he'd come to know as his aunt, though it was later revealed that they are not related. The foster care, meningitis and deaf story arcs received critical acclaim for their social impact and earned James five Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series and James won the award in 2007. James also earned seven NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series and he won the award in 2009. In 2011, the character would be written into more traditional soap opera plots starting with the revelation that he is the long lost grandson of the wealthy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). However, the plot twist would only bring him closer to his adoptive father, Neil. In 2013, Devon inherits the bulk of Katherine's billion dollar estate which turns his life upside. In 2014, Devon enters into an affair with Neil's young wife Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan). Devon's forbidden love affair with Hilary would mark the character's first major love story and would also solidify the character as a viable romantic lead. Due to the chemistry between the characters, the pairing of Devon and Hilary quickly amassed a very active fan base and as well as critical acclaim which propelled them to supercouple status. James earned two Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016 and 2019; he won the award in 2020. Storylines The character is introduced in 2004 as a delinquent living out of group homes. The homeless teenager is fostered and eventually adopted by Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) and her husband, Neil (Kristoff St. John). In 2006, Devon contracts meningitis and completely loses his hearing and he receives a cochlear implant to restore his hearing. Later Devon is implicated in the murder of Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez). Fortunately his name is cleared when Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien) admits to the murder. In December 2006, Devon is officially adopted by Neil and Dru but his happiness is short-lived when Dru is presumed dead in April 2007. Later that year, Devon starts dating Lily's friend, Roxanne (Tatyana Ali). In 2008, Devon meets his \\"aunt\\" Tyra (Eva Marcille) for the first time and he learns that Tyra's adopted daughter, Ana (Jamia Simone Nash) is actually his biological half-sister, also abandoned by Yolanda. In 2009, Neil and his new wife Karen Taylor (Nia Peeples) make plans to adopt Ana but those chances are destroyed when Neil cheats with Tyra‚Äîand Devon witnesses the affair. In May 2009, Devon meets his great-aunt Virginia (Della Reese) who reveals that Tyra is adopted and Devon disapproves when she starts dating Neil. However, Devon realizes his disdain for Tyra stems from the fact that he is attracted to her and after she splits with Neil, they end up sleeping together after he berates her for breaking up Neil's marriage. Roxanne finds them together and immediately dumps him while Tyra skips town with Ana. Devon and Roxy reconcile in October 2009. After he graduates college in 2010, Devon takes a job as a photographer's assistant to support his music career. He lands a gig at Tucker McCall's label Resurrection Music producing with Noah Newman (Luke Kleintank). However, when Noah abandons him for another gig, Devon convinces Tucker to give him another chance which culminates with Tucker firing him. Fortunately, Tucker's estranged mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) launches her own label and hires Devon to run it. When Katherine falls into a coma, it is revealed that Tucker is Devon's biological father. Devon rejects Tucker and Katherine as Yolanda (Debbi Morgan), now called Harmony, returns looking to make amends and explain her actions. Ana convinces Devon to forgive Yolanda, and try and connect with his new family. In 2012, Tucker and Harmony convince Devon to get another surgery to improve his hearing. Devon befriends Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) who invests in his label as he produces for Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo). Devon offers her a record contract, but Angelina instead goes to California and Devon closes down his label and joins the marketing team at Jabot Cosmetics. In 2013, Tucker offers Devon a position at his record label but Devon turns it down because it would keep him away from his family and Roxy is furious that Devon considered taking the position without consulting her.

Hilary finally professes her love for Devon and they agree to tell Neil the truth just as Neil lands in the hospital after being electrocuted and left blind. Because Hilary refuses to leave Neil until he recovers, Devon and Hilary give in to temptation and begin an affair. They are later discovered by Cane who orders them to end it immediately. However, they continue seeing each other in secret only to be caught by Cane's father Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) who blackmails Devon into paying him off in exchange for his silence. Colin later demands more money so he can help Jill acquire Chancellor Industries from Victor Newman. Cane neutralizes Colin and Devon gives the money directly to Jill and makes her promise to cut Colin out of the company. Devon wants to wait for Neil to adjust to the news that his condition isn't treatable, only for Neil to confront them when they are on a plane trip to Chicago looking for office space for Chancellor. The plane later crashes leaving the group stranded in a blizzard and they are eventually rescued. Devon is devastated when Hilary announces that she faked her love for Devon to avenge her mother's death. In March 2015, during a drunken binge, Neil causes a car accident that leads to district attorney Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) and police chief Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) losing their unborn child and to keep Neil out of prison, Devon immediately contacts Leslie to represent him. Devon is shocked when Hilary blackmails ADA Winston Mobley (Ryan Caltagirone) into giving Neil a suspended sentence. Hilary finally comes clean about her schemes and tells Devon she is still in love with him and she only left him so he could salvage a relationship with Neil. Devon and Hilary reunite and announce their engagement shortly after Hilary and Neil's divorce is finalized. Devon and Hilary support Lily when her marriage falls apart after her own affair Joe Clark (Scott Elrod) and she assist them with wedding planning. At his bachelor party, Devon presumably gets drunk and cheats on Hilary with a prostitute. While he doesn't remember anything, Lily warns a distraught Devon to keep quiet unless he is sure. Neil finally gives his blessing on Devon and Hilary's wedding day they on their honeymoon soon after. When Hilary goes missing, Devon is the prime suspect and he returns to Genoa City to avoid being arrested. Devon is about to be extradited back to Virgin Gorda until Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) pulls strings to stop the transfer. As Devon awaits news after offering a reward, he tracks down the pilot that transported Hilary from the island who reveals she is in Genoa City. Devon receives a ransom note and someone steals the reward and Cane is implicated. Hilary resurfaces suffering from amnesia and believing she is married to Neil and rejecting Devon. Devon is furious when Neil confesses to rescuing Hilary after accidentally causing her accident; Neil has hired Dr. Simon Neville (Michael E. Knight) to help bring her out of the coma. Devon is about to turn Neil in until Hilary talks him out of it. Devon's hopes for reconciliation are dashed when Hilary regains her memories but not her feelings for Devon. Devon rescues Neil from Neville's blackmail attempt by investing in Neville's medical research and Devon puts Neil in charge. Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) comes aboard and allows the research project to set up shop in Jabot Cosmetics lab. Hilary also becomes the spokes model for the project to help protect Devon's investment. In January 2016, Neil tries to orchestrate Devon and Hilary's reunion and Devon is furious to find the duo sleeping together. Devon then serves Hilary with divorce papers and after Neil rejects her, Hilary suddenly changes her mind about loving Devon but he is hesitant to believe her. A drunken Neil causes trouble at a press conference forcing Devon to fire allowing Hilary to take over. Devon is suspicious when Ashley suddenly gives up her position at the research company to Hilary. When Jack and Neil form the Abbott-Winters Foundation to support recovery centers across the country, Hilary convinces Devon to donate $1 million to challenge Ashley. Hilary also fights for a seat on the board of the foundation and Devon convinces Neil not to hire her fearing the trouble she could cause. A furious Hilary announces plans to divorce Devon and take half his fortune but when Hilary ends up in the hospital again, he rushes to her side as Neville administers treatment. Though Neville believes his medicine is working, Hilary collapses in Devon's arms‚Äîshe is dying. Devon fires Neville and hires another doctor to save his wife. When the victims of the failed drug protocol announce plans to sue, Hilary convinces Devon to settle with them to avoid escalated scandal. Devon, Hilary, Lily and Cane later support Neil when he reconnects with his estranged mother who dies shortly after their reunion. In September 2016, Devon attempts to bribe the GC Buzz to kill a story about Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) allegedly abusing his wife Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) and it backfires when the tabloid runs a story about Devon bribing the press. To stop the stories' circulation, Devon buys the production company and plans to shut down production until Hilary convinces him to keep it on the air and just change the way they tell stories. Devon goes a step further and decides to make Hilary the lead anchor. However, Hilary becomes obsessed with keeping viewers happy and spiking ratings which clashes with Devon's wishes of telling stories without destroying lives. Devon enlist Hilary's new assistant Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes) to help keep Hilary on the straight and narrow. Hilary and Mariah clash over how to handle the revelation that her mother Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) has secretly been raising her ex-husband Nick's (Joshua Morrow) presumed dead son. When Hilary edits an interview with Sharon's husband Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) to smear Sharon to get back at Mariah, a furious Devon fires her. Despite a humiliating fall on air, Devon convinces Mariah to serve as a temporary replacement until he can find a permanent host as Hilary refuses to return to the job. Meanwhile, Devon and Hilary reconcile and they move into a new penthouse. After Lily exposes that Hilary tricked Devon into rehiring her, the couples decides to start over and keep honesty first. During a charity gala, Mariah reveals that Hilary sabotaged her on-air and Devon leaves her and gets into a car accident. While Devon survives, he has short term due to a concussion. Despite filing for divorce, Devon convinces Hilary to co-host GC Buzz with Mariah. He later convinces Hilary to co-host GC Buzz with Mariah. Devon and Hilary divorce in April 2017 though he is obviously jealous of her budding romance with Jordan Wilde (Darnell Kirkwood). Hilary gains ownership of GC Buzz in the divorce with stipulation that she can't fire anyone for a year, to protect Mariah, whom Devon is now dating. Devon launches the Hamilton-Winters Group with Neil and they acquire Mergeron Enterprises from Dina Mergeron (Marla Adams). Devon signs Tessa Porter (Cait Fairbanks) to his new record label. Meanwhile, Devon's romance with Mariah is plagued by his struggle to move on from Hilary and they ultimately break up in November 2017. In 2018, Devon cuts Tessa from the label when she steals lyrics from Mariah. Later, Devon buys GC Buzz from Hilary as she needs cash to ensure financial security as she plans for a baby. Devon exposes that Hilary knew Cane had been falsely accused of sexual harassment and soon starts dating his new artist Simone (Shanica Knowles). Devon is about to fire Hilary for missing a GC Buzz taping until he learns she is mentoring the 17-year-old Shauna (Camryn Hamm). Devon agrees to be Hilary's sperm donor and draws up a co-parenting contract. Despite their plans to keep the relationship platonic, Devon and Hilary sleep together and he calls off the arrangement as it complicates his budding romance with Simone. Neil urges Devon to honor his commitment to Hilary, and he breaks up with Simone, he and Hilary go forward with the insemination. While they play matchmaker for Shauna and Devon's nephew Charlie (Noah Alexander Gerry), Devon and Hilary bond over their future and rekindle their romance. Devon invites the pregnant Hilary and Shauna to move in with him. Despite the efforts of Devon's cousin Nate Hastings (Brooks Darnell), Devon is devastated when Hilary dies from injuries sustained in a car accident. He lashes out when he discovers Lily caused the accident after she ran a red light during an argument with Hilary. While Neil blocks Devon's attempts to punish Lily, she turns herself into the police and Devon urges the judge to impose the maximum sentence. Devon has a last minute change of heart and Lily is sentenced to 1 year in prison. Devon forgives Lily after the sentencing and also pays for Shauna's college education in Hilary's name. Devon's mood swings and wild parties lead to Neil luring Ana (Loren Lott) to town to keep an eye on him. Devon is furious when Cane arranges for Shauna to move to Colorado with her family because she doesn't feel comfortable living with Devon anymore. Devon experiences panic attacks and starts taking anxiety medication when he attends therapy. As Devon's new assistant, Ana convinces Devon to sign Fenmore Baldwin (Zach Tinker) to a record contract. In December 2018, Devon partners with Abby Newman when she wants to launch a new restaurant with Lola Rosales (Sasha Calle) as the chef. Development =Creation and casting= The character of Devon was created by the writers as a vehicle to explore the foster care system. Actress Victoria Rowell who portrayed Devon's adoptive mother Drucilla, had pitched the storyline to co-head writer John F. Smith. Rowell, a product of the foster care system herself, pitched the storyline multiple times before it was approved. In an interview with Daytime Confidential in 2008, Rowell revealed that she was adamant that the actor portraying the role of the foster child be a Black actor due to the population of kids in the system being predominantly African-American boys. Bryton James (previously credited as Bryton McClure) was cast in the role of Devon in April 2004. James was previously known for his portrayal of Richie Crawford on the ABC sitcom Family Matters. As he finished high school in 2004, James took up acting again and one of his first auditions was for The Young and the Restless. James reminisced about the audition process in a 2014 interview with Soap Opera Digest. \\"I remember very vividly walking through the big door on the third floor for the read. The scenes for my audition were heavy drama so I had a sense of what I would be in for.\\" While the scenes had nothing to do with the character of Devon, James made quite the impression on casting director Marnie Saitta. \\"She stopped me halfway through my reading and said, ‚ÄòFinally! Someone reading the character the way it‚Äôs supposed to be read!‚Äô\\" A few days later, James was invited to do a screen test opposite Christel Khalil with four new scenes. James and Khalil had previously worked together when she guest starred on Family Matters. James credited Khalil with helping him land the gig. \\"Christel put in a good word for me and the rest is history\\" he said. In a 2019 interview, James revealed that he didn't know anything about the role or the character when he first auditioned. Once he got hired, \\"I remember sitting down and having some deep conversations with Victoria Rowell.\\" James made his debut on the June 1, 2004 episode. =Characterization= Personality In 2014, James said Devon is \\"so complex.\\" Upon his introduction, Devon is a \\"homeless foster kid with trust issues.\\" In a 2004 with Soap Opera Weekly, James described the character of Devon as a \\"very guarded kid.\\" According to James, Devon likes to stand on his own. He is not the kind of person that likes to be \\"babied\\" the actor said to Soap Opera Digest in 2006. He has a tendency to lash out if feels like he is being coddled. In 2011, head writer Scott Hamner described Devon as being \\"very independent and confident in his ability to take care of himself and shape his own destiny.\\" In 2013, James described Devon as being \\"very down to earth.\\" According to James, Devon had to become accustomed to dealing with huge life changes. In 2018, James described Devon as \\"always\\" having a \\"quick- temper\\" but said that over time, he has evolved the character be more \\"easygoing\\" like himself. In 2019, James said of the character's development throughout the years, \\"I think the writers have done a really great job at making the character accurate to how he would be, how he would feel, how he would treat others.\\" Backstory Devon is born on February 7, 1988 to Yolanda Hamilton. Devon grows up believing his father abandoned them though he apparently lives in Genoa City. Devon even runs into the man he believes is his father outside of a pool hall once but doesn't interact with him. Yolanda, who struggled with an addiction to crack, disappears often leaving Devon in her mother's care. His grandmother proves to be the most stable force in his life. Every year, Devon would spend his birthday with her at the zoo and every Christmas, they'd make 7 layer bars together. After his grandmother's death, Devon is placed in foster care as Yolanda is unable to care for him. Devon goes from one foster home to the next, and has been in approximately a 12 different foster homes. Each time, Devon went in hoping his new foster parents would keep him longer than a few weeks, but his hopes were always crushed. One set of foster parents in particular, the Taylors, Devon believed wanted to keep him. However, he ended up back in the system when their marriage fell apart. In the beginning, Yolanda would visit him until she just stopped. By the time of his introduction, Devon hadn't seen or heard from Yolanda in years. Devon has also been arrested for small crimes such as shop lifting and breaking curfew. He even spent three days in juvenile detention for stealing a sandwich. After all of his bad luck in foster homes, Devon is placed in New Promises Group in Genoa City in the summer of 2003. While in foster care, Devon is forced to attend therapy and at one point, even takes antidepressants. = Foster care and hearing impairment = Soap Opera Digest said Devon's introduction as a homeless foster child taken in by Neil and Drucilla landed the character on the \\"front burner in a social-issue saga.\\" With Victoria Rowell as a story consultant, the foster care storyline was only expected to run through the summer of 2004. However, Devon was soon integrated into the canvas. Rowell helped craft the story by \\"framing it\\" with the necessary characters from Devon's social worker, Lorena Davis (Davenia McFadden) to Devon's birth mother Yolanda (Chene Lawson). Rowell herself is a product of the foster care system having spent the first 18 years of her life growing up in the system. The actress had been heavily involved in working with foster children over the years after she found success which inspired her to incorporate it into the series. Rowell taught James all she could about the foster care system and James would use the lessons to inform his portrayal of Devon whose life was drastically different from his own. According to James, Devon's earliest plots \\"were all directly from experiences that Victoria herself had.\\" Most famously, when Devon runs off to the zoo after the Winters forget his birthday was a mirror image of one of Rowell's many experiences in foster care. James and his co-stars filmed opposite a real life lion for the scenes in which Devon gets trapped at the zoo. Rowell \\"gave me great insight into Devon and what he was feeling\\" James recalled. When James realized just how important the plot was to Rowell and the producers at the time, he assumed it would last for quite a while. \\"But never in a million years did I expect it would be this integrated into the canvas of such an iconic show.\\" Of Devon's eventual adoption in December 2006, James said \\"It showed commitment. It showed someone following through with their word. Devon had encountered families that ‚Äòtalked the talk,‚Äô but didn‚Äôt ‚Äòwalk the walk.‚Äô He dealt with a lot of emotional insecurity. To have the Winters family commit to him meant a great deal. It showed that they were in for the long haul with him even though he‚Äôd put them through a lot.\\" Bryton James (above) as Devon wearing his cochlear implant in 2012. From 2006 to 2007, James who had been asking for the writers to challenge him with a great storyline got the chance to show off his acting chops when his character contracts meningitis and the disease nearly kills him. When Devon starts college, he refuses the recommended immunization shots for the infection. However, the most significant part of the storyline is Devon losing his hearing. Though Devon definitely needs help, he wants to keep everyone at arms length because he wants to deal with the situation on his own. He puts on that tough \\"exterior.\\" Devon who already has to make his own way in the world due to his chaotic childhood, is forced to re-learn to communicate with his family and friends while starting college. After learning from doctors that surgery is his only option, Devon gets the Cochlear Implant surgery on November 26, 2006. At the time of Devon's meningitis scare, Neil and Dru are on the verge of divorce and it is his illness that brings the Winters family back together. Devon's illness helps them to realize that there a lot more important things to deal with then their \\"trivial problems.\\" James did a lot of online research to prepare for the storyline about the different levels of severity in meningitis cases, to how much hearing one could lose, to how much of their hearing a person could get back. James also reached out to some of his own real life friends who are deaf to get a feel for what Devon would feel. James compared it to Devon's foster care storyline: \\"[Y]ou can't completely understand unless you have been through it. Losing any of your senses is difficult. You can act it all you want but to do the best job, it is something you need to explore with someone who really has been through it.\\" James admitted that he was worried about the storyline not knowing if he could completely grasp the situation because he had not experienced it. James had to \\"wing it.\\" However, Devon is not completely hopeless; he believes anything is possible because he's already survived so much. Devon does not just accept that he will always be deaf. However, James said it was difficult to ignore his co-stars in scenes as if he could not hear them. Bryton and his co-stars immediately had to learn sign language from an onset coach. Fortunately, Devon can still speak, so James does not have to use sign language that often. The Young and the Restless worked in conjunction with Advanced Bionics for the storyline. The storyline was revisited in early 2012 when the character's hearing is fully restored due to another surgery. James revealed that Devon's most recent surgery to restore his hearing was actually inspired by real life advances in cochlear implants. His co-star, Eileen Davidson, whom at the time played his stepmother, Ashley Abbott, brought the information to James's attention, who presented the information to Maria Arena Bell. The advances were eventually incorporated into the show. Of the decision to incorporate the real life medical advancements into the story James said, \\"For it come to fruition and for me to play someone going through is very humbling.\\" The story culminates on April 11, 2012 with Devon getting his new implants activated restoring his hearing completely. Of the story, James said that Devon's hearing loss was \\"something you can't really understand unless you experience it, so you just try to the best you can.\\" The actor praised the writers for giving him the opportunity to play the story. James appreciated that his early storylines could not be categorized as the \\"traditional\\" soap opera plots, but instead the stories were very socially relevant. = Early romances (2007‚Äì2009) = Tatyana Ali appears as Devon's girlfriend \\"Roxanne\\" from 2007 to 2013. Prior to Hilary, Devon had seen very little romantic development. However, James appreciated that his character was not immediately thrust into a romance but was instead \\"given extremely meaningful and big stories over the first nine years.\\" The actor believed it gave the audience time to see Devon grow into a \\"believable\\" leading man. While the character has brief dalliances here and there, he has a stable girlfriend in Roxanne (Tatyana Ali) starting in 2007. However, the pairing receives very little development. The character's most controversial story to date involved Devon's affair with his \\"aunt\\" Tyra (Eva Marcille). In May 2009 the writers introduced Devon's great- aunt, Virginia (Della Reese) who reveals several family secrets, including that Tyra is not biologically or legally related to the Hamiltons. In June 2009, Daytime Confidential published a spoiler article which revealed that Devon would begin to develop romantic feelings for Tyra and Devon even fantasizes about kissing her. At the time, Devon is upset with Tyra for breaking up Neil's marriage to Karen Taylor (Nia Peeples). During an argument on August 12, 2009, an angry Devon brings Tyra to tears and when he comforts her, they end up sleeping together; the two are caught by Roxanne. Bryton defended Devon by reminding fans that Devon was only 19 years old when he slept with Tyra and until the affair Hilary, Tyra is the only big mistake Devon had made in his romantic life. Devon has grown up a bit since his tryst with Tyra. Also, the lack of a family connection between Devon and Tyra made it seem a little less dramatic for James. They \\"didn't grow up together. It's not like someone you see at every family reunion or anything like that.\\" Ultimately, James regretted the storyline because it made Devon look like a hypocrite when he comes down on his biological parents for having an affair when Tucker is still married. = Paternal lineage (2009‚Äì2013) = While his mother's history was well documented, the topic of Devon's paternity was rather unclear. The seeds for the story were first planted in 2009. James expressed to executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell his hopes for Devon's paternity to be explored at some point. \\"I always liked the idea of Devon finding his father and hoped it would be someone already in Genoa City.\\" In May 2009, Devon's great-aunt Virginia (Della Reese) presents him with a letter that reveals that Devon's father never knew about his existence. It changes everything for Devon who grew up believing his father was a junkie like his mother or just some guy who chose not to be in his life. According to James, the revelation \\"leaves it wide open to the possibilities of what kind of man this could have been.\\" To further complicate matters, it is not clear what state Yolanda was in at the time of his conception. This turn of events also made James hopeful that the writers would soon explore his character's paternity. James initially envisioned the character of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) as Devon's father. In May 2011, Daytime Confidential reported that Devon would soon come into contact with his biological father. In July 2011, it was announced that All My Children superstar Debbi Morgan had been cast in an undisclosed role. Yahoo! TV suggested several scenarios for her potential character including a recast of Devon's mother Yolanda, or the mother of Tucker McCall's (Stephen Nichols) long lost son. Upon Morgan's debut, it was revealed that the two potential roles were one in the same ‚Äì Devon was Tucker's son. As James prepared for his wedding in March 2011, he planned to take time off for his honeymoon. However, the producers were forced to tell James that he could not take time off because Devon would be involved in a major storyline. \\"It was a bad and very good thing\\" James remarked. James admitted that he was not really in favor of introducing a new character as Devon's father. While Tucker was still a relatively new character, the plot twist makes Devon the grandson of Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), the show's matriarch. Of the storyline, James said \\"‚Ä¶ it was more than I could ever have dreamed for myself. I never in a million years thought [Devon] would end up tied to the very core of the show. You can't get more entrenched than that!\\" According to Maria Arena Bell, she'd been looking to revisit the story since James first mentioned it in 2009. According to co-head writer Scott Hamner, the manner in which Devon finds out about his paternity \\"leaves a very bad feeling for Devon\\" and makes him \\"bitter.\\" Devon had such high hopes and learning that Katherine not only found out about his paternity, but chose to keep it from him, and give him a job instead leaves Devon angry. Devon also feels slighted that it took two billionaires like Katherine and Tucker so long to find him despite their wealth and power as he realizes they could have saved him from the struggles he faced early in life. However, the revelation only strengthens Devon's bond with his adoptive family. \\"Devon always will be Neil's son\\" James insisted. According to the actor, it is Devon's connection to the Winters family that keeps grounded when he suddenly comes into wealth. While most people would allow money to change them, James believed that nothing could ever make Devon turn away from Neil. As a unit, the Winters family were given several stories over the years, but not many of which allowed the family to intermingle with the non-African American characters often. Devon's connection to Katherine further removes the family from the proverbial \\"Black Box\\" in which the characters only interact with other African American characters. The storyline makes Devon the first biracial character to be introduced in the series and also reflected Bryton's own heritage. Upon Jeanne Cooper's passing in May 2013 and the subsequent announcement that Katherine's death would soon be acknowledged onscreen, many wondered who would benefit from Katherine's vast empire. Deanna Barnert concluded that Devon would be the biggest winner considering he would be Katherine's only blood relative still on the canvas at the time of Katherine's death. Because Devon's connection to Katherine was still fairly new compared to her other more well established relatives, many wondered exactly how much Devon would benefit compared to Katherine's other and more well established relatives. In an interview with Soaps in Depth's Julie McElwain, James hinted that there was quite a bit of story coming for Devon while McEwin questioned if someone could come after Devon's new inheritance. Devon has no problems using his new wealth to shower his loved ones with expensive gifts, but he is caught off guard when his longtime girlfriend Roxanne (Tatyana Ali) suddenly puts a down payment on a new place for them. The money brings a new dynamic to the relationship and Devon starts questioning Roxy's motives. According to James, Devon feels very guilty for accusing Roxy and though he doesn't really believe she is with him for the money, he would have rather they made a decision like that together. While James insisted that Devon's new wealth would not change him, Devon struggles to keep up with the sudden changes, from billionaire Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) suddenly taking an interest in him to Roxy's decision to move in together, and Mason Wilder's (Lamon Archey) schemes to suck up to Devon. It would be even harder for Devon to find his \\"passion\\" because the money brings him so many more opportunities leaving him a bit overwhelmed. In the fall of 2016, newly installed head writer Sally Sussman Morina revealed that she felt that Devon's inheritance \\"left him without drive, without a goal.\\" She continued, \\"What does he want? What does he strive for? I don't think those questions were ever asked, so we need to fix that.\\" Over the years, Devon has proven to be quite generous with his fortune. According to James, \\"it's understandable because he never came from it.\\" Devon's idea of \\"money and giving back and sharing wealth and helping to uplift others, it comes from what he never had and what he always wished people did for him.\\" = Relationship with Hilary Curtis (2013‚Äì2018) = Devon and Hilary's (Mishael Morgan) \\"forbidden love\\" garnered fan support very early on, and even more so after Hilary marries Neil (Kristoff St. John). Devon's most significant and popular pairing proved to be his romantic pairing with Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan). The couple faces several obstacles before they even become a couple including Hilary's \\"denial\\" of her feelings and Hilary's misunderstood attraction to her boss Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) which sends Devon into the arms of the gold digging supermodel Esmeralda (Briana Nicole Henry). Jean Passanante said \\"Esmeralda is unabashedly attracted to Devon's money, perhaps as much as she is to Devon himself.\\" Devon thinks he has missed his chance with Hilary after seeing her with Jack. Writer Shelly Altman insisted that the duo shared a mutual attraction but they would need to overcome yet another and \\"very surprising obstacle!\\" That obstacle comes in the form of Hilary's short lived romance and sudden marriage to Neil. James viewed the situation differently then he did Devon's affair with Tyra because at the time, he was very young, still only a teenager when it occurred. In the triangle with Neil and Hilary, Devon is an adult and he can come at Neil as an equal. Despite unflattering circumstances, the pairing was a hit with most fans and critics which James accredited to the writers for \\"taking the time, and letting the fans get invested in really caring about Devon and Hilary's feelings for each other.\\" According to James, Devon believes he has found \\"true love\\" with Hilary. Devon and Hilary face a long uphill battle once their affair is exposed. James was \\"thrilled\\" to finally get the opportunity to play a more \\"traditional soap\\" story like Devon and Hilary's affair. Devon and Hilary married in August 2015 with their wedding airing over the course of 4 episodes. Devon and Hilary's marriage is plagued by many ups and downs and the couple ultimately divorces in 2017. During his separation from Hilary, Devon quickly rushes into a romance with his friend Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), and Hilary's co-worker. \\"I think Devon's friendship with Mariah happened at the right time, and they do have feelings for each other,\\" James said. However, the relationship is plagued by Mariah's growing attraction to a woman, which Devon isn't aware of, and Devon's unwillingness to profess his love for Mariah when pressures him to do so. According to James, Devon and Mariah are \\"testing each other's feelings, trying to figure out what's going on.\\" The relationship happens so fast after Devon's split from Hilary, \\"that it's hard not to think a rebound-esque thing is going on\\" James insisted. After failed romances with other people, Devon and Hilary reunite in 2018 in a unique way ‚Äì by agreeing to conceive a child together, strictly as platonic co-parents. However, they soon rekindle their romance and prepare for their child. After failed contract negotiations in the summer of 2018, Mishael Morgan vacates the role of Hilary and executive producer Mal Young chose to kill off Hilary and their unborn child. The actors weren't aware of the plans until they received the scripts. James revealed \\"One day everything's fine. The next day she's in the hospital with days to live.\\" In preparation of Morgan's final scenes, Young sent James clips of Devon and Hilary's journey together which the actor said \\"Just watching them made me emotional all over again.\\" James admitted that he would miss working with Morgan. \\"Mishael was always ready to commit 110 percent to the material that was on the page, which is an acting partner's dream.\\" While he enjoyed playing it, James thought it was one of the more unbelievable plots Devon was involved in. = Grief (2018‚Äì2019) = While he would miss Devon and Hilary's relationship, Bryton looked forward to whatever the producers had in store for Devon next. After the sudden deaths of Hilary and his unborn child, \\"Devon is in a state of shock from experiencing so much pain in such a short amount of time.\\" Meanwhile, Neil worries Devon will shut his family out when he needs them the most like Neil did when he lost Dru. According to Julie McElwain, Devon struggles with \\"anger issues\\" over Lily involvement in Hilary's death. Though he understands the animosity Lily has for Hilary, Devon believes that \\"Hilary has done so much to make up for what she did and everyone has given her another chance except Lily. Even when Lily has said she would try, in the next breath, she said something insulting and degrading toward Hilary.\\" But for Devon, finding out Lily is responsible for Hilary's death is the \\"last straw\\" for him. He wants to punish her. When Cane begs Devon not to press charges, Devon remembers that Cane was at Lily's side whenever she set out to cause trouble for Hilary. And while most of his anger is reserved for Lily, Devon harbors \\"resentment\\" for Cane trying to cover up Lily's involvement. Though Neil promises he won't let it get that far, Devon is angry enough to go against Neil. He isn't surprised that Neil is protecting Lily, but he also knows if it was anyone else, Neil would support \\"Devon's need for justice.\\" Though they are the only consistent family he's ever had, it's very \\"difficult\\" for Devon to see beyond his grief. Devon throws himself into work, and his coldness toward Lily forces Neil to interfere. But the last thing Devon wants is advice about how he should be handling his grief. \\"I think Devon is at his tipping point!\\" James declared. James vowed that whatever happened \\"would changed the dynamic of the [Winters] family for the rest of their lives!\\" What Lily did can't be undone, \\"So there are certain [familial] feelings that also won't be coming back!\\" The pressure from his family to forgive Lily only leaves Devon further \\"frustrated.\\" Devon feels he needs to see Lily punished to grieve. As Lily's trial approaches, Devon starts realizes just how much is ridding on what he says to the judge. \\"Lily and Cane have children who will suffer greatly if their mother goes away for a long time, so Devon's not blind to all of that.\\" While getting \\"justice\\" for the family he lost is his \\"top priority\\" Devon knows he can't be too \\"one-sided.\\" Facing his family in court \\"makes it very real\\" for Devon. Though Devon isn't moved by Cane's testimony, Shauna asking the judge not to punish Lily has a drastic effect on him. \\"She's a young girl who doesn't want to have a hand in somebody's life being ruined because of an accident.\\" Ultimately, Devon decides against burying Lily in court and she is sentenced to prison for a year. However, James said \\"It doesn't look like Devon is going to get over Hilary's death anytime soon.\\" Devon \\"needs to grieve\\" the actor continued. In November 2018, Loren Lott steps into the role Ana whom Neil lures to town due to Devon's battles with depression because of his grief. With the sudden passing Kristoff St. John in February 2019, the writers decide to kill off the Neil character. By the spring of 2019, Devon seems to be moving forward, both professionally and personally as he had started dating Elena Dawson (Brytni Sarpy). He even shares a happy reunion with Lily when she attends the grand opening of his new restaurant. \\"Seeing Lily makes the night even better for him. Despite what they went through to have her end up in prison, forgiveness has been made and the relationship is mended.\\" Unfortunately, Devon's hopes for a new beginning are crushed when he finds Neil has passed away. Devon returns to the restaurant \\"visibly shaken\\" where he is forced to break the news to his family at the worst possible moment. Devon experiences \\"great difficulty coping with Neil's death so soon after losing Hilary and their unborn child.\\" For Bryton James, it was harder for him to film Neil's funeral than it was to attend Kristoff St. John's real life funeral, the week before. Seeing the set decorated with flowers and Kristoff's portrait made it \\"more real for me.\\" James reasoned that it was \\"because it's at the studio where I met him, worked with him, lived with him and had so many special moments with him.\\" Having so many cast members return to honor Kristoff and Neil added to those feelings for James. Despite the large number of people working that day, the filming \\"went smoothly.\\" James continued, \\"Kristoff would've been proud and I was grateful to be part of it.\\" When Devon sees Neil at home, the writers gave James the opportunity to personalize some of his dialogue. James revealed that his own father's passing in 2016 helped him with the story as well. On May 1, 2019, Mishael Morgan makes an unannounced return as Devon mistakes Hilary for Elena after a dream which leads to them kissing. CBS Soaps in Depth confirmed that Morgan would appear in several more episodes. According to the magazine, Hilary would help Devon move past his grief. However, Hilary's looming presence is proof of how hard it is for Devon to move on without Hilary. \\"Having this new romance and love just kind of came out of nowhere. You want to move on. And Devon is still very young. So it's natural to have these new feelings. But it's also normal to have a difficult time with letting go of someone that you were that attached to.\\" James appreciated that the writers paced it out instead of having \\"Devon get over [his grief] too quickly.\\" Morgan hinted that it wouldn't be the last time Devon would be visited by Hilary. Reception =Awards and nominations= Bryton James has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Devon throughout the years. Bryton was nominated for the Daytime Emmy in the Outstanding Younger Actor category 5 times from 2006 to 2009, and once again in 2013. He won the award in 2007. For his 2009 Emmy nomination, James submitted the scenes of Devon's reaction to losing his little sister, Ana to the foster care system, after interference from his biological mother. Bryton's portrayal of Devon has also garnered him several NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series, from 2005 to 2009. James won the award in 2009. In 2016, James was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. James received two more nominations in the category in 2019, and 2020, for which he won the award. =Foster care= Deanna Barnert of Soap Opera Weekly said \\"The foster care community has taken note\\" of the storyline and fans immediately took a liking to James. Soap Opera Digest praised the storyline as the \\"Best Social Issue\\" arc for the year 2004. The magazine said, \\"A social-issue soap story needn't be constorversial or shocking to be effective, as Y&R; proved with an intelligent and realistic tale about foster care. Not an inherently 'sexy' topic, the story was nonetheless compelling\\" specifically due to Victoria Rowell, who played Devon's foster mother Drucilla was so heavily involved in the story. \\"The result was an involving storyline\\" that received several accolades. \\"By allowing for vastly different viewpoints, it wasn't preachy or emotionally manipulative\\" and like all great soap stories, it added layers to an existing relationship. =Hearing loss= He won his first and only Emmy Award in 2007 for his portrayal of Devon during the hearing loss storyline. Despite some thinking the characters picked up sign language too quickly, Bionic Ear experts praised the storyline and James for his portrayal. The storyline also led to increased interests in cochlear implants and provided hope for those dealing with hearing loss. James expressed gratitude to viewers thanking him for his portrayal of Devon's situation. James earned his fifth Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Young Actor category in 2013, for his portrayal of Devon during the scenes where Devon's hearing is completely restored after a new cochlear implant. =Paternity and inheritance= The storyline about Devon's paternity received both positive and mixed criticism. Jae Jones from Yahoo! TV praised the series for reflecting \\"current times\\" by making Devon the biracial grandson of one of the show's core characters. Yahoo! TV also hailed the plot as the best reveal of 2011. Wordwiley complimented the series for making an established character like Devon Tucker's son instead of introducing a new character. The author also commented that the dynamic between Katherine, Tucker, Devon and Harmony was rich with potential story. Carolyn Hinsey said Nichols's Tucker was not a strong enough character to hang such a heavy story one. Naomi Rabinowitz appreciated that the plot cemented both Tucker and Devon to the canvas, and that it made for an interesting dynamic pitting Neil vs. Tucker, but disapproved of the constant rewriting of Katherine's history. Luke Kerr said that while he wasn't a big fan of the initial story, he enjoyed seeing Devon and Tucker bond over their shared interest in music. Sara Bibel praised the story arc because it allowed James to showcase his talent, and it provided the very underused character with a storyline, and described the plot twist as a \\"juicy way of defining\\" the character. However, Bibel admitted that the execution could have been better. During the week of Devon's paternity reveal, the show gained 282, 000 total viewers rebounding from a previous week of a new ratings low. In response to Devon's inheritance, Sara Bibel described the plot twist as a \\"doozy.\\" Bibel praised the twist for \\"transforming\\" Devon without having to make him act \\"out of character.\\" Boone of Soapcentral said \\"I'm kind of curious to know what Devon's role will be in the future.\\" However, the column also said that Devon has never been a leading character. Others were completely dumbfounded by the twist and said it didn't make any sense. Sara Bibel appreciated that the storyline was the most upbeat of the storylines on the series, but disapproved of Devon's need to maintain his normal way of life; \\"God forbid we should get to see someone having fun even though aspirational, wish-fulfillment storylines are a daytime staple,\\" Bibel said. Bibel later criticized how instead of having some fun, pursuing his own dreams, or a new business venture, Devon reacts to his inheritance \\"by feeling guilty about unearned wealth despite being surrounded by people with trust funds.\\" CBS Soaps in Depth also criticized the writing for Devon's reaction due to the money bringing him more misery then happiness. ABC Soaps in Depth said of Devon becoming the go-to-guy for money, \\"Why are the numerous rich folks of Genoa City treating The Young and the Restless' Devon like their own personal piggybank?\\" =Romance= After nine years with the series, James' character entered into a forbidden relationship with his then stepmother Hilary Curtis that was soon called a supercouple. Critics took notice of the pairing's chemistry in their very first scenes together, long before a romantic relationship was even a possibility. Devon's relationship with Hilary garnered quite a vocal fan base very quickly with the duo debuting on fan polls in both magazines and online. Devon and Hilary would make several year end \\"best-of\\" lists in 2014 including Daytime Confidential, TVSource Magazine and the duo was listed as the \\"Best Couple\\" of 2014 by Nelson Branco of TV Guide (Canada). The TV Watercooler hailed the pairing as \\"the show's best new pairing in years.\\" One writer known as Gingersnap appreciated the decision to pair the African American Devon with the African American Hilary and likened them to the Black version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Ashley Dionne from TVSource Magazine said Devon and Hilary gave fans \\"the audacity to hope\\" while simultaneously proving Bryton James' status as a \\"romantic daytime hunk.\\" Devon and Hilary won the Fan Favorite Award for \\"Most Romantic Duo\\" at the 42nd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2015. Despite the critical acclaim and fan response, fans of the pairing controversially accused the writers of racism, while others accused the producers of underestimating James' appeal as a romantic lead by suddenly pushing Devon aside and rushing Hilary into a romance with Neil and then forcing a triangle. Then executive producer Charles Pratt Jr. sparked further controversy when he attributed the couple's lack of airtime to budgetary restraints and Mishael Morgan's real-life pregnancy. Devon's previous romances were rather poorly received. Critics and fans were very much against Devon's affair with Tyra a full two months prior to the story playing out onscreen. The storyline was compared to fellow CBS soap, Guiding Light's incest storyline in which first cousins, Tammy Winslow (Stephanie Gatschet) and Jonathan Randall (Tom Pelphrey) fall in love and marry. Tammy is killed off just days after their wedding. TV Guide listed Devon and Tyra's one-night-stand as the \\"WORST AFFAIR\\" of 2009. Naomi Rabinowitz of Soap Opera Digest also disapproved of the storyline and described the dynamic between Tyra and Devon as \\"creepy \\" due to their lives being so intertwined and Devon being raised to believe Tyra is his aunt. On the other hand, while Lauren Flynn agreed that the plot was a turn off to viewers due to their relation, Flynn argued that the tryst was a \\"welcome twist\\" to an otherwise lackluster storyline. However, Flynn liked that the storyline gave Devon something to do instead of serving as a talk to for Lily. Jamey Giddens who immediately disapproved of the storyline agreed to wait until after the storyline played out and said the plot was \\"ridiculous,\\" due to their attraction coming out of nowhere. However, a poll posted on Daytime Confidential saw 60% of voters being against the storyline as well. Fans tend to hold Devon's affair with Tyra against the character because of how judgmental he is. Soaps in Depth also praised the decision to put an end to Devon and Roxy's romance, and accused prior regimes of treating James and Ali as glorified day players.

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 594. It is primarily known as the location of the Oulton Park motor racing circuit. The village is about 3 miles from Winsford and Tarporley, 14 miles to Chester City Centre, 8 miles to Northwich and 17 miles to Warrington with nearby rail connection along the Mid-Cheshire Line set in rolling English countryside and forest. History As the Romans settled in mid-Cheshire they explored Delamere Forest for food and discovered underground salt in the area. The transport of salt led to roads being created in an otherwise wild area. A settlement was founded in this open space by a Viking, Bodeur. The open space was called a 'wirth'. In the Domesday Book the village appeared as 'Bodeaurde' and is described as a 'waste' with woodland 'one league long and half a league wide' and land enough for two ploughs. Between 1153 and 1160 the manor was granted by the Third Earl of Chester to Robert le Grosvenor whose descendant held the village for Edward the First. Certain lands remained in the ownership of the Grosvenors. In the reign of Henry VIII it passed to the ancestors of the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1860 the village was known as Budworth-in-the- Frith. There was a school known as Lady Egerton's School. St Peter's Church St Peter's Church, Little Budworth The first record of a church in Little Budworth dates from 1190 when it was mentioned in conjunction with the parish of Over, Winsford. In 1526 Hugh Starky of Oulton directed that he should be buried in Little Budworth and left money to the church. The 'free chapel of Budworth le Frith, within the Parish of Over', is mentioned in a charter of 1547 endowing the Bishopric of Chester, when is belonged to the nunnery of St Mary, Chester. In 1798 the church was rebuilt (except for the tower and north wall) by a bequest from Ralph Kirkham (a rich merchant of Chester and the son of a farmer in Little Budworth, educated at Lady Egerton's School). The church was restored by the Colonel of Egerton in 1919 and the window commemorating the Egerton twins killed in the war was placed in the south aisle. Two chests ordered by Queen Elizabeth ‚Äì the outer for vestments and registers, the inner for the plate ‚Äì were still there in 1935 but now the smaller has disappeared. There remains one of the two short-handled copper collecting boxes dated 1801, the silver-gilt Egerton chalice and the large painting thought to be of the school of Caravaggio. The smaller painting of 'The Good Shepherd' by William Dyce (given by the Stocks family) is on permanent loan to the Walker Art Gallery. Public houses There are four pubs in the parish of Little Budworth. The Red Lion is in the heart of the village, opposite the church. The Shrewsbury Arms is on the road to Chester and the Cabbage Hall is on the A49. The Egerton Arms closed down in 2008 but has now re-opened. Little Budworth Common Little Budworth Common is a country park and SSSI west of the village. Described in the SSSI citation as \\"one of the best surviving examples of lowland heath in Cheshire\\", locally uncommon plant species found here include heather Calluna vulgaris, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea. The Friends of Little Budworth Common, a community group, help maintain the habitat. The site has designated routes for horse-riders and cyclists.

Model 5 was preplanned as a sweeping operation to destroy all of the Syrian surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries on the Golan front, by using unguided, general-use bombs dropped from a medium altitude near the targets. The attacking aircraft were to approach the targets at a very low altitude, in order to avoid being detected by Syrian radars (especially fire control and target acquisition radars such as the Flat Face and Long Track). Due to a lack of updated intelligence and reliance on outdated IMINT, while suffering from an underdeveloped ELINT‚ÄìESM capability, the Israeli aircraft did not find their targets, as these SAM batteries had already moved to other locations. The outcome of Model 5 was catastrophic for the attacking force: six F-4 Phantom aircraft were lost over Syria and several others were damaged but returned to Ramat David. Most of the damaged aircraft were hit by ZSU-23‚àô4 air defense artillery guns, which were especially deadly due to the sorties' very low altitude. Two crewmen were killed and nine captured by the Syrians, for the destruction of but a single Syrian SAM battery. Stunned by their difficulties in suppressing enemy air defenses in both fronts of the Yom Kippur War and the resulting degradation in the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force, the Israelis spent the years following the war developing a comprehensive strategy to deal with the suppression of enemy air defenses. These efforts culminated in their engagement of the Syrians 9 years later in Operation Mole Cricket 19, where they were able to, for the first time in history, destroy an entire Soviet-made SAM network in a matter of hours.

He became Metropolitan of Ephesus in 1393, before being elected Patriarch of Constantinople on 21 May 1416. Together with Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, 23 Metropolitan bishops and about 700 scholars and theologians, he took part in the Council of Florence. While in Florence, he was quartered in the Palazzo Ferrantini. He is portrayed in Benozzo Gozzoli's frescoes in the Magi Chapel of Palazzo Medici Riccardi, which celebrates the entrance of the Byzantine dignitaries in the city. Joseph was very old and ill and died within 2 months on 10 June 1439. His death caused much grief to all present at the Council, as he was a fervent supporter of union between the Churches; before his death, he drew up and signed an important pro-union declaration for the Council. His grave in the Dominican convent church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence survives, with an elaborate fresco portrait in a semi-Byzantine style. He was succeeded as Patriarch of Constantinople by Metrophanes II, who was appointed by Emperor John VIII on account of his similarly pro-unionist sentiments. He was cousin of Constantine II of Bulgaria.  Sources  * Council of Florence, at the Catholic Encyclopedia * Sergey F.

Pedro Aguilar was nicknamed \\"Cuban Pete\\" and . Aguilar was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He took tap-dance training in childhood and had an early career in boxing. He then transitioned to dance; creating a rhythmically complex, visually arresting dancing style that electrified audiences. By his own count he invented 100 signature foot, torso and hand movements with names like the Porpoise, the Shimmy Shimmy and the Prayer. His nickname, \\"Cuban Pete,\\" was conferred on him, in 1949, at the famous Palladium dance hall in New York City, in reference to the classic mambo song \\"Cuban Pete\\" by Desi Arnaz. The moniker was endorsed by Arnaz himself. In the 1950s, Aguilar and his partner Millie Donay appeared at a British command performance before the Queen. They also danced at the White House; for President Dwight Eisenhower and later for President Lyndon Johnson. Aguilar also appeared on the popular Jackie Gleason Show. Aguilar won numerous prizes in Latin dancing during the Mambo era, together with his dance partner Millie Donay. He is a recipient of many prestigious awards for his work, and is the only Latin dancer recognized in the Latin Jazz exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. Aguilar made a career as a dancer, teacher and choreographer. He also worked for Warner Brothers in Los Angeles for many years. As a consultant on the 1992 film \\"The Mambo Kings\\", he taught Antonio Banderas and Armand Assante to mambo, and can be seen in several of the dance scenes. In 2000, he collaborated with Edward Villella on the ballet ‚ÄúMambo No. 2 a.m.,‚Äù which had its premiere with the Miami City Ballet. In 2002, a documentary, The Lucky Man (also entitled Game Boys) by German film-maker Dieter Weihl, featuring Aguilar, premiered at The Tiburon International Film Festival.

It is made with thin yellow noodles stir fried in cooking oil with garlic, onion or shallots, fried prawn, chicken, beef, or sliced bakso (meatballs), chili, Chinese cabbage, cabbages, tomatoes, egg, and other vegetables. Ubiquitous in Indonesia, it is sold by food vendors from street-hawkers, warungs, to high-end restaurants. It is an Indonesian one-dish meal favourite, although street food hawkers commonly sell it together with nasi goreng (fried rice). It is commonly available at Mamak stalls in Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia and is often spicy. In Sri Lanka, mee goreng is a popular dish due to Malay cultural influences and is sold at street food stalls around the country. Origin Stir frying mie goreng Jawa in a wok Chinese influences are evident in Indonesian food, such as bakmi, mie ayam, pangsit, bakso, lumpia, kwetiau goreng, and mie goreng. The dish is derived from Chinese chow mein and believed to have been introduced by Chinese immigrants in Indonesia. Despite being influenced by Chinese cuisine, mie goreng in Indonesia have a definite Indonesian taste, it has been more heavily integrated into Indonesian cuisine; for example the application of popular sweet soy sauce that add mild sweetness, sprinkle of fried shallots, addition of spicy sambal and the absence of pork and lard in favour of shrimp, chicken, or beef; to cater for the Muslim majority. Today, mie goreng is one of the most widespread simple dishes in Indonesia. Asian stir fried noodle akin to mie goreng can arguably trace its origin to China. While in Indonesia, the dish origin is clearly associated with Chinese Indonesian cuisine, in Malaysia and Singapore however, mee goreng is associated with South Indian cuisine, regarded as the fusion food that incorporates the Chinese yellow noodle with Indian spices and mutton. In Malaysia and Singapore, the dish is believed to have been created by Indian immigrants who drew influences from their own as well as other cultures. Mee Goreng, which is fried yellow noodles commonly found in Malaysia, is commonly sold in Mamak stall; Mamak is a local term for Muslim Malaysian Indians hawkers. The Mamaks borrowed noodles from their Chinese counterparts and create their own spicy version. The naming in Malay: mee goreng is also meant to signify that it is a halal food; cooked by Indian- Muslim in Malaysia, in contrast to Malaysian Chinese version that often non- halal and retain its original Chinese names. The Malaysian Indian mee goreng mamak is a Malaysian phenomenon, since this version cannot be found in India itself.https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1740_2010-12-13.html Variations Mie goreng are traditionally made with yellow wheat noodles, stir fried with chopped shallots, onion, and garlic with soy sauce seasoning, egg, vegetables, chicken, meat or seafood. However, other versions might use dried instant noodle instead of fresh yellow wheat noodle. The powdered instant noodle seasonings are usually included in the dish, added with egg and vegetables, they are common in Indonesia and Malaysia. Authentic mie goreng uses fresh ingredients and spices, however, bottled instant spice paste might be used for practical reasons. The almost identical recipe is often used to create other dishes. For example bihun goreng is made by replacing yellow wheat noodle with bihun or rice vermicelli, while kwetiau goreng uses shahe fen or thick flat rice noodles instead. =Indonesia= Mie goreng Aceh. A number of mie goreng variants exist. In Indonesia mie goreng variants are usually named after the ingredients, while some might be named after the region of origin. * Mie goreng ayam or common mie goreng uses chicken with shallots, garlic, leek, sweet soy sauce, egg, and vegetables typically added as well. * Mie goreng ayam penyet mie goreng topped with ayam penyet smashed fried chicken with sambal. * Mie goreng sapi, similar to common traditional mie goreng, but uses beef instead. * Mie goreng kambing uses goat meat or mutton. * Mie goreng udang uses shrimp. * Mie goreng seafood uses seafood which includes mixture of fish, squid, and shrimp. * Mie Goreng Aceh a mie goreng variant from Aceh province, which uses a thicker noodle similar to that of spaghetti, and employs a curry-like rich spicy paste. * Mie goreng Jawa from Central Java, employ sweet soy sauce, egg, chicken, and vegetables. In restaurant, warung or travelling food vendor, it usually sold and offered together with mie rebus (lit. \\"boiled noodle\\") or mie Jawa. * Mie goreng tek- tek refer to mie goreng sold by travelling street hawkers that hitting the wok making \\"tek-tek\\" sounds to announce their wares. The seller with his food cart frequenting the residence areas, usually also offers nasi goreng and mie rebus. It is common in Jakarta and some large cities in Java. * Mie goreng dhog-dhog also known as Mie goreng Surabaya from Surabaya city. Refer to travelling food cart vendor selling mie goreng Surabaya that uses large wooden slit drum instead to announce his presence in the neighbourhood, thus creates \\"dhog-dhog\\" sounds. Instant version of mie goreng * Indomie Mi goreng the instant version of mie goreng, Indomie Mi goreng is also popular in Indonesia and other countries, notably Netherlands, Nigeria, Australia, New Zealand, United States and several Middle Eastern countries. This instant version however, is not technically goreng (stir-fried), but boiled instead and seasoned after discarding the water used for boiling. Nevertheless, it tries to closely resemble the authentic mie goreng by adding sweet soy sauce and crispy fried shallot. It is commonly found in warung Indomie stalls that sell instant noodles, grilled sandwiches and hot drinks in Indonesian urban areas. Indonesians tend to name similar foreign dishes as mie goreng, for example in Indonesia, chow mein is often called mie goreng Tionghoa and yakisoba is called mie goreng Jepang. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, mie goreng is associated with Malaysian Indian cuisine and is famous for being prepared and sold at Mamak stalls around the country. The dish has spawned unique variations found in Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore. * Mee goreng mamak. A common variation of mie goreng is mee goreng mamak which is sold at Mamak stalls run by Indian Muslims in Malaysia. This variation is distinguished from others through the use of spices, tomato sauce, potatoes, sweet soy sauce, and curry spice. Chilli is another common ingredient used in this dish. * Maggi goreng is a variation originating from the Indian Muslim community and sold in Mamak stalls around Malaysia. It uses Maggi instant noodles instead of standard yellow noodles. =Singapore= In Singapore, the availability of mie goreng is largely similar to that found in Malaysia, including the Mamak version. Singapore is also home of the Punggol mie goreng, so called due to its origins at the Punggol End bus station. It is closely related to the Peranakan Chinese-style mie goreng, and includes stir-fried rempah, yellow Chinese noodles, seafood (typically prawns). Some versions include the addition of imitation crab, cabbage, and bean sprouts.

His work helped to develop an anti parasitic drug to combat them. Career Duke attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and later Guy's Hospital, in all he attained an MD, MA, ScD, MB, BChir and a diploma in Tropical medicine. He joined the Colonial Medical Service in 1953 and was dispatched to the Cameroons where he started to do in-depth studies of the dynamics of River Blindness. He also conducted research into the parasitical infections Loa loa and Schistosomiasis. He wrote 172 medical papers and his research set new standards in methodology for all future clinical trials. In 1975 Duke joined WHO as head of Filariasis infectious unit, his earlier research enabling the clinical trials of Ivermectin to go smoothly. This anti-parasitic drug proved very effective against River Blindness and other diseases caused by parasitic worms. Duke is also credited with pressuring Merck to supply Invermectin free to all sufferers of River Blindness, which led to the creation of the Mectizan Donation Programme. To date more than half a billion doses have been given away. =Honours and retirement= In 1961 Duke was appointed an OBE, followed by a CBE in 1975. In 1991 Duke retired from WHO and became the medical director of the River Blindness Foundation until 1996. He was a distinguished scientist at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) where he developed invaluable teaching materials on Helminithic Diseases.

The site is notable for having been the scene of an 1868 armed conflict between elements of the United States Army and several of the Plains Indian tribes. The island was named for Lt. Fredrick Henry Beecher of the 3rd Infantry (nephew of Henry Ward Beecher and veteran of the Battle of Gettysburg), one of the heroes of the engagement who was killed during what became known as the Battle of Beecher Island. The \\"island\\" and the courses of the river have been modified by several floods since 1868. The Battle of Beecher Island was fought along the Arickaree Fork of the Republican River with concentrated fighting on a small island. A few willow trees stood on the island; however, the banks on either side of the river were believed to have had minimal tree growth. Bluffs rise gently from the course of the river. The physical appearance of the actual battleground site was changed by a flood in 1935 which altered the river channel. A monument, erected in 1905, was swept from the island and virtually all traces of the island were destroyed. The major pieces of the monument were retrieved and have been erected on the north side of the river, overlooking picnic and camping grounds. Beecher Island Battleground Memorial Association The Association purchased where the battle happened. This is a semi-arid region with native grasses, sagebrush, scrub plants, and trees along the river. The Association maintains a monument and the 1940 period auditorium, Sunday School building, kitchen hall, a one-room school house, modern showers and rest rooms, and a storage shed.

Westward immigration in the 1860s, broke the treaties between the Great Plains tribes and the United States The Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and Sioux Indians saw their hunting grounds being overrun by trails and homesteads. Alarmed, they began sporadic raids against settlers 1864-1868. Major George \\"Sandy\\" Forsyth, was commissioned to take fifty frontiersmen and locate the Indians doing the raiding. On the afternoon of September 16, 1868, an Indian trail was found and the troop followed it towards an encampment. Sioux scouts alerted their warriors nearby threat. The Indians were located on the Arikaree Fork of the Republican River. Roman Nose, Indian war leader was among those in the camp. The Forsyth setup camp on the south side of the Arickaree Fork. Toward dawn, Indian scouts happened onto the camp. Fighting began and reinforcements were called from the Indian camps. Forsyth organized a defense on the low-lying island in the Arickaree. Protected by hastily dug rifle pits the Forsyth and his men held out for nine days. Six scouts were killed and fifteen, including Forsyth, were injured. Scouts were sent out at night to bring help form Fort Wallace. Because his invulnerability had been damaged earlier, Roman Nose held back from the battle as he performed the rituals to restore his power. While watching the battle from a bluff he was hit by rifle fire and died from his wounds. Indian losses are unknown and the numbers disputed. The island was named in honor of Lieutenant Fred Beecher, who was killed during the engagement.

The Connect window also provided telnet, finger, ping, and traceroute functions, call cost monitoring for dialup connections, and, in earlier versions and those upgraded therefrom, Ipswitch's WS_FTP; it had up to 20 buttons which linked to these functions and any other application the user chose to configure (by default including Internet Explorer).

He was appointed by the Emperor John VIII in May 1440 as successor to Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople following the death of the latter in Florence. The Emperor was eager to secure help from Pope Eugene IV to deal with Turkish aggression, so he forced the patriarch and all other bishops to submit to papal authority. Only one bishop did not submit: Markos Eugenikos, Metropolitan of Ephesus, and without his signature the document of Union between East-West fell inactive. For his submission to the Union, he was nicknamed Mitrofonos (Mother-Killer). Metrophanes consecrated several unionist bishops and repeatedly pressed the Emperor John VIII to support the union openly. John finally agreed to summon a local council of bishops, but Metrophanes died before the council could meet. Metrophanes died in Constantinople on August 1, 1443.

An All-Big Eight guard who played collegiately at the University of Kansas, Jordan was the starting point guard during the school's 1991 and 1993 Final Four appearances. Together with shooting guard teammate Rex Walters, the two established Kansas as having one of the top backcourts in the NCAA during the 1992‚Äì93 season. He was later drafted in the 1993 NBA Draft but only appeared in only 10 career games in the league (six with the Denver Nuggets during the 1993‚Äì94 season and four with the Milwaukee Bucks during the lockout-shortened 1999 NBA season). He spent the bulk of his professional career playing overseas with various basketball clubs. Early life Adonis Jordan was born as the fourth son to Josephine Jordan in Brooklyn, New York. His mother named her son after the Greek mythological character Adonis, a handsome young man who was fabled to be the love interest of the goddess Aphrodite. She worked as a secretary for an insurance company while her son spent his time playing pick-up street basketball on Brooklyn blacktop courts. Jordan was enrolled by his mother at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, New York, across town from where she worked. Although the decision necessitated a 45-minute commute each way, she could be assured that her son would receive an education in a safer environment compared to their Brooklyn surroundings. Jordan played high school basketball at Roosevelt High and blossomed in his second year, being one of only two sophomores named to the New York All-City team. However, Jordan's stay in New York was cut short when his mother suddenly decided to relocate to California in 1987 after a two-week visit to see relatives in the state. Jordan moved from one coast to another and resettled in Los Angeles after his sophomore year in high school. He transferred to Cleveland High School in Reseda and joined future NBA veteran Lucious Harris as stars of the school's varsity basketball team. The New York native was a big factor on the Cleveland High Cavaliers' squad, playing big roles on offense (averaging 13.8 points a game) and defense (averaging 5.9 steals per game) during the 1987‚Äì88 season. At the start of his senior year, Jordan was considered by some to be one of the state's top point guards and was named among the nation's 50 top-rated high school seniors by basketball scout Bob Gibbons. He completed his final high school season averaging 24.3 points and 13.4 assists per game, leading the Cavaliers to a 23‚Äì3 record and to the quarterfinals of the City Section tournament while earning back-to-back Valley 4-A All-League First Team recognition. College career While at Cleveland High, Jordan was heavily recruited by collegiate basketball programs, including the University of Kansas. At the time, Kansas was suffering from NCAA sanctions that stemmed from recruiting violations under former coach Larry Brown. Though the scandal dissuaded other potential high school prospects from attending Kansas, Jordan nonetheless decided to take a chance with the school after he was impressed by the university's friendly and personal atmosphere. In the 1989‚Äì90 season, freshman Jordan came off the bench to back up starting Jayhawks point guard Kevin Pritchard. Together they helped lead Kansas to a surprising record of 30‚Äì5 under second- year coach Roy Williams. With Pritchard's graduation, Jordan became the starting point guard for the 1990‚Äì91 season, leading the 27‚Äì8 Kansas Jayhawks to the Final Four during his sophomore year. Jordan averaged 12.5 points and recorded 151 assists that season while the team managed three upset victories in the 1991 NCAA Tournament against Indiana (Sweet Sixteen), the Southeast Regional number one seed Arkansas (Elite Eight) and Eastern Regional number one seed North Carolina (National Semifinals) before finishing as National Runnerup to Duke in the National Championship game. Two years later, senior Jordan and teammate Rex Walters helped lead the Jayhawks to further success when they captured the 1993 Big Eight Regular Season Championship and the second seed in the Midwest Region of the 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a 25‚Äì6 record. Jordan and Walters' stellar backcourt performance earned them a reputation as one of the NCAA's best guard combinations. Kansas marched through the NCAA tournament, beating Midwest Region number one seed Indiana in the Regional Final to advance to the Final Four for the second time in three years. Though Kansas eventually finished at 29‚Äì7 with a loss to North Carolina in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance that year earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one. Jordan's legacy with Kansas is also recognized in holding the Jayhawks' number six spot for most assists in the school's history and is 22nd on the school's all-time scoring list. Professional career Jordan was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1993 NBA Draft after a storied basketball career at Kansas. Seattle ended up cutting the rookie at the start of the 1993‚Äì94 NBA season but Jordan reemerged in the league after being picked up by the Denver Nuggets later in the month on a 10-day contract. He appeared in six games with Denver before being waived again but finished the season in the CBA with the Rochester Renegades and the Sioux Falls Skyforce. The former Jayhawk headed to Australia in what would become the start of a series of overseas stints. His first stop landed him with the Australian National Basketball League's South East Melbourne Magic, where he led the team to an impressive record in 1994. After playing one season in Israel, Jordan headed to Venezuela where he joined the Cocodrilos de Caracas of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto. With five years of overseas experience, the globetrotter returned to the States and signed two 10-day contracts with the Milwaukee Bucks in early 1999. He donned a Bucks uniform in four games before ultimately being released in March. Jordan returned overseas later that same year, where he would eventually finish his professional career. He played a season with the Finnish Tapiolan Honka basketball club in 1999‚Äì2000 and returned to Australia where he retired after playing for the Victoria Giants. In 2010, Jordan returned to basketball with the Chelsea Gulls of the Big V, a Victorian basketball league.Jordan joins Chelsea Later that year, he became a coach with the Nunawading Spectres.NUNAWADING SECURE ADONIS JORDAN AS NEW DIRECTOR OF COACHING Personal life Jordan appeared in the 1994 basketball film, Blue Chips as the starting point guard for a Rick Pitino-coached college team. After retiring from basketball, Jordan accepted an offer to coach the Topeka Tornado of the short-lived semi-pro All-American Professional Basketball League in 2005. He now resides in Victoria, Australia with his daughter.

After coaching outside linebackers and punters his first three years with the Buffaloes, he was named the program's defensive coordinator in 1988.

Merrie Melodies short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on February 9, 1957, and stars Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. In 1994, it was voted #35 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. The film was edited into the Looney Tunes greatest hits features The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie in 1979 and Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales in 1982. Plot In the Arabian Desert, a rich Sultan stores his treasure in a cave and leaves his guard Hassan to watch the cave. As the Sultan leaves, a burrowing trail crosses the desert towards the cave, bumps into Hassan's sword, and enters the cave. Enraged, Hassan attempts to kill the intruders but has trouble remembering the command to open the cave's door (\\"Open sesame\\"). While he tries random words beginning with 's', Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about traveling underground and arriving at the wrong place end when he is mesmerized by the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he forces Bugs back into the burrow and eagerly indulges himself, jumping into the pile of treasure. Hassan eventually says the correct command and marches in, mistaken by Daffy as a porter. After being attacked, Daffy flees in terror and attempts to bribe Bugs into saving his life. When Bugs ignores him, Daffy urges Hassan to attack Bugs instead, but Bugs disguises himself as a genie and fools Hassan into believing the treasure is his to claim for freeing him. Unwilling to give up the treasure, Daffy steals a large gem, and Hassan chases him. Daffy begs Bugs to save him, and Bugs reluctantly complies while berating Daffy for his greed. He sets up an Indian rope trick behind a rock and misleads Hassan up the rope. As Hassan disappears into the clouds, Bugs pulls the rope down, seemingly trapping him there permanently. Daffy runs back into the cave to claim the treasure. After emptying the treasure, Daffy notices an oil lamp and polishes it. A grateful genie appears, but Daffy forces him back into the lamp, believing the genie is after the treasure. The enraged genie promises dire consequences for the duck's desecration as Bugs, unwilling and unable to save Daffy this time, hurriedly escapes via the burrow. Daffy shrugs off the genie's threats before the genie zaps him with bolts of magic. Later, in Pismo Beach, Bugs discovers Daffy's ultimate fate after finding a pearl in a clam: Daffy, shrunk to a few inches in height, claims the pearl as his own. The cartoon ends with Bugs making the clam close on the duck by saying \\"Oh, brudder. Close sesame!\\" Cast *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Hassan, Sultan and Genie Reception Linda Simensky writes, \\"Ali Baba Bunny was produced in an era where Bugs and Daffy were often paired up, and while that didn't always work, in this cartoon they seem to be formidable opponents. In the early 1950s, Daffy Duck was no longer just daffy. He had progressed to being greedy, cheap, and without a trace of empathy. When put in the right circumstances, this worked. Bugs, as paired up with Daffy, lost a little of his ability to incite conflict, being given the job of mostly reacting and politely suffering Daffy's outbursts. But in this cartoon, Bugs has his classic moments too.\\" In popular culture *During his SportsCenter tenure, Rich Eisen would occasionally use Hassan's catchphrase, \\"Hassan chop!\\", when a highlight showed a baseball player tossing his bat in disgust.http://sportscenteraltar.com/phrases/usage.asp?ID=43 See also * List of American films of 1957 References  External links  * 1957 films 1957 animated films 1957 short films 1950s American animated films 1950s animated short films Films based on Ali Baba American parody films Fairy tale parody films Genies in film Short films directed by Chuck Jones Merrie Melodies shorts Warner Bros.

It is the inaugural entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who would ultimately star in 190 short subjects for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges, employed as traveling salesmen, join the Woman Haters Club, swearing to never get romantically involved with any women. That doesn't last very long. Jim (Larry) finds an attractive woman, Mary (Marjorie White), falls in love, and has proposed marriage. Women Haters Tom (Moe) and Jack (Curly) talk him out of it. However, during the party, Mary's intimidating father threatens Jim to marry his daughter by telling him a story about his other daughter having a fiance who tried to abandon her on their wedding day. He and his brothers had roughed him up for it but also forced him to go through with the ceremony. Jim is convinced to go through the ceremony, much to the man's dismay. Later, on a train ride, the confrontation escalates between the Stooges and Mary. Mary uses her feminine charm to woo both Jack and Tom in an attempt to make Jim jealous. She sings a theme (\\"my life, my love, my all\\") with each of the Stooges in turn, as she flirts with them. Each is attracted to her charms as she proves the oath they swore as Women Haters was fraudulent (though Jack attempts to resist her). Finally, Mary tells Tom and Jack the truth, that she and Jim are married, and pushes her way into bed with the trio, knocking Tom and Jack out the train window in the process. The film closes as the Stooges, now older, finally reunite at the now almost empty Woman Haters clubhouse when Jim enters and declares he wants to rejoin. Cast * Moe Howard as Tom * Larry Fine as Jim * Curly Howard as Jackie (billed as Jerry Howard) * Marjorie White as Mary * Bud Jamison as Woman Hater's Club chairman * Monte Collins as Mr. Zero * Walter Brennan as train conductor * Jack Norton as Justice of the Peace * Fred \\"Snowflake\\" Toones as porter * A.

Specifically it is used to prevent rather than treat asthma attacks. It can be applied to the skin, inhaled, or used in the nose. Mometasone furoate, not mometasone is used in medical products. Common side effects when used for asthma include headache, sore throat, and thrush. It is therefore recommended to rinse the mouth after use. Long term use may increase the risk for glaucoma and cataracts. Common side effects when used in the nose includes upper respiratory tract infections and nose bleeds. Common side effects when applied on the skin include acne, skin atrophy, and itchiness. It works by decreasing inflammation. Mometasone furoate was patented in 1981 and came into medical use in 1987. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 197th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses Mometasone furoate is used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders (such as eczema and psoriasis) (topical form), allergic rhinitis (such as hay fever) (topical form), asthma (inhalation form) for patients unresponsive to less potent corticosteroids, and penile phimosis. In terms of steroid strength, it is more potent than hydrocortisone, and less potent than dexamethasone. Some low-quality evidence suggests the use of mometasone for symptomatic improvement in children with adenoid hypertrophy. Mometasone is used to alleviate inflammation and itchiness in skin conditions that respond to treatment with glucocorticoids such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Nasal mometasone is used in adults (including the elderly) and children over two years of age, to diminish the symptoms such as hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) and other allergies (perennial rhinitis), including nasal congestion, discharge, pruritus, and sneezing and to treat nasal polyps. It is not useful for the common cold. =Asthma= Mometasone furoate can be used with formoterol for the treatment of asthma, due to its anti-inflammatory properties.  Contraindications  People should not use inhaled mometasone or mometasone nasal spray if: * glaucoma or cataracts * hypersensitivity or allergic to any ingredient in mometasone Those who are using mometasone nasal or inhaled for a long period of time (e.g. more than three months) should get regular eye exams to check for glaucoma and cataracts and should take precautions to avoid infections such as taking a vitamin D supplement, staying away from those with an infection (chickenpox, measles, colds or flu, COVID-19), washing foods, hand washing and calling a family doctor at the first sign of a severe infection. People should not use mometasone topical (skin cream) if: * hypersensitive or allergic to any ingredient in the skin cream Mometasone furoate is in class C in terms of safety while use during pregnancy. Therefore, its risks to the baby cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the use in pregnancy is not recommended.  Side effects  The nasal spray form of mometasone may cause the following side effects: * headache *Viral upper respiratory infections * sore throat * nose bleeds * cough * muscle and joint pain Serious side effects include: Thrush (fungal infection in the nose or throat), slow wound healing, eye problems such as glaucoma or cataracts, weakened immune system (immunodeficiency) which causes an increased susceptibility to infections and adrenal insufficiency. The inhaled form of mometasone for asthma may cause the following side effects * headache * stuffy or runny nose * dry throat * swelling of nose, throat and sinuses *flu like symptoms * painful menstrual periods Serious side effects may include : allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), increased risk of osteoporosis, glaucoma and cataracts, thrush in the mouth or throat, growth retardation in children, bronchospasms, adrenal insufficiency and weakened immune system which causes an increased susceptibility to infections. The topical (skin cream) version may cause: * burning and itching at the application site *acne * changes in skin color * dryness at application site * skin sores The only serious side effect that is known with mometasone topical is adrenal insufficiency. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Mometasone furoate reduces inflammation by causing several effects: * Reversing the activation of inflammatory proteins * Activating the secretion of anti- inflammatory proteins * Stabilizing cell membranes * Decreasing the influx of inflammatory cells In addition to the glucocorticoid properties of mometasone furoate, it is a very potent agonist of the progesterone receptor as well as a partial agonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Mechanism of action Mometasone ‚Äî the metabolite of mometasone furoate. Mometasone, like other corticosteroids, possesses anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. For allergies, corticosteroids reduce the allergic reactions in various types of cells (mastocytes and eosinophils) that are responsible for allergic reactions. Mometasone and other corticosteroids circulate in the blood easily, crossing cellular membranes and binding with cytoplasmic receptors, resulting in the transcription and synthesis of proteins. It also inhibits the actions of the enzyme cytochrome P450 2C8 which participates in the activity of monooxygenase. The inflammation is reduced in decreasing the liberation of hydrolase acids of leukocytes, the prevention of the accumulation macrophages in the sites of inflammation, the interference with adhesion of leukocytes to capillary walls, the reduction of the permeability of the capillary membranes and consequently edema, the reduction of complementary components, inhibition of histamine and kinin liberation, and interference with scar tissue formation. The proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen deposits is also reduced. It is believed that the action of corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agents is bound to inhibitive proteins of phospholipase A2, collectively called lipocortins. The lipocortins, in turn, control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, inhibiting the liberation of the molecular precursors of arachidonic acid. Intranasal mometasone alleviates symptoms such as rhinorrhea aquosa, nasal congestion, nasal drip, sneezing, and pharyngeal itching. Topical administration applied to skin reduces the inflammation associated with chronic or acute dermatosis. Although mometasone furoate does not have significant systemic immunomodulatory effects, it can be considered a local immunosuppressive drug because clinical studies have shown reductions (vs. baseline ) in neutrophils (a white blood cell) in the nasal mucosa. It could be also considered an antihistamine along with its glucocorticoid effects because it significantly reduces histamine and eosinophil cationic protein levels. =Pharmacokinetics= Metabolism Extensive metabolic hepatic metabolism of mometasone furoate to multiple metabolites occurs. No principal metabolites are detectable in plasma. After in vitro incubation, one of the minor metabolites formed is furoate 6Œ≤-hydroxymometasone. In human hepatic microsomes, the formation of these metabolites is regulated by CYP3A4. =Mometasone= Mometasone by itself is a synthetic, steroidal glucocorticoid or corticosteroid that was never marketed. The C17Œ± furoate ester of mometasone, is the marketed medication. Mometasone furoate acts as a prodrug of mometasone. In addition to its glucocorticoid activity, mometasone also has very potent progestogenic activity and acts as a partial agonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Society and culture =Brand names= As of 2016 mometasone furoate was available worldwide in formulations for nasal, oral inhalation, and topical administration, for human and for veterinary use, and in combinations with other drugs, under many brand names.

Then the Emperor's advisors came up with a better plan to remove him from office without causing a rebellion. During a meeting with other bishops, Bishop Basil accused Tryphon of being illiterate, and the Patriarch protested that he was not. Bishop Basil had an Imperial agent ask him to prove that by signing his name on a blank paper, Tryphon signed the blank paper and then Bishop Basil sent the paper to the Palace where the Imperial Clerks wrote the document of his resignation on the blank paper with Tryphon's signature.

It was donated to the state by Adile Sultan to be used as a school building for the Kandilli Anatolian High School for Girls and is today a cultural center. It is located in the Kandilli neighbourhood of Istanbul, Turkey.  History  The palace was built for the Ottoman princess Adile Sultan (1826‚Äì1899), the daughter of Sultan Mahmud II (1789‚Äì1839) and the sister of the Sultans Abd√ºlmecid I (1823‚Äì1861) and Abd√ºlaziz (1830‚Äì1876), and designed by the court architect Sarkis Balyan. It was erected on the same place of a kiosk, which was presented to her by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid in 1856. The palace was commissioned by Sultan Abd√ºlaziz and built by Balyan in 1861. It stands at one of the most prominent places in Istanbul, upon a hill, which is a headland in the middle of Bosphorus on the Asian shore. This location enables a panoramic view of Bosphorus, reaching from the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, seen out of all the rooms in three sides of the building. The palace with has 55 rooms and is on a ground of 17,000 m¬≤. Adile Sultan, a great and the only Turkish royal female poet having a Diwan, lived here until the death of her husband Mehmet Ali Pasha in 1868. She donated her residence to the state to be used as a high school for girls after her death in February 1899. Before it was used as determined, the palace came a short while under the control of Ministry of War during World War I. Only in 1916 was the building turned into a secondary school for girls, the Adile Sultan ƒ∞nas Mekteb-i Sultanisi (\\"Adile Sultan Imperial Girls School\\"), and the first graduates left the school in 1920. The school was named 1924 after its location, Kandilli Secondary School. In 1931, the school became the Kandilli High School for Girls, a respected educational institution since then. The classes of the high school moved to a new building in 1969. The old palace was used as dormitory for boarding girls of the school until 1986, when it was burned down due to an electrical short-circuit. The historic building became a ruin consisting of only four walls. Some alumni of Kandilli High School established soon a foundation, and raised funds to rebuild the palace. However, the cost of the restoration exceeded their extent. With the huge financial support of the late billionaire businessman and philanthropist Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± and the Governor of Istanbul Muammer G√ºler, the restoration work could continue. The lacking funds to accomplish the long-lasting and painstaking restoration works were donated again by Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± in his sickbed three days before his death in 2004. Adile Sultan Palace was rebuilt in ten years at a cost of 9.5 million YTL, and it revived after twenty years by reopening with a ceremony, which took place on June 28, 2006. The building is named \\"Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± Kandilli Education and Culture Center\\". The palace covers an area of 5,625 m¬≤, which accommodates an oval hall for meeting and banqueting of 500 people, another two meeting halls for 200 people each, a 1,300 m¬≤ hall for cocktails and exhibitions, 20 seminar rooms with 30-40 seats, a museum, a dining hall for 150 people and a cafeteria for 60 people.

Largo Canyon area, New Mexico. Din√©tah is the traditional homeland of the Navajo tribe of Native Americans. In the Navajo language, the word means \\"among the people\\" or \\"among the Navajo\\" (din√© is the Navajo word that refers to the Navajo people; it also means \\"people\\" in the generic sense; ' means \\"among, through, in the area of\\"). In the geographical sense, Din√©tah encompasses a large area of northwestern New Mexico, southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, and northeastern Arizona. The boundaries are inexact, and are generally marked by mountain peaks which correspond to the four cardinal directions.  Geography and topography  The Din√©tah region is marked by high mesas and deep canyons that drain to the San Juan River. The canyons of the area are composed of irregular layers of sandstone, marked by multiple benches and talus slopes. Elevations average approximately 5,000 to 6,500 feet, with a few mountain peaks rising to more than 14,000 feet. The traditional boundary of the land is demarcated by four mountains: Blanca Peak (Sis NaajinƒØÃÅ), to the east, Mount Taylor (Tsoodzil), to the south, the San Francisco Peaks (Dook'o'ooshƒØÃÅƒØÃÅ), to the west, and Hesperus Peak, (Dib√© Nitsaa), to the north.Iverson, 2002  Cultural overview  The Navajo regard Din√©tah as their ancestral homeland. The traditional Navajo creation story centers on the area, and Navajo place names within the region reflect its role in Navajo mythology. While Din√©tah generally refers to a large geographical area, the heart of the region is regarded to be the canyons of the Largo and Carrizo washes, south of the San Juan River in New Mexico. These canyons are located to the east and south of Farmington, New Mexico, and include Blanco, Largo, Carrizo and Gobernador Canyons. The cultural significance of Din√©tah is documented throughout Navajo oral history, and is supported by numerous archaeological and rock art sites. According to Navajo tradition, the infant Changing Woman (), one of the best known Navajo deities, was found by the Holy People () on top of Gobernador Knob (), located within Din√©tah area. The region is also indicated as the place to which the first four Navajo clans arrived after their migration from the western ocean.  Archaeological sites  Frances Canyon Pueblito is a multi-roomed structure situated at the edge of a cliff in northwestern New Mexico. There are thousands of recorded archaeological sites within the Din√©tah region. The sites include the remains of several cultures, including the Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the Anasazi), the Navajo, and early Hispanic settlers. The naturally dry conditions of the region have contributed to a generally good state of preservation for a variety of site types, which include structures of stone and wood, as well as pictograph and petroglyph sites. The most visible archaeological sites are known as Navajo pueblitos. These sites are usually stone structures consisting of from one to six rooms. The pueblitos are thought to date to the end of the 17th century, and appear to be largely defensive in nature. Pueblitos take the form of multi-storied towers, fort- like enclosures, and cliff dwellings. Several pueblitos are included on the List of Registered Historic Places in New Mexico.  History  There is increasing evidence for Navajo presence in Din√©tah as early as 1500 CE. While there is continuing debate as to the dating of Navajo sites in the area, it is generally agreed that they inhabited Din√©tah at some point well before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The Navajo occupation of the region has been divided by archaeologists into two major phases - the Din√©tah phase (ca. 1500-1630), which includes the entrance and settling of the area by the Navajo, and the Gobernador phase (ca. 1630-1800), during which time the Navajo culture became fully defined. The difference between the two phases has been based on the recovery of Gobernador Polychrome ceramic shards from reliably dated sites, and the presence of pueblitos. In response to pressures from the Spanish and Utes, the Navajo population began moving toward the south and west around 1750. By about 1800 they had abandoned or left the heartland of the Din√©tah region.

Walter Norblad, member of the United States House of Representatives from Oregon's 1st Congressional District from 1946 to 1964. Family and early life Norblad was born in 1881 in Malm√∂ (which was located in the Swedish-Norwegian Union at the time of his birth). His parents were Peter and Bessie Youngsberg. The family's last name was changed by the Swedish Government to avoid confusion in military records. The family emigrated to the United States while Albin was very young, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan. At age 12, Albin decided to support himself, mostly by means of odd jobs. He would later recount that the most notable jobs held during this time were newsboy, hot dog vendor, and clarinetist for the circus. He managed to earn enough money to return to Grand Rapids, taking night classes at the Grand Rapids Business College. After earning enough credits there, Norblad was able enroll at the University of Chicago Law School, supporting himself as a reporter for the Chicago American newspaper's crime beat. Graduating in 1902, he quickly passed the bar exam and moved back to Michigan. Once in Michigan, he set up a law firm, and was elected District Attorney for Delta County. Early political career While visiting Oregon on business in 1908, Norblad met with an old friend who invited him to live in Astoria. He accepted, and moved with his wife, Edna Lyle Cates Norblad, in 1909. He began practicing law, and became involved in the community. His first government office in Oregon was as Astoria's city attorney from 1910‚Äì1915. He would also become a member of the local school board, and President of the Astoria Chamber of Commerce. Outside politics Norblad was involved in many fraternal and civic organizations. With a prominent local political profile, Norblad went on to run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate in 1918, and served in the Senate starting in 1919. Re-elected in 1920, he attempted an abortive run for Oregon's At-large U.S. House seat in 1922. He was succeeded in the Senate by W.S. Kinney in 1923, but won re-election to the seat in 1926. He served as President of the Oregon State Senate in 1929, placing him as second in the state's then-official line of gubernatorial succession. Governorship The death of sitting Governor Isaac Patterson on December 21, 1929, came as a shock to Oregonians. The governor had apparently been recovering since contracting pneumonia late in his third year in office. Thus Senate President Albin Norblad was sworn in promptly as governor. As soon as he was inaugurated, he declared his intent to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Taking office during the Great Depression, Norblad's first attempts to improve conditions in the state were largely ineffective. Lacking a political identity statewide, and considered a progressive by conservative elements in control of the state Republican party, Norblad was defeated in his primary bid in May 1930, coming in second place. When the winner of the primary unexpectedly died a month later, Norblad took his name out of the running for the nomination, giving the Republican state central committee his blessing to choose a new candidate. Freed from having to contest an election, Norblad began focusing his attention on the economic situation in the state. He formed the state's first labor commission, later to become the modern Employment Department. In order to put men back to work, he authorized $2 million worth of road construction, and succeeded in employing 5,000 workers. The Oregon Coast Highway was begun under his leadership. Another $3 million was spent upgrading publicly owned facilities around the state. The Governor also took a personal role in pardons and labor disputes. A Pardons Board was established, and Norblad even interviewed pardon-seeking inmates in- person. In matters involving the rest of the nation, Norblad accepted federal help in solving a long-simmering dispute between Eastern Oregon's cattle and sheep ranchers. The Governor indicated his support for the pending military draft legislation working its way through Congress. He also argued for the state's acquisition of federally owned forest land. Defeated in his primary bid by George W. Joseph, who died prior to the general election, Governor Norblad handed office to the victor of the 1930 gubernatorial election, independent Julius L. Meier.Albin Walter Norblad (Oregon State Library) Later life Norblad went back to practicing law in Astoria, once again becoming closely involved in the community. He founded the Lower Columbia Association of Chambers of Commerce, and gained a $10,000 grant from the descendants of John Jacob Astor for use in the Astoria Sesquicentennial Celebration. Norblad continued his practice and civic activities in Astoria until his death on April 17, 1960. He is buried with his wife, Edna, in Rose City Cemetery, Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon.

In 1896, Kremmerz founded the Confraternita Terapeutica e Magica di Myriam (Therapeutic and Magic Brotherhood of Myriam).  Biography  J.M. KREMM-ERZ, simplified as Giuliano Kremmerz, is the name of Ciro Formisano, born in Portici, near Naples, on 8 April 1861. He was a philosopher, therapeutist and thaumaturgist, and founded the S.P.H.C.I (Schola Philosophica Hermetica Classica Italica) Fratellanza Terapeutica Magica di Miriam, with exclusively therapeutic aims for the benefit of all, and still in operation today through some filiations that inherited the doctrinal and ritual patrimony of the school. Ciro Formisano soon made contact with Pasquale De Servis, known to scholars of magic hermeticism of that time as IZAR and in linked to the Italic roots of initiatory tradition ‚Äì the tradition that, prior to Christianity, had flourished in Magna Graecia in the Pythagorean School, which had taken in the Isiacal and Osirian cults from Egypt. Virtually buried under the effects of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 BC, this tradition had later attempted to re- emerge in various forms, disguised in the works and thoughts of some of the greatest names in culture and medicine, such as Dante and the Fedeli d‚ÄôAmore the Brotherhood of the Faithful in Love, Cecco D'Ascoli, Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino (Marsilius Ficinus), Giordano Bruno, Cornelio Agrippa, and Paracelsus, all the way through to Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero, and to the Count of Cagliostro in the eighteenth century and, in more recent times, to the esoteric currents in the Italian Risorgimento. On the basis of what Kremmerz himself states, it was De Servis who initiated the young Ciro Formisano to the mysteries of the Sacred Science, recognising in him the constituent characteristics of a master of hermeticism, combined with a great humanitarian, tolerant and generous nature. Ciro Formisano graduated in the Humanities and, after a brief experience as a teacher and then as a journalist, he departed on a mysterious voyage to Montevideo, where it is said he made contact with the shamanic cultures of Latin America. It is not impossible that the idea of Formisano‚Äôs journey had come from De Servis (Izar) himself for, protected by his anonymity, he controlled much of the Italic and neo-Egyptian hermetic initiatory tradition of that time. In 1887, when he had adopted the pseudonym of Giuliano Kremmerz, Ciro Formisano started to disclose the first elements of natural and divine magic through the journal Il Mondo Secreto. At the same time, he started up the SPHCI, binding it to therapeutic ends carried out by means of ‚Äúdistance medicine‚Äù for the sick. The form and substance he outlined for the Schola has remained unchanged to this day and has statutory form in the 60 paragraphs of the Pragmatica Fondamentale of the S.P.H.C.I Fratellanza Terapeutica Magica di Miriam. The works of Kremmerz laid the foundations for carrying the initiatory tradition into the new millennium, taking it back to the archetype ‚Äì which, over the centuries, had become confused ‚Äì of the feminine form of the mystery tradition. It was on this archetype that he modelled the Schola, introducing instructions and practices designed to train disciples in the exercise of selfless good and to develop latent powers within them. It must also be said that Kremmerz‚Äôs work of promulgation came up against a number of obstacles, some of which came from the esoteric world itself, from areas still bound by a conservative and elitist vision of ancient wisdom and its transmission.  Thought and word  The basis of the philosophical ideas of Giuliano Kremmerz is ¬´ sacred materialism ¬ª, which should not be confused with the depreciatory meaning given to the word ‚Äúmaterialism‚Äù as much by economic doctrines as by a particular vision of the philosophy of science. Kremmerz‚Äôs ‚Äúsacred materialism‚Äù is based on the idea of the unity of all that exists, which means there can be no separation between spirit and matter. On the contrary, it is precisely towards the full integration of the two apparently opposite poles (in other words, intelligent origin and material manifestation) that the evolutionary path of man is directed. This integration is conscious and, especially, concrete in terms of the effects it can have on the living matter of the human being. It is the ultimate goal of hermetic philosophy and of the practices it aims to accomplish. It is also the goal of the Schola founded by Kremmerz. The achievement of this goal is symbolised as ‚Äúmatriarchy‚Äù, in which the term is not used in its more usual, social meaning. ¬´ Matriarchy ¬ª, comes from the union of two words ‚Äúmeter‚Äù, or ‚Äúmother‚Äù, ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù, which has the same root as ‚Äúmatter‚Äù ‚Äì and ‚Äúarch√©‚Äù, or ‚Äúcommencement‚Äù, ‚Äúorigin‚Äù, ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù. Within the vision of the unity of existence, as proposed by Kremmerz, the dualism of spirit and matter has no reason to exist. Kremmerz states that ‚Äúhermetic reality‚Äù is to be found in the balance between free intelligence and the sensitivity of the organism, and that the predominance of one or the other always leads to a state of imbalance that leads away from fundamental unity. In the equilibrium of the hermetic vision, the idea that creates (in other words, the intelligent spirit) cannot do without the substance (matter) through which the idea itself takes form. Album Numen Lumen, by Italian neofolk band Hautville featuring Klemmerz's sentences, was dedicated to his memory.

During the Rigvedic period, they formed a warrior society, engaging in endemic warfare and cattle raids (\\"\\") among themselves and against their enemies, the \\"Dasyu\\" or Dasa.

List of clans  # Alina people (RV 7.18.7) - They were probably one of the clans defeated by Sudas at the Dasarajna, and it has been suggested that they lived to the north-east of Nurestan, because much later, in the 7th century CE, the land was mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang. #Anu is a Vedic Sanskrit term for one of the 5 major clans in the Rigveda, RV 1.108.8, RV 8.10.5 (both times listed together with the Druhyu) and, much later also in the Mahabharata.Talageri, S. G. (2005). The Rigveda as a source of Indo-European history. The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and Inference in Indian History, 332. In the late Vedic period, one of the Anu kings, King Anga, is mentioned as a \\"chakravartin\\" (AB 8.22). ƒÄnava, the vrddhi derivation of Anu, is the name of a ruler in the Rigvedic account of the Battle of the Ten Kings (7.18.13) and at 8.4.1 with the Turva≈õa (clan). The meaning √°nu \\"living, human\\" (Naighantu) cannot be substantiated for the Rigveda Mayrhofer, Etym. Dict. 1986, pt. 1, p. 74 and may have been derived from the tribal name. #ƒÄyuBloomfield, M.

Some scholars have argued that the Bhalanas lived in Kabulistan, and that the Bolan Pass derives its name from the Bhalanas. #Bharatas - The Bharatas are an Aryan clan mentioned in the Rigveda, especially in Mandala 3 attributed to the Bharata sage Vishvamitra and in and Mandala 7.Frawley, D.

Bharat√° is also used as a name of Agni (literally, \\"to be maintained\\", viz. the fire having to be kept alive by the care of men), and as a name of Rudra in RV 2.36.8. In one of the \\"river hymns\\" RV 3.33, the entire Bharata clan is described as crossing over, with their chariots and wagons, at the confluence of the Vipash (Beas) and Shutudri (Satlej). Hymns by Vasistha in Mandala 7 (7.18 etc.) mention the Bharatas as the protagonists in the Battle of the Ten Kings, where they are on the winning side. They appear to have been successful in the early power-struggles between the various Aryan and non-Aryan clans so that they continue to dominate in post-Rigvedic texts, and later in the (Epic) tradition, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the eponymous ancestor becomes Bharata Chakravartin, conqueror of 'all of India', and his clan and kingdom is called BhƒÅrata. \\"BhƒÅrata\\" today is the official name of the Republic of India (see also Etymology of India). #BhrigusWeller, H.

Recently, some writersTalageri 2000 have ahistorically asserted that the Druhyu are the ancestors of the Iranian, Greek or European peoples, or of the Celtic Druid class.Sanskrit in English The word Druid (Gallic Celtic druides), however, is derived from Proto-Indo-European *weyd- \\"to see, to know' F.

The National Cooperative Soil Survey Program (NCSS) in the United States is a nationwide partnership of federal, regional, state, and local agencies and institutions. This partnership works together to cooperatively investigate, inventory, document, classify, and interpret soils and to disseminate, publish, and promote the use of information about the soils of the United States and its trust territories. The activities of the NCSS are carried out on national, regional, and state levels.  Overview  The National Cooperative Soil Survey Program (NCSS) is a partnership led by the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service of Federal land management agencies, state agricultural experiment stations, counties, conservation districts, and other special-purpose districts that provide soil survey information necessary for understanding, managing, conserving and sustaining the nation's soil resources. It seeks to inventory soil resources as a basis for determining land capabilities and needed conservation treatments, to provide soil information to the public (primarily through maps), and to provide technical support to those who use soil information. More than 90% of private lands have been mapped. In FY2001, maps were prepared or updated on , including 25 counties or areas for the first time.  History  While the National Cooperative Soil Survey has involved multiple partners since its inception in 1896, Federal responsibility for coordinating partner efforts has resided within the USDA. However, soil survey responsibilities have moved several times within the USDA: * 1894 Division of Agricultural Soil within the USDA Weather Bureau. * 1899 Name changed to Division of Soils. * 1901 Division moved up in status to Bureau of Soils. * 1927 Merged with the Bureau of Chemistry, forming the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. * 1938 Soils unit transferred to the Bureau of Plant Industry. * 1942 Changed name to Bureau of Plant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural Engineering, becoming part of the Agricultural Research Administration. * 1952 Soil survey program transferred to the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). * 1994 Name changed to Natural Resources Conservation Service. as depicted in = Early history = The original federal authority for the soil survey of the United States is contained in the record of the 53rd Congress, chapter 169, Agricultural Appropriations Act of 1896. Milton Whitney was the first Chief of the Division of Agricultural Soil. The division was created under the USDA Weather Bureau in 1894, but, with the inception of National Cooperative Soil Survey efforts, became the Division of Soils as an independent division within the Department of Agriculture. The early vision of soil survey was a survey that combined geography with soil chemistry. The men conducting the surveys were geologists or chemists; none had training in agronomy.Realizing the deficiencies in training of his personnel, Whitney, in 1903, arranged with Cornell University for detailing J. A. Bonsteel to that institution as Professor of Soil Investigations. There, for two years, Bonsteel, representing the Bureau, developed a course in soil science and soil surveying. Source: . Lapham was on active field service in the USDA Soil Survey 1899‚Äì1944, and correlator 1944‚Äì1949.. This article is a reprint of the original paper: Lee WD. 1984. The early history of soil survey in North Carolina. Raleigh (NC): Soil Science Society of North Carolina. 28 p. On May 3, 1899, with an appropriation of $16,000 Whitney began field operations. In four separate soil surveys about were mapped that first year. Cecil County, Maryland, and Connecticut Valley, Connecticut, concentrated on tobacco lands. Survey of the Salt Lake Valley of Utah and the Pecos River Valley of New Mexico concentrated on alkali soil areas where irrigation and land reclamation projects were planned. Soil surveys focused on cropland or interpretations for cropland until the 1970s when the scope of the NCSS was expanded to focus on urban lands. Of the four survey areas initiated in 1899, three were published the next year. These first surveys cost about 3/10ths of a cent per acre. , soil surveys cost about $3/acre. Soil texture was the main differentiating soil characteristic used in the early survey process. Soil series were soon to follow as groupings of soil types. By 1906 Miami soil series included 16 soil types from the glaciated regions and Norfolk series included 12 soil types from the coastal plains. Several other characteristics were added by that time. They were soil color, organic content, soil structure, drainage, erodibility, and nature of subsoil. Soil provinces were established and soil series were confined to their area. Series at first were identified where the soils formed from the same accumulated parent material: glaciated, wind blown, alluvial etc. Geological Survey maps were generally unavailable and early soil surveyors used the plane table and alidade to develop their own base maps. Work for soil surveys was done at a mapping scale 1 inch to the mile. Scale is pretty well standardized at 1:12000 or 1:24000. Six different scales have been used in published soil surveys. In 1913 Curtis F. Marbut was appointed Scientist in Charge of the Soil Survey, the position he held almost until his death. Marbut was Professor of Geology and Physiography at the University of Missouri from 1895 until 1910. As a geologist and geographer his initial view was that soils were surface reflections of the geology below them. Marbut changed to recognize soil science as distinct from geology. Eugene W. Hilgard of the University of California and Hopkins of the University of Illinois greatly influenced this change. The land-grant universities from the very start were close partners in National Cooperative Soil Survey. By 1920, most soil surveyors were graduates of land-grant universities and other agricultural colleges with training in soils and crops. The recognition of soil science as a distinct discipline was also influenced by the Russian school of soil science and K.D. Glinka (1867‚Äì1927) in particular. These soil scientists characterized soils based on soil horizons of the soil profile. This recognized soils more on natural boundaries. Previously the soil was divided into sections by 6 inch increments to depth. Depths used were 0 to 7, 7 to 13, 13 to 20, 20 to 27, 27 to 34, 34 to . Forty inches was the depth of observation for a number of years, then later it was extended to and subsequently to 2 meters. In 1920 Marbut began his work on a soil classification scheme. In 1927 he published a translation of Glinka's The Great Soil Groups of the World and their Development from German to English. His classification scheme became the 1935 system that was modified to become the system published in the 1938 Yearbook of Agriculture, Soils and Men: the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy. At the highest level of classification the soils were divided into pedocals and pedalfers. Pedocals were used in the drier climates and referred to the carbonate rich soils. The Pedalfers began about at the Udic border and referred to soils rich in Aluminum (Alumen) and Iron (Ferrous). Alfer became the root term for Alfisols. Following 1938, classifying soil series according to the system met with mixed success. By 1945 the development of a new system began. The first version, termed an \\"approximation\\" was tested by the 1948. A series of approximations followed and the 7th approximation came out in 1960. The supplement to the 7th approximation was approved for use in 1965. USDA soil taxonomy, with 10 soil orders came out in 1975. It was revised into the 2nd edition with 12 soil orders in 1999. In 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Soil Erosion Service under the Department of the Interior. Hugh Hammond Bennett, after a 30-year career with the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, was first chief and within 2 years the Soil Erosion Service moved to Department of Agriculture as the Soil Conservation Service. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) ended up with much of the budget and soils personnel of the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, but did not support the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils approach to soil survey. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) pushed farm by farm surveys using a utilitarian legend. The symbol indicated the soil properties. These symbols and surveys continued until the 1970s. Conflict existed between the SCS and the other partners within the NCSS during the 20 years from 1933 to 1952. Marbut did not feel that soil erosion threatened the food supply of the United States and wrote that to the National Academy of Science, in direct opposition to Bennett. Marbut died in 1935 on a trip to China. Charles Kellogg, a professor of soil science at North Dakota State University, became the new Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. He produced the Soil Survey Manual of 1937 that gave direction on the procedure for soil survey to be used by both Bureau of Chemistry and Soils and SCS soil surveys. During the Great Depression, the soil survey efforts slowed. The Bureau continued it soil survey efforts but with reduced funding. The SCS was put in charge of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) involving a massive workforce to build terraces and other demonstrations on agricultural lands. As a result, highly specialized studies, such as soil surveys, were limited. In 1942, the CCC was disbanded and SCS revived its soil survey efforts Hugh Bennett promoted local interest and input in soil conservation. To achieve this, Bennett pushed for soil districts in each state. Each district board, made up of elected local landowners and farmers, determines the issues and concerns for their area, usually a county, with the SCS providing requested technical assistance. by the 1940s, most states had passed laws to form Soil Conservation Districts. In some states, like Indiana, Conservation Districts became dissatisfied with Federal technical involvement and SCS was excluded from the state. Consistent with this, states like Indiana directed their own cooperative soil survey efforts. In some states like Missouri, the newly formed districts, relying on SCS technical assistance, ignored scientific data and input from the universities, which responded by opposing the formation of additional districts. This was resolved by the expansion of the Cooperative Extension Service. It is now typical for all counties have a Conservation District, and a University Extension agent. Both Conservation Districts and Cooperative Extension are partners in the National Cooperative Soil Survey. In 1951, the SCS developed the Land Capability System. By using factors such as flooding frequency, slope, rockiness and clay or sand content, the best use for the soil can be estimated. National Cooperative Soil Survey standards assure the soil survey data is consistent with the Land Capability Classification System. During the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration much of the Department of Agriculture was reorganized. In 1952, all soil survey work by the USDA was consolidated and responsibility for Federal leadership in the National Cooperative Soil Survey partnership was given to the SCS. This included all mapping, classification, interpretation, laboratory services, map compilation and nationwide publication. The Bureau was then abolished and Kellogg became head of the USDA soil survey program. After being assigned the responsibility of the entire soil survey program, the SCS shifted from making individual conservation plan soil surveys and land use maps to making complete county soil surveys. This reorganization did not set well with some universities and individuals that had been involved in the soil survey program up to that point. From 1899 until this time a number of agencies, both state and federal, had financial support to perform soil survey work. The consolidation of soil survey activities (and funding) into the SCS program was a hard pill for many to swallow.

If more than one language has developed from the same proto-language, or 'mother language', those languages are said to be sister languages, members of the same language family. These concepts are linked to the tree model of language evolution, in which the relationships between languages are compared with those between members of a family tree. This model captures the diversification of languages from a common source. Strictly speaking, the metaphor of the mother-daughter relationship can lead to a misconceptualization of language history, as daughter languages are direct continuations of the mother language, which have become distinct by a process of gradual change; the languages are not separate entities \\"born\\" to a parent who eventually dies.

Less formally he was usually called Sheridan Dufferin. Childhood and inheritance Born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family from Ulster, he was the youngest child and only son of The 4th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and his wife, Maureen Guinness (daughter of The Honourable Arthur Ernest Guinness, second son of the 1st Earl of Iveagh). One of his sisters was the novelist Lady Caroline Blackwood. Named after his playwright ancestor Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Lord Dufferin was known by his father's courtesy title Earl of Ava until he succeeded his father in the marquessate in 1945, when he was only six years old. When he was aged 12, trustees acting in his name sold Clandeboye, his ancestral seat, to his estates company for ¬£120,000 in order \\"to maintain his station in life\\", as the trustees allegedly said at the time. After attending the day school Garth House in Bangor, County Down, he went to Eton College. After Eton he attended Christ Church, Oxford. A keen shot and sportsman, he played championship tennis at the Queen's Club, but it was at Oxford that he developed a passion for the arts. Patron of the arts After Oxford he met and went into partnership with John Kasmin, and opened the Kasmin Gallery on New Bond Street, London in 1963. The Kasmin was a radical gallery for the time and showed British and American abstract and pop art. The gallery was described as \\"a beautiful space in New Bond Street designed for them by Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, with a curiously shaped white ceiling, white walls and a green-khaki rubberised floor. It was a space described by Kasmin as 'a machine for looking at pictures in'; those pictures, moreover, were prototypes of the new art. They looked as if they had been painted to be seen in museums: the space was designed for canvasses six feet square and upwards that would readily carry across a large room. The gallery thereby affirmed that painting had changed fundamentally: it was no longer being made to fit into drawing-rooms.\\" Among the artists the gallery showed were Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Anthony Caro and most famously of all David Hockney. The Kasmin Gallery closed in 1972, with Kasmin going on to work in partnership with other London dealers up to the 1990s. Lord Dufferin was appointed a trustee of the Wallace Collection in 1973, and was also a trustee of the National Gallery, London and continued to support up-and-coming contemporary British artists. He also helped in the making of films about the pianist Liberace and the Playboy entrepreneur Hugh Hefner, as well as backing the controversial 1976 film Sebastiane, directed by the British filmmaker Derek Jarman. He was also a sometime director of the Guinness company, being a great-grandson of Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh. Personal life Although he was homosexual, in 1964 Lord Dufferin married his fourth cousin Lindy Guinness. Their wedding was at Westminster Abbey where 1,800 guests attended, including Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon. Lady Dufferin was also passionate about art and together they were at centre of the trendy art scene in late 1960s London. Parties at their house in Holland Park \\"were legendary in the late 1960s. You would find yourself talking to Princess Margaret or Duncan Grant and Angelica Garnett, or Francis Bacon or Stephen Spender or the Queen Mother.\\" Legacy Lord Dufferin died on 29 May 1988 from an AIDS-related illness, aged 49. As there were no other living descendants in the direct male line from the 1st Marquess, the marquessate and the other peerages created for the 1st Marquess in the Peerage of the United Kingdom became extinct. The Barony of Dufferin and Claneboye, the family's older title in the Peerage of Ireland, passed to a distant kinsman. His sister married Robert Lowell in 1972, and they named their son Sheridan after his uncle. In the years immediately before, and especially after, her husband's death, Lady Dufferin developed new initiatives at Clandeboye, and today the estate has associations with a number of environmental organisations and projects, being a home for Conservation Volunteers Northern Ireland's biodiversity projects, training centre and tree nursery (in the old walled garden). The Northern Ireland branch of the Woodland Trust was established in 1998 in partnership with the Dufferin Foundation, and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew have developed a blossoming relationship with Clandeboye since 2003. Lady Dufferin also returned to the art world, and has exhibited in galleries in London and New York under the name Lindy Guinness. She was also the inspiration behind the opening of the Ava Gallery at Clandeboye in 2004, which exhibits works by leading contemporary Northern Irish artists and an annual exhibition of museum- standard work by a major artist or group of artists.

It is owned and operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as an Illinois State Historic Site. City hall and public market The Old Market House was built by the city of Galena to serve as a city hall and enclosed public farmer's market. A rapid increase in population in the Galena area in the 1830s and 1840s, largely a result of the discovery of galena, a kind of lead ore found in the region, had led to a sharp increase in demand for local foodstuffs. The Old Market House's business plan called for the US$50 per year rents from the twelve enclosed farmer's market stalls to help maintain the building. The $2,500 used for initial construction was obtained through the sale of $5 per share stocks, which was enabled by an 1845 act of the Galena City Council.Campbell, Thomas A., Jr. \\"Old Market House,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form, July 16, 1973, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, pp. 1-5. Sellers who could not rent a stall were allocated space in the market square just outside the building. Cars and grocery stores The Old Market House continued to serve the people of Galena until about 1910. As an increasing percentage of local citizens bought motor vehicles, households began to \\"shop around\\" for foodstuffs. Local grocery stores, which paid property taxes to the city of Galena, were not interested in helping to maintain their competitors. In about 1910 the stalls of the Old Market House went out of business. The city of Galena moved its offices elsewhere in 1938, making the old building redundant. It was given to the state of Illinois in 1947. A frontier community The Old Market House was extensively rebuilt and restored in 1954 to repair growing deterioration. It has been refitted by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency to serve as a visitor services information desk and museum of local social history.

The film experienced a brief theatrical release and was poorly received by critics. In the United Kingdom, the film was released under the title Party Stooge. Victoria Jackson played a nurse at the fictional Stooge Hills. Additionally, the local arcade owner is played by Paul \\"Mousie\\" Garner, who was one of Ted Healy's stooges and a member of the \\"New Three Stooges\\" in the 1970s.  Plot  The film centers on Howard F. Howard (Josh Mostel), a Three Stooges fan. He is engaged to the woman he loves (Melanie Chartoff), and life seems to be going well. More recently, he has been starting to see the Stooges wherever he goes. To save his life and his relationship, he seeks the help of a renowned Stooge psychologist (Sid Caesar). However, his illness is part of a very serious epidemic which has apparently swept the nation. The doctor gives him medicine, which is the wrong one and is a sleeping pill. To his dismay, Howard still sees the Stooges everywhere. He ends up going to \\"Stooge Row\\", a seedy part of Los Angeles located between the fictional \\"Shet Up St.\\" and \\"Nyuk Nyuk Blvd.\\" To combat this, a sanitarium known as Stooge Hills is created. While in an all-Stooge burlesque house, members of Stooge Hills (including James Avery) commit everyone in there to the sanitarium. Over a rigorous program, everyone is deemed cured. During the graduation ceremony, to prove that the Three Stooges are no longer funny, they play a few shorts. However, everyone comes to terms and realize \\"we love these guys\\". Howard marries his sweetheart, and the film ends on a happy note.  Production  Stoogemania was made in an attempt to cash in on The Three Stooges' resurgence in popularity during the 1980s, thanks to syndication and Jump N the Saddle Band's hit novelty song, \\"The Curly Shuffle\\". The film was not endorsed by Columbia Pictures or the Three Stooges trademark holders. Only four shorts are shown throughout the film, all of which are in the public domain: Sing a Song of Six Pants, Malice in the Palace, Brideless Groom, and Disorder in the Court.

The winning crew gets to go home with their car, as well as the car of the losing team. Each episode of the 30-minute show would follow the two teams as they took their cars from the planning stage to completion. Various situations, both positive and negative, would be highlighted, such as bad paint jobs, incomplete features, and insight into the creation of different features for the cars. The tournament featured 8 teams from car modification shops in Southern California. Each round offered different rules for the contestants to follow. * Round one, the quarterfinals, allowed teams to choose their own themes for their cars. * Round two, the semifinals, had de Vera choose the theme for each contest.  In episode one of the semifinals, de Vera had the teams stick to a \\"secret agent\\" theme.  In episode two of the semifinals, de Vera had the teams stick to an \\"ultimate gaming\\" theme. * Round three, the finals, de Vera gave the teams new cars, both the 2006 Honda Civic EX Coupe, and gave them the theme of \\"car of the future\\".

The line and station were opened on 1 June 1889 for goods and on 1 October 1889 for passenger services by the Great Eastern Railway. The station was originally named Woodham Ferris; this was changed to Woodham Ferrers on 1 October 1913, and to South Woodham Ferrers on 20 May 2007. The station had two platforms connected by a footbridge; a goods yard; and a 36-lever signal box. The goods yard closed in 1964. The south platform, goods loop, footbridge and signal box were decommissioned on 21 January 1967. The level crossing immediately to the east of the station was converted to automatic-opening on 9 March 1986 and to automatic half-barriers on 4 April 1993. Electrification of the Wickford to Southminster line using 25 kV overhead line electrification (OLE) was completed on 12 May 1986. Today the station is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it.

The series covered generally obscure, rare or offensive excerpts of television footage from numerous media archives, usually accompanied by Lewis-Smith's biting commentary and cynical approach to what was being shown. Lewis-Smith used a variety of categories on the show to accompany a particular selection of programme footage. The show was also characterised by its musical score of campy jingles introducing the regular segments. These were produced in the 1980s style by the Dallas-based radio ID company JAM Creative Productions. The programme was made by Associated- Rediffusion, the name of a TV company formerly serving the London area from 1955 to 1964 (and continuing as Rediffusion London until 1968). Lewis-Smith bought the name for his own production company when he discovered that it was dormant.https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/tvoffal_66602210.shtml TV Offal has never been fully repeated, although a \\"best of\\" series entitled TV Offal Prime Cuts was aired in November 1999. Regular segments The opening to each episode involved a guest appearance from Professor Stephen Hawking, who's often shown conversing with either Lewis-Smith or one of the gay daleks (who's convinced he's really Robert T. Ironside and so pesters Hawking for an autograph). =Honest Obituary= A humorous look at the death of either a current or generally obscure celebrity personality's \\"demise\\" followed by a satirical account of his/her contributions to the viewing public (which usually derails them) before revealing the exaggerated cause of death. The first few lines of the obituary are a list of very harsh criticisms, usually followed by \\"his/her critics were less kind\\". The deaths are usually announced using a piece of dubbed dialogue of the celebrity's name, mixing into BBC News footage of newsreader (Michael Buerk) saying \\"... who died today\\" in a bitter and traumatized manner. (From the news reports broadcast on the day that Princess Diana died.) Obituaries included Noel Edmonds, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Melvyn Bragg, Nigel Kennedy, Jeremy Clarkson, Vanessa Feltz, Two Fat Ladies and Jeremy Beadle. =Kamikaze Karaoke= Usually involves Lewis- Smith imitating various musicians to interpret how they sound \\"to him\\", usually mocking them in the process. =Assassination of the Week= This segment usually had two parts, with one part leading to the commercial breaks, challenging the viewer to depend on their memory to guess the outcome of a genuine assassination attempt aired on the show, and the second part resolving the outcome and whenever or not the victim survived or was killed (\\"did they live or are they worm food\\"). Those featured were Inejiro Asanuma and Luis Donaldo Colosio (both killed), Park Chung-Hee (who survived but whose wife Yuk Young-soo was killed in the attempt), Imelda Marcos (who survived), John F Kennedy (who was killed but whom Lewis-Smith said had survived in a fictitious \\"what really happened\\" segment) and Prince Charles (who survived but whom Lewis-Smith said was killed in an equally fictitious segment). In between the setting of the question and the reveal of the answer, viewers were usually treated to a bizarrely outdated television advertisement, such as an ad for the Daily Mirror produced in about 1960 (using the slogan \\"the Daily Mirror backs the young!\\" and ridiculing the \\"old guard\\" of British society) and an advert for the now discontinued Diocalm. The section was dropped from one episode when TV Offal instead used the original break titles from an episode of The Golden Shot during a piece satirising the game show. =Crappy TV Logo of the Week= A piece mocking the most under budget and mismanaged of obscure television studios, produced by students or otherwise. =Fantasy Programme of the Week= A \\"What If...\\" segment pondering aloud what certain celebrities would be doing if they chose a different action to affect the outcome of their productions, ranging from Roy Walker creating dirty versions of Catchphrase (a commentary on the infamous \\"Snake Charmer\\" outtake) to Richard Baker being drunk on the Last Night of the Proms (\\"which of course...he wasn't\\" claimed a sarcastic Lewis-Smith whilst introducing the segment). =The Pilots That Crashed= Rare and unaired pilots produced for possible series. Included such gems as \\"The Development of the Test Card\\", \\"Tubby the Tumour\\" and \\"It'll All End In Tiaras\\", a satire on monarchy. =The Gay Daleks= A series of interactions between two Michael Portillo obsessed, gay Daleks, travelling in a space/time machine called \\"The Turdis\\" (a play on the TARDIS and \\"turd\\", a countable noun for a piece of faeces), during the sketches, the pair treat their relationship with an argumentative, tense approach which often is ridden with their addressing relationship problems, crude bickering, and finally becoming so turned on by their arguing, that they begin to orgasm, leading to a variation of the classic Dalek catchphrase \\"Exterminate\\", now \\"Exsperminate\\". In the pilot episode, dubbed clips from the 1979 serial Destiny of the Daleks were used. A later attempt at reviving the Gay Daleks as an animated series was blocked by the Terry Nation Estate. =Satirical Song in the '80s Genre= Each episode would contain a song about a celebrity, with the exception of one song about 'Selling God'. \\"Its nice being [NAME]\\" The tune itself was always the same, but the lyrics were changed depending on the celebrity. The song would always end with the line: \\"..but now we must stop as our lawyer says that [NAME] will sue\\". Ironically one of the songs (\\"It's Nice Being Esther\\") was edited on legal advice when included as part of TV Offal Prime Cuts in 1999. Celebrities targeted included Esther Rantzen, Sir David Attenborough, Dale Winton, Loyd Grossman, Carol Vorderman, Chris Evans, and 'Selling God' which featured a variety of 'has-been celebs'. The show would close with Lewis-Smith prank calling a variety of people, such as Hughie Green, Mary Whitehouse or the offices of Carlton Television, with initial good graces, before becoming more and more rude as the conversation continued.

Because the Bond albedo accounts for all of the light scattered from a body at all wavelengths and all phase angles, it is a necessary quantity for determining how much energy a body absorbs. This, in turn, is crucial for determining the equilibrium temperature of a body. Because bodies in the outer Solar System are always observed at very low phase angles from the Earth, the only reliable data for measuring their Bond albedo comes from spacecraft. Phase integral The Bond albedo (A) is related to the geometric albedo (p) by the expression :A = pq where q is termed the phase integral and is given in terms of the directional scattered flux I(Œ±) into phase angle Œ± (averaged over all wavelengths and azimuthal angles) as :q = 2\\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\frac{I(\\\\alpha)}{I(0)} \\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\, d\\\\alpha. The phase angle Œ± is the angle between the source of the radiation (usually the Sun) and the observing direction, and varies from zero for light scattered back towards the source, to 180¬∞ for observations looking towards the source. For example, during opposition or looking at the full moon, Œ± is very small, while backlit objects or the new moon have Œ± close to 180¬∞. Examples The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself). This is in contrast to other definitions of albedo such as the geometric albedo, which can be above 1. In general, though, the Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question.

In Greece the village is particularly known for the mineral water bottled there. Administratively it belongs to the municipality of Thermi. St. John the Theologian Convent is situated there, associated with the name of a famous Orthodox religious author and ascetic of the 20th century, St. Paisios of Mount Athos.Elder Paisios the Athonite commemorated in Greece History Saint Arsenius church Souroti is an immigrant's village, one of the many that were established in Greek Macedonia after the Balkan wars and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Shortly before 1912 the area was called \\"Surukli\\" (from the Turkish suru which means herd) and was owned by five Turkish land owners (Œ§œÉŒπœÜŒªŒπŒ∫Œ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ) who sold their land to Jews from Thessaloniki. The first Greeks that settled in the area were a vlach family from Vlasti of the Kozani regional unit, the Christos Lolas' family. Although they were originally shepherds, the family sold their sheep to buy the land from the Jews. In 1914 forty families of arvanites came from Mandritsa (ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒØœÑœÉŒ±) in North Thrace following a Bulgarian invasion in their home village. Most of them were bilingual in Greek and Arvanitika. Their primary occupation was sericulture and they moved to Souroti to take advantage of the local mulberries. At the same time they maintained trade bonds with Jewish silk producers in Thrace. In 1922, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey about 48 families arrived from Asia Minor originating from Izmir (Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑), Aydin (ŒëœäŒ¥ŒØŒΩŒπŒø), Cius (ŒöŒØŒøœÇ), Mudanya (ŒúŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ¨) and also from Eastern Thrace. Those were educated and they carried their own traditions. In Souroti they worked in sericulture, olive oil production and vine dressing. Between 1928 and 1930 more vlach shepherds came from Vlasti along with 4-5 families of Sarakatsanoi (Œ£Œ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÑœÉŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπ). Land was distributed to the immigrants by the Greek state first in 1914 and later in 1932. =Modern establishment= The community of Souroti was officially established and recognized by the Greek state on Sep. 20th, 1947. Since then the village, whose main productive activities were agriculture and bottling of mineral water, has undergone steady development. In 1997 during a major reorganization of local self-government initiated by the Greek government called \\"Kapodistrias plan\\", Souroti merged with the municipality of Vasilika along with Ag. Paraskeyi, Ag. Antonio, Libadi, Monopigado and Peristera. In 2011 with the Kallikratis plan, Vasilika merged with the municipality of Thermi. Nowadays people from the nearby Thessaloniki are moving to the area around the village which is expected to turn into a suburb of Thessaloniki. Discovery of the mineral water spring While still part of the Ottoman Empire, the area around today's bottling factory was a swamp, and the spring of mineral water unknown. During the 1915 military campaigns of the First World War, the French troops that camped at the then called Surukli mapped the spring and built a rudimentary bottling facility. In 1917 Serbian troops camped there and they too built a new bottling facility. They called the water \\"Sour Water\\" (Serbian Latin: Kisela Voda, ). The Lolas family appropriated and refurbished the facility in 1918. In 1925 George Chonaios took over the Lola's enterprise. Chonaios had the facility work as a private enterprise, however he allotted 5% of the profit to the local community. In 1998 the company went public. Since then it exhibited rapid development and became one of the most popular mineral water brands in Greece. =Quality of the mineral water= Souroti water has been recognized as a sub-acidic sparkling mineral water rich in calcium and magnesium in accordance with Greek Legislation (Government Gazette 600/1-8-1991, Decision No. 4). It is also included in the European Union's List of Natural Mineral Waters recognised by Member States. The water, at least in the beginning of the 20th century, was naturally sparkling. Although it still preserves its original mineral composition, nowadays carbon dioxide is added during bottling. The water is estimated to come from a container approximately 150 m underground. It owes its excellent quality to the rock formations at Mount Anthemounta which consist of semi-metamorphic, metamorphic and igneous rocks. Water flowing in the substrate is slow-moving and as it passes through the various rocks it is filtered and enriched with beneficial elements giving it its unique mineral composition and distinctive taste. Water in the spring is cold at a steady temperature of around 16 ¬∞C. Its special features are a high magnesium content with the ideal calcium to magnesium ratio and a low sodium and nitrate content. It also contains potassium and fluorine as well as valuable trace elements such as iron, copper, manganese, lithium, selenium, chromium and zinc. It has exceptional taste and is very pleasant to drink, assists in the functioning of the digestive and urinary systems and it has several other health benefits. One liter of Souroti water meets 1/4 of the body's daily needs in calcium and magnesium. All this makes it different from soda water, which is ordinary potable water to which sodium bicarbonate has been added so that it acquires approximately the same properties as natural mineral water.

Despite a planned release in fall of 2000, the game was released in May 2001 for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color. Ports were made for the Dreamcast, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Advance. A sequel was released the following year. Development Following the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Activision looked to expand its line of video games to other extreme sports outside of just skateboarding. Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX would be the first of such efforts. A demo version of the game is available in the options menu in the PlayStation version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 which features two BMX riders and a beta version of the finished game's first level. Despite a \\"fall 2000\\" release listed in the demo, the game would be delayed until its eventual release in May 2001, nearly eight months after Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX was released. Gameplay Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX uses a tweaked version of the game engine used in a similar video game, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The goal of the game is to successfully perform and combine different tricks on a BMX bike, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the number of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth). Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of \\"signature moves\\" which are worth more than normal tricks. Grinds, lip tricks, and manuals (wheelies) are included in the game to help the player link tricks together into combos. Bails (falling off the bike due to poor landing) cause for no points to be awarded for the attempted trick or combo, and resets the special bar to empty. The player can play as one of eight different professional BMX riders, including Mat Hoffman, Rick Thorne, Dennis McCoy (BMX rider) and Mike Escamilla. Tony Hawk is featured as a hidden character, as is a fictional elderly character named \\"Granny\\". Each rider has their own individual stats, bikes, and trick-sets. Ten levels exist in the game (including two remade levels from Pro Skater), consisting of street, vert, and dirt track-oriented courses. Secret areas, point-bonuses, and many breakable objects are scattered amongst the levels. =Game modes= Career Mode ‚Äî In Career Mode, the player has five magazine covers (i.e. objectives) to obtain in six of the eight levels. The player has only two minutes in which to obtain a cover after which their run ends; however, individual objectives are marked off once completed. In each level, two of the covers are acquired by reaching set scores (with the second score being two to three times the amount required for the first), one is obtained by collecting the five letters to spell \\"T-R- I-C-K\\", one is a hidden cover which the player must find in the level, and one requirement varies from level to level, but always involves doing something to five objects (e.g., \\"smash five lights\\"). The other two levels are competitions, where the goal is to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal by ranking higher than the other riders. In these levels, the basis for ranking is not the player's score, but the mean number of points given on a scale of one to ten by three computer AI judges after three sets. Advancing in Career mode allows the player to unlock new levels, bikes, and secret riders. Single Session ‚Äî In this mode, the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and available level, and rides for a two-minute session in an attempt to set a high score. While similar to the two-minute session in career mode, there are no specific goals for the player to attempt. Free Ride ‚Äî Free Ride is similar to the Single Session mode; the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and an available level. Instead of a two-minute timer, however, there is no time limit, allowing the player to practice or simply explore, searching for gaps and secrets areas. Multiplayer modes ‚Äî The game features several split- screen multi-player modes including Trick Attack, Horse, and Graffiti. Park Editor ‚Äî This mode allows the player to create their own level by arranging various ramps, rails, and other pieces. Gaps can be created and named, and the player's starting positions can also be chosen by the player. Once a created park is finished, the level can be accessed in the game's \\"Single Session\\", \\"Free Ride\\", and multiplayer modes. Five pre-made parks, which were created using Park Editor, were included in the game as samples of the editor's potential. Reception The PlayStation and Dreamcast versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PC and Game Boy Advance versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Jeff Lundrigan of Next Generation said of the former console version, \\"Even two years later, the Tony Hawk engine makes a monkey out of the likes of Razor [Freestyle] Scooter ‚Äì which is, weirdly enough, this game's only immediate competition on PlayStation.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the PlayStation version a score of four stars out of five, saying that \\"Players can create their own custom BMX tracks with the bundled 3-D course editor, offering more than 100 variations of ramps, rails and other obstacles.\\" Maxim gave the same console version a similar score of eight out of ten, saying that \\"Extreme- sports poseurs can break a femur in solo and multiplayer modes; master the controls and you‚Äôll open new venues by performing death-defying stunts that‚Äôd make Evel Knievel wet his bedpan. Despite a trick roster with some troubling names (anyone care to attempt a ‚ÄúRocket Queen‚Äù?), this is as down and dirty as they come. Detergent not included.\\" BBC Sport gave the similar console version a score of 79%, saying, \\"If you like rock music to accompany your efforts, this has some of the best with even the Stone Roses lending their tracks.\\" However, X-Play gave it a score of three stars out of five, stating, \\"The levels aren't the greatest around, and it's not quite as solid as THPS, but \\"Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX\\" is better than THQ and Acclaim's freestyle bike games. It's easy to slip into and fun to play. At the same time however, because \\"Hoffman's Pro BMX\\" piggybacks on the THPS engine, they're very similar, and if you've started to get bored with \\"Tony Hawk's,\\" you might want to try out Matt Hoffman's before you pick it up.\\" Edge similarly gave it six out of ten, stating that the game \\"offers more realism, while Mirra delivers a marginally better, if arcadey, experience. Both entertain in differing fashions. Then again, you could always wait for the next-gen versions.\\" In Japan, where the same console version was ported and published by Success on September 5, 2002, Famitsu gave it a score of 26 out of 40. Jon Thompson of AllGame gave the GBC version four stars out of five, saying that it \\"tries hard to live up to its big brother on the PlayStation, and it does a pretty good job of it, surprisingly. A diverse trick set is hampered only by stuffy controls, and the levels themselves are visually pleasing and fun to play. Hopefully, this is a sign of better things to come for the portable market.\\" However, the same website gave the GBA and PC versions each three-and-a-half stars out of five, with Michael L. House saying of the former, \\"As an extreme sport that fills a specific niche, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX will appeal more to bikers who've had hands-on experiences than casual gamers looking for a fun sport with less subjective scoring and easier controls\\"; and Thompson saying of the latter, \\"The host of different riders, bikes, and levels come together to create a cohesive package, and with the relative dearth of quality extreme sports games on the PC, the title is worthwhile. If you've played the game in console form, you won't find anything new here, but fans will find it undeniably fun.\\" Despite similar Activision O2 releases such as Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder, Wakeboarding Unleashed featuring Shaun Murray and Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer, only Mat Hoffman's would spawn a sequel.

He acquired additional duties over time including the instruction of members of the Imperial family, among them the future Empress Maria Theresa. He was promoted to second organist in 1729 and first organist upon the accession of Maria Theresa to the throne in 1741. He retired from official duties at the court in 1763.Wollenberg, Susan. \\"Muffat, Gottlieb Theophil\\" in Grove Music Online accessed 11/15/2013 Compositions Muffat's compositional output is primarily limited to keyboard music. He shows considerable skill as a contrapuntist in the short liturgical fugues published in his first collection 72 Versetl sammt 12 Toccaten (Vienna, 1726). These pieces reflect a conservative approach to liturgical music in that they are organized in the order of the church tones with an introductory toccata and a regular number of versets for each tone.Wollenberg, Susan. \\"Muffat, Gottlieb Theophil\\" in Grove Music Online accessed 11/15/2013 His second publication, Componimenti musicali per il cembalo (Augsburg, ca. 1736), is more progressive in its outlook. This collection of six suites, while maintaining the traditional Allemande, Courante and Saraband format, is more lavishly ornamented than was characteristic of Austro-German music of that era. Some of the movements are even given fanciful French titles like La Coquette or L'aimable Esprit as were popular among the clavecinistes. Short, simple phrases and clear motives characterize the pieces in this set. The preface to this work contains an ornamentation table with symbols and performance instructions for 57 ornaments.Wollenberg, Susan. \\"The Keyboard Suites of Gottlieb Muffat.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, Volume 102, 1975. 83-91 The most recent modern edition was done by the late Christopher Hogwood in 2009. Much of Muffat's output remains unpublished, though it nonetheless contains much music of great interest. His manuscript containing 32 ricercare and 19 canzonas is remarkable in that it is the largest body of work from his era based on 17th century models. Like all pupils of Fux, Muffat would have studied the music of Frescobaldi and Froberger during his years of apprenticeship. In the ricercare, Muffat shows himself to be a master of the stile antico. Following the usage of the early Baroque, the contrapuntal ricercare are notated in open score and preserve the sense of modality and sectional structure of the Italian masters. The canzonas are modeled on the 16th century vocal motet and are livelier and more idiomatically instrumental in style.Wollenberg, Susan \\"Muffat, Gottlieb Theophil\\". Grove Music Online. accessed 11/15/2013. Also still in manuscript are the 24 Toccatas and Capriccios. a pairing which seems to be unique to Muffat. Two styles of toccatas appear in this collection: one type features a florid melodic line over a supporting chordal structure and the second type utilizes a sectional form that juxtaposes contrasting tempi, meters and textures. The capriccios represent a variety of styles including prelude, invention, and dance forms. Muffat and Handel It is well established that Handel borrowed copiously from his contemporaries, including Muffat. While it would be easy to cast aspersions at Handel for this seemingly dishonest practice, it hardly diminishes his stature as a composer and probably would not have created much consternation for either party. It is not known with certainty whether Handel and Muffat had any personal knowledge of each other, but their positions as leading musicians in major European capitals might imply at least a mutual awareness. There is a copy, in Muffat's own hand, of Handel's Suites des pieces (1720) which Muffat supplied with numerous ornaments along with a few variants of his own design.Baselt, Bernd. \\"Muffat and Handel: A Two Way Exchange.\\" The Musical Times, Volume 120, no.1641, Nov., 1979. 904-907 Modern edition by Hogwood 2007. Muffat as well did his own version of Handel's 6 Fugues for Keyboard (1735) HWV 605-610, first edition from the manuscript by Hogwood 2008. For his part, Handel seems to have borrowed extensively from Muffat's Componimenti Musicali with at least 18 of these pieces appearing 30 times in Handel's output.Bennett, Gregory. \\"Handel's Borrowings.\\" The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular Volume 36, no. 625, March, 1895. 596-600 Handel's Ode to St. Cecilia's Day seems to owe the greatest debt to Muffat, with material from five pieces being reworked into the score. Not only were themes reused in their entirety, but also counter subjects and continuing phrases were put to use by Handel. More such examples appear in Handel's oratorios Joshua, Samson, and Judas Maccabeus.Shedlock, J.S. \\"Handel's Borrowing.\\" The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, Volume 42, no.701, July 1901. 450-452 The spirited fugue in the second movement of the Overture to Samson makes extensive use of a Muffat fugue from Componimenti Musicali and a similar borrowing occurs in the third movement of the Overture to Judas Maccabeus.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between to the west and to the east. The Engineer's Line Reference for the line is WIS; the station's three- letter station code is NFA. The southern (westbound) platform has an operational length for eight-coach trains while the northern (eastbound) platform can accommodate nine coaches. The line and station were opened for goods on 1 June 1889 and to passenger services on 1 October 1889 by the Great Eastern Railway. Facilities then included two platforms, both provided with buildings and linked by a footbridge; a goods yard including cattle pens; and a 30-lever signal box, reduced to 10 after 1966. The signal box was taken out of use on 1 December 1985 and demolished in February 1986. The original footbridge was replaced with a higher one prior to the electrification of the line in 1986. Electrification using 25 kV overhead line electrification (OLE) was completed on 12 May 1986. North Fambridge station is currently managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it. The typical off- peak service is of one westbound train every 40 minutes to and one eastbound train every 40 minutes to , with additional services at peak times. Some peak services continue to or from and/or London Liverpool Street via the Great Eastern Main Line. As North Fambridge is at the midpoint of this single-track line, its double-track configuration provides a passing loop to allow two trains to run on the line at any one time. The station was originally called Fambridge (with the code FAM) but this was changed to North Fambridge on 20 May 2007.

It was produced as a response to the success of the Austin 7 and was Triumph's first car to be made in large numbers. In 1933 the name was changed to the Triumph Super 8\\\\. Design Development of the new car had started in 1925 when Arthur Sykes, who had been with Lea-Francis was given responsibility to design a new small car. Amongst those he recruited to help him was Stanley Edge, who had been the original draughtsman for the Austin 7\\\\. The car was launched in September 1927 and was 6 inches (150 mm) longer and 2 inches (50 mm) wider than the Austin. The new 832 cc 4-cylinder side-valve engine, mainly designed by Harry Ricardo, had a stroke of and bore of and unlike the Austin had a three bearing crankshaft with pressure lubrication and monobloc crankcase made from cast iron. (The Austin 7 had a two-bearing crankshaft and the cylinder block and crankcase were separate castings.) The car followed its Triumph predecessors by having Lockheed hydraulic brakes, but now they were internal expanding in drums and so less affected by water then the older external contracting type. The handbrake operated on the transmission. The chassis had a rigid front axle supported by half-elliptic springs and a live rear axle with Austin 7-like quarter-elliptics, allowing the chassis side members to finish ahead of the rear axle. The three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox was mounted in unit with the engine and transmitted power to the worm gear final drive via a torque tube. The electrical system was 6 volts. Body Styles A range of body styles were available, all made in house. The cheapest model was a two-door four-seat tourer, followed by a de-luxe tourer with two-coloured body, a two-seater with dickey seat, a two- door saloon, a fabric-bodied saloon and at the top of the range, a coachbuilt saloon. Gordon England could also supply a special fabric-bodied saloon with sliding roof. The chassis was also supplied to other coachbuilders for fitting their own bodies. Prices ranged from ¬£113 for the chassis to ¬£190 for the Gordon England saloon. On test the car could reach just over and return . Model history For 1929 a new body style was released called the Special Sports with pointed tail and there was also briefly a supercharged version with the engine capacity reduced to 747 cc and reputedly able to reach , but they were expensive at ¬£250, and few seem to have been sold. Also in 1929 Donald Healey entered a standard car in the Monte Carlo Rally, starting from Berlin but failing to finish, getting stuck repeatedly in the snow in France. Undeterred, he tried again in 1930 and was the first British car to finish and seventh overall, in a car with a top speed of . More body styles appeared in 1930 when a two-seat coup√©, a de-luxe fabric saloon and a landaulet appeared. Wire wheels became standard replacing the artillery type that had been used on some versions. The extensive range was simplified for 1931 with the deletion of the fabric saloons, landaulet, coup√© and Special Sport but a Gnat sports tourer and Tickford-bodied saloon were added. With the deteriorating economic climate a further rationalisation of the range was carried out in 1932 with the cars being designated Mark I for the tourers and Mark II for the saloons. A pillarless saloon joined the range. The car's track grew from 42 to 43.5 inches (1105 mm), the rear springs were changed from quarter to semi elliptic on the Mk II Saloons, and the de-luxe models got a four-speed gearbox. The Super 8 The name was changed in 1933 to the Super 8, the car had always technically fallen into the 8 hp taxation bracket, and all cars gained the Mk II chassis. The body range was further reduced to the two-door saloon, pillarless saloon and four-seat tourer. This was the last year for the car. Triumph had already launched the Super 9 in 1931, and this car was destined to be the replacement.  References  *The Story of Triumph Sports Cars. Graham Robson.

He was first introduced in the New Mutants Special Edition #1 (December 1985), and was created by Chris Claremont and Art Adams. Fictional character biography A descendant of the Fenris Wolf,Thor Annual #12 Hrimhari was the Wolf Prince in the realm of Asgard. He presided over all wolves in the enchanted woods of that land, but retained a humble and gentle demeanor not normally associated with that of royalty. He originally had the ability to change his form from that of a gray wolf to a shape resembling a wolf-human hybrid (like the form associated with werewolves in modern fiction or Cynocephali of lore). He is highly respected by the people of Asgard, and is said to be a true friend of Hogun the Grim. However, the giants of Asgard are mortal enemies of the wolf people and hunt them down at every opportunity. =Captured by Loki= When the New Mutants were magically taken to Asgard, Wolfsbane met Hrimhari in a wood while being chased by giants. Immediately enchanted by her, Hrimhari saves Rahne and the two became almost inseparable. Rahne has similar feelings but does not know how to deal with them, due to her strict upbringing.New Mutants Special Edition #1 The god Loki manages to capture the two lovers and transformed them into more sinister versions of their man-wolf forms under his servitude. Under these guises they were known as Grimfang and Bleakheart. They are eventually changed back to their original selves but were forced to be separated once Rahne returned to Earth. Rahne had wanted to be with Hrimhari more, but to do so would force the other X-Men and New Mutants to stay behind also.X-Men Annual #9 =Fighting Hela= Years later, the death goddess Hela tried to take over Asgard. Part of her plan to conquer Asgard and kill a then-helpless Odin, using the Wolves of the forest as her scouts and spies. Hrimhari fought Hela's armies for his people's freedom but he was eventually captured and prisoned. Through the link Danielle Moonstar held with the Valkyries the New Mutants discovered Hela's plan and rescued Hrimhari.New Mutants Vol 1 #80 In the heat of battle and due to a mystical forcefield, Hrimhari was separated from the majority of the group, ending up with Meltdown and Warlock.New Mutants Vol 1 #81 After some delays, the trio headed straight for Odin's chambers, not understanding that he was under the much-needed Odinsleep (a process that would restore his energy and vitality). They were soon captured by a guard and tossed in prison. With their powers, they could escape, but those they need to talk to, Balder the Brave and the Warriors Three would be returning anyway from other lands. The children of Volstagg, a member of the Warriors Three, appear at the cell's window, having eavesdropped on the current happenings. They know of Hrimhari, through the tales told by Hogun the Grim, their father's teammate. He, in turn, had heard of Volstagg's children through Hogun's tales himself. Understanding that the power of Thor, Balder and the others might not quite be enough, the children tell of the sorcerer Tiwaz, who lives in Astrond at the edge of the icy wastes.New Mutants Vol 1 #82 The children agreed to stay behind in Hrimhari's cell to emphasize the seriousness of the situation, for when the others do come back. Hrimhari and his friends travelled to Tiwaz's home, battling several of Hela's bat-creatures along the way. They survive a crash and capture by the Frost Giants thanks to Tiwaz. He told of much needed information about Hela's campaign. Though the three did not know it, this Tiwaz is Thor's great-grandfather.New Mutants Vol 1 #83 Tiwaz sent the trio on a mission; they free the Warriors Three from the dangerous Hive Trolls. Hrimhari recruited Ula, the queen of the trolls, to their side. The hive did not trust mortals nor most Asgardians; it was Hrimhari's honor that convinced them Hela was the true enemy.New Mutants Vol 1 #84 (1989) Hrimhari joined Balder, the trolls and the other forces gathered to battle Hela's army. He is injured in battle and was not present when the New Mutants saved Odin from Hela's 'Deathsword', which was to be plunged into his sleeping form.New Mutants Vol 1 #85 The Warriors Three bring Hrimhari and many wounded warriors to the royal palace, which is acting as a makeshift hospital. All are healed by restorative magics.New Mutants Vol 1 #86 (Feb. 1990) He learns that Rahne and her friends must leave again; they accomplish this despite Asgard being trapped in the Negative Zone.New Mutants Vol 1 #87 (March 1990) =Back with Wolfsbane= Later, Asgard suffered through the end of times, the Ragnarok, with the destruction of all its inhabitants.Thor Vol 2 #85 Yet all return in one form or another. Hrimhari himself surprised Wolfsbane, meeting her in an Earth forest. He tells of how Frost Giants had recently slain his pack to wear their skins. He had been fighting them when Ragnarok hit, claiming him the lives of all immortal beings. X-Force Vol. 3 #10 Hrimhari subsequently revealed a new ability, being able to shapeshift into a human form. He claimed that Midgard, Earth, is now a part of him.X-Force Vol. 3 #13 Hrimhari resumed his relationship with Rahne and consummated their relationship by making love before battling and killing Frost Giants.X-Force Vol. 3 #21 Rahne then fell unconscious soon afterwards and it had been revealed by Doctor Nemesis that she is pregnant with the Wolf Prince's child, which is neither human nor mutant and that the unborn child is threatening her health and her life.X-Force Vol. 3 #22 The Wolf Prince later made a deal with Hela. Faced with a moral dilemma of whom to save, his child or Rahne, he chose the mutant healer Elixir instead as he can heal both. She agreed and they returned to the Asgardian Underworld together. Hrimhari's final words to Rahne were that \\"he would somehow find his way back to Rahne and their unborn child.\\" Revived, Elixir was able to heal Rahne. In doing so he realized that Rahne would not the survive the birth of the hybrid baby. Because of this Elixir transferred some of the baby's strength to Rahne. On Genosha, Rahne demonstrated that her strength, durability, and senses have been further enhanced.X-Force #23 A few months afterwards Wolfsbane had returned to X-Factor and let everybody believe that one-time lover Rictor was the father of her child. It is revealed that Hrimhari is now part of Hela's undead army. While X-Factor battled its way through the army in Niflhel, Hrimhari caught Rahne's scent on Rictor's boyfriend Shatterstar, as he and Wolfsbane had fought only a short time ago. Hrimhari attacked him because he believed that Shatterstar had forced himself on her. During this fight he revealed that he was the father of Rahne's child. The fight between the two men was stopped by Banshee who knocked Hrimhari out of the way with her sonic scream.X-Factor #212 Other versions =What If?= Hrimhari appears in What If vol. 2 #12, in a story titled \\"What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard\\". Rahne and Hrimhari had married and lived in the woods. He was killed in a later battle but left Rahne with three children (depicted as a wolf cub, a human baby and wolf-human-hybrid baby).What If vol. 2 #12 In other media Hrimari is mentioned in the children's novel Odd and the Frost Giant where the titular character must save Asgard from the aforementioned giants.

Accreditation is a voluntary process by which colleges demonstrate to each other, and sometimes to employers and licensing agencies, that their credits and degrees meet minimum standards. It is the self-regulation of the higher education industry. Each regional accreditor oversees the vast majority of public and private educational institutions, both not-for-profit and for-profit, in its region. Their primary function is accreditation of post-secondary institutions, though there is a limited amount of accreditation of primary and secondary schools.Statement of Commitment by the Regional Accrediting Commissions for the Evaluation of Electronically Offered Degree and Certificate Programs, retrieved from University of Hawaii website, June 19, 2011. \\"The eight regional accrediting commissions assure the quality of the great majority of degree-granting institutions of higher learning in the United States.\\" (Page i)Catherine Finnegan, Aligning Information Technology with Academic Standards , Educause Center for Applied Research Research Bulletin, volume 2006, Issue 10, May 9, 2006. \\"Regional acceditors include among their membership nearly all community colleges and public and private colleges universities in the region that they serve.\\" (Page 2)Janice M.

Additionally, most non-profit institutions are regionally accredited while most for-profit colleges and universities are nationally accredited.

Since 2012, the Northwest Accreditation Commission for primary and secondary schools has been a division of AdvancED. * Southern Association of Colleges and Schools - Educational institutions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. * Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges - 4-year educational institutions in California, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Micronesia, Palau, and Northern Marianas Islands, as well as schools for American children in Asia. * Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, formerly part of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges - 2-year educational institutions in California, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Micronesia, Palau, and Northern Marianas Islands, as well as schools for American children in Asia. The seven organizations form the Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions (C-RAC).http://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/accred/Assessment%20Guide%20-%20C-RAC.pdf Each regional accrediting commission's executive directors and commission chairs sit on C-RAC and periodically promulgate principles and guidelines which are followed by the regional commissions. Although the principles do not replace individual commission regulations, they provide a basis for assessing accreditation practice between regions. All regional agencies have accrediting authority for colleges and universities, 2-year, 4-year, or both. Some agencies also have accrediting authority over K-12 schools (primary and secondaryschools). The Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regional accreditors divide responsibility between two separate accreditation agencies with one focusing on primary and secondary schools and the other focusing on postsecondary institutions. In the Western region, there is a separate commission that accredits 2-year colleges. History The regional accrediting agencies were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to a perceived need for better articulation between secondary schools and higher education institutions (the school offered the courses the college needed applicants to have taken; this helped colleges and universities evaluate prospective students).Fred F. Harcleroad and Judith S. Eaton (2005), \\"The Hidden Hand: External Constituencies and their Impact,\\" Chapter 9 in Philip G. Altbach, Robert Oliver Berdahl, and Patricia J. Gumport, editors, American higher education in the twenty-first century: social, political, and economic challenges. Page 263. JHU Press. , . The New England Association was formed in 1885 by a group of schoolmasters of secondary schools. The Middle States Association formed in 1887. The faculty of Vanderbilt University led the establishment of the Southern Association in 1895, and the North Central Association was organized the same year at a meeting of 36 administrators of midwestern schools, colleges, and universities. The Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools (predecessor of the two organizations that now serve that region) was formed in 1917 and the Western Association was founded in 1923. Initially the main focus of the organizations was on accreditation of secondary schools and establishment of uniform college entrance requirements. Regional accreditation replaced other methods, such as the Association of American Universities's \\"AAU Accepted List\\" (1914-1948). Accreditation first emerged as a regional rather than national activity because it typically involved site visits, and the fastest transportation available at the time was the railroad. Regional accreditation vs. national accreditation Regionally accredited institutions are usually academically oriented, state-owned or non- profit private institutions.Judith S. Eaton, Accreditation and Recognition in the United States , CHEA, 2008. Nationally accredited schools are usually career-oriented and for profit. Both regional and national accreditations are recognized by the United States Department of Education (U.S.DoED) , the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Every college in the United States has the right to set standards and to accept or refuse to accept transfer credits. If a student has attended a school that is not regionally accredited, it may be difficult or impossible to have the credits, or even the degree earned, recognized by a regionally accredited college (or employer). A 2005 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that, in making decisions on credit transfer, about 84 percent of U.S. higher education institutions considered whether the sending institution is accredited, and many had policies stating that they would accept credits only from regionally accredited institutions.Government Accountability Office, Transfer Students: Postsecondary Institutions Could Promote More Consistent Consideration of Coursework by Not Basing Determinations on Accreditation, GAO-06-22, October 2005. About 63 percent of institutions told the GAO that they would accept credit from any regionally accredited institution, but only 14 percent similarly accepted credits from nationally accredited schools. Regionally accredited institutions are reluctant to accept credits from nationally accredited institutions because of national accreditors' less stringent standards for faculty qualifications and library resources. Students who anticipate transferring credits from a nationally accredited school to a regionally accredited one are advised to verify in advance that the credits will be accepted.What is the Difference Between Regional and National Accreditation , Yahoo! Education website In general, the names of U.S. post- secondary institutions and their degree titles do not indicate whether the institution is accredited or the type of accreditation it holds. Rules on this topic vary from state to state. For example, Tennessee Higher Education Commission regulations require that post-secondary institutions in the state of Tennessee must be regionally accredited to use the word \\"university\\" in their names, and that a school lacking regional accreditation may not use the word \\"college\\" in its name without adding a qualifier such as \\"career\\", \\"vocational\\", \\"business\\", \\"technical\\", \\"art\\", \\"Bible\\", or \\"Christian\\". Tennessee rules also specify that only regionally accredited schools can issue liberal arts degrees or degree titles such as Associate of Arts or Science and Bachelor of Arts or Science.Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, Protecting Tennesseans from Education Fraud, March 2007.

Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. In 1927, after the publishing house failed because of French harassment and censorship, the VNQDD was formed under the leadership of Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc. Modelling itself on the Kuomintang of Nationalist China (the same three characters in ch·ªØ H√°n: ) the VNQDD gained a following among northerners, particularly teachers and intellectuals. The party, which was less successful among peasants and industrial workers, was organised in small clandestine cells. From 1928, the VNQDD attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. A turning point came in February 1929 with the Bazin assassination, the killing of a French labour recruiter widely despised by local Vietnamese people. Although the perpetrators' precise affiliation was unclear, the French colonial authorities held the VNQDD responsible. Between 300 and 400 of the party's approximately 1,500 members were detained in the resulting crackdown. Many of the leaders were arrested, but H·ªçc managed to escape. In late 1929, the party was weakened by an internal split. Under increasing French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals with a plan to expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched the Y√™n B√°i mutiny on February 10, 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. H·ªçc and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country. Some remaining factions sought peaceful means of struggle, while other groups fled across the border to Kuomintang bases in the Yunnan province of China, where they received arms and training. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by Japan during World War II and, in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945, the VNQDD and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. However, after a falling out, Ho purged the VNQDD, leaving his communist-dominated Viet Minh unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the First Indochina War, Vietnam was partitioned into two zones. The remnants of the VNQDD fled to the capitalist south, where they remained until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. Today, the party survives only among overseas Vietnamese. __TOC__  Origins  French involvement in Vietnam started in the late 18th century when the Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine assisted Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, to found the Nguyen Dynasty by recruiting French volunteers. In return, Nguyen Anh, who took the reign name Gia Long allowed Catholic missionaries to operate in Vietnam. However, relations became strained under Gia Long's successor Minh Mang as missionaries sought to incite revolts in an attempt to enthrone a Catholic. This prompted anti-Christian edicts, and in 1858, a French invasion of Vietnam was mounted, ostensibly to protect Catholicism, but in reality for colonial purposes. The French steadily made gains and completed the colonization of Vietnam in 1883. Armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly, most notably through the Can Vuong movement of the late-1880s. In the early-20th century, the 1916 southern revolts and the Thai Nguyen uprising were notable disruptions to the French administration. In late 1925, a small group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals, led by a teacher named Pham Tuan Tai and his brother Pham Tuan Lam, started the Nam Dong Thu Xa (Southeast Asia Publishing House). They aimed to promote violent revolution as a means of gaining independence for Vietnam from French colonization, and published books and brochures about Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Revolution of 1911, as well as opening a free school to teach quoc ngu (Romanised Vietnamese script) to the working class. The group soon attracted the support of other progressive young northerners, including students and teachers led by Nguyen Thai Hoc. Hoc was an alumnus of Hanoi's Commercial School, who had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance.Hammer (1955), p. 82.Duiker p. 155. Hoc had previously tried to initiate peaceful reforms by making written submissions to the French authorities, but these were ignored, and his attempt to foster policy change through the publication of a magazine never materialized due to the refusal of a license. Harassment and censorship imposed by the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards more direct political action, in a bid to appeal to more radical elements in the north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.Duiker, p. 156. At the time, nationalist sentiment had been on the increase in Vietnam. The French colonial authorities were bringing more Vietnamese into the administration, and there was a small but growing proportion who were exposed to western education. As a result, they became aware of French ideals such as Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©, republicanism and democracy, which sharply contrasted to the racial inequality and stratified system of the colonial elite ruling the masses in Vietnam. There was also an increasing awareness of the political writings of Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which stoked a desire for civil and political rights, combined with the knowledge of the Japanese victory over Russia in 1905, which gave people confidence that Asians could defeat western powers.Luong (2010), pp. 81‚Äì82.

The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD) was formed at a meeting in Hanoi on December 25, 1927, with Nguyen Thai Hoc as the party's first leader. It was Vietnam's first home-grown revolutionary party, established three years before the Indochinese Communist Party. The party advocated socialism, but at the outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives. Many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution, rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent Vietnamese republic; but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism, putting off potential Vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence. In a bid for moderation, the final statement was a compromise that read: A manifesto released in February 1930 showed that the VNQDD heavily based its rhetoric on appealing to resentment against the system of racial inequality and the French imposition of capitalism.Luong (2010), pp. 82‚Äì83. It appealed to the populace to rise up against colonisation and the poor treatment of Vietnamese people. It assailed the French for restricting the Vietnamese people's ability to study, discuss policy and associate, and what it perceived as exploitative capitalist policies that enriched French enterprises while leaving Vietnamese people unhealthy. It criticised the colonial administration, which it saw as corrupt and encouraging low-level Vietnamese bureaucrats to mistreat their compatriots, and said that the ouster to French rule was necessary to stop the \\"elimination process\\" against the Vietnamese race. In order to attain its primary aim of independence, the VNQDD had three principles by which it intended to operate. The first was nationalism, under which people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam were to be citizens of a sovereign nation. Secondly, democracy was to give citizens the right to vote, impeach elected officials, ratify and abolish laws. The third and final principle was to implement socialist controls on the economy, and restricting capitalism through nationalisation, guaranteed minimum working conditions and land reform. This was ultimately aimed towards reducing income inequality.Luong (2010), p. 85. There had been a debate over the socioeconomic bent of the party when it was formed, with some advocating communism and others private property, but the position reached was not dissimilar from an existing Vietnamese social norm where villagers often owned land communally although social hierarchies still existed. Although the socioeconomic side of the VNQDD agenda was not as heavily promoted at a high political level as the other two principles, there was a strong push at grassroots level to implement more socialist systems.Luong (2010), p. 86. Although the VNQDD modelled itself on Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang or KMT, later led by Chiang Kai-shek), even down to copying the \\"Nationalist Party\\" designation, it had no direct relationship with its Chinese counterpart and in fact did not gain much attention outside Vietnam until the Yen Bay mutiny in 1930. However, in elucidating its primary objective of national independence, it did rely ideologically on S√∫ns Three Principles of the People (nationalism, people's welfare and human rights).Luong (2010), p. 88. Like the KMT, it was a clandestine organisation held together with tight discipline. Its basic unit was the cell, above which there were several levels of administration, including provincial, regional and central committees. Also like the KMT, the VNQDD's revolutionary strategy envisaged a military takeover, followed by a period of political training for the population before a constitutional government could take control. Most party members were teachers, young people who had been exposed to a western education and political theory, employees of the French colonial government, Confucian-oriented village notables, or non- commissioned officers in the colonial army. In particular, they sought to cultivate support among warrant officers who would then be able to mobilise their enlisted men.Luong (2010), p. 89. This led to a membership based heavily on traditional Asian and western-style political elites. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of society‚Äîthere were few workers or peasants in its support base, and those that were supporters of the VNQDD, were put into affiliated organisations that were adjunct to the parent organisation. The party's popularity was based on a groundswell of anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism.Marr (1981), p. 301. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time.Tucker, p. 489. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances.Duiker, p. 157. Talks with the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party (NVRP) failed because the NVRP wanted a more centralised and structured party organisation, although the VNQDD did manage to absorb the NVRP branch in Hung Hoa. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the time‚ÄîPhan Boi Chau‚Äîto the French in return for a financial reward. Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals.Currey, pp. 15‚Äì16, 20. The VNQDD would later be on the receiving end of another of Ho's manoeuvres.  Initial activities  Financial problems compounded the VNQDD's difficulties. Money was needed to set up a commercial enterprise, a cover for the revolutionaries to meet and plot, and for raising funds. For this purpose, a hotel-restaurant named the Vietnam Hotel was opened in September 1928. The French colonial authorities were aware of the real purpose of the business, and put it under surveillance without taking further preliminary action. The first notable reorganisation of the VNQDD was in December, when Nguyen Khac Nhu replaced Hoc as chairman. Three proto- governmental organs were created, to form the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government. The records of the French secret service estimated that by early 1929, the VNQDD consisted of approximately 1,500 members in 120 cells, mostly in areas around the Red River Delta. The intelligence reported that most members were students, minor merchants or low- level bureaucrats in the French administration. The report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among the members, but that few were of scholar-gentry (mandarin) rank. According to the historian Cecil B. Currey, \\"The VNQDD's lower-class origins made it, in many ways, closer to the labouring poor than were the Communists, many of whom‚Ä¶[were] from established middle-class families.\\"Currey, p. 20. At the time, the two other notable nationalist organisations were the communists and the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party, and although they had different visions of a post- independence nation, both competed with the VNQDD in attracting the support of the small, educated, urban class. In the late-1920s, around half of the communists were from bourgeoise backgrounds.Luong (2010), p. 87. Beginning in 1928, the VNQDD attracted substantial Vietnamese support, provoking increased attention from the French colonial administration. This came after a VNQDD death squad killed several French officials and Vietnamese collaborators who had a reputation for cruelty towards the Vietnamese populace.Tucker, p. 442.  Assassination of Bazin  The assassination of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Herv√© Bazin on February 9, 1929, was a turning point that marked the beginning of the VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the √âcole Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. The sources disagree on whether the party adopted a policy of sanctioning the assassination. One account is that Hoc felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French S√ªret√©, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.Duiker, pp. 160‚Äì161. Another view is that the senior VNQDD leaders felt that killing Bazin was necessary so that the party would appear to be relevant to workers involved in industry or commerce, given that the communists had begun to target this demographic for their recruitment drives. The first account says that, turned down by the VNQDD leadership, one of the assassination's proponents‚Äîit is unclear whether or not he was a party member‚Äîcreated his own plot. With an accomplice, he shot and killed Bazin on February 9, 1929, as the Frenchman left his mistress's house. The French attributed the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find: between three and four hundred men were rounded up, including 36 government clerks, 13 French government officials, 36 schoolteachers, 39 merchants, 37 landowners and 40 military personnel. The subsequent trials resulted in 78 men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Hoc and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.  Internal split and change in strategy  In 1929, the VNQDD split when a faction led by Nguyen The Nghiep began to disobey party orders and was therefore expelled from the Central Committee. Some sources claim that Nghiep had formed a breakaway party and had begun secret contacts with French authorities. Perturbed by those who betrayed fellow members to the French and the problems this behaviour caused, Hoc convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam-Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Hoc argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Hoc's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term.Marr (1981), pp. 377‚Äì378. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in an attack on the two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.Duiker, pp. 161‚Äì162. For the remainder of 1929, the party prepared for the revolt. They located and manufactured weapons, storing them in hidden depots. The preparation was hindered by French police, particularly the seizure of arms caches.Duiker, p. 162. Recruitment campaigns and grassroots activist drives were put in place, even though the VNQDD were realistic and understood that their assault was unlikely to succeed. The village elders were used to mobilise neighbours into the political movement. Their logic was \\"Even if victory is not achieved, we will fully mature as human beings with our [heroic] efforts\\".Luong (2010), p. 90. Y√™n B√°i mutiny At around 01:30 on Monday, February 10, 1930, approximately 40 troops belonging to the 2nd Battalion of the Fourth R√©giment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois stationed at Y√™n B√°i, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDD, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers.Rettig, p. 310. The rebels had intended to split into three groups: the first group was to infiltrate the infantry, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support among Vietnamese troops; the second, supported by the VNQDD civilians, was to break into the post headquarters; and the third group would enter the officers' quarters.Duiker, p. 163. The French were caught off guard; five were killed and three seriously wounded. The mutineers isolated a few more French officers from their men, even managing to raise the VNQDD flag above one of the buildings. About two hours later, however, it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, and the remaining 550 Vietnamese soldiers helped quell the rebellion rather than participate in it. The insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indig√®ne town post and could not convince the frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a French Indochinese counterattack scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Y√™n B√°i. That same evening, two further insurrectionary attempts failed in the S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng sector. A raid on the Garde indig√®ne post in H∆∞ng H√≥a was repelled by the Vietnamese guards, who appeared to have been tipped off. In the nearby town of Kinh Khe, VNQDD members killed the instructor Nguyen Quang Kinh and one of his wives. After destroying the Garde indig√®ne post in L√¢m Thao, the VNQDD briefly seized control of the district seat. At sunrise, a new Garde indig√®ne unit arrived and inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents, mortally wounding Nhu.Rettig, p. 311. Aware of the events in the upper delta region, Pho Duc Chinh fled and abandoned a planned attack on the S∆°n T√¢y garrison, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities. On February 10, a VNQDD member injured a policeman at a Hanoi checkpoint; at night, Arts students threw bombs at government buildings, which they regarded as part of the repressive power of the colonial state. On the night of February 15‚Äì16, H·ªçc and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vƒ©nh B·∫£o, in Th√°i B√¨nh and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng provinces respectively, for a few hours. In the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at Co Am village; on the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior Ren√© Robin dispatched 200 Gardes indig√®nes, eight French commanders and two S√ªret√© inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. H·ªçc and his lieutenants, Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended. A series of trials were held to prosecute those arrested during the uprising. The largest number of death penalties was handed down by the first Criminal Commission, which convened at Yen Bay. Among the 87 people found guilty at Yen Bay, 46 were servicemen. Some argued in their own defence that they had been \\"surprised and forced to take part in the insurrection\\". Of the 87 convicted, 39 were sentenced to death, five to deportation, 33 to life sentences of forced labour, nine to 20 years imprisonment, and one to five years of forced labour. Of those condemned to death, 24 were civilians and 15 were servicemen.Rettig, p. 316. Presidential pardons reduced the number of death penalties from 39 to 13. H·ªçc and Chinh were among the 13 who were executed on June 17, 1930. The condemned men cried \\"Viet Nam!\\" as the guillotine fell. H·ªçc wrote a final plea to the French, in a letter that claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with French authorities, but that their intransigence had forced him to revolt. H·ªçc contended that France could only stay in Indochina if they dropped their \\"brutal\\" policies, and became more amiable towards the Vietnamese. The VNQDD leader called for universal education, training in commerce and industry, and an end to the corrupt practices of the French-installed mandarins.Duiker, p. 164. Exile in Yunnan Following Yen Bay, the VNQDD became more diffuse, with many factions effectively acting virtually autonomously of one another.Marr (1995), pp. 165‚Äì167. Le Huu Canh‚Äîwho had tried to stall the failed mutiny‚Äîattempted to reunite what remained of the party under the banner of peaceful reform. Other factions, however, remained faithful to H·ªçc's legacy, recreating the movement in the Hanoi-Haiphong area. A failed assassination attempt on Governor-General Pasquier led to French crackdowns in 1931 and 1932. The survivors escaped to Yunnan in southern China, where some of Nghiep's supporters were still active. The Yunnan VNQDD was in fact a section of the Chinese Kuomintang, who protected its members from the Chinese government while funds were raised by robbery and extortion along the Sino-Vietnamese border. This eventually led to a Chinese government crackdown, but VNQDD members continued to train at the Yunnan Military School; some enlisted in the nationalist Chinese army while others learned to manufacture weapons and munitions in the Yunnan arsenal. alt=Man with a black cylindrical hat, thick black beard, rimless glasses, wearing a black tunic, stands in front of a white background. Nghiep was briefly jailed by Yunnan authorities, but continued to run the party from his cell. Upon his release in 1933, Nghiep consolidated the party with similar groups in the area, including some followers of Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u who had formed a Canton-based organisation with similar aims in 1925. Chau's group had formed in opposition to the communist tendencies of Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League. However, Ho betrayed Chau to eliminate a potential rival and to pocket a reward.Currey, pp. 15‚Äì20. With nationalist Chinese aid, Chau's followers had set up a League of Oppressed Oriental Peoples, a Pan-Asian group that ended in failure. In 1932 the League made the point of declaring a \\"Provisional Indochinese Government\\" at Canton.Hammer (1955), p. 84. In July 1933, Chau's group was integrated into Nghiep's Yunnan organisation. In 1935, Nghiep surrendered to the French consulate in Shanghai. The remainder of the VNQDD was paralysed by infighting and began losing political relevance, with only moderate activity until the outbreak of World War II and Japan's invasion of French Indochina in 1940. They attempted to organise workers along the Yunnan railway, threatening occasional border assaults, with little success.Duiker, p. 165. The VNQDD was gradually overshadowed as the leading Vietnamese independence organisation by Ho's Indochinese Communist Party (ICP).Tucker, p. 175. In 1940, Ho arrived in Yunnan, which was a hotbed of both ICP and VNQDD activity. He initiated collaboration between the ICP and other nationalists such as the VNQDD. At the time, World War II had broken out and Japan had conquered most of eastern China and replaced the French in Vietnam. Ho moved east to the neighbouring province of Guangxi, where Chinese military leaders had been attempting to organise Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army. Under the umbrella of KMT activities, a broad alliance of nationalists emerged. With Ho at the forefront, the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Independence League, usually known as the Viet Minh) was formed and based in the town of Chinghsi. The pro-VNQDD nationalist Ho Ngoc Lam, a KMT army officer and former disciple of Phan Boi Chau,Marr (1995), p. 165. was named as the deputy of Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng, later to be Ho's Prime Minister. The front was later broadened and renamed the Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh (Vietnam Liberation League). It was an uneasy situation, as another VNQDD leader, Truong Boi Cong, a graduate of a KMT military academy, wanted to challenge the communists for pre-eminence, while V≈© H·ªìng Khanh led a virulently anti-communist VNQDD faction.Marr (1995), p. 167. The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General Zhang Fakui created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Vietnamese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyen Hai Than, who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese. General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces. At one stage, the communists made an appeal for other Vietnamese anti-colonialists to join forces, but condemned Khanh as an \\"opportunist\\" and \\"fake revolutionary\\" in their letter.Marr (1995), p. 196. The cooperation in the border area lasted for only a few months before VNQDD officials complained to the local KMT officials that the communists, led by Dong and V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, were attempting to dominate the league. This prompted the local authorities to shut down the front's activities.Duiker, pp. 272‚Äì273.  Post World War II  In March 1945, the VNQDD received a boost, when Imperial Japan, which had occupied Vietnam since 1941, deposed the French administration, and installed the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime.Marr (1995), pp. 56‚Äì61. This resulted in the release of some anti-French activists, including VNQDD members.Marr (1995), p. 42. On August 15, 1945, Japanese forces in Vietnam surrendered to the Republic of China. General Lu Han (ÁõßÊº¢) was the representative of the Nationalist Army. The government of the Republic of China favored the VNQDD over Viet Minh which led to Ho's reliance on the rebel Chinese communists. Ho's Viet Minh seized power and set up a provisional government in the wake of Japan's withdrawal from Vietnam.Jacobs, p. 22. This move violated a prior agreement between the member parties of the Viet Nam Cach Mang Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Revolutionary League), which included the VNQDD as well as the Vietminh, and Ho was pressured to broaden his government's appeal by including the VNQDD (now led by Nguy·ªÖn T∆∞·ªùng Tam).Hammer (1955), p. 139. The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the mandarin governance system and hold national elections with universal suffrage in two hold. The VNQDD objected to this, fearing that the communists would perpetrate electoral fraud.Currey, p. 107. After the seizure of power, hundreds of VNQDD members returned from China, only to be killed at the border by the Vietminh. Nevertheless, the VNQDD arrived in northern Vietnam with arms and supplies from the KMT, in addition to its prestige as a Vietnamese nationalist organisation. Nationalist China backed the VNQDD in the hope of gaining more influence over its southern neighbour. Ho tried to broaden his support in order to strengthen himself, in addition to decreasing Chinese and French power. He hoped that by co-opting VNQDD members, he could shut out the KMT.Currey, p. 103. The communists had no intention of sharing power with anyone in the long term and regarded the move as purely a strategic exercise.Currey, p. 108. Giap, the Vietminh's military chief, called the VNQDD a \\"group of reactionaries plotting to rely on Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang and their rifle barrels to snatch a few crumbs\\". The VNQDD dominated the main control lines between northern Vietnam and China near L√†o Cai. They funded their operations from the tribute that they levied from the local populace.Hammer (1955), p. 140. Once the majority of the non-communist nationalists had returned to Vietnam, the VNQDD banded with them to form an anti-Vietminh alliance. The VNQDD and the Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang (DVQDD, Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) started their own military academy at Y√™n B√°i to train their own military recruits. Armed confrontations between the Vietminh and the nationalists occurred regularly in major northern cities. The VNQDD were aided by the KMT, who were in northern Vietnam as the result of an international agreement to stabilise the country. The KMT often disarmed local Vietminh bands. The VNQDD then established their national headquarters in Hanoi, and began to publish newspapers, expounding their policies and explaining their ideology. The OSS agent Archimedes Patti, who was based in Kunming and northern Vietnam, reported that the VNQDD were \\"hopelessly disoriented politically\\" and felt that they had no idea of how to run a government. He speculated that the VNQDD were driven by \\"desires for personal power and economic gain\\". Giap accused them of being \\"bandits\\". Military and newspaper attacks between the groups occurred regularly, but a power-sharing agreement was put in place until the elections occurred in order to end the attacks and strengthen national unity to further the goal of independence.Currey, p. 110. The communists also allowed the VNQDD to continue printing material.Marr (1981), p. 409. However, the agreement was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Gi√°p and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's V≈© H·ªìng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement turned out to be a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle.Currey, p. 111. Meanwhile, Gi√°p was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events. Ho scheduled elections for December 23, but he made a deal with the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi, which assured them of 50 and 20 seats in the new national assembly respectively, regardless of the poll results. This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government, in which Tam served as foreign minister.Hammer (1955), p. 144. For the communists' part, they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD,Currey, p. 109. and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations. The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation, citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.Currey, pp. 111‚Äì112.  War against French colonial rule  The Ho‚ÄìSainteny agreement, signed on March 6, 1946, saw the return of French colonial forces to Vietnam,Tucker, pp. 181‚Äì182. replacing the Chinese nationalists who were supposed to be maintaining order. The VNQDD were now without their main supporters. As a result, the VNQDD were further attacked by the French, who often encircled VNQDD strongholds, enabling Viet Minh attacks. Gi√°p's army hunted down VNQDD troops and cleared them from the Red River Delta, seizing arms and arresting party members, who were falsely charged with crimes ranging from counterfeiting to unlawful arms possession.Hammer (1955), p. 176.Currey, p. 120. The Viet Minh massacred thousands of VNQDD members and other nationalists in a large scale purge. Most of the survivors fled to China or French-controlled areas in Vietnam. After driving the VNQDD out of their Hanoi headquarters on On Nhu Hau Street, Gi√°p ordered his agents to construct an underground torture chamber on the premises. They then planted exhumed and badly decomposed bodies in the chamber, and accused the VNQDD of gruesome murders, although most of the dead were VNQDD members who had been killed by Gi√°p's men.Currey, p. 126. The communists made a public spectacle of the scene in an attempt to discredit the VNQDD, but the truth eventually came out and the \\"On Nhu Hau Street affair\\" lowered their public image.Currey, p. 127. When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD seats were filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 remained by the end of the session.Hammer (1955), p. 178. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office.Hammer (1955), p. 181. In any case, the VNQDD never had any power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met only once a year.Currey, pp. 118‚Äì119. In any case, the fa√ßade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into full flight. A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Gi√°p's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.Jamieson, p. 215.  Post- independence  alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. After Vietnam gained independence in 1954, the Geneva Accords partitioned the country into a communist north and an anti-communist south, but stipulated that there were to be 300 days of free passage between the two zones.Jacobs, pp. 53‚Äì55. During Operation Passage to Freedom, most VNQDD members migrated to the south. The VNQDD was deeply divided after years of communist pressure, lacked strong leadership and no longer had a coherent military presence, although they had a large presence in central Vietnam.Hammer (1987), pp. 78‚Äì79. The party's disarray was only exacerbated by the actions of autocratic President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, who imprisoned many of its members. Diem's administration was a \\"dictatorship by Catholics‚ÄîA new kind of fascism\\", according to the title of a VNQDD pamphlet published in July 1955. The VNQDD tried to revolt against Diem in 1955 in central Vietnam.Hammer (1987), p. 140. During the transition period after Geneva, the VNQDD sought to set up a new military academy in central Vietnam, but they were crushed by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, who ran the region for his elder brother Di·ªám,Hammer (1987), p. 131. dismantled and jailed VNQDD members and leaders. Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) felt that Di·ªám discriminated against them because of their political leanings.Hammer (1987), p. 156. Di·ªám used the secret Catholic C·∫ßn Lao Party to keep control of the army and stifle attempts by VNQDD members to rise through the ranks.Hammer (1987), p. 130. During the Di·ªám era, the VNQDD were implicated in two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, allowing time for loyalists to relieve the president.Karnow, pp. 252‚Äì253. Many of the officers involved had links to or were members of the VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed.Hammer (1987), pp. 131‚Äì132. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and V≈© H·ªìng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed.Hammer (1987), pp. 154‚Äì155. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ª´‚Äîson of a prominent VNQDD leader‚Äîand Ph·∫°m Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc, bombed the Independence Palace in a bid to kill Di·ªám and his family, but their targets escaped unharmed.Karnow, pp. 280‚Äì281. Di·ªám was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Di·ªám.Hammer (1987), p. 250. Many VNQDD members were part of the ARVN, which sought to prevent South Vietnam from being overrun by communists during the Vietnam War,Hammer (1987), pp. 131‚Äì133. and they were known for being more anti-communist than most of their compatriots. After the fall of Di·ªám and the execution of C·∫©n in May 1964,Hammer (1987), pp. 306‚Äì307. the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously.Goodman, p. 54. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes.Blair, pp. 130‚Äì131. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Qu·∫£ng Nam approached the Australians in an attempt to have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected.Blair, p. 134. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.Blair, p. 86. In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising erupted in central Vietnam, in which some Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war, hoping to end foreign involvement in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them.Blair, pp. 136‚Äì138.Karnow, pp. 460‚Äì464. On April 19, clashes erupted in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province between the Buddhists and the VNQDD, prompting the local ARVN commander T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh to forcibly restrain the two groups. Three days later the VNQDD accused the Buddhists of attacking their premises in H·ªôi An and Da Nang, while US officials reported that the VNQDD were making plans to assassinate leading Buddhists, such as the activist monk Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang.Topmiller, p. 63. The VNQDD contested the national elections of 1967, the first elections since the fall of Diem, which were rigged‚ÄîDiem and his people invariably gained more than 95% of the vote and sometimes exceeded the number of registered voters.Jacobs, p. 95.Karnow, p. 239. The campaign was disorganised due to a lack of infrastructure and some VNQDD candidates were not formally sanctioned by any hierarchy. The VNQDD focused on the districts in I Corps in central Vietnam where they were thought to be strong.Goodman, p. 56. There were 60 seats in the senate, and the six victorious tickets would see all ten of their members elected. The VNQDD entered eight tickets in the senate election, and while they totalled 15% of the national vote between them, the most of any grouping, it was diluted between the groupings; none of the tickets and thus none of the candidates were elected. This contrasted with one Catholic alliance with three tickets that won only 8% of the vote, but had all 30 candidates elected.Goodman, pp. 57‚Äì58. They won nine seats in the lower house, a small minority presence, all from districts in central Vietnam, where they tended to poll between 20 and 40% in various areas.Goodman, pp. 62‚Äì63. The VNQDD members made several loose alliances with H√≤a H·∫£o members of the lower house.Goodman, p. 160. During the Tet Offensive of 1968, the communists attacked and seized control of Hu·∫ø for a month. During this time, in the Massacre at Hu·∫ø they executed around 3,000‚Äì6,000 people that they had taken prisoner,Willbanks, pp. 99‚Äì103. out of a total population of 140,000.Willbanks, p. 54. The communists had compiled a list of \\"reactionaries\\" to be liquidated before their assault.Willbanks, p. 100. Known for their virulent anti-communism, VNQDD members appeared to have been disproportionately targeted in the massacre.Jamieson, p. 321. After the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War, the remnants of the VNQDD were again targeted by the victorious communists. As Vietnam is a single-party state led by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the VNQDD is illegal. Some VNQDD members fled to the West, where they continued their political activities. The VNQDD remains respected among some sections of the overseas Vietnamese community as Vietnam's leading anti-communist organisation.Tucker, p. 443.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between to the west and to the east. The station is managed by Greater Anglia who operate all services. The Engineer's Line Reference for line is WIS; the station's three-letter station code is ALN. The single platform, north of the running line, has an operational length for eight-coach trains. The line and station were opened on 1 June 1889 for goods and on 1 October 1889 for passenger services by the Great Eastern Railway. The facilities included a single platform with station buildings, a goods yard, and a 30-lever signal box south of the station. Two miles east of Althorne, Creeksea sidings (facing points in the \\"down\\" direction) received traffic to and from the Creeksea ferry from 1889 to 1947. Ownership passed to the London and North Eastern Railway following the Grouping of 1923, and then to the Eastern Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced, Althorne was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways. The goods yard closed on 19 December 1960, and the signal box on 21 January 1967. The level crossing to the east of the station was normally closed to road vehicles but was later converted to an automatic open crossing with lights. Electrification of the Wickford to Southminster line using 25 kV overhead line electrification (OLE) was completed on 12 May 1986. Services The typical off-peak service is of one train every 40 minutes westbound to and eastbound to with additional services at peak times. Some peak services continue to or from and/or via the Great Eastern Main Line. On Sundays, the service is reduced is to hourly. Services are typically formed of rolling stock, built by BREL York and introduced in 1988.

It can refer to the act itself or the person who carries it out. Used in current common law terminology as gender-neutral for either spouse or significant other of either sex. The killing of a wife is called uxoricide. Prevalence According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mariticide made up 30% of the total spouse murders in the United States. Data not including proxy-murders conducted on behalf of the wife. FBI data from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s found that for every 100 husbands who killed their wives in the United States, about 75 women killed their husbands indicating a 3:4 ratio of mariticide to uxoricide. English common law Under English common law it was a petty treason until 1828, and until it was altered under the Treason Act 1790 the punishment was to be strangled and burnt at the stake.

Low has been called the \\"father of radio guidance systems\\" due to his pioneering work on guided rockets, planes and torpedoes. He was a pioneer in many fields though, often leading the way for others, but his lack of discipline meant he hardly ever saw a project through, being easily distracted by new ideas. If it wasn't for this inability to see things to a conclusion, Low could well have been remembered as one of the great men of science. Many of his scientific contemporaries disliked him, due in part to his using the title Professor, which technically he wasn't entitled to do as he didn't occupy an academic chair. His love of the limelight and publicity probably also added to the dislike. Archibald M. Low was one of the many forecasters of the concept of television in the early 1920s.The Machine Age, TIME Magazine, 4 February 1924 Early life Low was born in Purley, London, the second son of John and Gertrude Low. His father was an engineer and Low's interest in all things mechanical and scientific was fired by visits to his father's place of work. The family moved to Erith in Kent when Low was still a baby. He was sent to Preparatory school at Colet Court when his family had to visit Australia. A few years later he also got to visit Sydney Australia with his family. He recalls being amazed to find that telephones were fitted in every house. As a young boy Low was forever experimenting at home, building homemade steam turbines or conducting chemical experiments that brought havoc to his local neighbourhood and caused his parents to receive many complaints about the bangs, smells and gases created by young Archie. At the age of 11 he was enrolled into St Paul's School, an institution where he didn't fit in, being as he put it \\"too much of an individual\\". One of his classmates for several years was Bernard Montgomery, whom Low recalled as being \\"rather dull\\". Aged 16 Low entered the Central Technical College, an institution far more to his liking, here his abilities really started to show. Under the guidance of his mentor Professor Ashcroft, Low's mercurial mind was given free rein over many of the scientific disciplines. During his time at the CTC Low designed a drawing device which he called \\"The Low flexible and adjustable curve\\". This device along with a dotted line pen and a self filling draughtsman's pen were marketed by Thornton's, a renowned instrument maker based in Manchester. He also spent a year devising and making a selector mechanism which allowed a lever when moved to fall into a pre-selected slot. It wasn't until 32 years later that pre-selected gears came in, long after Low had originally thought of them. Early career Low joined his uncle, Edward Low's engineering firm, \\"The Low Accessories and Ignition Company\\", which at the time was the second oldest engineering firm in the City of London. Unfortunately the company was in a constant struggle for solvency. Edward Low did what he could financially to help get his nephew's ideas off the ground, but what was really needed was a rich investor. During this pre-war period Low was constantly coming up with big new ideas, such as his Forced Induction Engine \\"The Low Forced Induction Engine, The Motor Cycle, 24 Oct 1912, pp1192-1193 (which in modern parlance would be called a gasoline direct injection engine), which was further developed with the large engine builder F.E. Baker Ltd and exhibited on their stand at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show in November 1912. He also invented gadgets like the whistling egg-boiler which he christened \\"The Chanticleer\\". It went on to sell very well, earning him some much-needed money. He also experimented with gas turbines, but the alloys available at that time wouldn't stand up to the required heat. In May 1914 Low gave the first demonstration of what was to become television, he called it TeleVista. This demonstration was given to the Institute of Automobile Engineers and was entitled \\"Seeing By Wireless\\". Low's invention was crude and under-developed but the idea was there. The main deficiency was the Selenium cell used for converting light waves into electric impulses, which responded too slowly thus spoiling the effect. The demonstration certainly garnered a lot of media interest with The Times reporting on 30 May; On 29 May The Daily Chronicle reported; Low, of course failed to follow up this early promising work, due in part to his temperamental failings and also of course the outbreak of World War I later that year. Nature commented that the work was overblown in \\"Sensational paragraphs on seeing by wire\\".Nature''June 4 ', 1914, p.357 The Great War The Experimental Works staff of the RFC, Low is front centre. When war broke out, Low joined the military and received officer training. After a few months he was promoted to captain and seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, the precursor of the RAF. His brief was to use his civilian research to find a way to remotely control an aircraft, so it could be used as a guided missile. With two other officers (Captain Poole and Lieutenant Bowen) under him, they set to work to see if it were possible. This project was called \\"Aerial Target\\" or AT a misnomer to fool the Germans into thinking it was about building a drone plane to test anti-aircraft capabilities. After they built a prototype, General Sir David Henderson (Director-General of Military Aeronatics) ordered that the Royal Flying Corps Experimental Works should be created to build the first proper \\"Aerial Target\\" complete with explosive warhead. As head of the Experimental Works, Low was given about 30 picked men, including jewellers, carpenters and aircraftsmen in order to get the pilotless plane built as quickly as possible. The plane, the Ruston Proctor AT from its manufacturer was designed by H P Folland. It had its first trial on 21 March 1917 at Upavon Central Flying School near Salisbury Plain, attended by 30‚Äì40 allied Generals. The AT was launched from the back of a lorry using compressed air (another first). Low and his team successfully demonstrated their ability to control the craft before engine failure led to its crash landing. A subsequent full trial on 6 July 1917 was cut short as an aerial had been lost at takeoff. At a later date an electrically driven gyro (yet another first) was added to the plane, but ultimately the \\"Aerial Target\\" project was not followed up after the war, due to the shortsightedness of military planners. In 1917 Low and his team also invented the first electrically steered rocket (the world's first wireless, or wire-guided rocket), almost an exact counterpart of the one used by the Germans in 1942 against merchant shipping. Low's inventions during the war were to a large extent before their time and hence were under-appreciated by the Government of the day, although the Germans were well aware of how dangerous his inventions might be. In 1915 two attempts were made to assassinate him; the first involved shots being fired through his laboratory window in Paul Street; the second attempt was from a visitor with a German accent who came to Low's office and offered him a cigarette, which upon analysis contained enough strychnine chloride to kill. Lows principles were adopted by the Air Ministry for the Larynx \\"Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine\\", and explosive laden autopilot-ed aircraft which was developed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment from 1925. Further developments continued by the British before and during the Second World War. During World War II the Germans also made good use of Low's 1918 rocket guidance system and used it as one of the foundations for their V projects. So yet again Low was leading the way. Low could have made a considerable amount of money from these inventions, but his patents couldn't stay in force for the statutory period, as he was in the employment of the War Department everything he invented was as a part of his duties so he couldn't benefit financially from them. Inter-war years Not long after the war Low started the Low Engineering Company Ltd in association with the Hon. C. N. Bruce (later Lord Aberdare). The company offices were on Kensington High Street, and Low spent much of his time trying to bring his inventions to fruition. As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. One of the better gadgets was a motor scooter that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir Henry Norman. Despite his best efforts, business wasn't his strong point. An example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend Lord Brabazon and others. It was entitled Armchair Science, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold off. Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. He was a regular attendee at Brooklands and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25 mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. One of Low's peeves was excess noise, to this end he invented an audiometer to measure and record noise in a visual form. He conducted experiments on the London Underground and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels. In 1938 Low had lunch with a gentleman called William Joyce. Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run. Low declined the offer being too busy; it was only a couple of years later that Joyce gained infamy as Lord Haw-Haw. A few of Low's inventions from this period are: *Using infra- red photography to check head space in engines; *A machine for reproducing photographs by radio; *An audiometer that was a forerunner of sound photography at high speed (used in engineering and architectural work); *A device for converting ordinary print to Braille using photo electric cells; *Cap-detonating sparkplug. Second World War and later At the outbreak of the Second World War Low initially joined the Air Ministry in a civil capacity. His job was to examine captured German aircraft and prepare reports for British pilots to enable them to identify the weak points of the enemy aircraft. Later on he joined the Royal Pioneer Corps and was promoted to Major. Between experiments in his back garden laboratory, he gave frequent talks to service personnel on scientific matters. Low was frequently in bad health from the late 1930s onwards, having never fully recovered from a bout of pneumonia he suffered a few years earlier. Although nothing that he experimented with during the war ultimately came to fruition, he did work on some interesting projects: *The 'W' bomb ‚Äì a riverine mine for Operation Royal Marine being designed by MD1. It floated just beneath the surface, came up when needed and spread a kind of umbrella out of itself which would detonate when touched. The primary inventors were Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae ‚Äì the latter was formerly an editor of Armchair Science with whom Low was on friendly terms.Macrae, 1972. p.29 *A bomb that when dropped on airfields would be buried to the hilt but leave trailing wires on the surface. An aircraft touching these wires would detonate the bomb. Quotations Later life Low died at his London home in 1956 aged 68. Cause of death was a malignant tumour on his lung. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. In 1976 Low was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame Gravestone, Brompton Cemetery, London Works Low was a prolific author of science books. He aimed several of his books at the layman to try to nurture interest in science and engineering. Quite a few of his books contained predictions on scientific advancements. As well as these non-fiction books he wrote four science fiction novels for the younger reader. =Non-fiction= *The Two Stroke Engine:A manual of the coming form of the internal combustion engine (1916) *Wireless Possibilities (1924) *The Future (1925) *Tendencies of Modern Science (1930) *On My Travels(1930) *The Wonder Book of Inventions (1930) *Popular Scientific Recreations (1933) *Science in Wonderland (1935) *Recent Inventions (1935) *Great Scientific Achievements (1936) *Conquering Space and Time (1937) *Life and its Story (1937) *Home Experiments (1937) *Electrical Inventions (1937) *Science for the Home (1938) *What New Wonders!

It was also released as a single in the United States, but it did not chart. Overview The track is done in the style of a 1950s rock and roll number. Some of lead singer Robert Plant's lyrics are a homage to rockabilly idioms. John Bonham's drumming is controlled rather than bombastic, driven by interplay between the ride cymbal's bell and snare. Meanwhile, Jimmy Page's guitar solo is short and measured, coming in halfway through the song. The band recorded the song at Musicland Studios in Germany, and it only took them about an hour to write it. Plant sang from a wheelchair because he was recovering at the time from a car accident he had sustained in Greece. Plant considers \\"Candy Store Rock\\" to be one of his favourite songs from Presence. Live renditions \\"Candy Store Rock\\" was never performed live by the band at Led Zeppelin concerts,Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, . except for a brief riff by Page at Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 20 April 1977. However, a one- minute improvisation was played live in concert by Page and Plant as a \\"Black Dog\\" introduction on 26 July 1995 at Wembley Arena. The song was also played live in Montreux by Page and Plant on 7 July 2001. Reception In a contemporary review for Presence, Stephen Davis of Rolling Stone described \\"Candy Store Rock\\" as \\"perfectly evoking the Los Angeles milieu in which the Zep composed [Presence].\\" He further described the song as sounding like \\"an unholy hybrid in which Buddy Holly is grafted onto the quivering stem of David Bowie.\\" In a retrospective review of Presence (Deluxe Edition), Andrew Doscas of PopMatters described \\"Candy Store Rock\\" as sounding like \\"the prequel to 1971's \\"Rock and Roll\\"\\" from their fourth album. Singer Robert Plant later described \\"Candy Store Rock\\", along with \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", as the \\"saving grace[s] of Presence\\". Plant said the song's rhythm section was inspiring to him, partly due to the album's tumultuous recording sessions.

(The numbers represent proposed historical dates in the Western calendar). Austro-Asiatic linguistic family, going back 8000 years. (The numbers represent proposed historical dates in the Western calendar). In historical linguistics, the tree model (also Stammbaum, genetic, or cladistic model) is a model of the evolution of languages analogous to the concept of a family tree, particularly a phylogenetic tree in the biological evolution of species. As with species, each language is assumed to have evolved from a single parent or \\"mother\\" language, with languages that share a common ancestor belonging to the same language family. Popularized by the German linguist August Schleicher in 1853,Fran√ßois (2014). the tree model has always been a common method of describing genetic relationships between languages since the first attempts to do so. It is central to the field of comparative linguistics, which involves using evidence from known languages and observed rules of language feature evolution to identify and describe the hypothetical proto-languages ancestral to each language family, such as Proto-Indo-European and the Indo-European languages. However, this is largely a theoretical, qualitative pursuit, and linguists have always emphasized the inherent limitations of the tree model due to the large role played by horizontal transmission in language evolution, ranging from loanwords to creole languages that have multiple mother languages. The wave model was developed in 1872 by Schleicher's student Johannes Schmidt as an alternative to the tree model that incorporates horizontal transmission. The tree model also has the same limitations as biological taxonomy with respect to the species problem of quantizing a continuous phenomenon that includes exceptions like ring species in biology and dialect continua in language. The concept of a linkage was developed in response and refers to a group of languages that evolved from a dialect continuum rather than from linguistically isolated child languages of a single language. History of the model =The confusion of Babel= Family tree of Biblical tribes Augustine of Hippo supposed that each of the descendants of Noah founded a nation and that each nation was given its own language: Assyrian for Assur, Hebrew for Heber, and so on. In all he identified 72 nations, tribal founders and languages. The confusion and dispersion occurred in the time of Peleg, son of Heber, son of Shem, son of Noah.Genesis 10:251 Chronicles 1:19. Augustine then makes a hypothesis not unlike those of later historical linguists, that the family of Heber \\"preserved that language not unreasonably believed to have been the common language of the race ... thenceforth named Hebrew.\\" Most of the 72 languages, however, date to many generations after Heber. St. Augustine solves this first problem by supposing that Heber, who lived 430 years, was still alive when God assigned the 72. =Ursprache, the language of paradise= St. Augustine's hypothesis stood without major question for over a thousand years. Then, in a series of tracts, published in 1684, expressing skepticism concerning various beliefs, especially Biblical, Sir Thomas Browne wrote: > \\"Though the earth were widely peopled before the flood ... yet whether, > after a large dispersion, and the space of sixteen hundred years, men > maintained so uniform a language in all parts, ... may very well be > doubted.\\" Garden of Eden, home of the Ursprache By then, discovery of the New World and exploration of the Far East had brought knowledge of numbers of new languages far beyond the 72 calculated by St. Augustine. Citing the Native American languages, Browne suggests the \\"confusion of tongues at first fell only upon those present in Sinaar at the work of Babel ....\\" For those \\"about the foot of the hills, whereabout the ark rested ... their primitive language might in time branch out into several parts of Europe and This is an inkling of a tree. In Browne's view, simplification from a larger aboriginal language than Hebrew could account for the differences in language. He suggests ancient Chinese, from which the others descended by \\"confusion, admixtion and corruption\\". Later he invokes \\"commixture and alteration.\\" Browne reports a number of reconstructive activities by the scholars of the times: > \\"The learned Casaubon conceiveth that a dialogue might be composed in Saxon, > only of such words as are derivable from the Greek ... Verstegan made no > doubt that he could contrive a letter that might be understood by the > English, Dutch, and East Frislander ... And if, as the learned Buxhornius > contendeth, the Scythian language as the mother tongue runs throughout the > nations of Europe, and even as far as Persia, the community on many words, > between so many nations, hath more reasonable traduction and were rather > derivable from the common tongue diffused through them all, than from any > particular nation, which hath also borrowed and holdeth but at second hand.\\" The confusion at the Tower of Babel was thus removed as an obstacle by setting it aside. Attempts to find similarities in all languages were resulting in the gradual uncovering of an ancient master language from which all the other languages derive. Browne undoubtedly did his writing and thinking well before 1684. In that same revolutionary century in Britain James Howell published of Epistolae Ho-Elianae, quasi-fictional letters to various important persons in the realm containing valid historical information. In Letter LVIII the metaphor of a tree of languages appears fully developed short of being a professional linguist's view: > \\"I will now hoist sail for the Netherlands, whose language is the same > dialect with the English, and was so from the beginning, being both of them > derived from the high Dutch [Howell is wrong here]: The Danish also is but a > branch of the same tree ... Now the High Dutch or Teutonick Tongue, is one > of the prime and most spacious Maternal Languages of Europe ... it was the > language of the Goths and Vandals, and continueth yet of the greatest part > of Poland and Hungary, who have a Dialect of hers for their vulgar tongue > ... Some of her writers would make this world believe that she was the > language spoken in paradise.\\" The search for \\"the language of paradise\\" was on among all the linguists of Europe. Those who wrote in Latin called it the lingua prima, the lingua primaeva or the lingua primigenia. In English it was the Adamic language; in German, the Ursprache or the hebr√§ische Ursprache if one believed it was Hebrew. This mysterious language had the aura of purity and incorruption about it, and those qualities were the standards used to select candidates. This concept of Ursprache came into in use well before the neo-grammarians adopted it for their proto-languages. The gap between the widely divergent families of languages remained unclosed. =The first Indo-Europeanists= Proposed homeland of the Indo-Europeans, western Kazakhstan On February 2, 1786, Sir William Jones delivered his Third Anniversary Discourse to the Asiatic Society as its president on the topic of the Hindus. In it he applied the logic of the tree model to three languages, Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, but for the first time in history on purely linguistic grounds, noting \\"a stronger affinity, both in the roots of the verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; ....\\" He went on to postulate that they sprang from \\"some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.\\" To them he added Gothic, Celtic and Persian as \\"to the same family.\\" Jones did not name his \\"common source\\" nor develop the idea further, but it was taken up by the linguists of the times. In the (London) Quarterly Review of late 1813-1814, Thomas Young published a review of Johann Christoph Adelung's Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde (\\"Mithridates, or a General History of Languages\\"), Volume I of which had come out in 1806, and Volumes II and III, , continued by Johann Severin Vater. Adelung's work described some 500 \\"languages and dialects\\" and hypothesized a universal descent from the language of paradise, located in Kashmir central to the total range of the 500. Young begins by pointing out Adelung's indebtedness to Conrad Gesner's Mithridates, de Differentiis Linguarum of 1555 and other subsequent catalogues of languages and Kashmir (red), Adelung's location of Eden. Young undertakes to present Adelung's classification. The monosyllabic type is most ancient and primitive, spoken in Asia, to the east of Eden, in the direction of Adam's exit from Eden. Then follows Jones' group, still without a name, but attributed to Jones: \\"Another ancient and extensive class of languages united by a greater number of resemblances than can well be altogether accidental.\\" For this class he offers a name, \\"Indoeuropean,\\" the first known linguistic use of the word, but not its first known use. The British East India Company was using \\"Indo-European commerce\\" to mean the trade of commodities between India and Europe. All the evidence Young cites for the ancestral group are the most similar words: mother, father, etc. Adelung's additional classes were the Tataric, the African and the American, which depend on geography and a presumed descent from Eden. Young does not share Adelung's enthusiasm for the language of paradise, and brands it as mainly speculative. Young's designation, successful in English, was only one of several candidates proposed between 1810 and 1867: indo-germanique (Conrad Malte-Brun, 1810), japetisk (Rasmus Christian Rask, 1815), Indo-Germanisch (Julius Klaproth, 1823), indisch-teutsch (F. Schmitthenner, 1826), sanskritisch (Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1827), indokeltisch (A. F. Pott, 1840), arioeuropeo (Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, 1854), Aryan (Max M√ºller, 1861) and aryaque (H. Chav√©e, 1867). These men were all polyglots and prodigies in languages. Klaproth, author of the successful German-language candidate, Indo-Germanisch, who criticised Jones for his uncritical method, knew Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and a number of other languages with their scripts. The concept of a Biblical Ursprache appealed to their imagination. As hope of finding it gradually died they fell back on the growing concept of common Indo-European spoken by nomadic tribes on the plains of Eurasia, and although they made a good case that this language can be deduced by the methods of comparative linguistics, in fact that is not how they obtained it. It was the one case in which their efforts to find the Ursprache succeeded. =The neogrammarians= The model is due in its most strict formulation to the Neogrammarians. The model relies on earlier conceptions of William Jones, Franz Bopp and August Schleicher by adding the exceptionlessness of the sound laws and the regularity of the process. The linguist perhaps most responsible for establishing the link to Darwinism was August Schleicher.Schleicher's tree model That he was comparing his Stammbaum, or family tree of languages, to Darwin's presentation of evolution shortly after that presentation, is proved by the open letter he wrote in 1863 to Ernst Haeckel, published posthumously, however. In 1869, Haeckel had suggested he read Origin of Species. After reading it Schleicher wrote Die Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft, \\"Darwinism tested by the Science of Language.\\" In a scenario reminiscent of that between Darwin and Wallace over the discovery of evolution (both discovered it independently), Schleicher endorsed Darwin's presentation, but criticised it for not inserting any species. He then presented a Stammbaum of languages, which, however, was not the first he had published. The evolution of languages was not the source of Darwin's theory of evolution. He had based that on variation of species, such as he had observed in finches in the Galapagos Islands, who had appeared to be modifications of a common ancestor. Selection of domestic species to produce a new variety also played a role in his conclusions. The first edition of Origin of Species in 1859 discusses the language tree as though de novo under the topic of classification. Darwin criticises the synchronic method devised by Linnaeus, suggesting that it be replaced by a \\"natural arrangement\\" based on evolution. He says: > \\"It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking > the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a > genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best > classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and > if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, > had to be included, such an arrangement would, I think, be the only possible > one. Yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little, and > had given rise to few new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading > and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, > descended from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many > new languages and dialects. The various degrees of difference in the > languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups > subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement > would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would > connect together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest > affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.\\" Schleicher had never heard of Darwin before Haeckel brought him to Schleicher's attention. He had published his own work on the Stammbaum in an article of 1853, six years before the first edition of Origin of Species in 1859. The concept of descent of languages was by no means new. Thomas Jefferson, a devout linguist himself, had proposed that the continual necessity for neologisms implies that languages must \\"progress\\" or \\"advance.\\" These ideas foreshadow evolution of either biological species or languages, but after the contact of Schleicher with Darwin's ideas, and perhaps Darwin's contact with the historical linguists, Evolution and language change were inextricably linked, and would become the basis for classification. Now, as then, the main problems would be to prove specific lines of descent, and to identify the branch points. =The phylogenetic tree= The old metaphor was given an entirely new meaning under the old name by Joseph Harold Greenberg in a series of essays beginning about 1950. Since the adoption of the family tree metaphor by the linguists, the concept of evolution had been proposed by Charles Darwin and was generally accepted in biology. Taxonomy, the classification of living things, had already been invented by Carl Linnaeus. It used a binomial nomenclature to assign a species name and a genus name to every known living organism. These were arranged in a biological hierarchy under several phyla, or most general groups, branching ultimately to the various species. The basis for this biological classification was the observed shared physical features of the species. Darwin, however, reviving another ancient metaphor, the tree of life, hypothesized that the groups of the Linnaean classification (today's taxa), descended in a tree structure over time from simplest to most complex. The Linnaean hierarchical tree was synchronic; Darwin envisioned a diachronic process of common descent. Where Linnaeus had conceived ranks, which were consistent with the great chain of being adopted by the rationalists, Darwin conceived lineages. Over the decades after Darwin it became clear that the ranks of Linnaeus' hierarchy did not correspond exactly to the lineages. It became the prime goal of taxonomy to discover the lineages and alter the classification to reflect them, which it did under the overall guidance of the Nomenclature Codes, rule books kept by international organizations to authorize and publish proposals to reclassify species and other taxa. The new approach was called phylogeny, the \\"generation of phyla,\\" which devised a new tree metaphor, the phylogenetic tree. One unit in the tree and all its offspring units were a clade and the discovery of clades was cladistics. Classification of African language families Greenberg began writing during a time when phylogenetic systematics lacked the tools available to it later: the computer (computational systematics) and DNA sequencing (molecular systematics). To discover a cladistic relationship researchers relied on as large a number of morphological similarities among species as could be defined and tabulated. Statistically the greater the number of similarities the more likely species were to be in the same clade. This approach appealed to Greenberg, who was interested in discovering linguistic universals. Altering the tree model to make the family tree a phylogenetic tree he said: > \\"Any language consists of thousands of forms with both sound and meaning ... > any sound whatever can express any meaning whatever. Therefore, if two > languages agree in a considerable number of such items ... we necessarily > draw a conclusion of common historical origin. Such genetic classifications > are not arbitrary ... the analogy here to biological classification is > extremely close ... just as in biology we classify species in the same genus > or high unit because the resemblances are such as to suggest a hypothesis of > common descent, so with genetic hypotheses in language.\\" In this analogy, a language family is like a clade, the languages are like species, the proto-language is like an ancestor taxon, the language tree is like a phylogenetic tree and languages and dialects are like species and varieties. Greenberg formulated large tables of characteristics of hitherto neglected languages of Africa, the Americas, Indonesia and northern Eurasia and typed them according to their similarities. He called this approach \\"typological classification\\", arrived at by descriptive linguistics rather than by comparative linguistics. =Dates and glottochronology= The comparative method has been used by historical linguists to piece together tree models utilizing discrete lexical, morphological, and phonological data. Chronology can be found but there is no absolute date estimates utilizing this system. Glottochronology enables absolute dates to be estimated. Shared cognates (cognates meaning to have common historical origin) are calculate divergence times. However the method was found to be later discredited due to the data being unreliable. Due to this historical linguists have trouble with exact age estimation when pinpointing the age of the Indo-European language family. It could range from 4000 BP to 40,000 BP, or anywhere in-between those dates according to Dixon sourced from the rise and fall of language, (Cambridge University Press). As seen in the article here. Possible solutions for Glottochronology are forthcoming due to computational phylogenetic methods. Techniques such as using models of evolution improves accuracy of tree branch length and topology. There for, using computational phylogenetic methods computational methods enable researchers to analyze linguistic data from evolutionary biology. This further assists in testing theories against each other, such as the Kurgan theory and the Anatolian theory, both claiming origins of Info-European languages. Computational phylogenetics in historical linguistics The comparative method compares features of various languages to assess how similar one language is to another. The results of such an assessment are data-oriented; that is, the results depend on the number of features and the number of languages compared. Until the arrival of the computer on the historical linguistics landscape, the numbers in both cases were necessarily small. The effect was of trying to depict a photograph using a small number of large pixels, or picture units. The limitations of the Tree Model were all too painfully apparent, resulting in complaints from the major historical linguists. In the late 20th century, linguists began using software intended for biological classification to classify languages. Programs and methods became increasingly sophisticated. In the early 21st century, the Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics (CPHL) project, a consortium of historical linguists, received funding from the National Science Foundation to study phylogenies. The Indo-European family is a major topic of study. As of January, 2012, they had collected and coded a \\"screened\\" database of \\"22 phonological characters, 13 morphological characters, and 259 lexical characters,\\" and an unscreened database of more. Wordlists of 24 Indo-European languages are included. Larger numbers of features and languages increase the precision, provided they meet certain criteria. Using specialized computer software, they test various phylogenetic hypotheses for their ability to account for the characters by genetic descent. =Limitations of the model= One endemic limitation of the tree model is the very founding presumption on which it is based: it requires a classification based on languages.or, more generally, on language varieties. Since a variety represents an abstraction from the totality of linguistic features, there is the possibility for information loss during the translation of data (from a map of isoglosses) into a tree. For example, there is the issue of dialect continua. They provide varieties that are not unequivocally one language or another but contain features characteristic of more than one. The issue of how they are to be classified is similar to the issue presented by ring species to the concept of species classification in biology. The limitations of the tree model, in particular its inability to handle the non-discrete distribution of shared innovations in dialect continua, have been addressed through the development of non-cladistic (non-tree-based) methodologies. They include the Wave model; and more recently, the concept of linkage.See ; Heggarty et al. (2010); Fran√ßois (2014). An additional limitation of the tree model involves mixed and hybrid languages, as well as language mixing in general since the tree model allows only for divergences. For example, according to Zuckermann (2009:63),Zuckermann, Ghil'ad. 2009. \\"Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns.\\" Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2:40-67. \\"Israeli\\", his term for Modern Hebrew, which he regards as a Semito-European hybrid, \\"demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent.\\" =Perfect phylogenies= The purpose of phylogenetic software is to generate cladograms, a special kind of tree in which the links only bifurcate; that is, at any node in the same direction only two branches are offered. The input data is a set of characters that can be assigned states in different languages, such as present (1) or absent (0). A language therefore can be described by a unique coordinate set consisting of the state values for all of the characters considered. These coordinates can be like each other or less so. Languages that share the most states are most like each other. The software massages all the states of all the characters of all the languages by one of several mathematical methods to accomplish a pairwise comparison of each language with all the rest. It then constructs a cladogram based on degrees of similarity; for example, hypothetical languages, a and b, which are closest only to each other, are assumed to have a common ancestor, a-b. The next closest language, c, is assumed to have a common ancestor with a-b, and so on. The result is a projected series of historical paths leading from the overall common ancestor (the root) to the languages (the leaves). Each path is unique. There are no links between paths. Every leaf and node have one and only one ancestor. All the states are accounted for by descent from other states. A cladogram that conforms to these requirements is a perfect phylogeny.. At first there seemed to be little consistency of results in trials varying the factors presumed to be relevant. A new cladogram resulted from any change, which suggested that the method was not capturing the underlying evolution of languages but only reflecting the extemporaneous judgements of the researchers. In order to find the factors that did bear on phylogeny the researchers needed to have some measure of the accuracy of their results; i.e., the results needed to be calibrated against known phylogenies. They ran the experiment using different assumptions looking for the ones that would produce the closest matches to the most secure Indo-European phylogenies. Those assumptions could be used on problem areas of the Indo- European phylogeny with greater confidence. To obtain a reasonably valid phylogeny, the researchers found they needed to enter as input all three types of characters: phonological, lexical and morphological, which were all required to present a picture that was sufficiently detailed for calculation of phylogeny. Only qualitative characters produced meaningful results. Repeated states were too ambiguous to be correctly interpreted by the software; therefore characters that were subject to back formation and parallel development, which reverted a character to a prior state or adopted a state that evolved in another character, respectively, were screened from the input dataset.. =Perfect phylogenetic networks= A phylogenetic network, one of many posited by the CPHL. The phylogenetic tree appear in black lines. The contact edges are the red lines. Here there are three, the most parsimonious number required to generate a feasible network for Indo-European. Despite their care to code the best qualitative characters in sufficient numbers, the researchers could obtain no perfect phylogenies for some groups, such as Germanic and Albanian within Indo-European. They reasoned that a significant number of characters, which could not be explained by genetic descent from the group's calculated ancestor, were borrowed. Presumably, if the wave model, which explained borrowing, were a complete explanation of the group's characters, no phylogeny at all could be found for it. If both models were partially effective, then a tree would exist, but it would need to be supplemented by non-genetic explanations. The researchers therefore modified the software and method to include the possibility of borrowing.The technical details of the algorithms used are stated in . The details of the dataset are stated in Appendix B. The researchers introduced into the experiment the concept of the interface, or allowed boundary over which character states would flow. A one-way interface, or edge, existed between a parent and a child. If only one-way edges were sufficient to explain the presence of all the states in a language, then there was no need to look beyond the perfect phylogeny. If not, then one or more contact edges, or bidirectional interfaces, could be added to the phylogeny. A language therefore might have more than one source of states: the parent or a contact language. A tree so modified was no longer a tree as such: there could be more than one path from root to leaf. The researchers called this arrangement a network. The states of a character still evolved along a unique path from root to leaf, but its origin could be either the root under consideration or a contact language. If all the states of the experiment could be accounted for by the network, it was termed a perfect phylogenetic network.. =Compatibility and feasibility= The generation of networks required two phases. In the first phase, the researchers devised a number of phylogenies, called candidate trees, to be tested for compatibility. A character is compatible when its origin is explained by the phylogeny generated.. In a perfect phylogeny, all the characters are compatible and the compatibility of the tree is 100%. By the principle of parsimony, or Occam's razor, no networks are warranted. Candidate trees were obtained by first running the phylogeny-generation software using the Indo-European dataset (the strings of character states) as input, then modifying the resultant tree into other hypotheses to be tested. None of the original candidate trees were perfect phylogenies, although some of the subtrees within them were. The next phase was to generate networks from the trees of highest compatibility scores by adding interfaces one at a time, selecting the interface of highest compatibility, until sufficiency was obtained; that is, the compatibility of the network was highest. As it turned out, the number of compatible networks generated might vary from none to over a dozen. However, not all the possible interfaces were historically feasible. Interfaces between some languages were geographically and chronologically not very likely. Inspecting the results, the researchers excluded the non-feasible interfaces until a list of only feasible networks remained, which could be arranged in order of compatibility score. =Most feasible network for Indo- European= The researchers began with five candidate trees for Indo-European, lettered A-E, one generated from the phylogenetic software, two modifications of it and two suggested by Craig Melchert, a historical linguist and Indo- Europeanist. The trees differed mainly in the placement of the most ambiguous group, the Germanic languages, and Albanian, which did not have enough distinctive characters to place it exactly. Tree A contained 14 incompatible characters; B, 19; C, 17; D, 21; E,18. Trees A and C had the best compatibility scores. The incompatibilities were all lexical, and A's were a subset of C's.. Subsequent generation of networks found that all incompatibilities could be resolved with a minimum of three contact edges except for Tree E. As it did not have a high compatibility, it was excluded. Tree A had 16 possible networks, which a feasibility inspection reduced to three. Tree C had one network, but as it required an interface to Baltic and not Slavic, it was not feasible.. Tree A, the most compatible and feasible tree, hypothesizes seven groups separating from Proto-Indo-European between about 4000 BC and 2250 BC, as follows.. * The first to separate was Anatolian, about 4000 BC. * Tocharian followed at about 3500 BC. * Shortly thereafter, about 3250, Proto-Italo-Celtic (western Indo-European) separated, becoming Proto-Italic and Proto-Celtic at about 2500 BC. * At about 3000, Proto-Albano- Germanic separated, becoming Albanian and Proto-Germanic at about 2000. * At about 3000 Proto-Greco-Armenian (southern Indo-European) divided, becoming Proto-Greek and Proto-Armenian at about 1800. * Balto-Slavic appeared about 2500, dividing into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic at about 1000. * Finally, Proto-Indo-European became Proto-Indo-Iranian (eastern Indo-European) at about 2250. Trees B and E offer the alternative of Proto-Germano-Balto-Slavic (northern Indo-European), making Albanian an independent branch. The only date for which authors vouch is the last, based on the continuity of the Yamna culture, the Andronovo Culture and known Indo-Aryan speaking cultures. All others are described as \\"dead reckoning.\\". Given the phylogeny of best compatibility, A, three contact edges are required to complete the compatibility. This is group of edges with the least number of borrowing events: * First, an edge between Proto-Italic and Proto-Germanic, which must have begun after 2000, according to the dating scheme given. * A second contact edge was between Proto-Italic and Proto-Greco-Armenian, which must have begun after 2500. * The third contact edge is between Proto-Germanic and Proto-Baltic, which must have begun after 1000. Tree A with the edges described above is described by the authors as \\"our best PPN.\\". In all PPNs, it is clear that although the initial daughter languages became distinct in relative isolation, the later evolution of the groups can be explained only by evolution in proximity to other languages with which an exchange takes place by the wave model.

Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Lew Sapieha. Under his supervision the Lithuanian Metrica was reorganized. The Lithuanian Metrica or the Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (, , , or Metryka Wielkiego Ksiƒôstwa Litewskiego; , ) is a collection of the 14‚Äì18th century legal documents of the Chancellery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL). Maintained systematically since the 2nd half the 15th century, metrica consisted, initially and primarily, of the copies of the documents issued by the Grand Duke, Lithuanian Council of Lords, and Seimas. The Metrica also included some important externally originated documents (like translations of the issues (yarlyks) of the Crimea Khans, copies of the Muscovy diplomatic documents etc.), the office-keeping documental materials (like registers of acts, inventories of the Metrica itself etc.) The selection of the classes of the documents included in the Metrica had increased since the 2nd half 15th ‚Äì 16th century and even more so in the 17‚Äì18th centuries, extending to include the copies of transcripts of diplomatic correspondence, charters of privileges, wills, verdicts, judicial decrees, even certain kinds of private correspondence, e.g., received by the official persons. Sometimes, the external and thematically not quite related collections of the documents had also been referred to as the part of the Metrica, the word Metrica here to be understood as the State Archive.–ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥—ñ–π –ì–∞–ª–µ–Ω—á–∞–Ω–∫–∞. –ú–µ—Ç—Ä—ã–∫–∞ –í—è–ª—ñ–∫–∞–≥–∞ –ö–Ω—è—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –õ—ñ—Ç–æ—û—Å–∫–∞–≥–∞ // –≠–Ω—Ü—ã–∫–ª–∞–ø–µ–¥—ã—è –≥—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—ñ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ: –£ 6 —Ç. –¢. 5. / –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å. –≠–Ω—Ü—ã–∫–ª. ; –†—ç–¥–∫–∞–ª.: –ì.–ü.–ü–∞—à–∫–æ—û (–≥–∞–ª–æ—û–Ω—ã —Ä—ç–¥.) —ñ —ñ–Ω—à. ‚Äì –ú–Ω. : –ë–µ–ª–≠–Ω, 1999. (—Ç.5), The documents of the Metrica were to be preserved interminably. Effectively, the Metrica had become the core of the Archive of the Grand Duke, later the core of the Main State Archive of the GDL, serving the notifying (judicial-registrative), judicial, referential functions. It had been the source of the authoritative official documents (copies of copies). The Metrica developed parallel to and on the model of the Crown Metrica of Poland. Today, over 600 (estimated) books of the Lithuanian Metrica still exist. Their microfilms are preserved at the Lithuanian State Historical Archives in Vilnius. Names The word metrica generates from for archive, from for office book. The first historical names of the collection were metrics, books of metrica, metrica. Since the end of the 16th ‚Äì beginning of the 17th century, the full official name was Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This would be the most appropriate scientific name. The dub Lithuanian Metrica had been occasionally used in the local office books (by analogy with the Crown Metrica of Poland), since the mid-17th century the dub had consolidated its position in the documents of the Warsaw Archives, later in the Archives of Moscow and St. Petersburg, then in the 19‚Äì20th centuries Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian historiographies. The name Lithuanian Metrica is till now traditionally used in the Western publications of the Metrica. The name Lithuanian Metrica is also used in reference to some contemporary archival collections, including some of the materials of the Chancellery of the GDL (together with other unrelated materials), chiefly in Russia custody. Languages The prevailing language of the documents of the 15th and the most of the 16th century Metrica had been the Ruthenian language. Alternatively, the prevailing use of the Ruthenian language in the Metrica is extended up to the mid-17th century. The documents, concerned with the Western Europe, had been issued in Latin, occasionally in German. The documents, concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, had been issued in Latin.–õ. –ê–±–µ—Ü–∞–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫—ñ. –£ —Å–≤—è—Ç–ª–µ –Ω–µ–∞–±–≤–µ—Ä–∂–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∞—û. ‚Äì –ú–Ω. : –î—Ä—É–∫-–Ω—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç—ã ¬´–ó–≤—è–∑–¥–∞¬ª, 1969. ‚Äì –ë—ñ–±–ª—ñ—è—Ç—ç—á–∫–∞ –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç—ã ¬´–ì–æ–ª–∞—Å –†–∞–¥–∑—ñ–º—ã¬ª. See also naming of the Ruthenian language. Since the late 16th ‚Äì early 17th century, the number of the documents composed in Polish and in Latin, had been steadily increasing, until the complete elimination of the Ruthenian from the office use in the GDL, and further official ban on the Ruthenian for the official use (1696). The language of the 17‚Äì18th century Metrica is mostly Polish and partly Latin. History State archives were begun in the 13th-century Kingdom of Lithuania.Vladimiras Pa≈°uta. Lietuvos valstybƒós susidarymas. Vilnius, 1987, t. 2, p. 107 Diplomacy was greatly increased under the rule of Gediminas. During the various wars, floods, and city fires that followed, many official documents were lost. Some were impossible to trace, if these documents had not been duplicated or otherwise copied. A growing need to reproduce these documents later, and the mounting number of edicts, wills, court verdicts etc., determined the evolution of the Lithuanian Metrica. The Lithuanian Metrica was stored in the Trakai Island Castle under the supervision of the Treasurer, until 1511. Afterwards the documents were transferred to Vilnius, and kept in what was referred to as the Lower Castle. The responsibility for safeguarding the Metrica there, was supervised by the State Chancellor. By 1569, when the regions of Podlasie, Volhynia, Podolia and the Kiev were separated from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and incorporated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the books which concerned these regions, were removed from the Lithuanian Metrica, and merged into the Crown Metrica. Due to the deterioration of the books, the State Grand Chancellor, Lew Sapieha, ordered the volumes of the Metrica to be recopied in 1594. The recopying process continued until 1607. The newly recopied books were inventoried, rechecked, and transferred to a separate building in Vilnius, with the older books remaining in the Castle of Vilnius. Great parts of the Metrica were lost during the wars with Muscovy, and others were taken way by Swedish armies in 1656‚Äì1657. Only after the Treaty of Oliva (1660), did the Swedes return many books from the Metrica, but some of them were lost at sea, in the Baltic, during transport back to Lithuania. The Metrica from Vilnius was taken to Warsaw in 1765.Augustinas Janulaitis. Praeitis ir jos tyrimo r≈´pesƒçiai. Vilnius, Mokslas, 1989, p. 325 The books were bound, cataloged and integrated into the system that was in use, in Warsaw. According to an edict issued in 1793, the Lithuanian Metrica was to be transferred from Warsaw to Vilnius again. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the Lithuanian Metrica was transferred from Warsow to Russia as a war trophy and was kept in Saint Petersburg. Russia gave several of the Lithuanian Metrica books to Prussia in 1799. Afterwards Prussia transferred these books to the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. The remaining Lithuanian Metrica books in St. Petersburg were inventoried and taken to Moscow. The majority of the historical Lithuanian Metrica's books have been kept in Russia, and today only a small fraction of them are in Lithuania. The remaining part of the Lithuanian Metrica is kept in Poland, at the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw. Publications The Metrica is one of the most authoritative and revered sources on the history of the GDL. Some of the documents of the Metrica and parts of them had begun to be published in the end 18th century.

The Bad Life Mitterrand's autobiographical novel The Bad Life () was a best seller in 2005. In the book he details his \\"delight\\" whilst visiting the male brothels of Bangkok, and writes, \\"I got into the habit of paying for boys ... The profusion of young, very attractive and immediately available boys put me in a state of desire I no longer needed to restrain or hide.\\" At the time of its release Mitterrand was applauded for his honesty, but he has had to defend his writings after he publicly defended Roman Polanski when Polanski was detained in Switzerland on an American request for extradition for raping a thirteen-year-old girl. On 5 October 2009, Marine Le Pen of the French National Front Party quoted sections of the book on French television, accusing him of having sex with underage boys and engaging in \\"sex tourism\\", demanding that Mitterrand resign his position as culture minister. Amongst others he was also criticised by the Socialist Party spokesman Beno√Æt Hamon, who stated: \\"As a minister of culture he has drawn attention to himself by defending a film maker and he has written a book where he said he took advantage of sexual tourism. To say the least, I find it shocking.\\" On the other hand, some conservatives supported Mitterrand, and a close aide to Nicolas Sarkozy said the French President backed his Culture Minister, describing the controversy around him as \\"pathetic\\". Mitterrand insisted the book is not an autobiography, the publisher describes it as a \\"novel inspired by autobiography\\" and the BBC refers to it as \\"autobiographical novel\\". In his own defence Mitterrand stated, \\"Each time I was with people who were my age, or who were five years younger ‚Äì there wasn't the slightest ambiguity ‚Äì and who were consenting\\", and that he uses the term \\"boys\\" loosely, both in his life and in the book.

She was the younger daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria and sister of Joan I of Naples, and had been intended as a bride for Louis I of Hungary or John II of France, but was abducted by Charles and his mother to make a marriage that would place Charles closer to the throne of Naples. Keeping carefully aloof from the conspiracy that murdered Joan's husband Andrew, Duke of Calabria, he led a faction opposing Joan and Louis of Taranto.

He is best known as the former bass guitarist and backing vocalist for the rock band Chevelle. He joined the band in 2005 after the departure of Joe Loeffler, who had been a member of the group since 1995. Bernardini is also a noted visual artist and woodworker; the cover of the 2009 album Sci-Fi Crimes was an original 24x48 oil on canvas painting by Bernardini, and he also supplied an original oil on canvas painting for the band's 2012 album Stray Arrows: A Collection of Favorites.  History  Before Chevelle, Bernardini played drums in the Chicago band Liftpoint. Bernardini taught himself to play bass by listening to and attempting to copy bass lines on albums. The first album he played to was Muse's Absolution. When Joe Loeffler left Chevelle, Bernardini, who is married to Pete, Joe, and Sam Loeffler's sister, replaced him. In May 2006, Bernardini injured his left hand forcing the band to pull out of the first eight concert dates (from June 30 to July 26) with Nickelback and Hoobastank.  Equipment  In a feature in Bass Player, Bernardini stated that he uses Gibson Thunderbird and Ibanez BTB bass guitars with Mesa Boogie Big Block 750 amplifiers and Mesa 8x10 cabinets for both clean and distorted tones. He is also a featured artist by both Gibson Guitars and Ibanez Guitars. The Thunderbirds Bernardini plays are custom built by Ryan Loux of Loux Custom Instruments. One is black with a scale and Chevelle logo inlays, and another is a white bass that features a custom inlaid fretboard inspired by a Picasso painting, and featuring Nordstrand pickups and an extended scale length. The Ibanez BTB570s are modified by Bernardini by refinishing and installing hand- made pickguards and Bartonlini pickups. He uses custom gauge (65-85-115-130) GHS strings.

Web, Sep. 14, 2010. the brainchild of guitar player Mike Clark, who later played in Suicidal Tendencies. History The band started in 1982 and featured lead vocalist Keven Guercio, guitarist Mike Clark, bassist Ken Blakley later replaced by Ric \\"Rancid\\" Clayton (the artist who designed the Suicidal Tendencies logo as well as the shirts on S.T.'s first album) and drummer Sal Troy. Guercio recorded a few demos and the tracks on the Welcome to Venice (1985) compilation before leaving and moving to Jackson Hole, WY and was replaced by Suicidal Tendencies vocalist Mike Muir. Muir signed them to his independent label \\"Suicidal Records\\". In 1987 No Mercy released their first and only album Widespread Bloodshed Love Runs Red, and were about to record their second album with many new songs already written but Clayton and Troy quit. Instead of recruiting new members, Muir decided to \\"merge\\" the two bands by having Clark join Suicidal Tendencies. Clark took over much of the songwriting duties for Suicidal, shifting its style more to a melodic thrash metal sound similar to No Mercy's and what would have been No Mercy's second album became Suicidal Tendencies' third album, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today. In 1989 Suicidal Tendencies released the Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D√©j√† Vu double-EP. Many of the songs on it, including \\"Waking The Dead\\" and \\"Controlled By Hatred\\", were re- recorded by Suicidal Tendencies from the Widespread Bloodshed album. Muir and Clark relaunched the band in 2000 as \\"No Mercy Fool!\\" with all new members, mainly from Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves, and have contributed new recordings to the 2001 Suicidal Records compilation Suicidal Friends and Family - Vol. 2 and 2008's Year of the Cycos. They have since re-recorded more No Mercy songs as Suicidal Tendencies for their 2010 album No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family. Keven Guercio has since recorded a track called \\"Roll the Dice\\" (available on iTunes), featured on the compilation album Welcome 2 Venice (2007), with original members of Suicidal Tendencies including ex- bassist Louiche Mayorga who produced the album. In early 2013 Mike Clark formed a new version of No Mercy under the name Waking The Dead (due to copyright issues with the WWF). They opened up for Suicidal Tendencies on their Slam City Tour. They are a 3 piece and there are rumours of a new album and perhaps a re release of some old material.

The professional practitioner of the field, who may be called a sociotherapist or life enrichment therapist, sometimes called a clinical sociologist, is usually concurrently a member of another relevant profession: medical doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, social worker, sociologist, criminologist, activity and recreational professionals, among others. Clinical sociotherapy usually targets groups of children, youths or elderly, employed in various settings such as treatment facilities or lifecare communities like nursing homes and are directly involved in case management and care planning. Professional definition Still in its infancy as a social science and profession, sociotherapy is ill-defined and thus takes many forms, according to the respective definitions created by the individual therapists, firms and institutions that employ sociotherapists and life enrichment therapists. The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy defines sociotherapy as \\"the methodical management of the living environment of a group of clients, directed towards reaching the treatment targets of this group‚Äîand conceived as a means of achieving the treatment targets of the individual client‚Äîwithin a functional unit, usually in a clinical treatment setting.\\"Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, definition of Sociotherapy This definition is most accepted especially in lifecare communities such as nursing homes. The Sociotherapy Association in the United States describes a sociotherapy that emphasizes the support of awareness, relationship, and the integration of life and the environment. Its main focus is the process of interpersonal relationships as a method of facilitating healthier living, rather than diagnosing intrapsychic psychopathology, and attempting to change it through coercion and analysis (psychology and psychotherapy).Sociotherapy Association The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy says: \\"Sociotherapy operates through a holistic vision of mankind. That is to say that the human being is seen as a somatic, psychic, social and spiritual unity, which is unique because of his own history of growth.\\"Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, general methods of approach of Sociotherapy Definition of sociotherapy as a social science and profession is also based on regional dicta. For example, the public health insurance system of Germany offered a uniquely German definition in order to subsidize treatment by sociotherapeutic professionals. It said that sociotherapy \\"designates non-medical, social, and work-related components of the care process\\". Sociotherapy has been used in the treatment and education of adolescents at Kanner Academy and Community Schools in Sarasota Florida US. In These settings the working definition of sociotherapy is the practice of promoting healthy growth and living by facilitating therapeutic communities, personal relationships and positive peer culture. It is better known as the \\"relationship therapy\\".Robert G. Lee Ph.D, Kanner, C. (2004) The Value of Connection: A Relational Approach to Ethics. (Chapter 5 The Relational Ethic in the Treatment of Adolescents) Rand L. Kannenberg wrote, \\"Sociotherapy for Sociopaths: Resocial Group\\". Designed by the author to help prevent relapse and rearrest of parolees and probationers at a community mental health center in 1986, this text outlines an evidence- based, twenty-four session group program created for adult clients with coexisting Substance Use Disorders and the persistent problems of aggressiveness, breaking rules and laws, carelessness, dishonesty, impulsivity, indifference, irresponsibility and irritability. The book examines the importance of sociotherapy or sociological counseling in the corrections and substance abuse fields. \\"Kannenberg's fresh approach to treating psychoactive chemical abusing sociopaths should be in every counselor's arsenal when treating a client of this nature.\\"Misti Storie, Education and Training Coordinator, Counselor Resources, \\"Reader's Corner,\\" (NAADAC News, August 2005). Top 10 Bestselling Book List of search by subject on Medicum.net 2005. Credentialing professionals The Sociotherapy Association is certifying sociotherapists and support companions. Developing methods and theories =Practice= The foundation of any sociotherapeutic relationship include the practice of dialogical relationship, the phenomenological method, field-theoretical strategies, experimental freedom, countertransference (CT) management. Support Companionship is a time tested method for helping people, who for one reason or another, are struggling in their lives. Support Companions provide wrap-around support to adults, adolescents, families, the elderly, children, and service providers, when the support is needed! The foundation of support companion services is relationship, and the methodology of contact is sociotherapy. Sociotherapists are constantly involved in creating and refining theories in group and socialization dynamics. For example, a sociotherapist in a nursing home may experiment on the various methods one might employ to lure an introverted resident to activities and thus reduce the resident's risk of social isolation, which may be linked to the continued progression of that resident's dementia. In this example, the sociotherapist would also use activities like games and exercises to monitor an individual's mental health and use interaction with other residents as a tool to improve that mental health. =Phenomenological method= The goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness.Yontef, G. (1993) Awareness, Dialogue, and Process, essays on Gestalt therapy. Highland, NY: The Gestalt Journal Press, Inc. In Sociotherapy awareness and integration are central to healthy living. Much of the practice is centered around ways to support and improve a sense of awareness in our fields of experience. This is accomplished with relationship, experimentation and phenomenological exploration. The phenomenological method comprises three steps: (1) the rule of epoch√©, (2) the rule of description, and (3) the rule of horizontalization.Spinelli, E. (2005) The interpreted world, an introduction to phenomenological psychology, 2nd edition. London, UK: Sage Publications. Applying the rule of epoch√© we sets aside our personal initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions. Applying the rule of description, one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining. Applying the rule of horizontalization one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance. When it comes to a socio- therapeutic relationship the rule of epoch√© sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of any clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \\"lived experience\\".Husserl, Edmund. The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, p. 240. =Intersubjectivity= Intersubjectivity emphasizes that shared understanding and consensus is essential in the shaping of our ideas, experiencing, and relations. Language, quintessentially, is viewed as communal rather than private. Therefore, it is problematic to view the individual as partaking in a private world, one which has a meaning defined apart from any other subjects. But in our shared divergence from a commonly understood experience, these private worlds naturally emerge.http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com See also * Public sociology References Subfields of sociology Therapy ","title":"Sociotherapy"},{"id":"5778191","text":"Rebecca James (born 1970 in Sydney, Australia) is a writer of young adult fiction.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between to the west and to the east. The Engineer's Line Reference for the line is WIS; the station's three- letter station code is BUU. The platform has an operational length for eight- coach trains. It is located near the Mangapps Railway Museum. The line and station were opened on 1 June 1889 for goods and on 1 October 1889 for passenger services by the Great Eastern Railway in 1889. The station had two platforms both with station buildings and connected by a footbridge. A 24-lever signal box was located on the north of the line to the west of the station; this was closed on 21 January 1967. There were sidings and a goods shed to the west of the station. The line and station were passed to the London and North Eastern Railway following the Grouping of 1923. It then passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948. The north platform was closed by 1969. When sectorisation was introduced, Burnham-on-Crouch was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Rail. The line was electrified using 25 kV overhead line electrification (OLE) on 12 May 1986. Today the station is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it. Services The typical off-peak service is of one train every 40 minutes westbound to and eastbound to with additional services at peak times. Some peak services continue to or from and/or via the Great Eastern Main Line. On Sundays, the service is reduced is to hourly. Services are typically formed of rolling stock, built by BREL York and introduced in 1988.

DCA's stated mission is to serve the interests of California's consumers by ensuring a standard of professionalism in key industries and promoting informed consumer practices. The DCA provides the public with information on safe consumer practices, in an effort to protect the public from unscrupulous or unqualified people who promote deceptive products or services. DCA licenses or certifies practitioners in more than 255 professions. There are currently more than 2.4 million practitioners licensed by the DCA. The Department consists of more than 40 bureaus, boards, committees, commission, and other entities that license and regulate practitioners.

The Department publishes a number of publications on consumer-related issues, the most popular being the California Tenants Guide. Publications are free to the public and are made available on the department's website. DCA's enforcement staff works with the Office of the Attorney General of California and local district attorneys to investigate fraudulent activity in the marketplace. Many investigations are initiated as a result of complaints from consumers. DCA has a Complaint Resolution Program to help resolve disputes between consumers and businesses. History Consumer protection in California began with the passage of the Medical Practice Act of 1876. The Act was designed to regulate the State's medical professionals, who up to that point had operated virtually unchecked. However, an actual government agency with the legal authority to enforce the Act was not created until 1878. The three boards created that year were later consolidated into what is now the Medical Board of California. Additional professions and vocations were brought under State authority in the next 30 years. By the late 1920s, the Department of Vocational and Professional Standards was responsible for licensing or certifying accountants, barbers, cosmetologists, dentists, embalmers, optometrists, pharmacists, physicians, and veterinarians. The Consumer Affairs Act was passed in 1970, giving the Department its current name.  Administration  DCA‚Äôs boards, bureaus, and other entities are supported by a dedicated and highly skilled staff of legal, technical, and administrative professionals. These professionals provide a wide range of support services including human resources, information technology, investigations, professional examinations, training, strategic planning, budgeting, and more.

It was originally published for the Xbox and included a sampler CD of tunes by cover band Diffuser. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2 with two new courts and a handful of additional player costumes, accessories, etc. under the title Outlaw Volleyball Remixed. The game features Steve Carell as the announcer.  Gameplay  The game follows the normal rules of volleyball and a standard game with standard rules can be played. However, there are a number of different modes that mix up the standard formula. One example is Hot Potato, where the ball is played as a timer ticks down, and once it runs out the ball explodes upon impact of the nearest player. Another is \\"Casino Round\\", where the longer the rally, the more money the scoring team on that play gets. Individual settings can also be altered within these modes, such as adjusting whether only the serving team can score a point (\\"side out\\" rule) or any team who wins the rally gets a point. Fighting with other characters in an option before a serve where a player can choose to fight an opponent on the other side of the net. If the player wins they earn the victim's momentum bar. Beating tokens are earned after great plays and a turnover of the serve.  Outlaw Volleyball Red Hot!  Released as a rental-only exclusive for Blockbuster, and meant to serve as a side game to the original rather than a full-fledged sequel. The game is set in Hell and contains only one court, the \\"Pit of Hell\\", which wasn't in the original Outlaw Volleyball. Returning characters also had slight outfit variants to reflect the setting, like red horns and devil wings. The game can now be found at many used game retailers. Reception Reviews ranged from positive to very mixed. GameRankings and Metacritic gave Outlaw Volleyball a score of 79% and 77 out of 100, and also gave Outlaw Volleyball Remixed a score of 64% and 57 out of 100.

It occurred in the family's house to the southwest of Yusufiyah, a village to the west of the town of Al-Mahmudiyah, Iraq. Other members of al-Janabi's family murdered by Americans included her 34-year-old mother Fakhriyah Taha Muhasen, 45-year-old father Qassim Hamza Raheem, and 6-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza Al- Janabi. The two remaining survivors of the family, 9-year-old brother Ahmed and 11-year-old brother Mohammed, were at school during the massacre and orphaned by the event. Five U.S. Army soldiers of the 502nd Infantry Regiment were charged with rape and murder; Specialist Paul E. Cortez, Specialist James P. Barker, Private First Class Jesse V. Spielman, Private First Class Brian L. Howard, and Private First Class Steven D. Green). Green was discharged from the U.S. Army for mental instability before the crimes were known by his command, whereas Cortez, Barker, Spielman and Howard were tried by U.S. Army General Courts Martial, convicted, and sentenced to prison. Green was tried and convicted in a United States civilian court and was also sentenced to life in prison. Background Green in December 2005 Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi ( ‚ÄòAbƒ´r QƒÅssim ·∏§amza al-JanƒÅbƒ´; 19 August 1991 ‚Äì 12 March 2006), lived with her mother and father (Fakhriya Taha Muhasen, 34, and Qassim Hamza Raheem, 45, respectively) and her three siblings: 6-year-old sister Hadeel, 9-year-old brother Ahmed, and 11-year-old brother Mohammed. Of modest means, Abeer's family lived in a one-bedroom house that they did not own, with borrowed furniture, in the village of Yusufiyah, which lies west of the larger township of Al-Mahmudiyah, Iraq. The family was very close. Her father, Qassim, worked as a guard at a date orchard. Abeer's mother, Fakhriya, was a stay-at-home mom. According to her brothers, little Hadeel, Abeer's 6-year-old sister, loved a sweet plant that grew in the yard, was playful but not very mischievous, and enjoyed playing hide and seek with them. Qassim doted on his family, hoping that he would one day be able to buy a home for them and that they would live and eat like everyone else. He also had a dream that his children would finish college. According to her neighbours, at the time of the massacre, Abeer spent most of her days at home, as her parents would not allow her to go to school because of security concerns. Having been born only months after the Gulf War, which devastated civilian infrastructure in Iraq, and living her entire life under sanctions, followed by the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, Abeer had dreams as well, hoping to one day live \\"in the big city\\" (Baghdad). Her relatives describe her as proud. Although she was only a 14-year-old child, Abeer endured repeated sexual harassment from U.S. soldiers. Abeer's home was situated approximately 200 meters (220 yards) from a six-man U.S. traffic checkpoint (TCP), southwest of the village. From their checkpoint, the soldiers would often watch Abeer doing her chores and tending the garden. The neighbors had warned Abeer's father of this, but he replied it was not a problem as she was just a small girl. Abeer's brother Mohammed (who along with his younger brother was at school at the time of the murders and thus survived) recalls that the soldiers often searched the house. On one such occasion, Private First Class Steven D. Green ran his index finger down Abeer's cheek, an action which had terrified her. Abeer's mother told her relatives before the murders that, whenever she caught the soldiers staring at Abeer, they would give her the thumbs-up sign, point to her daughter and say, \\"Very good, very good.\\" Evidently this had concerned her and she made plans for Abeer to spend nights sleeping at her uncle's (Ahmad Qassim's) house. According to an affidavit later filed by the FBI, Green discussed raping the girl in the days preceding the event. Rape and murders On March 12, 2006, soldiers at the checkpoint (from the 502nd Infantry Regiment) consisting of Green, Specialist Paul E. Cortez, Specialist James P. Barker, Private First Class Jesse V. Spielman, and Private First Class Brian L. Howard had been playing cards, illegally drinking alcohol (whiskey mixed with an energy drink), hitting golf balls, and discussing plans to rape Abeer and \\"kill some Iraqis.\\" Green was very persistent about \\"killing some Iraqis\\" and kept bringing up the idea. At some point, the group decided to go to Abeer's home, after they had seen her passing by their checkpoint earlier. The four soldiers of the six-man unit responsible for the checkpoint Barker, Cortez, Green, and Spielman then left their posts for Abeer's home. Two men, Howard and another soldier, remained at the post. Howard had not been involved in discussions to rape and murder the family. He heard the four men talking about it and saw them leave, but thought they were joking and were planning to beat up some Iraqi men to blow off some steam. The sixth soldier at the checkpoint had no involvement. On the day of the massacre, Abeer's father Qassim was enjoying time with his family, while his sons were at school. In broad daylight, the five U.S. soldiers walked to the house, not wearing their uniforms, but wearing army-issue long underwear to look like \\"ninjas\\", and separated 14 year-old Abeer and her family into two different rooms. Spielman was responsible for grabbing Abeer's 6 year-old sister, who was outside the house with her father, and bringing her inside the house. Green then broke Abeer's mother's arms (likely evidence of a struggle that resulted when she heard her daughter being raped in the other room) and murdered her parents and younger sister, while two other soldiers, Cortez and Barker, raped Abeer. Barker wrote that Cortez pushed Abeer to the floor, lifted her dress, and tore off her underwear while she struggled. According to Cortez, Abeer ‚Äúkept squirming and trying to keep her legs closed and saying stuff in Arabic,‚Äù as he and Barker took turns holding her down and raping her. Cortez testified that Abeer heard the gunshots in the room in which her parents and little sister were being held, causing her to scream and cry even more as she was being violently raped by the men. Green then emerged from the room saying, \\"I just killed them, all are dead\\". Green, who later said the crime was \\"awesome\\", then raped Abeer and shot her in the head several times. After the massacre, Barker poured petrol on and the soldiers set fire to the lower part of Abeer's body, from her stomach down to her feet. Barker testified that the soldiers gave Spielman their bloodied clothes to burn and that he threw the AK-47 used to murder the family in a canal. They left to \\"celebrate\\" their crimes with a meal of chicken wings. Meanwhile, the fire from Abeer's body eventually spread to the rest of the room, and the smoke alerted neighbors, who were among the first to discover the scene. One recalled, \\"The poor girl, she was so beautiful. She lay there, one leg was stretched and the other bent and her dress was lifted up to her neck.\\" They ran to tell Abu Firas Janabi, Abeer's uncle, that the farmhouse was on fire and that dead bodies could be seen inside the burning building. Janabi and his wife rushed to the farmhouse and doused some of the flames to get inside. Upon witnessing the scene inside, Janabi went to a checkpoint guarded by Iraqi Army soldiers to report the crime. Abeer's 9- and 11-year-old younger brothers, Ahmed and Mohammed, returned from school that afternoon to find smoke billowing from the windows. After going to their uncle's home, they returned to the house only to be traumatized, finding their father shot in the head, mother shot in the chest, 6-year-old sister Hadeel shot in the face, and 14-year-old sister Abeer's remains burning. The Iraqi soldiers immediately went to examine the scene and thereafter went to an American checkpoint to report the incident. This checkpoint was different from the one manned by the perpetrators. After approximately an hour, some soldiers from the checkpoint went to the farmhouse. These soldiers were accompanied by at least one of the perpetrators. Cover up Green and the other soldiers who participated in the incident lied to the Iraqi soldiers who arrived on scene immediately after the incident, telling them that the massacre had been perpetrated by Sunni insurgents. These Iraqi soldiers conveyed this information to Abeer's uncle, who viewed the bodies. This lie prevented the event from being recognized as a crime or widely reported amidst the widespread violence occurring during the occupation of Iraq.Iraqi Television Treatment of Reported Rape, Killing of Iraqi Girl Iraqi television stations on July 5, 2006 Sergeant Anthony Yribe learned of the massacre and told Private First Class Justin Watt, a newly assigned soldier to Bravo Company, that Green was a murderer. Watt conducted a personal inquiry about this alarming act by a fellow soldier and coworker. He talked to other members of his platoon who revealed to him that the gang-rape and murder had in fact occurred. Watt then reported what he believed to be true to another Non-Commissioned Officer in his platoon, Sergeant John Diem. Watt trusted Diem; he told him that he knew a terrible crime had been committed and asked for his advice, knowing that if he reported the crime he would be considered a traitor to his unit and could possibly be killed by them. Diem told him to be cautious, but that he had a duty as an honorable soldier to report the crimes to the proper authorities. Unfortunately, they did not trust their chain of command to protect them if they reported a war crime. As a result, Watt asked to speak with a mental health counselor, thereby bypassing the chain of command to report the crimes. On June 22, 2006, the rape and the murders came to light when Watt revealed them during a mental health counseling session and on to Army criminal investigators. Before Watt reported the crimes, Green had previously been honorably discharged from the Army on May 16, 2006, before the crime was recognized, with \\"antisocial personality disorder\\".Federal court to try ex- soldier on Iraq charges .

Alleged 2006 retaliation  On July 10, the Mujahideen Shura Council (now a part of the Islamic State) released a graphic video showing the bodies of Pfcs. Tucker and Menchaca. This video was accompanied by a statement saying that the group carried out the killings as \\"revenge for our sister who was dishonored by a soldier of the same brigade.\\"Mujahidin Shura Council Links US Soldiers Killing to 'Rape' of Iraqi Girl Islamic Renewal Organization website via OpenSource.gov, July 11, 2006. The Washington Post reports that Charles Babineau and two other individuals from the same unit were captured and killed by militants a month after the rape. Local Iraqi officials, and U.S. officials, denied the killing of the GIs was an act of retaliation, because the soldiers were killed days before the revelation leaked out that U.S. soldiers had committed the massacre in Mahmudiyah. At the time of Menchaca and Tucker's abduction on June 16, 2006, only the perpetrators of the rape and murder, and a few soldiers in their unit engaged in covering up the crime, knew that it had been committed by U.S. soldiers. The crime was revealed by Watt on June 22, and American responsibility only became \\"public knowledge\\" in Iraq on July 4, days after which the video by the Mujahideen Shura Council was released. Also, the abduction occurred on June 16, nine days after the targeted killing of the Shura Council's leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on June 7. The video from the Mujahideen Shura Council claimed that upon learning of the massacre, the group \\"kept their anger to themselves and didn't spread the news, but were determined to avenge their sister's honor\\". Locals may have been able to deduce the guilt of the U.S. soldiers from the nearby checkpoint, after the Americans and their Iraqi cohort unit provided the explanation, \\"Sunni extremists did this.\\" A portion of locals served as auxiliary support for both for Al Qaeda in Iraq and the 1920s Revolutionary Brigade. Auxiliary support comprised both material aid and performing a human intelligence support function. Relaying the accusation of the local MNC-I unit to the insurgents, is a basic function of that support. The Sunni extremists were able to eliminate themselves as suspects and, having an already low opinion of the U.S. military, may have assumed the guilt of the 101st Airborne soldiers. A statement issued along with the video stated that, \\"God Almighty enabled them to capture two soldiers of the same brigade as this dirty crusader.\\" Other militant groups also made various claims or statements announcing revenge campaigns after the killings were reported on July 4, when the U.S. investigation into the incident was announced.Salah al-Din Brigades Vows Revenge for Al-Mahmudiyah 'Rape' Case Islamic Renewal Organization (IRO) website in Arabic via OpenSource.gov, July 10, 2006Al-Mujahidin Army Responds to Alleged Rape of Iraqi Girl by US Soldiers Baghdad al-Rashid forum in Arabic via OpenSource.gov, July 10, 2006 On July 4, Jaysh al-Mujahidin claimed responsibility for downing a U.S. Army AH-64 Apache \\"in retaliation for the child, Abir, whom U.S. soldiers raped in Al-Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad.\\"Doha Al-Jazirah Satellite Channel Television in Arabic via OpenSource.gov 1412 GMT Jul 04, 06 On July 12, the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb near the entrance to the Green Zone in Baghdad, in support of the \\"Abir operations\\" targeting the \\"evil den in the Green prison\\".Islamic Army in Iraq: Green Zone Attack 'in Support of Abir, Gaza Operations' Al- Firdaws Jihadist Forums at www.alfirdaws.org/vb on July 12, 2006 Legal proceedings Green was arrested as a civilian, and convicted by a civilian court, the U.S. District Court in Paducah, Kentucky.Detroit Free Press, page A18, May 8, 2009 The other four, all active-duty soldiers, were convicted through courts-martial. =Steven Dale Green= Steven Green May 2009 booking photo, Mecklenberg County Sheriff's department Green was arrested in North Carolina while traveling home from Arlington, Virginia, where he had attended the funeral of a soldier. On June 30, 2006, the FBI arrested Green, who was held without bond and transferred to Louisville, Kentucky. On July 3, federal prosecutors formally charged him with raping and murdering Abeer, and with murdering her parents and younger sister. On July 10, the U.S. Army charged four other active duty soldiers with the same crime. A sixth soldier, Yribe, was charged with failing to report the attack, but not with having participated in the massacre. On July 6, 2006, Green entered a plea of not guilty through his public defenders. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Moyer set an arraignment date of August 8 in Paducah, Kentucky. On July 11, his lawyers requested a gag order. \\"This case has received prominent and often sensational coverage in virtually all print, electronic and internet news media in the world. ‚Ä¶ Clearly, the publicity and public passions surrounding this case present the clear and imminent danger to the fair administration of justice,\\" said the motion. Prosecutors had until July 25 to file their response to the request. On August 31, a federal judge rejected the gag order. U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell said there is \\"no reason to believe\\" that Green's right to a fair trial would be in jeopardy. Furthermore, he added, \\"It is beyond question that the charges against Mr. Green are serious ones, and that some of the acts alleged in the complaint are considered unacceptable in our society.\\" Opening arguments in Green's trial were heard on April 27, 2009. The prosecution rested its case on May 4. On May 7, 2009, Green was found guilty by the federal court in Kentucky of rape and multiple counts of murder. While prosecutors sought the death penalty in this case, jurors failed to agree unanimously and the death sentence could not be imposed. On September 4, Green was formally sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. That Green was spared the death penalty provoked outrage from the family's relatives, with Abeer's uncle describing the sentence as \\"a crime  almost worse than the soldier's crime\\". Green was held in the United States Penitentiary, Tucson, Arizona, and died on February 15, 2014, from complications following an attempt at suicide by hanging.Almasy, Steve. \\"Former soldier at center of murder of Iraqi family dies after suicide attempt\\" . CNN. February 18, 2014; retrieved February 19, 2014. Appeal Green challenged his convictions, claiming that the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act is unconstitutional and that he should face a military trial. Green lost his appeal in August 2011. =James P. Barker= On November 15, 2006, Specialist Barker pleaded guilty to rape and murder as part of a plea agreement requiring him to give evidence against the other soldiers to avoid the death penalty. He was sentenced to 90 years in prison and must serve 20 years before being considered for parole, following which he would be dishonorably discharged. Barker wept during closing statements, and accepted responsibility for the rape and murders, saying the violence he had encountered in Iraq left him \\"angry and mean\\" toward Iraqis. Journalists reported \\"he smoked a cigarette outside as a bailiff watched over him. He grinned but said nothing as reporters passed by.\\" He is currently held in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. =Paul E. Cortez= On January 22, 2007, Cortez pleaded guilty in a court martial to rape, conspiracy to rape, and four counts of murder as part of a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to 100 years in prison followed by a dishonorable discharge. He wept as he apologized for the crimes, saying he could not explain why he took part. He is currently held in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. =Jesse V. Spielman= Pfc. Jesse V. Spielman On August 3, 2007, Spielman, 23, was sentenced by a court martial to 110 years in prison with the possibility of parole after ten years, followed by a dishonorable discharge. He was convicted of rape, conspiracy to commit rape, housebreaking with intent to rape and four counts of felony murder. He had earlier pleaded guilty to lesser charges of conspiracy toward obstruction of justice, arson, necrophilia and drinking. Spielman was held in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. =Bryan L. Howard= Howard was sentenced by a court martial under a plea agreement for obstruction of justice and being an accessory after the fact. The court found that his involvement included hearing the others discussing the crime and lying to protect them, but not commission of the actual rape or murders. Howard served a 27-month sentence, after which he was dishonorably discharged. =Anthony W. Yribe= Yribe was initially charged with obstructing the investigation, specifically, dereliction of duty and making a false statement. In exchange for his testimony against the other men, the government dropped the charges against him and he accepted an administrative discharge characterized as \\"other than honorable\\". Others =Justin Watt= Watt, the whistleblower, received a medical discharge and is now running a computer business. He says that he received death threats after coming forward; however, starting in 2010, he was asked by the US Army Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE) at West Point, New York, to be interviewed and speak before Army Profession audiences about his decision to report the crimes in accordance with his moral obligation to uphold the Army Ethic. Watt and Sergeant Diem have both done so, including venues at which hundreds of senior Army leaders were present, for which their acts were given standing ovations. =Survivors= Muhammed and Ahmed Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, the surviving brothers of murder victim Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, are being raised by an uncle, according to testimony in the courts-martial of Cortez, Barker and Spielman.

It originates in Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China where it is called the Phung Chu or Bum-chu. Name In Tibet, the river is called Bum-chu, also transliterated Phung-Chu or from Chinese as Peng Qu or Pumqu. Men Qu or Moinqu is an upper tributary draining glaciers from Shishapangma. In Nepal the river's name changes to Arun. Tibet The Tibetan name Bum-chu may refer to a religious ceremony attempting to divine prospects for the coming year from the level of water in a pot or well, chu is the Tibetan word for water. The river originates near Gutso in Nyalam County of Tibet. Around downstream the Men-chu joins it. The Tingri county occupies the upper reaches of the Bum-chu and the lateral valleys formed by its tributaries, the foremost of which are Lolo-chu, Shel- chu, Rongpu-chu, Trakar-chu, Kharda-chu, Ra-chu Tsangpo, and Langkor Gya-chu. The Yeru Tsanpo confluences with Bum-chu in Tingkye County, which accommodates the lower Bum-chu valley. Another river that meets Bum-chu is Trakar-chu. The river flows past the town of Kharda, gateway to the Khangzhung east face of Everest. The force of its accumulated waters carves its way, south of Drengtrang, through the main chain of the Himalayas directly between the mountain massifs of Makalu and Kangchenjunga into Nepal. Since the river's elevation is about at the border while Makalu and Kangchenjunga are both about , the valley is some deep, one of the world's deepest. Kosi River System The Kosi or Sapta Koshi drains eastern Nepal. It is known as Sapt Koshi because of the seven rivers which join together in east-central Nepal to form this river. The main rivers forming the Koshi system are ‚Äì the Sun Kosi, the Indravati River, the Bhot√© Koshi, the Dudh Kosi, the Arun River, Barun River, and Tamur River. The combined river flows through the Chatra Gorge in a southerly direction to emerge from the hills. The Sun Kosi contributes 44 per cent of the total water in the Sapta Koshi, the Arun 37 per cent and the Tamur 19 per cent. Nepal The Arun is the largest trans-Himalayan river passing through Nepal and also has the greatest snow and ice-covered area of any Nepalese river basin. The Arun drains more than half of the area contributing to the Sapta Kosi river system but provides only about a quarter of the total discharge. This apparent contradiction is caused by the location of more than 80 percent of the Arun's drainage area in the rain shadow of the Himalayas. Average annual rainfall in Tibet is about . The river leaves the Tibet region at a height of about and crosses the main Himalayan ranges. Leaving their rain shadow, the river's flow increases substantially in the monsoonal climate of east Nepal. The landscape south of the border tends to be steep with less than 15 percent of the area having a sustained slope of less than 15¬∞ and is strongly dissected by stream channels. Many of the hill slopes are structurally unstable, and the region is seismically active. The August 1988 Nepal earthquake, with an epicentre more than 50 km south of the Arun basin, had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and resulted in more than 100 deaths in the basin alone. The northern third of the Nepalese portion of the Arun basin supports a rich, though human-modified, forest of mixed hardwoods, Chir pine, fir, and rhododendron at elevations of over . The vegetation in the southern two-thirds of the area has been extensively modified for subsistence agriculture. Most of the half-million people in the Arun basin live in this southern area between and in widely scattered villages near the slopes they farm.

The city and the municipality were named Mahendranagar in the honour of late king Mahendra of Nepal. After becoming a republic in 2008, the Mahendranagar municipality name was changed to Bhimdatta municipality in honour of the revolutionary farmer leader Bhimdatta Panta. It is surrounded by Bedkot Municipality in the east, Dadeldhura District in the north, Shuklaphanta National Park in the south and Uttarakhand, India in the west. Mahendranagar is the 9th largest city in Nepal. It is east of the Indian border and west of Kathmandu. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census, it had a population of 62,050. According to the census of 2001, the city's population was 80,839. Bheemdatt is a hub of activity for industries running between India and Nepal. It is also a gateway to Shuklaphanta National Park, formerly Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve. Society The indigenous people living here are the Rana-Tharus but people from other parts mostly from the hill districts Baitadi, Darchula and Dadeldhura find themselves at home. Bheemdatt has become a unique combination of ethnic groups which has a different way of life within an already diverse country Nepal. The festivals celebrated by the ethnic Tharu people are Holi and Maghi. Tharu people celebrate Maghi as New year, while Hill People primarily celebrate Gora (commonly called Gaura Parba). Deepawali or Diwali or Tihar is a major festival which is celebrated with Laxmi Puja, Gai Puja, and Bhai Tika on their respective days. Dashain is also a major festival here. Small population from western Nepal mainly arghakhachi, gulmi, pyuthan etc have settled here (mostly in bhasi), even before local people of the same region settled from the hills of Far-west Nepal. Services Bheemdatt is the business and educational hub of the Mahakali Zone. Since it is in close proximity to the border with India, Bheemdatta plays a major role in trade in the region. Students from neighbouring districts come for education. Far-western University, which teaches diversified disciplines ranging from economics to the humanities to the sciences, is the only university in the city. People here are mainly occupied by agriculture as Nepal is an agrarian society. Business is another source of empowering the local economy which is concentrated in the bazaar area of Bheemdatt. Government services is a significant part of the economy. Being comparatively closer to the major industrial areas of India, Mahendranagar could serve as a portal for industrial exchange between India and Nepal. Transport and communication Nepal Telecom and Ncell provide 3G and 4G facilities in the area. Bheemdatt is connected to other parts of Nepal by East-West Highway which is the only road which connects it to the rest of Nepal. There is a domestic airport in Bheemdatt which is out of service. Bus service connects Bheemdatt to all the other parts of the country. There is a customs post for goods and third country nationals, while Indian and Nepalese nationals may cross the border freely. Banbasa, Uttarakhand state, India is the other side of the border. Bheemdatt is the nearest place in Nepal to New Delhi, capital of India. Bheemdatt is also connected by sub-highways to hill towns Dipayal, Baitadi, Amargadhi, and Darchula.

She is the Queen of the Southern Sea (Indian Ocean) in Sundanese and Javanese mythology. In an older Sundanese folklore, she is a beautiful princess named Dewi Kadita who comes from the Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran. According to Javanese beliefs, she is also the mythical spiritual consort of the Sultans of Mataram and Yogyakarta, beginning with Senopati and continuing to the present day. Names Nyai Loro Kidul spirit has many different names, which reflect the diverse stories of her origin in different sagas, legends, myths and traditional folklore.

Sri Winarti P, 2004 Many Javanese believe it is important to use various honorifics when referring to her, such as Nyai, Kanjeng, and Gusti. People who invoke her also call her Eyang (grandmother). In mermaid form she is referred to as Nyai Blorong.Robson, Stuart. The Kraton, KITLV Press 2003, Leiden, , p. 77 The Javanese word loro literally means two ‚Äì 2 and merged into the name of the myth about the Spirit-Queen born as a beautiful girl or maiden, in Old Javanese rara, written as r√•r√•, (also used as roro). Old-Javanese rara evolved into the New Javanese lara, written as l√•r√•, (means ill, also grief like heartache, heart-break). Dutch orthography changed lara into loro (used here in Nyai Loro Kidul) so the word play moved from beautiful girl to a sick one ‚Äì Old Javanese Nyi Rara and the New Javanese Nyai Lara.Jordaan, Roy E. Tara and Nyai Lara Kidul - Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 56, 1997: pp 303 Description Nyai Roro Kidul is often illustrated as a mermaid with a tail as well as the lower body parts of a fish. The mythical creature is claimed to be able to take the soul of any who she wished for.Becker, Judith. Die Meeresk√∂nigin des S√ºdens, Ratu Kidul. pp 142, Nyi Blorong, die Schlangenfrau ‚Äì According to local popular beliefs around coastal villages on Southern Java, the Queen often claim lives of fishermen or visitors that bathe on the beach, and she usually prefers handsome young men. The role of Nyai Loro Kidul as a Javanese Spirit-Queen became a popular motif in traditional Javanese folklore and palace mythologies, as well as being tied in with the beauty of Sundanese and Javanese princesses. Another aspect of her mythology was her ability to change shape several times a day.Bogaerts, Els. Scription Van sunans, sultans en sultanes; Ratu Kidul in the Panitik Sultan Agungan ‚Äì M.A. Thesis, Rijskuniversiteit Leiden, Holland Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta described his experience on spiritual encounters with the spirit Queen in his memoire; the queen could change shapes and appearance, as a beautiful young woman usually during full moon, and appear as an old woman at other times.Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX memoire \\"Takhta untuk Rakyat\\" Nyai Loro Kidul in a significant amount of the folklore that surrounds her ‚Äì is in control of the violent waves of the Indian Ocean from her dwelling place in the heart of the ocean. Sometimes she is referred as one of the spiritual queens or wives of the Susuhunan of Solo or Surakarta and the Sultan of Yogyakarta. Her literal positioning is considered as corresponding to the Merapi-Kraton-South Sea axis in the Solo Sultanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate. Another pervasive part of folklore surrounding her is the color aqua green, gadhung m'lathi in Javanese, which is favored and referred to by her and is thus forbidden to wear along the southern coast of Java.Robson, Stuart. The Kraton, KITLV Press 2003, Leiden , She is often describes wearing clothes or selendang (silky sashes) in this color. Origin and history Although her legends are mostly linked to the 16th century Javanese Mataram Sultanate, the older manuscript traced her legendary origin to the era of the Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran and the legend of the ill-fated princess Kadita. However, Javanese and Sundanese anthropological and cultural studies suggest that the myth of the Queen of Java's Southern Seas probably originated from older prehistoric animistic beliefs in the pre-Hindu-Buddhist female deity of the southern ocean. The fierce waves of the Indian Ocean on southern Java's coasts, its storms and sometimes tsunamis, probably had raised in the locals awe and fear of natural power, and locals attributed it to the spiritual realm of deities and demons that inhabit the southern seas ruled by their queen, a female deity, later identified as \\"Queen Kidul\\". The 16th century Javanese legends connects the Queen of Southern Seas as the protector and spiritual consort of the kings of Mataram Sultanate. Panembahan Senopati (1586‚Äì1601 AD), founder of the Mataram Sultanate, and his grandson Sultan Agung (1613‚Äì1645 AD) who named the Kanjeng Ratu Kidul as their bride, is claimed in the Babad Tanah Jawi.Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras ‚Äì (34:100 ‚Äì 36:1) According to Javanese legends dated from 16th century CE, the prince Panembahan Senopati aspired to establish a new kingdom Mataram Sultanate against Pajang overlordship. He performed ascetic acts through meditating on the beach of Parang Kusumo, south of his home in the town of Kota Gede. His meditation caused a disturbing, powerful supernatural phenomenon in the spiritual kingdom of Southern Sea. The Queen came to the beach to see who had caused this menace in her kingdom. Upon seeing the handsome prince, the queen immediately fell in love and asked the prince to stop his meditation. In return, the deity queen, who ruled spiritual realm of the southern seas, agreed to help Panembahan Senopati in his political effort to establish a new kingdom. In order to become the spiritual protector of the kingdom, the Queen asked to be held by the prince in hand of marriage, as the spiritual consort of Panembahan Senopati and all of his successors, the series of Mataram kings. One Sundanese folktale is mentioned about Dewi Kadita, the beautiful princess of the Pajajaran Kingdom, in West Java, who desperately fled to the Southern Sea after being struck by black magic. The black magic was cast by a witch under the order of a jealous rival in the palace and it caused the beautiful princess to suffer a disgusting skin disease. She later jumps into the violent waves of the ocean where she was finally cured and regained her beauty, and the spirits and demons crowned the girl as the legendary Spirit-Queen of the South Sea.Meijboom, Jos ‚Äì Javaansche sagen mythen en legenden, Zutphen ‚Äì W.J. Thieme & Cie, 1924 pp 204 ‚Äì 243, A similar version of the story above mentions that the king (at the time), who had her as his only child, was planning to retire from the throne. At the time, having a queen lead a kingdom, instead of a king, was forbidden. Therefore, the king remarried and sought for a male heir to his throne from his new wife. The king's wife finally gets impregnated, but, due to jealousy, forces the king to choose between her and his daughter. His wife then stated an ultimatum; If he chose his daughter, then his wife would leave the palace for good and the throne would be given to his daughter, who would later become the queen. If the wife was chosen instead, the daughter would be banned from the palace and the unborn child of his wife would later claim the throne as king. The king then made his decision to ban his daughter from the palace and orders a witch to curse his daughter, leaving her to suffer a skin disease. The pitiful daughter, now banned from the palace, hears a voice that tells her that if she wants to be cured of her terrible disease, she should jump into the seawater as midnight strikes. She followed as instructed and then she vanished, never to be seen or heard from again. Another Sundanese folktale shows Banyoe Bening (meaning clear water) becomes Queen of the Djojo Koelon Kingdom and, suffering from leprosy, travels to the South where she is taken up by a huge wave to disappear into the Ocean.Njai Loro Kidoel by Inten Bayan aka Rene Adeboi, Moesson, The Hague 1967 Another West Java folktale is about the Ajar Cemara Tunggal (Adjar Tjemara Toenggal) on the mountain of Kombang in the Pajajaran Kingdom. He is a male seer who actually was the beautiful great aunt of Raden Jaka Susuruh. She disguised herself as a psychic and told Raden Jaka Susuruh to go to the east of Java to find a kingdom on the place where a maja-tree just had one fruit; the fruit was bitter, pait in Javanese, and the kingdom got the name of Majapahit. The seer Cemara Tunggal would marry the founder of Majapahit and any descendant in first line, to help them in all kind of matters. Though the seer's spirit would have transmigrated into the \\"spirit-queen of the south\\" who shall reign over the spirits, demons and all dark creatures.Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras ‚Äì (7:16 ‚Äì 9:1) Specialties Sarang Burung are Javanese bird's nests, and are some of the finest in the world. The edible bird's nests, in the form of Bird's nest soup or sarang burung, find a ready market in China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore are dedicated to Nyai Loro Kidul, mentioned by Sultan Agung in reports. There are three harvests which are known as the Unduan-Kesongo, Unduan-Telor and Unduan- Kepat, and take place in April, the latter part of August (the largest), and December. The places Rongkob and along the south coast of central Java are famous for the edible bird's nests, made by the little sea swallows (so called, but actually swiftlets), called Salanganen or Collocalia fuciphaga. The harvests are famous because of the wayang performances which are held, and the Javanese ritual dances which are performed with gamelan music as the traditional ceremony. This happens in a cave (Karang Bolong) and when these are ended specially prepared offerings are made in a shed in what is known as the \\"Royal Bed of Nyai Loro Kidul\\". This relic is hung with beautiful silk batik kains, and a toilet mirror is placed against the green-coloured pillows of the bed.De Cock Wheatley, Ch. In the Realms of a Mystic Queen, Inter-Ocean, 12‚Äì13, 1931‚Äì'32 ‚Äì KITLV Leiden Holland pp 205‚Äì210 Nyai Loro Kidul is the patron goddess of the bird's-nest gatherers of South Java. The gatherers descend the sheer cliff-face on coconut fiber ropes to an overhang some thirty feet above the water where a rickety bamboo platform has been built. From there they must await their wave, drop into it, and be swept beneath the overhang into the cave. Here they grope around in total darkness filling their bags with bird's nests. Going back needs very precise timing, to avoid misjudging the tides, and falling into the violent waves.Blair, Lawrence and Lorne. Ring of Fire an Indonesian Odyssey, Park Street Press Hongkong 1991 The Dutch and their Javanese legacy The term wali which is applied to all of the Islam teachers is Arabic (meaning \\"saint\\"), but the title \\"sunan\\" which they all carry, too, is Javanese. Sunan Kalijaga used to be one of the most \\"popular\\" Wali Sanga, and he got deeply involved with Nyai Loro Kidul because of the water aspect (at the beach of Pemancingan of northern Java, kali means river). Panembahan Senopati Ingalaga (1584‚Äì1601), founder of Mataram's imperial expansion, sought the support of the goddess of the Southern Ocean (Kangjeng Ratu Kidul or Nyai Loro Kidul) at Pemancinang of southern Java. She was to become the special protectress of the House of Mataram. Senopati's reliance upon both Sunan Kalijaga and Nyai Loro Kidul in the chronicles accounts nicely reflects the Mataram Dynasty's ambivalence towards Islam and indigenous Javanese beliefs.Ricklefs, M.C. A history of modern Indonesia since c.1300, The Macmillan Press LTD 1993, pp 7, 41, Local beliefs =Pelabuhan Ratu= Pelabuhan Ratu, a small fishing town in West Java, Indonesia, celebrates an annual holiday in her honor on April 6. A memorial day for the locals, offering a lot of ceremonial \\"presents\\" to appease the queen. The local fishermen annually send the sedekah laut ceremony, offering gifts and sacrifices; from rice, vegetables and agricultural produces, to chicken, batik fabrics and cosmetics, to be larung (sent afloat to the sea) and finally drawn it to the sea to appease the queen. The local fishermen believe that the ceremony will please the Queen of Southern Sea, that in return would give them some good catches in fisheries and will also bless the surrounding areas with better weather, fewer storms and waves. Nyai Loro Kidul is also associated with Parangtritis, Parangkusumo, Pangandaran, Karang Bolong, Ngliyep, Puger, Banyuwangi, and places all along the south coast of Java. There is a local belief that wearing a green garment in these areas will anger her and will bring misfortune on the wearer, as green is her sacred color.Legend of Borobudur, pp 114: Dr. C.W. Wormser ‚Äì Het Hooge Heiligdom ‚Äì Uitgeverij W. Van Hoeve Deventer, N.V. Maatschappij Vorkink Bandoeng =Samudra Beach Hotel= The Samudra Beach Hotel, Pelabuhan Ratu, West Java, keeps room 308 furnished with green colors and reserved for Nyai Loro Kidul. The first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, was involved with the exact location and the idea for the Samudra Beach Hotel. In front of the room 308 there is the Ketapang tree where Sukarno got his spiritual inspiration. The painting of Nyai Rara Kidul by Basuki Abdullah, a famous Indonesian painter, is displayed in this room. =Yogyakarta and Central Java= The legend of Queen Kidul is often associated with beaches in Yogyakarta, especially Parangkusumo and Parangtritis. Parangkusumo in particular is special since it was the place believed to be the location of the first spiritual encounter between the Queen with Panembahan Senopati. Legends recount her love for Senopati and the famous Sultan Agung of Mataram, which continues to be recounted in the ritualized Bedhaya dance by the royal line of Surakarta, and she is honored by the susuhunans of Solo/Surakarta and the sultans of Yogyakarta, Central-Java. When Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX died on October 3, 1988, the Tempo newsmagazine reported her sighting by palace servants, who were sure that she was paying her final tribute to the deceased King. In popular culture The myth of Nyi Loro Kidul as the queen of southern ocean has become a popular source of inspiration in Indonesian culture, both traditional and modern. Some local traditional theater, particularly Sundanese Sandiwara and Javanese Kethoprak, may retell this legend in their performances. It has become the main theme of mystery, horror, and epic genres of Indonesian film and sinetron TV series. The tale of the Queen of the Southern Ocean has become the source of one of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang character, Kadita. She is also the inspiration behind the song ‚ÄúQueen of the South‚Äù by the West Javanese band The Panturas.

This is thus the frequency of fluctuations in the populations of the two atomic levels involved in that atomic transition in that situation. It is proportional to the strength of the coupling between the light and the atomic transition and to the amplitude (not intensity) of the light's electric field. Rabi flopping between the levels of a 2-level system illuminated with light exactly resonant with the transition will occur at the Rabi frequency; when the incident light is detuned from resonance then this occurs at the generalized Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency is a semiclassical concept as it is based on a quantum atomic transition and a classical light field. In the context of a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment, the Rabi frequency is the nutation frequency of a sample's net nuclear magnetization vector about a radiofrequency field. (Note that this is distinct from the Larmor frequency, which characterizes the precession of a transverse nuclear magnetization about a static magnetic field.)  Definition  The Rabi frequency is defined as : \\\\Omega_{i,j} = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{d}_{i,j} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E}_0}{\\\\hbar}, where \\\\vec{d}_{i,j} is the transition dipole moment for the i \\\\to j transition, and \\\\vec{E}_0 = \\\\hat{\\\\epsilon} E_0 is the vector electric field amplitude, which includes the polarization. The numerator has dimensions of energy, so dividing by \\\\hbar gives an angular frequency. By analogy with a classical dipole, it is clear that an atom with a large dipole moment will be more susceptible to perturbation by an electric field. The dot product includes a factor of \\\\cos\\\\theta, where \\\\theta is the angle between the polarization of the light and the transition dipole moment. When they are parallel the interaction is strongest, when they are perpendicular there is no interaction at all. In real systems, with more than two levels, the correct dipole transition matrix element for the relevant transition has to be calculated. When equating the Rabi frequency the correct Clebsch‚ÄìGordan coefficient has to be considered. Animation of optical resonance, frequency domain  Generalized Rabi frequency  For an incident light field that is not exactly at the resonant frequency of the transition, one may refer to the generalized Rabi frequency \\\\tilde\\\\Omega_{i,j}. Rabi flopping actually occurs at the generalized Rabi frequency in that situation. :\\\\tilde\\\\Omega_{i,j} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{i,j}^2 + \\\\Delta^2} where \\\\Delta = \\\\omega_\\\\text{light} - \\\\omega_\\\\text{transition} is the detuning, a measure of how far the light is off resonance relative to the transition. For instance, examining the above animation at an offset frequency of ¬±1.73, one can see that during the 1/2 Rabi cycle (at resonance) shown during the animation, the oscillation instead undergoes one full cycle, thus at twice the (normal) Rabi frequency \\\\Omega_{i j}, just as predicted by this equation. Also note that as the incident light frequency shifts further from the transition frequency, the amplitude of the Rabi oscillation decreases, as is illustrated by the dashed envelope in the above plot.

Unlike the simpler flat disks, made from a circular flat sheet of a coated abrasive, a flapwheel is made of multiple overlapping small pieces or 'flaps', bonded to a central hub.  Advantages  The advantages of a flapwheel over a traditional disk are twofold: * The separate flaps each attack the workpiece surface at a slightly different angle, and this varies slightly with tool angle. This avoids the common problem with flat sheets, where they produce repeated identical scratches. * Abrasive wear is distributed more evenly across the flaps, and through the length of each flap. Flaps wear from their outer ends and the sheet carrier cuts back as the abrasive coating is worn away. The wheel remains useful even as the flaps erode. Compared to flat sheets, that are discarded after only a small area of the abrasive is truly worn-out, this is a much more efficient use of the abrasive material.  Development  Flap disk for angle grinder use They appeared in the 1950s and their use was encouraged by developments in gas turbines. These demanded an increased production of fine investment castings that required careful polishing. In particular, the high centrifugal stresses these experienced in service required a finishing technique that did not give rise to oriented scratches that could act as stress risers. The first flapwheels were made from cut sheets of abrasive, stacked into a multi-layered flat disk. These gained the advantage of long life from their materials, but their geometry was still flat and so they tended to produce surface flats if not carefully handled. Early flapwheels were large diameter and intended for use on fixed buffing machines. They were used for deburring and polishing of castings, often instead of wire wheels. These cut faster, with less burnishing and surface contamination from the bristles. Portable flapwheels were made by bonding radial flaps of abrasive into a hub fitted with a spindle shank.Flap Wheel Abrasives These were intended for use with electric drills and were limited to a maximum speed of around 1,000 rpm. With developments in abrasive coating, the sheet material could withstand greater forces and speeds. This allowed the production of flapwheels for use with high speed angle grinders.Angle grinders typically run at speeds around 10,000 rpm. These disks were different in format: flatter, like the original rigid angle grinder disks, and with the flaps arranged in a densely overlapped layout rather than radial. The extra lifetime this gave to the disk allowed their use for stock removal and metal shaping, not just finishing and polishing. The flexibility of a flapwheel is an advantage for smoothing curved work and avoids the production of facets, as was a problem for rigid disks. This was taken further advantage of with the development of foam-bonded flapwheels. These use fewer flaps, spaced apart by a flexible foam spacer. This makes them even more flexible, thus more suited for producing a smooth finish to curved surfaces.

History View.of Onerahi Wharf circa 1912 The land for the town was purchased by Henry Walton and William Smellie Graham from Te Tirarau in the mid-1860s. It was then called Kaiwaka Point, but they renamed it Grahamtown. In 1912 it was renamed again to Onerahi ( - which means \\"beach\\" and - which can be translated to mean \\"long and wide\\") to prevent a conflict with Grahamstown in the Coromandel. From 1911 to 1933, Onerahi was also served by a branch line railway from the North Auckland Line known as the Onerahi Branch. It was built to provide access to a wharf in Onerahi and when coastal shipping declined severely in the 1930s, the railway was closed. Part of its formation has been retained as a walking track. Whangarei Airport was established in May 1939 as a RNZAF training base. It was later converted to civilian use with commercial flights commencing in 1947, and has served the Whangarei District since.http://www.whangareiflyingclub.com/history/ Demographics Onerahi, including Sherwood Rise and Onerahi Park, had a population of 6,498 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 708 people (12.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 756 people (13.2%) since the 2006 census.

Plot summary The story begins in the Soviet Union, just after the end of the Russian Civil War. An engineer Mstislav Sergeyevich Los Los', designs and constructs a revolutionary pulse detonation rocket and decides to set course for Mars. Looking for a companion for the travel, he finally leaves Earth with a retired soldier, Alexei Gusev. Arriving on Mars, they discover that the planet is inhabited by an advanced civilization. However, the gap between the ruling class and the workers is very strong and reminiscent of early capitalism, with workers living in underground corridors near their machines. Later in the novel, it is explained that Martians are descendants of both local races and of Atlanteans who came there after the sinking of their home continent (here Tolstoy was inspired by Blavatsky's books). Mars is now ruled by Engineers but all is not well. While speaking before an assembly, their leader, Toscoob, says that the city must be destroyed to ease the fall of Mars. Aelita, Toscoob's beautiful daughter and the princess of Mars, later reveals to Los' that the planet is dying, that the polar ice caps are not melting as they once did and the planet is facing an environmental catastrophe. While the adventurous Gusev takes the lead of a popular uprising against the ruler, the more intellectual Los' becomes enamored with Aelita. When the rebellion is crushed, Gusev and Los' are forced to flee Mars and eventually make it back to Earth. The trip is prolonged with the effects of high speed and time dilation resulting in a loss of over three years. The exact fate of Aelita herself is unknown. It is hinted that she actually survived, since Los' receives radio messages from Mars mentioning his name. Adaptations The novel was adapted in the Soviet Union to silent film under the same title shot by Yakov Protazanov in 1924, and by Hungarian director Andr√°s Rajnai in 1980. Andrija Mauroviƒá (artist) and Kre≈°imir Kovaƒçiƒá (writer) in Yugoslavia adapted it into a comic, published 1935-1936, titled Ljubavnica s Marsa (Mistress from Mars).

In arabic, the spellings ŸÉŸÜÿ¨ŸÅÿ© or ÿ¨ŸÜÿ¨ŸÅÿ© or ÿ∫ŸÜÿ¨ŸÅŸá can be found. The Persian word is ganjifeh (⁄ØŸÜÿ¨ŸÅŸá). In Hindi the term is ‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä‡§´‡§æ. is a card game and type of playing cards that are most associated with Persia and India. After Ganjifa cards fell out of use in Iran before the twentieth century, India became the last country to produce them.At the start of the 21st Century production in India was still ongoing in the town of Sawantvadi in the west, and Odisha in the east for example. See Abram (2003: 53) and Crestin-Billet (2002: 189). The form prevalent in Odisha is Ganjapa. Description Images of ivory playing cards bought in a Cairo bazaar by French traveller Mr. √âmile Prisse d'Avennes (1807-1879), during his visit to Egypt in the period 1827-1844. He identified them as Persian by the style and quality. Ganjifa cards are circular or rectangular,A rectangular example dated to around 1770 is held in the collection of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. See http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55007315w/f13.item and traditionally hand-painted by artisans. The game became popular at the Mughal court, and lavish sets were made, from materials such as precious stone-inlaid ivory or tortoise shell (darbar kalam). The game later spread to the general public, whereupon cheaper sets (baz√¢r kalam) would be made from materials such as wood, palm leaf, stiffened cloth or pasteboard. Typically Ganjifa cards have coloured backgrounds, with each suit having a different colour. Different types exist, and the designs, number of suits, and physical size of the cards can vary considerably. With the exception of Mamluk Kanjifa and the Chads of Mysore, each suit contains ten pip cards and two court cards, the king and the vizier or minister. The backs of the cards are typically a uniform colour, without patterning. History =Etymology= The earliest origins of the cards remain uncertain, but Ganjifa cards as they are known today are believed to have originated in Persia. The first syllable is attributed to the Persian word 'ganj' meaning treasure. Gen. Houtum-Schindler suggested to Stewart Culin that the last two syllables in the word 'Ganjifa' may be derived from the Chinese chi-p'ai, meaning playing cards (Culin p928)Andy Pollett covers this line of argument on http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards25.htm (retrieved 03/01/2015). In a related passage Chatto explains that an early Chinese term was 'ya-pae', meaning 'bone ticket', and that the term 'che-pae' came later, meaning literally 'paper ticket'(1848: 58). These different terms could account for the different spellings and pronunciations of 'Ganjifa'. Rolf Zimmermann goes further in his 2006 article, and suggests that the first syllable of the word Ganjifa could come from 'Han' as in Han Chinese, and thus 'Ganjifa' would mean 'han-chi-pai', or 'Chinese playing cards'.(Retrieved from Szent Istv√°n t√©r on 03/01/2015) These remain unproved theories, but the 18th century traveller Carsten Niebuhr claimed to have seen Arabian merchants in Bombay playing with Chinese cards.(Niebuhr 1774: 173) In the 19th century Jean Louis Burckhardt visited Mecca and wrote that 'cards are played in almost every Arab coffee-house (they use small Chinese cards)'.(Burckhardt 1829: 377) Ganjifa became popular in India under the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. The term has been used at times in many countries throughout the Middle East and western Asia. In Kuwait, the word 'Janjifah' has become a general term and so is applied to the internationally known French deck.In Arabic and Persian, there exists also the more general word for playing cards, 'waraq' ( Ÿàÿ±ŸÇ ). This word can be found in texts that may refer to Ganjifa cards. For example in the 16th century work, the Humayun-namah, about the Mughal emperor Humayun, this term 'waraq' is used. The text describes a gambling game that was played during celebrations upon Humayun's return to Kabul in 1545. The game involved twelve players, each with twenty cards. Refer Beveridge (1902: 178, or 77 in the Persian section of the book). =Arabic sources and surviving cards= Four Mamluk playing cards Despite the significance of Persia in the history of ganjifa cards, the very earliest known text reference (Ibn Taghribirdi) and card specimens (Mamluk era) are from Egypt. An exhibition in the British museum in 2013 noted \\"Playing cards are known in Egypt from the twelfth century AD. Ganjafeh was a popular card game in Iran and the Arab world.\\" For example, the word 'kanjifah' ( ŸÉŸÜÿ¨ŸÅÿ© ) is written in the top right corner of the king of swords, on the Mamluk Egyptian deck witnessed by L.A. Mayer in the Topkapƒ± Palace museum. The Mamluk cards are difficult to date with any certainty, but Mayer estimated these cards to be from the 15th century. The piece of playing card collected by Edmund de Unger may be from the period of the 12-14th centuries.(Mayer 1971: 9); See also the discussion on the early history of playing cards. The term Kanjifah can be found in the 1839 Calcutta edition of the One Thousand and One Nights, in Arabic, at the end of night 460. The first known reference can be found in a 15th-century Arabic text, written by the Egyptian historian Ibn Taghribirdi (died 1470). In his history of Egypt he mentions how the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mu'ayyad played kanjafah for money when he was an emir.The text is described in English by Richard Ettinghausen, in his article \\"Further Comments on Mamluk Playing Cards\\". The quote refers to the work of Ibn Taghribirdi, called \\"Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira\\". Ettinghausen notes that the reference comes in the section describing events from the year 820H or 1417-1418 AD (1984: 1194). The original Arabic text can be found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=QCvC39URTY4C&lpg;=PP1&dq;=editions%3Ae0XIWB1KOVMC&pg;=PT535 (Google E-book) or http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-11988/page-4536 . The relevant passage begins \\" ... Ÿàÿ£ÿÆÿ∞ ŸÅŸâ ÿ•ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠ ÿ£ŸÖÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ \\". The cards used by the Mamluks most likely entered Italy and Spain during the 1370s. As early as 1895, William Henry Wilkinson pointed out the similarities between Spanish and Italian playing cards and Chinese money-suited cards.Wilkinson, W.H. (1895) Chinese Origin of Playing Cards . The American Anthropologist, Volume VIII, pp. 61-78. He was unaware of the existence of the Mamluk cards since Mayer did not make his discovery until 1939. The similarities between the Latin European cards and Chinese money-suited cards become more apparent when the Mamluk Kanjifa is described. Looking at the actual games played with Ganjifa cards, Andrew Leibs points out that the cards are divided into strong and weak suits, and in one set the order of the numerical cards is reversed, so that the order runs King, Vizier, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the weakest. This feature can also be found in the old games of Tarot, Ombre, and Maw played in Europe, and the Chinese money-suited card game of 'Madiao'. He suggests these games may have a common ancestor.(2004: 130) Kanjifa consists of 52 cards divided into four suits: *Coins: This suit is in reverse order like in Chinese money- suited card games of Madiao and Khanhoo as well as in Tarot, Ombre, and Maw. The high ranking cards of this suit have blue panels (king, viceroy, second viceroy, 1, 2, 3).Gjerde, Tor. Mamluk cards, ca. 1500 at Historical playing cards. Retrieved 23 February 2016. *Polo-sticks: Very likely originated from the Chinese suit of Strings of Coins. This suit is also in reverse order as indicated by the blue panels. This suit was converted into cudgels (Spain) or batons (Italy) as polo was too obscure in Europe. *Cups: The cups are called tuman, a Turkic, Mongol, and Jurchen word meaning \\"myriad\\". In China, there is a suit of myriads (). Wilkinson proposed that European cups were created by flipping the Chinese character. In Italy and Spain, this suit was inverted but in the Mamluk deck the blue panels are only found in the three court cards. *Swords: This suit is in the logical order with blue panels on the king, viceroy, second viceroy, 10, 9, and 8. Andrea Pollett proposes that it originates from the Chinese suit of Tens () of Myriads.Pollett, Andrea. Relations between eastern and western cards at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 23 February 2016. Richard Ettinghausen speculated that importation of European cards killed off manufacturers in Egypt and the Levant. Trade continued after the conquest of these regions by the Ottomon Turks in 1517. They were also mentioned by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami. The lack of references or cards after the 16th century is likely due to the Ottomans taking a harder stance against cards and gambling which would last until the 19th century. =Persian sources= Images of cards from the collection of Francis Douce, shown by Samuel Weller Singer. The figure on horseback on the card in the top right corner appears to be holding an object marked \\" ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ™ \\", meaning 'bill' or 'cheque' in Persian. The earliest Persian reference is found in Ahli Shirazi's (died 1535) poem, 'Rubaiyat-e-Ganjifa', there is a short verse for each of the 96 cards in the 8-suited pack, showing that the Persians had the same suits and ranks as the Mughals.See Farsi wikipedia article :fa:ÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿπ€åÿßÿ™ ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨ŸÅŸá, or for the full text refer to Shirazi & Rabbani (1965:668-684). The poem is also mentioned in the bibliography of Katip √áelebi page 832. The Austrian National Library possess eight Safavid lacquer paintings from the 16th-century that mimic ganjifeh cards. Despite being produced around the same time as Shirazi's poem, they do not match his description.They depict a mounted vizier playing polo with two assistants, 10 archers, 8 merchants, 8 farmers, 2 bulls, 3 lions, 10 lions, and 2 genii or demons. It is not known if they are purely artwork or supposed to represent a standard pattern of cards. See: Zimmerman, Rolf. Die verschollenen Spielkarten Zentralasiens at altacarta.com. Retrieved 31 October 2015. Shah Abbas II (r 1642-66) banned ganjifeh and the game decline precipitously with no known rules surviving into the present. Around the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, the game of As-Nas became more popular.The collection of the Fournier playing cards museum in Vittoria, Spain, contains As-Nas cards dated to the 18th and 19th centuries. The Cary playing card collection (Yale University) contains various Iranian cards, spanning a period from 1800 to 1905 (estimated dates). All the cards are of the As-Nas type, rather than the older 8-suited variety. In 1895, General Albert Houtum-Schindler described ganjifeh and As-Nas with the following comments:Quoted by Stewart Culin :\\"The word ganjifeh is in Persian now only employed for European playing-cards (four suits, ace to ten; three picture cards each suit), which, however, are also called rarak i √¢s - rarak i √¢san√¢s - or simply √¢s, from the game √¢s or √¢san√¢s. From travellers to Persia in the seventeenth century we know that a set of ganjifeh consisted of ninety or ninety-six cards in eight suits or colors.See for example Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1676: 626), and Jean Chardin (1811: 451). Michael Dummett noted the differences between Mamluk kanjifa and Safavid ganjifeh and postulated that there was an earlier ancestor. This ur-ganjifeh would be similar to kanjifa but with only two court cards, the king and the viceroy/vizier. The second viceroy rank found in the kanjifa pack is not based on any historical title and may be a Mamluk invention. According to his hypothesis, the Chinese money- suited pack entered Persia where the Persians added three new ranks: the 10, viceroy, and king to make a 48-card pack. He suggests the Persians eventually changed most of the Chinese suits to fit their culture while the Mamluks were more conservative with the suits. The addition of new suits in both Persia and India was to make the game more challenging as memory is the most important skill in the eponymous trick-taking game. Chinese money-suited cards copied their pips directly from Chinese banknotes. In 1294, Gaykhatu began printing an imitation of Yuan banknotes in Iran although these were withdrawn quickly after merchants rejected them.Ashtor, Eliyahu. (1976) A Social and Economic History of the Near East in the Middle Ages. Londen: W. Collins & Co. Ltd. p. 257. By the 17th century, the money-suited deck had acquired a new card depicting a Persian merchant.Lo, Andrew (2000), The Late Ming Game of Ma Diao, The Playing-Card (XXIX, No. 3), pp. 115‚Äì136, The International Playing-Card Society. =Early history in India= Rudolf von Leyden suggested that the Ganjifa cards may have been brought by the first Mughals from their ancestral homeland in Inner Asia.(article 'The Search for Ganjifa' in The India Magazine, June 1983, p28. Retrieved from http://kreedaakaushalya.blogspot.fr/2010/01/search-for-ganjifa.html on 02/01/2015) A key reference comes from an early 16th-century biography of B√¢bur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty. In his work the Baburnama, Babur notes in the year 933H (1527) that he had a pack of Ganjifa cards sent to Shah Hassan. This took place in the month of Ramzan, on the night he left Agra to travel to nearby Fatehpur Sikri (Uttar Pradesh, India).See Beveridge (1922: 584) The earliest surviving rules date to around 1600 in India. When Edward Terry visited India in the first quarter of the seventeenth century, he saw ganjifa cards often.See Terry (1777:190), or weblink https://books.google.com/books?id=79gRAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA190#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Modern ganjifa is usually round but rectangular cards were more common during the 18th-century and from records Persian ganjifeh was always rectangular. Its circular shape must have been an Indian innovation. Mughal Ganjifa Playing Cards, Early 19th century, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection While Mughal ganjifa had the same suits and ranks as Safavid ganjifeh, a 10-suited deck, the Dashavatara Ganjifa, was created to appeal to Hindus in the seventeenth century. Some historical decks have had more than 30 suits. =Competition from Western style cards= In countries such as India and Persia, the traditional hand-made Ganjifa cards lost market share to Western-style printed cards, which came to dominate in the 20th century. This decline has several aspects. * Improvements in printing techniques and machinery allowed manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere to improve their output and further expand their export of playing cards. Manufacturers introduced steam powered machines, lithography and later Offset printing during the 19th century. For example, the town of Turnhout in Belgium was a centre of playing cards manufacture. The Turnhout manufacturer Brepols installed steam powered equipment in 1852, lithographic printing of playing cards in 1862, and began offset printing in 1920.Autenboer & Cremers, pages 23-25 In the period around 1900 the French manufacturer CamoinSee also French wikipedia article :fr:Jean- Baptiste Camoin exported cards to North Africa, and the Middle East as far as the Persian Gulf.p81-2, Cartes √† jouer & tarots de Marseille: La donation Camoin The Indian market was so significant for the Belgian manufacturer 'Biermans' that a factory was established in Calcutta in 1934.Autenboer & Cremers, page 27 In 1938 playing card exports from the US to India totalled some 888,603 packs, and 60,344 packs were exported to Iraq.Bureau of the Census pages 642-3 For the Ottoman Empire some European manufacturers produced cards with specific designs, known as 'cartes turques' and 'cartes orientales'. These were essentially 4-suited European style designs, but the aces featured scenic prints adapted to the target market.Autenboer & Cremers, page 18, and on p.22 an example is shown from the Turnhout manufacturer Gl√©nisson, from the second half of the 19th Century. The ace has a double- headed design, with a scene of the modern city of Istanbul on one end, and a scene of the historic city on the other, when it was called Constantinople. The titles are written using the Arabic alphabet. * Ganjifa cards were less suited to Western card games. The invention of games such as Euchre, Bridge, Poker, and Rummy can be seen as significant events and Western style playing cards are best suited to these games. In Iran, the game of As-Nas largely fell out of fashion by around 1945.Article from the Brooklyn Museum website, consulted 15/11/2014 \\"As nas became popular under the Qajars and continued to be played until the end of World War II, when it lost favor to games such as poker, rummy, and bridge.\\". Link: http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/169352/Playing_Cards_for_the_Game_of_Nas In some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, a version of the French game Belote became popular, under the name Baloot ( ÿ®ŸÑŸàÿ™ ). With regards to India, European style cards were introduced during the colonial period, with demand coming from the wealthier classes.Crestin Billet (2002:188) Some cards were imported, some were made by hand using traditional techniques, and others were made by Indian industrialists. The Cary Collection of Playing Cards (Yale University) has a deck of Indian-made bridge cards dated to around 1935, for example.Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Cary Playing Cards Database.

Title: ZENITH 515 BRIDGE PLAYING CARDS * Taxes on playing cards. States used taxes on playing cards to generate revenue, and required specific stamps or wrappers on packs of cards. Such arrangements can create barriers for smaller manufacturers producing cards by hand. The Ottoman Empire introduced taxes on playing cards in 1904.Autenboer & Cremers, page 26 * Playing cards monopolies. In many countries state monopolies were established to control imports and production. Such monopolies tend to standardise card designs, or create conditions that better suit larger manufacturers that can win government contracts or meet the necessary conditions. In Iran, the monopoly was set up following the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act of 1931. The British playing card manufacturer De La Rue was commissioned to provide cards during the 1930s. The cards featured indexing in Persian and court card images that evoked Persian history. Nonetheless the cards used Western style suits, and so the commissioning of the cards reinforced the position of Western-style 4-suited printed cards. By the 21st- century, the only place with a significant community of ganjifa makers and players is Odisha in the east of India. They use ganjapa, the local variation known for abstract and highly stylized suit symbols and extra suits. Variants Various Ganjifa cards from Dashavatara set * Moghul GanjifaFor more information and images refer to pattern sheet 67 of the International Playing Card Society (website: http://www.i-p-c-s.org). Link to pattern sheet viewed 16/11/2014: http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/sawmog.html is played in some parts of Odisha with 96 cards in 8 suits of 12 cards each; each suit is distinctively coloured and comprises ten pip cards from 1 to 10 and two court cards, a vizier and a king. This is the type of pack described by Ahli Shirazi. The suits featured are: slaves (·∏°olƒÅm, ÿ∫ŸÑÿßŸÖ ); crowns (tƒÅj, ÿ™ÿßÿ¨ ) swords (≈°am≈°ƒ´r, ÿ¥ŸÖÿ¥Ÿäÿ± ); 'red' gold coins (zar-e sor·∏µ, ÿ≤ÿ± ÿ≥ÿ±ÿÆ ); harps (ƒçang, ⁄ÜŸÜ⁄Ø ); bills of exchange (barƒÅt, ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ™ ); white gold coins (zar-e safƒ´d, ÿ≤ÿ± ÿ≥ŸÅŸäÿØ ); and cloth (qomƒÅ≈° ŸÇŸÖÿßÿ¥ ). When referring to the king of a suit, he uses the term 'emir', shortened to 'mir' ( ŸÖ€åÿ± ) in the titles, but the term 'padishah' ( ŸæÿßÿØÿ¥ÿßŸá ) in the text of the verses. He describes a card with one suit symbol simply as a 'one', that is to say he does not the term 'ace'.Shirazi & Rabbani (1965:668-684) * Dashavatara GanjifaRefer to IPCS pattern sheet 66 for examples from Sawantwadi: http://i-p- c-s.org/pattern/sawdas.html ; sheet 69 for examples from Nossam: http://i-p- c-s.org/pattern/nosdas.html ; or sheet 82 for examples from Kurnol: http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/kurnol.html (links viewed 16/11/2014). is played by three persons with 120 cards, mainly in Sawantwadi in Maharashtra, India, although it is played by five persons in Bishnupur, West Bengal. There are 10 suits of 12 cards each; the suits correspond to the ten avatars of Vishnu. The order of the suits (from lowest to highest) is: Matsya (fish), Kuchha (turtle), Varaha (boar), Narsingha (lion, or half-man, half-lion), Vamana (Vishnu as a dwarf, round vessel symbols on cards), Parashurama (axes), Rama (bows and arrows), Krishna (round plates shown), Buddha (conch shells), Kalanki (swords).Description based on booklet supplied with a set of cards from Sawantwadi Lacquerwares, The Palace, Sawantwadi 416510 Maharashtra, India. * Ramayan Ganjifa, a type with imagery from the Hindu epic, the Ramayan.Orissa Review, January 2010. Retrieved 30/1/2015. http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/Jan/engpdf/39-43.pdf It is closely associated with the Ganjapa tradition of Odisha and usually has eight, ten, or twelve suits. * Rashi Ganjifa is a 12 suited Indian deck, with suit symbols derived from the 12 signs of the zodiac. It appears to be limited to the 18th and 19th centuries. * Ashta Malla Ganjifa, meaning 'Eight Wrestlers'. Depicts Krishna wrestling various demons.Described by Krishna Chaitanya (1994: 58).

There is only one suit which is quadruplicated. The suit symbols used for the run of 12 cards vary from one pack to the next. These decks are associated with gambling or play during the festival season in India. * Mysore Chad Ganjifa. Mysore was a centre for Ganjifa card making, encouraged by the ruler Krishnaraja Wadiyar III in the mid-19th century. He devised a series of complex Ganjifa games, some requiring as many as 18 different suits, permanent trumps, and wild cards. A typical Chad suit had twelve numeral and six court cards, and packs had as many as 360 cards. They never achieved mass appeal and are quite obscure, possibly played only within his royal palace if at all.Refer to articles by Mr. Kishor N. Gordhandas, such as 'Cards of Honour', in the Mysore based Deccan Herald newspaper, Sunday 6/4/2008, online version http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Apr62008/finearts2008040561212.asp (retrieved 02/01/2015); 'Playing cards of Mysore' http://kishorcards.tripod.com/05mysore/mysore1to7.htm (retrieved 25/3/2015); also 'Mysore Palace Playing cards', http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=India&CraftCode;=003665 (retrieved 02/01/2015). The games are described in the work called the Sritattvanidhi, in the section 'Kautuka nidhi', and colour illustrations show designs for the cards. * Akbar's Ganjifa. The 16th-century Mughal emperor Akbar played using a 12 suited deck, which is described in detail in the Ain- i-Akbari. The suits were horses, elephants, foot soldiers, forts, treasures, warriors in armour, boats, women, divinities, genii, wild beasts, and snakes. No specimens are known to have survived.Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (1873: 306). Google book: https://books.google.com/books?id=_Isx7NqZZHEC&pg;=PA306 * Mamluk Kanjifa. Very few such cards are known or exist. The examples found by Leo Aryeh Mayer are understood to have four suits: cups, coins, swords, and polo- sticks. Each suit has three court cards, the king (malik), the first vizir (na'ib malik), and the second vizir (na'ib thani). The court cards have no figurative imagery, but they feature calligraphed inscriptions and richly decorated backgrounds. The term 'Kanjifa' appears in Arabic on the king of swords. They directly inspired the Latin-suited playing cards of Italy and Spain. * French suited Ganjifa. Hybrids exist that combine Indian or Persian imagery with the hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs symbols of the French suit system.Refer to IPCS pattern sheet 68. Link viewed 16/11/2014: http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/sawf.htmlCrestin Billet shows examples taken from the collection of the Mus√©e Fran√ßais de la Carte √† Jouer, in the Paris region (2002: 185, 188-9). Games =Ganjifa= This is a trick-taking game, played individually. This is the game most commonly associated with ganjifa cards, each player playing for him or herself. The objective is to win the most cards by taking tricks. At least three players are required. In some games 4 players play individually, and it is also possible to play in pairs. The rules vary, but generally the following apply: :In the simplest form of the game there is no concept of a 'trump suit' that beats cards in other suits.A variant is possible where the 'lead suit' as described below is the trump suit. A trick can only be won by a card of the same suit. When a player is not in position to win a trick there is no obligation to follow the suit led. :In all cases the King ('mir' or 'shah') is always the strongest card in each suit, followed by the Vizier. However, in half the suits the numerical cards rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and the other suits the order of the numerical cards is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.This feature of a reversed order in the number cards of half the suits can be found in some European games, notably Ombre, Maw, and most games played with Tarot cards. For the game of Ombre see the rules given by Peter Arnold, for example (2010:88), and Chatto points out this similarity between the rules of Ganjifa and those of Ombre (1848:45). An Italian account explains how this feature of Ombre also applied to the game played with the Minchiate tarot cards (Brunetti 1747:16)(direct link https://books.google.com/books?id=x_1dAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PA16 ). The suits of cups (coppe) and coins (denari) are those with the reversed order of the number cards. In France this inverted order did feature for a time in the game of French tarot, at least in some regions, although it has now disappeared from the modern standard rules. The book 'Tarot, Jeu et Magie' points to two literary sources that mention this feature, from the 18th and 19th centuries (1984:122-124)(link, text in French, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6532698n ). If playing with a Moghul type pack, the suits with the 'reverse order' numerical cards are , , , and (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e safƒ´d (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs the suits with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols). :Before the start of play stakes are agreed if the game is being played for money. At the end of the round the losing player pays this stake value, multiplied by the difference in number of tricks taken between the winner and the loser. Dealing :Players draw cards at the beginning to determine who will deal. Traditionally players would sit on a sheet or large cloth on the floor, and the cards are mixed face down in the middle of the cloth, rather than shuffled in the manner of Western cards. :The deal and the order of the play follows an anti-clockwise direction. The dealer deals out all the cards. According to custom cards may be dealt in batches of four, rather than individually. Some accounts stipulate that the first batch and last batch dealt to each player are dealt face up.These are the rules given by Shrikrisna Maudranalay, and also those in the account by Chatto (1848: 42) :Players should sort their cards into suits and put them in order. For convenience, due to the large number of cards, players often separate any low value pip cards and keep them to the side, keeping only the more valuable cards in hand. When discarding during play these low value cards are used indifferently. Play :During the game players must try to keep track of the cards that have been played. The highest outstanding cards left in play in each suit are called , corresponding to the Persian word \\" ÿ≠⁄©ŸÖ \\".Hukm (or Hokm) is the name of a card game played in modern Iran. It is of the same general family of games as the ganjifa trick taking game. Play is to the right (counterclockwise), cards are dealt in batches, and as in ganjifa, the player that leads the game is one that receives a high card (in the case of Hokm, an ace). Refer to http://www.pagat.com/whist/hokm.html :The player to lead is the one holding the King in a certain suit. This 'lead suit' varies according to the type of pack, and also according to whether the game is played during the day (between sunrise and sunset) or during the night. With a Moghul pack the lead suits are (red gold coins, or figuratively 'suns') by day, and (white gold coins or figuratively 'moons') by night. If playing with Dashavtar cards the lead suits are Rama by day, and Krishna by night. The player holding the King in this lead suit begins by playing two cards at once - the King and another low card. The other players cannot win, and so they each discard two low cards which are won by the player who led the game. This player then leads again. At this point accounts of the game rules differ. The rules below on gameplay are based on the description by John McLeod.Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \\"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997.

For comparison, other accounts can be found, such as Sally Wilkins (2002: 194-195); the booklet given with sets of cards by Sawandwadi Lacquerwares, written by Maudranalay; Chatto (1848:41-43), who quotes from an article from the 'Calcutta Magazine' (1815); and an article by Kishor Gordhandas, retrieved on Feb. 8, 2015: http://kishorcards.tripod.com/08handed/handed1to6.htm :Rules govern which leads are possible. Players must lead as follows, in order of priority: 1) If the lead player has a continuous series of winning cards in a suit, then this sequence must be led, with the exception of the last card in the sequence which is kept for later. 2) The next possibility is a move called 'deni'. This is possible when a player lacks the in a given suit, but has the second highest outstanding card. In this case the player may lead a low card in that suit, and call for the . The opponent with the then wins the trick but the player that made the 'deni' move retains the lead, which is the advantage of making this move. If the player with the also holds the third highest card in the suit, he may play this card as well, and it is said that the deni is doubled. In this case everyone plays a second card and the player with the wins two tricks. However the lead still returns to the player who made the deni move. 3) When a leader cannot make either of the two leads described above, he then leads out any remaining cards, all at once, a move called 'utari'.Noted by Wilkins (2002: 195). Compare also the definition given by Maudranalay, page 16. In McLeod's account this is the only option available to a player at this stage, so a player would need to lead any they might have, and then pass the lead as described next in step 4. However in the rules given by Wilkins there is a second option, whereby the player can instead simply lead a low card or non-winning card of his choosing to pass the lead.Wilkins (2002:195) 4) If a player has no further valid options for leading cards, he gives up the lead by shuffling his hand, and placing the cards face down. The player to his right then selects the card that he must lead, for example by saying 'fourth from the top' or pointing to a card if they are spread out. The lead then passes to the player who wins the trick, who then follows the same sequence of possible leads as described above. :In some accounts there is an end phase or secondary phase to the game, in which the leading rules are simplified or changed. According to McLeod, when the players get down to the last 12 cards, steps 1 and 2 described above are skipped, and a player starts by leading out all his directly. After doing so, the player must try to lead a card from a suit named by his right-hand neighbour. If he cannot lead this suit the lead is passed as described in step 4 above, with the player's cards shuffled and placed face down. In Wilkins' account, there is also a second phase to the game, which applies when all the players have held and lost the lead once. From this point onwards cards are played individually instead of in batches. Furthermore, in this second phase, if a player leads a low card, it is played face down and the player can freely choose the suit which must be followed. :The round continues until all the cards have been played. At this point the players can count their tricks and decide any payments or forfeits that must be paid. However in the rules described by Chatto there a final round played using the cards won in tricks. This is a challenging game called 'Ser-k'hel'. Players shuffle their tricks, and the winner of the last trick plays one trick blind against a player of his choice. The winner of this trick then challenges the player to his right in the same way.Chatto (1848:43) Following rounds :In some accounts losing players are disadvantaged when starting the next round. One possibility is that players are required to use the cards won in tricks for playing with in the following round. Players who are short on cards have to buy cards from other players to make up the difference.See Chatto (1848:43) Alternatively, cards can be shuffled and distributed equally, but losing players are required to exchange cards with winning players. The losing player must give cards at random, without looking at them, and the winning player is allowed to return low value cards, sorted from his hand. The number of cards exchanged is the difference in the number of tricks won in the last round. :The total number of rounds played may vary. In Chatto's account a full game is made up of four rounds. In the version described by Maudranalay, there is no fixed number of rounds, rather the game must continue round after round until a losing player (presumably meaning a player who lost the previous round of gameplay) beats the card led by another player on the last trick of the round.Maudranalay, page 16. This last lead card is called the 'akheri', from a word for 'last' (which exists in persian and Arabic ( ÿ¢ÿÆÿ± ). In Wilkin's account, this event has a different significance. Wilkins writes that if a player beats the akheri card, he is exempted from paying any forfeit money going into the next round. :An adaptation is possible if players use the international 52 card pack. In this case the game is for three players only, and the 2 of diamonds is removed so that players each receive 17 cards each. The lead suit is always spades. In an account about gameplay in northern India (before the creation of Pakistan), Shurreef writes that the King is referred to as 'Badshah' (corresponding to the Persian term 'Padishah'), the queen as 'Bibia' (Persian term 'Bibi'), and the Jack as the 'Ghulam', meaning 'slave'.Shurreef (1999:336). =Partnership Ganjifa= Played in partnerships (two against two). Some call this game 'Dugi'.See IPCS paper 'Ganjifa - the traditional playing cards of India', by Jeff Hopewell, p63. The name 'Dugi' is used in Digapahandi (Orissa) In this game the order of the suits and the cards is the same as for the individual ganjifa trick taking game described above, however the aim of the game is for one partnership to win all the tricks. The partnership dealt the King in the lead suit has to take on this challenge. It is possible to determine the lead suit by the day or night rule as above, or by cutting cards. The following game rules are taken from an account by John McLeodOnline post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \\"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997.

Before starting, the lead king can be passed from one partner to another in exchange for another card of the same suit. :When leading, a player must lead all the that they have in hand (these are the highest cards remaining in a given suit, that are sure to win). Players must follow suit if they are able to do so. If this is not possible, the leading player names another suit, and they must discard their highest card in that suit. If they do not have any cards in the suit named, then they may discard any other card. :When a player who has the lead has no , he may ask his partner which suit he should lead. Thus the partner can indicate a suit in which he has a , so that the partnership can keep the lead. If the partner names a suit that the leader does not have in hand, the leader must decide himself which card to lead, without asking for more guidance. :If the opponents succeed in winning a single trick then they win the game. =Naqsh= This game can be played with any pack of cards, including the Mughal types, and the shorter 48 card decks. European style packs can be used by removing the jacks. Each suit therefore has two court cards, and ten numeral cards. The game has some similarities with Blackjack. In Naqsh the 'Mir' (or King) is given a value of 12 points, and the second court card, the 'Ghodi' (or Vizir, Cavalier or Queen) is worth 11. The other cards are worth their pip values, including the ace which has a value of 1. Several players can play the game. Mr. Gordhandas suggests 5-7 players, with 6 being the ideal number. The aim is to achieve a total value of 17 with the first two cards dealt, or the nearest number below this total. Players with low value cards can continue to draw further cards to try to improve their total. Variations can be played where 21 is a target total (but only if made with a King and a 9, or a Vizier and a ten), or where different winning combinations are accepted such as pairs, triples and so on. The game is suited to gambling.Based on article by Mr. Kishor Gordhandas: http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=india&CraftCode;=003675 retrieved 3/1/2015.

The play premiered in 1996 as Six Myths at Northwestern University and later the Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago. The play opened off-Broadway in October 2001 at the Second Stage Theatre. It transferred to Broadway on 21 February 2002 at the Circle in the Square Theatre. That year it won several Tony Awards. It was revived at the Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago on 19 September 2012 and was produced in Washington, DC at the Arena Stage in 2013.  Background  Mary Zimmerman's Metamorphoses is based on David R. Slavitt's free-verse translation of The Metamorphoses of Ovid. She directed an early version of the play, Six Myths, in 1996 at the Northwestern University Theater and Interpretation Center. Zimmerman's finished work, Metamorphoses, was produced in 1998. Of the many stories told in Zimmerman's Metamorphoses, only the introductory \\"Cosmogony\\" and the tale of Phaeton are from the first half of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The story of Eros and Psyche is not a part of Ovid's Metamorphoses; it is from Lucius Apuleius' novel Metamorphoses ‚Äîalso called The Golden Ass‚Äîand was included in Zimmerman's Metamorphoses because, as Zimmerman said in an interview with Bill Moyers of PBS NOW, \\"I love it so much I just had to put it in.\\"Moyers, Bill.

Woods in 1990); and Jane Alison's The Love-Artist (2001). Additionally, Ovid's Metamorphoses were translated by A.D. Melville, Allen Mandelbaum, David R. Slavitt, David Michael Hoffman and James Lasdun, and Ted Hughes‚Äîin 1986, 1993, 1994, 1994, and 1997, respectively. Plot synopsis The play is staged as a series of vignettes. The order is as follows: *Cosmogony  Used to explain the creation of the world, as well as give the audience a sense of the style and setting of the play. Woman by the Water, Scientist, and Zeus help narrate how our world of order came from chaos, either by the hand of a creator or by a \\"natural order of things.\\" *Midas  The story is framed by the narration of three laundresses, who tell the story of King Midas, a very rich man. After Midas shuns his daughter for being too disruptive during his speech about caring for his family, a drunken Silenus enters and speaks of a distant land capable of granting eternal life. Silenus later falls asleep, and Midas shelters him in the cabana. When Bacchus comes to retrieve Silenus, he grants Midas a wish for his gracious care of Silenus. Midas asks to have whatever he touches turn to gold. Midas accidentally turns his beloved daughter into gold and is told by Bacchus to seek a mystic pool, which will restore him to normal. Midas leaves on his quest. *Alcyone and Ceyx  Also narrated by the three laundresses, this story portrays King Ceyx and his wife Alcyone. Despite his wife's warnings and disapproval, Ceyx voyages on the ocean to visit a far off oracle. Poseidon, the sea god, destroys Ceyx's ship and the king dies. Alcyone awaits him on shore. Prompted by Aphrodite, Alcyone has a dream of Ceyx, who tells her to go to the shore. With mercy from the gods, the two are reunited. Transformed into seabirds, they fly together toward the horizon. *Erysichthon and Ceres  This story tells of Erysichthon, man of no god, who chops down one of Ceres' sacred trees. For vengeance, Ceres commands the spirit Hunger to make Erysichthon captive to an insatiable appetite. After eating endlessly and spending all his gold on food, Erysichthon tries to sell his mother to a merchant. His mother is transformed into a little girl after praying to Poseidon and escapes. Erysichthon eventually falls to his endless hunger and devours himself. *Orpheus and Eurydice  The story of Orpheus, the god of music, and Eurydice is told from two points of view., the first is from the point of view of Orpheus in the style of Ovid from 8 AD, who has just married his bride Eurydice. Bitten by a snake on their wedding day, Eurydice dies. Distraught, Orpheus travels to the Underworld to negotiate with Hades and the gods to free Eurydice. After Orpheus sings a depressing song, Hades, the god of the Underworld, agrees to let Eurydice return with Orpheus as long as Eurydice follows Orpheus from behind, and he does not look back at her. If he does, she must stay in the Underworld. Orpheus agrees but, when almost back to the living world, he looks back, as he could not hear Eurydice, causing Hermes to return her to Hades. The action is repeated several times, resembling the memory that Orpheus will have forever of losing his bride. The second time is told from the point of view of Eurydice, in the style of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke from 1908. After an eternity of this repeated action, Eurydice becomes forgetful and fragile, no longer remembering Orpheus. She returns to the Underworld ignorant of Orpheus, the man she loved so long ago. *Narcissus Interlude  A brief scene showing Narcissus catching a glimpse of his own reflection in a pool. Enthralled, he becomes frozen. The actors replace him with a narcissus plant. *Pomona and Vertumnus  A female wood nymph, Pomona, becomes involved with the shy Vertumnus. Pomona has refused the hands of many suitors and remains alone. Vertumnus, in order to see her, disguises himself in a variety of gimmicks. Trying to convince Pomona to fall in love with him, he refuses to show himself. After telling the story of Myrrha, Pomona tells Vertumnus to take off his ridiculous disguise, and the two fall in love. *Myrrha  Vertumnus tells the story of King Cinyras and his daughter Myrrha. After denying Aphrodite's attempts many times to turn her head in love, Myrrha is cursed by Aphrodite with a lust for her father. Myrrha tries to control her urges, but eventually falls to temptation. With the help of her Nursemaid, Myrrha has three sexual encounters with her father, each time keeping him inebriated and blind so he would not know it's her. The third time Cinyras takes off his blindfold and tries to strangle Myrrha, who escapes and is never seen again. *Phaeton  Phaeton narrates his relationship with his father, Apollo (the sun god), to the Therapist. With the Therapist adding her psychoanalytical points, Phaeton tells the audience of a distanced relationship with his father. After bullying at school, Phaeton goes on a journey to meet his father, who drives the sun across the sky every day. Racked with guilt from neglect of his son, Apollo allows Phaeton to \\"drive\\" the sun across the sky as compensation for his years of absence. Phaeton, who constantly whines, drives the sun too close to the earth and scorches it. The Therapist closes the scene in a monologue about the difference between myth and dream. *Eros and Psyche  \\"Q\\" and \\"A\\" essentially narrate a scene about Psyche falling in love with Eros. Psyche and Eros remain silent during the whole interlude, but act out what Q and A discuss. Eros and Psyche fall in love, as Q and A tell the audience that they might wander in the darkness of loneliness until they blind themselves to personal romantic desires and give in to a deeper love. Psyche becomes a goddess and lives with Eros forever. *Baucis and Philemon  The final story tells of Zeus and Hermes disguising themselves as beggars on earth to see which people are following the laws of Xenia. After being shunned by every house in the city, they are accepted into the house of Baucis and Philemon, a poor married couple. The couple feed the gods with a great feast, not knowing the identity of the strangers, except that they are \\"children of God\\". After the feast, the gods reveal themselves and grant the two a wish. Baucis and Philemon ask to die at the same time to save each other the grief of death. The gods transform their house into a grand palace and the couple into a pair of trees with branches intertwined. At the end of the scene, Midas returns to the stage, finds the pool, washes, and is restored. His daughter enters, restored from being fixed as a gold piece, and the play ends with a redeemed Midas embracing his daughter. The stories as they are told in the classic Ovid tales: ;Characters *Creation *King Midas *Alcyone and Ceyx *Erysichthon *Orpheus and Eurydice *Pomona and Vertumnus *Myrrha *Phaeton *Apollo *Eros and Psyche *Baucis and Philemon Plot analysis David Rush notes that in this case, the plot is the playwright's deliberate selection and arrangement of the incidents and actions. When Metamorphoses is not a conventional arrangement and has a non-linear point of view. A linear dramatic action may be set as with the following steps: #A state of equilibrium #An inciting incident #Point of attack of the major dramatic question #Rising action #Climax #Resolution #New state of equilibrium. These set of events are described as being of a well-made play and follow a linear set of actions. First one event, then the next and the following one after that and so on and so forth. Metamorphoses does not follow this laid out set of steps and no single analysis can make it follow this formula. However each of the separate stories embedded within the play is in itself a \\"well-made play\\" within a play. Each story can be easily followed and analyzed through a look at the seven parts already established. An example that can easily demonstrate and lay out the structure is the story of Erysichthon described within Metamorphoses. The seven elements of this story can be seen as follows: * State of Equilibrium  Erysichthon has no regard for the gods and does as he wishes with no fear of punishment * Inciting Incident  Erysichthon tears down a tree that is beloved by the god, Ceres * Point of Attack of the MDQ (Major Dramatic Question)  Will Ceres avenge her beloved tree and teach a valuable lesson about the power of the gods to Erysichthon? * Rising Action  Ceres sends a servant to look for Hunger, Ceres' servant finds Hunger, Hunger embodies itself into Erysichthon, Erysichthon gorges on food * Climax  Erysichthon's hunger is so insatiable that he sells his own mother to a trader for money to buy more food * Resolution  Finally, Erysichthon can no longer find any more food to eat and curb his hunger so Ceres approaches him with a tray that holds a fork and a knife, Erysichthon sits down and actually destroys himself * New State of Equilibrium  Erysichthon is no more and people are no longer left to wonder or question the power of the gods Each of the stories told within Metamorphoses can be analyzed in this fashion and it is even worth noting the story of King Midas. His dramatic action can be followed over the entire length of the play for we are introduced to his story in the beginning and are not subjected to the resolution of his story until the end of the play and his story is actually the last one addressed in the play.

Character analysis Because of the mythic quality of the script, sometimes the players in the performance often resemble \\"archetypes instead of characters.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Dreams of Metamorphoses Echo in a Larger Space\\", New York Times 5 Mar. 2002: Sec. E. Miriam Chirico describes the work as \\"enacting myth does not require creating a plausible character, but rather an emblematic figure who demonstrates a particular, identifiable human trait.\\" The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is told twice, each to emphasize their individual stories and act like mirrors with reflecting stories of love and loss; the first being from Orpheus' point of view from Ovid's tale from 8 A.D., then Eurydice's tale in 1908 inspired by German poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Orpheus is an archetype for strong human emotion and expressing it through poetry and music. Music is related to Orpheus' ability to move only forward in time, along with his feelings and mortal love. Although they can repeat, as they do in the scene several times, they cannot turn back completely and be the same. Zimmerman includes with the line, \\"Is this a story about how time can only move in one direction?\\" to bring light to Orpheus' struggle. Phaeton narrates his own story (not the case with most of the other stories). With the Therapist bringing a glimpse of Freudian psychoanalysis, Phaeton's relationship with his father can be seen in new ways: \\"the father is being asked to perform an initiation rite, to introduce his son to society, [and] to inscribe him in a symbolic order.\\" Because Midas frames the story at the beginning and returns at the end as a redeemed man, the play ends with a sense of optimism due to his transformation. The character Eros, although he attains many of the traits of the more popularized Cupid, is meant to symbolize more. In the play, \\"A\\", Psyche, interprets why \\"Q\\", Eros, is presented as naked, winged, and blindfolded: he is naked to make our feelings transparent, he is winged so he might fly from person to person, and he is blindfolded to encourage us to see into each other's hearts. A, a narrator of the Eros and Psyche scene, says, \\"He is blind to show how he takes away our ordinary vision, our mistaken vision, that depends on the appearance of things.\\" Genre Since the Metamorphoses is derived from literary texts, productions of Zimmerman's may be classified in the genre of Readers Theater. According to Miriam Chirico, Readers Theater presents a narrative text to an audience, for instance a poem rather than action that follows a typical play script. Readers Theater generally follows the \\"presentational\\" form of theater, rather than representational, often relying on narrators to bring insight from an outside perspective to a character. The presentational aspect creates a direct link between the audience and the narrator. Readers Theater reduces theatrical devices, such as costumes, sets, and props, to concentrate on the story and the language. Metamorphoses follows these methods by using multiple narrators, who both tell and comment on the story, and language that is strongly rooted in the David R. Slavitt translation of Ovid. Compared to classic genres, Metamorphoses is a hybrid containing elements of various genres, including comedy, classic tragedy, and drama, but not necessarily limited to any of them. The play borrows aspects from opera, as it uses visual and aural illusions, and achieves them in simple ways. Joseph Farrell praised Zimmerman for capturing the seriocomic elements of Ovid's tales better than in most adaptations. Style Based on myths thousands of years old, Zimmerman's Metamophoses demonstrates their relevance and emotional truths. The play suggests that human beings haven't changed to the point of being unrecognizable nearly two thousand years later. Zimmerman has said, \\"These myths have a redemptive power in that they are so ancient. There's a comfort in the familiarity of the human condition.\\" Zimmerman generally presents an objective point of view. An example is the Alcyone and Ceyx passage, when the audience learns of Ceyx's death long before Alcyone does. In terms of motifs, Metamorphoses is more subjective, especially related to the theme of death and love. The play promotes suggesting death as a transformation of form rather than death as an absence, which is more typical in popular Western culture. A non-naturalistic play, Metamorphoses is presented as mythic rather than realistic. The use of myths essentially \\"lifts the individuals out of ordinary time and the present moment, and places him in \\"mythic time\\"‚Äîan ambiguous term for the timeless quality myths manifest.\\" The setting of the play isn't limited to just one specific location. For example, the pool on stage transforms from \\"the luxurious swimming pool of nouveau riche Midas, the ocean in which Ceyx drowns, the food devoured by Erysichthon, Narcissus' mirror, a basin to hold Myrrha's tears, [and] the river Styx\\" and that the pool, like the stories transcend realistic thinking and are \\"suspended in space and time.\\"Whitworth, Julia E. Rev. of Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman. Theatre Journal Vol. 54 Is. 4 (Dec. 2002): 635. The plot is constructed as a series of vignettes, framed overall by a few narrative devices. The opening scene essentially shows the creation of the world, or Cosmogony, not only sets up the world that the following characters will live in, but the world itself. In terms of a beginning and end within the stories themselves, King Midas frames them with his story of greed at the beginning and his redemption at the last moments of the play. After being introduced as a horribly selfish man, the other stories of the play get told and mask the lack of resolution within the Midas story. Finally at the end, Midas who is \\"by this time long forgotten and in any case unexpectedreappears, newly from his quest\\" with his restored daughter, and \\"on this note of love rewarded and love redeemed, the play comes to an end.\\". Through all the vignettes that are portrayed, the audience is meant to leave not with the story of a few individuals, but rather to know the power of human transformation in all forms. Metamorphoses uses a combination of presentational and representational forms, including the Vertumnus and Pomona scene, which is both acted out and tells the story of Myrrha. Representation is used as a rendition of a story. For the most part, the play follows a linear technique by having the sequence of events in each individual story follow a rational chronological timeline. The Orpheus scene strays from this, by repeating a portion of the same scene numerous times to emphasize the torment of his loss. Zimmerman intended the play to build on a foundation of images. In a New York Times interview, Zimmerman said, \\"You're building an image, and the image starts to feed you.\\" She said, \\"When I approach a text, I don't do a lot of historical reading. It's an artificial world and I treat it as an artificial world.\\"Marks, Peter. \\"Building Her Plays Image by Image,\\" New York Times 9 March 2002, late ed.: B7. Miriam Chirico has described Zimmerman's plays as \\"theater of images\\" and compared to the style of the director Robert Wilson, Pina Bausch, and Julie Taymor. Zimmerman uses the play as a \\"poetic bridge between myth and modernism\\" by creating a hybrid of ancient Greek and modern American cultures. Metamorphoses expresses general concepts and emotions, rather than focusing on individual characters. Theme/Idea The central idea of Metamorphoses is the concept of change. To \\"metamorphose\\" means the striking change in appearance or character of something.Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. Metamorphose. Merriam-Webster, Inc. Each story contains at least one example. The theme of change is expressed by the play's use of water. The set includes centrally placed pool, into which characters move and leave as they are transformed. The water is used for different functions throughout Metamorphoses, and it is described as \\"the most protean (lit: diverse or varied) of elements\\" In transforming her early version of Metamorphoses, Six Myths, into its final form, Zimmerman's most significant change was the addition of the central pool. According to David Ostling, Zimmerman's scenic designer, \\"She was looking for the changing ability of water, the instantaneous nature of it, how it could go from still to violent and back to calm.\\"Eddy, Michael S. \\"Metamorphosing Metamorphoses: scenic designer Daniel Ostling discusses moving Mary Zimmerman's meditation on Ovid from coast to coast,\\" Entertainment Design 36.4 (April 2002): 28(4). Zimmerman's play also examines the causes of change in persons. What can make a person become something completely different? The most frequent cause throughout Metamorphoses is love. At the same time, Metamorphoses warns of what happens when love is ignored. When Erysichthon cuts down a sacred tree, showing that he loves only himself, he is transformed into a man consumed by hunger, eventually eating himself. When the beautiful Myrrha scorns the love of her suitors, the goddess Aphrodite curses her to love her father. Discovered, she flees to the wilderness, where the gods transform her into tears. Zimmerman has said that \\"[Metamorphoses] makes it easy to enter the heart and to believe in greater change as well... that we all can transform.\\" Spectacle The primary feature of the set in Metamorphoses is the pool, which generally sits center stage and occupies most of the stage. The pool is central to all of the stories, although its function changes. During the production, for instance, it becomes a swimming pool, a washing basin, the River Styx of the Underworld, and the sea. The stage set consists of a platform bordering the pool, a chandelier hanging above, a large depiction of the sky upstage and right of the pool, and a set of double doors, upstage left of the pool. The stage has been described as \\"reminiscent of paintings by Magritte and the dream states they evoke.\\" The costumes of the play are described as \\"evocative of a generalized antiquity but one in which such things as suspenders and trousers are not unknown.\\" Actors wear costumes that range from classic Grecian togas to modern bathing suits, sometimes in the same scene. This juxtaposition of old and new is particularly striking in the story of Midas, in which he is shown wearing a \\"smoking jacket\\" and confronted by a drunken reveler in a half-toga with vine leaves in his hair. Language The language in Metamorphoses sets up the mythic, yet comprehensible world, to be portrayed on stage. Philip Fisher describes the myths as \\"poetic\\" and says that Zimmerman \\"has a great vision and her sense of humor intrudes on a regular basis, often with clever visual or aural touches.\\"Fisher, Philip. The British Theatre Guide. 2003. The comedy elements present contemporary connections for the audience to the mythic stories. When an audience hears a clever interjection by Zimmerman, they can easily take in the experience of a well-written play. Zimmerman's rhythm in the play establishes quick scenes and down-to-the point dialogue, making it easy to follow. She does not leave much silence or pauses. This upbeat rhythm shows up within separate lines as well. For example, \\"HERMES: The god of speed and distant messages, a golden crown above his shining eyes, his slender staff held out in front of him, and little wings fluttering at his ankles: and on his left arm, barely touching it: she.\\" A device known as \\"dissonance\\" is strongly used in this particular line. Dissonance is a subtle sense of disharmony, tension, or imbalance within the words chosen in the play. Dissonance uses short, stressed sounds, as in this example; the playwright uses them to emphasize the up-tempo rhythm throughout the play. Music Willy Schwarz composed the music, for which he was awarded the 2002 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music in a Play. Schwarz also collaborated with Zimmerman in her plays The Odyssey and Journey to the West.Willy Schwarz website, 29 November 2008. His music often signifies a change in scene or accompanies specific moments, often one or more of poetic speech. Finger cymbals are used in the story of Midas, to indicate his footsteps after he has the power of transforming all he touches to gold. During the story of Phaeton, Apollo sings the aria \\"Un Aura Amorosa\\" from Cos√≠ Fan Tutte by Mozart . Production history (Times and dates retrieved from the beginning of the script.) *World premiere production: Lookingglass Theatre Co., Chicago. It opened on October 25, 1998 at the Ivanhoe Theater. *Second Stage Theatre production: The play's off Broadway debut was on October 9, 2001 in New York City. This production was in rehearsal during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Towers. With the towers still smoldering downtown and many people suffering losses, the production inspired considerable emotional response from the audiences. *Broadway production: The debut was on March 4, 2002 at the Circle in the Square theater in New York City. Unlike previous productions, the Circle in the Square Theater uses a 3/4 thrust stage, meaning that the audience is on three sides of the playing area. It is related to similar structures of the Greek and Roman amphitheaters. The audience was aware of members on the other sides of the stage, \\"appropriate for a show that stresses the value of shared cultural myths and the emotions they summon.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Dreams of Metamorphoses Echo in a Larger Space,\\" New York Times 5 March 2002: E1. Although the play kept many of the Off-Broadway aspects of the show, it subdued the incest scene between Myrrha and King Cinyras for the Broadway production. The Off Broadway scene had the pair \\"writhing and splashing\\" enthusiastically in a much more intense and disturbing fashion; on Broadway they gently rolled in the water. Margo Jefferson commented that the performance style fell into an American jokiness form; its youthful charm and a high energy was a way to deflect and delay an emotionally heavy scene, but this had more resonance.Jefferson, Margo. \\"Myth, Magic, and Us Mortals,\\" New York Times 26 May 2002: A1.

She is a full professor of performance studies at Northwestern.Northwestern University School of Communication. 2008. Northwestern University. 29 November 2008. Beyond her childhood fascination with Greek myths, Zimmerman credits the Jungian scholar James Hillman as the source of many of her ideas involving love, such as that in the story of Eros and Psyche. She also acknowledges the influence of Joseph Campbell, a scholar of mythology, in her work. Zimmerman won the MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Fellowship in 1998 in recognition of her creative work. Her plays include Journey to the West, The Odyssey, The Arabian Nights, The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, and Eleven Rooms of Proust. She also co-wrote and directed Galileo Galilei. She has twice directed for the New York Shakespeare Festival in the Park.

Neaves was known as one of the early analysts of the history of evolution, and is often quoted regarding the subjects of evolution and women's rights. Life Neaves was born in Edinburgh in 1800, the son of Charles Neaves (1777-1868), a Forfar solicitor and clerk of the Justiciary Court in Edinburgh, and his first wife. His father later married Mary Anne Wilson (1792-1887), sister of John and James Wilson.Grave of Mary Ann Neaves, Dean Cemetery Neaves was educated at the High School and Edinburgh University. He became a member of the Faculty of Advocates at age 22. He married Eliza Macdonald in 1835. They lived (c. 1833) in a large Georgian townhouse at 47 Queen Street in Edinburgh's New Town. They moved in 1845 to the more prestigious address of 7 Charlotte Square. Edinburgh Post Office directories, 1845-1878 From 1841 to 1845, he was Advocate Depute, and from 1845 to 1852 Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland. He became Solicitor General for Scotland in 1853, being succeeded by Robert Handyside, Lord Handyside. He served as a judge of the Court of Session from 1853 to 1858. From 1858 to his death, he was Lord of Justiciary, Scotland's supreme criminal court. Neaves lived the majority of his life in Edinburgh, but when associated with the Justiciary Court, he travelled to Glasgow thrice yearly and Lord Neaves (although elderly and almost without hearing capability by the 1875) acquired a reputation in Glasgow as a man of justice and evenness.Mitchell Library, Glasgow, Scotland, Accession 4BAI Charles Neaves had acknowledged skills as a composer of verse. He was vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1859‚Äì67, 1868‚Äì73 and 1874‚Äì76), and a president of the Heriot-Watt Institution. From 1872 to 1874, he held the post of Rector at the University of St Andrews, the oldest university in Scotland. The Rector chairs meetings of the University Court, the governing body of the University of St Andrews. Neaves was a regular author of poetry and essays to Blackwood's Magazine, only a fraction of his work having been republished.British Authors of the 19th Century (1936) He is buried in the family plot in Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh with his second wife, Elisabeth MacDonald (1811-1888). His first wife, Mary Anne, is buried in a south section of Dean Cemetery. Evolutionary analyst As a judge of the Court of Session, Neaves was familiar with one of his predecessors, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, to whom he credited the origination of the concepts of the theory of evolution.Watt, Archibald, A Goodly Heritage, Halcon Printing Ltd., Stonehaven, UK (1985) In 1875, Neaves published a poem within a book of verse\\"The Memory of Monboddo: An Excellent New Song,\\" Blackwood's Magazine 90 (Sept. 1861): 363‚Äì64Neaves, Charles, Lord Neaves, Songs and Verses, Fourth Edition, London p5 (1875) to establish this point: In another instance he elaborates on Monboddo's writings again in Blackwood's Magazine, indicating the clarity with which Monboddo foresaw evolutionary theory: Poet and critic Not only did Neaves produce poetry but he was a prolific critic, often in venues such as Blackwood's Magazine. One of his thematic elements was virtue, which naturally tied to his theological roots. He also conducted critiques of others' poetry based upon how their attitudes deviated from virtue and a common theme of under- recognition of women, as in the scalding criticism of the poet Thomas Carew.Charles Neaves, \\"Carew and Herrick,\\" in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. XLV, No. CCLXXXIV, June 1839, pp. 782‚Äì94. Reprinted in Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800, Vol. 13 Quotations In Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (Quote number 6171),Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 1855 as published originally in Darwin's The Origin of Species, he quipped on the subject of evolution: This quote became so famous in that early era that the authorship of the quotation became a matter of public dispute. Although Bartlett and Darwin clearly attributed the quotation to Neaves, Zachary Macaulay argued that he had made this statement three years earlier. Lord Neaves may have also been an early thinker on the issue of women's rights with the following quote, that would have bordered on heresy in his era: See also *History of evolution  References External links Bannatyne Club papers with register of selected papers relating to Neaves and contemporaries *Reference to marriage contract with Eliza MacDonald 1800 births 1876 deaths 19th-century Scottish people People from Edinburgh People educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Members of the Faculty of Advocates People associated with Heriot-Watt University Rectors of the University of St Andrews Scottish essayists Neaves Scottish poets Solicitors General for Scotland Scottish sheriffs 19th-century poets 19th-century essayists Burials at Warriston Cemetery ","title":"Charles Neaves, Lord Neaves"},{"id":"5778565","text":"Viejas Casino and Resort is a hotel casino and outlet center owned by the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, located in Alpine, California. The casino has over 2,000 slot machines, up to 86 table games, three restaurants, a deli, bingo, an off-track betting facility, lounge, concert venues and multiple indoor and outdoor meeting spaces. Opened in March 2013, the original hotel had 128 rooms; an expansion was completed in October 2015 with the opening of an additional hotel tower with 109 deluxe rooms and luxury suites increasing hotel accommodations to a total of 237 rooms and suites.  History  In 1932, The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians purchased the reservation with their share of proceeds from a forced eviction from the area now containing El Capitan Reservoir. The Viejas tribe is one of seven California tribes that signed a modified compact with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger granting unlimited slot machines in return for higher payments to the state. In 1977, the Viejas Bingo Room opened in the Ma Tar Awa RV Park on the Viejas reservation. The Viejas Casino opened its doors on September 13, 1991. The bingo room was moved inside the casino from the RV resort in 1994. Six years later, a new bingo room was built east of the casino. In 2006, a $19 million project to remodel the casino was completed. In 2007, the Viejas tribe announced an $800 million expansion project including a second casino, hotel, and parking garage. That expansion project was never completed, but as of November 17, 2015, the Viejas Casino and Resort has a newly renovated non- smoking casino area, a 5-story parking garage, and an expanded section of the hotel which was officially opened on October 30, 2015. A poker room was added in early 2016 but was later removed. The addition of a new hotel is expected to be completed by the January 2018. The new hotel tower will be adults only (21+) and have 159 suites. A spa and saltwater pool will also be included.  Hotel  On August 31, 2011, the Viejas tribe announced plans to add a 150-room luxury hotel to the casino. Plans were scaled back slightly resulting in a 5-story hotel with 128 rooms consisting of 99 deluxe rooms and 29 luxury suites. The $36 million project broke ground in early 2012 and the building was topped out in November 2012. Hotel construction was completed in March 2013 with the grand opening celebration held on March 21, 2013. Viejas describes the hotel as \\"modern amenities, streamlined design and handcrafted, boutique feel\\". The original hotel includes a business center, fitness center, and resort style pool with VIP cabanas. As part of the original hotel construction project both east and west entrances to the casino were remodeled and valet parking was moved from the east entrance to the west entrance. Additional valet parking was made available at the hotel entrance when the hotel opened. Bingo was moved into a new 340-seat bingo hall inside the casino and the former bingo hall was razed to make room for the hotel. The east entrance was enlarged and extended to connect the hotel to the casino and the buffet was remodeled and expanded. The buffet is the only restaurant that allows children and persons under the age of 21. Those under 21 are not permitted anywhere else in the casino. With the hotel opening, Viejas was renamed from Viejas Casino to Viejas Casino & Resort. Since its opening in 2013, Viejas Casino & Resort has received the AAA Four Diamond Award consecutively each year. In February 2013 a Tribal Environmental Impact Report was filed for construction of a 6-story parking structure with capacity for up to 1,000 vehicles to be built on the north side of the casino. The parking garage would provide additional parking for both the casino and hotel. Construction was started in April 2013 and the parking structure opened on November 21, 2013. In 2014, the casino underwent a year-long development project to include a 15,000 square foot expansion of their gaming floor, an additional five-story hotel tower and renovated non-smoking casino areas. The extended casino floor allowed for the addition of another 1,000 slot machines, while the new hotel tower increased accommodations. This expansion created an additional 50,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor multifunction resort space, and increased hotel accommodations to a total of 237 rooms and suites. In 2016, Viejas Casino & Resort began another development project with the construction of a third hotel tower named the Willows Hotel & Spa. The newest addition is open to guests age 21 and older and has 159 suites, a saltwater pool, two new restaurants, outdoor dining and a day spa and salon.https://viejas.com/viejas-hotels/  Dining  Viejas Casino & Resort features several restaurants and eateries throughout the casino, hotel and outlets.

Also known as \\"waterman of India\\", he won the Magsaysay Award in 2001 and Stockholm Water Prize in 2015. He runs an NGO called 'Tarun Bharat Sangh' (TBS), which was founded in 1975. The NGO based in village hori-Bhikampura in Thanagazi tehsil, near Sariska Tiger Reserve, has been instrumental in fighting the slow bureaucracy, mining lobby and has helped villagers take charge of water management in their semi-arid area as it lies close to Thar Desert, through the use of johad, rainwater storage tanks, check dams and other time-tested as well as path-breaking techniques. Starting from a single village in 1985, over the years TBS helped build over 8,600 johads and other water conservation structures to collect rainwater for the dry seasons, has brought water back to over 1,000 villages and revived five rivers in Rajasthan, Arvari, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahajwali. He is one of the members of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) which was set up in 2009, by the Government of India as an empowered planning, financing, monitoring and coordinating authority for the Ganges (Ganga), in exercise of the powers conferred under the Environment (Protection) Act,1986.p.2. Composition of the Authority: Ministry of Environment. In the UK he is a founder member of an NGO called the Flow Partnership which aims to counter the negative effects of soil erosion and flooding. Early life and education Rajendra Singh was born at village Daula in Bagpat district in Uttar Pradesh near Meerut. He was the eldest of seven siblings. His father was an agriculturist and looked over their 60 acres of land in the village and where Singh did his early schooling. An important event in his life came in 1974, when still in high school, Ramesh Sharma, a member of Gandhi Peace Foundation visited their family home in Meerut, this opened up young Rajendra's mind, to issues of village improvement, as Sharma went about cleaning the village, opened a vachnalaya (library) and even got involved in settling local conflicts; soon he involved Rajendra in an alcoholism eradication program. Another important influence was an English language teacher in school, Pratap Singh, who started discussing politics and social issues with his students after class. At this time Emergency was imposed in 1975, making him aware about the issues of democracy and formulate independent views. After finishing high school education. He enrolled for post graduation in Hindi literature, at another college in Baraut, affiliated with Allahabad University. He became the leader of a local chapter of Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Vahini, a student activism organisation founded by Jaiprakash Narayan (Magsaysay Award, 1965), though after Jaiprakash fell ill, the internal power politics disillusioned him. Dr. Singh is a BAMS doctor by education. Career of Dr. Rajendra Singh Rana After completing his studies, he joined government service in 1980, and started his career as a National Service Volunteer for education in Jaipur, from where he was appointed to oversee adult education schools in Dausa district in Rajasthan. Meanwhile, he joined Tarun Bharat Sangha (Young India Association) or TBS, an organization formed by officer and students of Jaipur University to aid victims of a campus fire. Subsequently, after three years when he became General Secretary of the organisation, he questioned the organisation, which had been dabbling with various issues, for its inadequacy in having a substantial impact. Finally in 1984 the entire board resigned leaving the organization to him. One of the first tasks he took up was working with a group of nomad blacksmiths, who though traveled from village to village had little support from anyone. This exposure inspired him to work closely with people. However back at work, he was feeling increasingly frustrated by the apathy of his superiors towards developmental issues and his own inability to have a larger impact, he left his job in 1984. He sold all his household goods for Rs 23,000 and took a bus ticket for the last stop, on boarded bus going into interior of Rajasthan, along with him were four friends from Tarun Bharat Sangha. The last stop turned out to be Kishori village in Thanagazi tehsil in Alwar district, and the day was 2 October 1985. After initial skepticism, the villagers of neighboring village Bhikampura accepted him, and here they found a place to stay. Soon, he started a small Ayurvedic medicine practice in nearby village Gopalpura, while his colleagues went out about promoting education in the villages. Rajendra Singh educating the students of Teri University, New Delhi about his projects at Alwar, Rajasthan. Alwar district, which once had a grain market, was at the time largely dry and barren, as years of deforestation and mining had led to a dwindling water table, minimal rainfall followed by floods. Another reason was the slow abandoning of traditional water conservation techniques, like building check dams, or johad, instead villagers started relying on \\"modern\\" bore wells, which simply sucked the groundwater up. But consistent use meant that these bored wells had to be dug deeper and deeper within a few years, pushing underground water table further down each time, till they went dry in ecologically fragile Aravalis. At this point he met a village elder, Mangu Lal Meena, who argued \\"water was a bigger issue to address in rural Rajasthan than education\\". He chided him to work with his hands rather than behaving like \\"educated\\" city folks who came, studied and then went back; later encouraged him to work on a johad, earthen check dams, which have been traditionally used to store rainwater and recharge groundwater, a technique which had been abandoned in previous decades. As a result, the area had no ground water since previous five years and was officially declared a \\"dark zone\\". Though Rajendra wanted to learn the traditional techniques from local farmers about water conservation, his other city friends were reluctant to work manually and parted ways. Eventually with the help of a few local youths he started desilting the Gopalpura johad, lying neglected after years of disuse. When the monsoon arrived that year, the johad filled up and soon wells which had been dry for years had water. Villagers pitched in and in the next three years, it made it 15 feet deep. These facilitated a rise in the groundwater levels and helped turn the area into a \\"white zone\\". So much so that the Forest Department invited the NGO to take an active part in the park's management. Tarun Ashram in Kishori-Bhikampura in Thanagazi tehsil bordering the Sariska sanctuary, became the headquarters of Tarun Bharat Sangha. He started on his first padayatra (walkathon) through the villages of the area in 1986, educating to rebuild villages' old check dams. Yet their bigger success was yet to come, as inspired by the walkathon and success at Gopalpura, 20 km away, in 1986, people of Bhanota-Kolyala village with through shramdaan (voluntary labour) and with the help of TBS volunteers, constructed a johad at the source of a dried Arvari River, following this villages that lay in its catchment area, and along it also built tiny earthen dams, with largest being a 244-meter-long and 7-meter-high concrete dam in the Aravalli hills; eventually when the number of dams reached 375, the river started to flow again in 1990, after remaining dry for over 60 years. Yet the battle was far from over, even after constructing johads, the water level in the ponds and lakes around Sariska didn't go up as expected, that it went they discovered that missing water got evaporated from mining pits left unfilled by the miners after their operations in the area. A legal battle ensued, they filed public interest petition in the Supreme Court, which in 1991 banned mining in the Aravallis. Then in May 1992, Ministry of Environment and Forests notification banned mining in the Aravalli hill system all together, and 470 mines operating within the Sariska sanctuary buffer area and periphery were closed. Gradually TBS built 115 earthen and concrete structures within the sanctuary and 600 other structures in the buffer and peripheral zones. The efforts soon paid off, by 1995 Aravri became a perennial river. The river was awarded the \`International River Prize', and in March 2000, then President, K. R. Narayanan visited the area to present the \\"Down to Earth ‚Äî Joseph. C. John Award\\" to the villagers. In the coming years, rivers like Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahajwali were revived after remaining dry for decades. Abandoned villages in the areas got populated and farming activities could be resumed once again, in hundreds of drought-prone villages in neighbouring districts of Jaipur, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Bharatpur and Karauli, where work of TBS gradually spread. By 2001, TBS had spread over an area of 6,500 km2, also including parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. It had built 4,500 earthen check dams, or johads, to collect rainwater in 850 villages in 11 districts of Rajasthan, and he was awarded the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership in the same year. Reforestation has been taken up by numerous village communities, and Gram sabha have been set up especially to look after community resources. A notable example is the Bhairondev Lok Vanyajeev Abhyaranya (people's sanctuary), spread over 12 km2 near Bhanota- Kolyala village at the head of Arvari. He has also been organizing Pani Pachayat or Water Parliament in distant villages in Rajasthan to make people aware of the traditional water conservation wisdom, the urgency of groundwater recharge for maintaining underground aquifers and advocating community control over natural resources. In 2005, he was awarded the Jamnalal Bajaj Award. He also played a pivotal role in stopping the controversial Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project over river Bhagirathi, the headstream of the Ganges River in 2006, even as G. D. Agrawal, environmentalist from IIT Kanpur went on a hunger strike. In 2009, he led a pada yatra (walkathon), a march of a group of environmentalists and NGOs, through Mumbai city along the endangered Mithi river. On Jan 2014, he did a parikrama along the banks of Godavari river, from Trimbakeshwar to Paithan to urge people to make the river pollution free. Recently he gave lecture on water and its conservation and values of water at Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Mumbai. The struggle for the life and devoted water conservation efforts of Rajendra Singh is being produced by the film producer and director Ravindra Chauhan under the name of the documentary Jal Purush Ki Kahani.

They originally played hardcore punk in the vein of bands such as Black Flag and The Circle Jerks. In 1998 they added second guitarist Lars Swenson and began cultivating a dirtier '70s glam-rock sound, as heard on their eMpTy Records releases. The records sold fairly well and gained them the attention of larger labels such as DreamWorks and Sub Pop, the latter of whom signed the band to a recording contract in 1999. Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4-piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song \\"Nothing\\", from their album Static Delusions and Stone-Still Days (Sub Pop, 2002). After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album Howling...It Grows and Grows!!! (Sub Pop, 2004), which infused their earlier sound with elements of classic rock. The Catheters played their final show on October 15, 2004 at Seattle's Sunset Tavern, joined by friends the Vells and blackbelt (who played some old-school Catheters covers), ending the show with a mass sing-along to their song '\\"Fake ID\\" which degenerated into instrument destruction and a minor brawl. The band dissolved amicably, with Brian Standeford and Davey Borozowski forming the group Tall Birds (later joined by Leo Gebhardt), while Derek Mason went on to play keyboards in the Girls and bass in Sunday Night Blackout. After Tall Birds disbanded, Standeford started Idle Times, while Borozowski went on to form the band Black Whales. Borozowski also tours with the popular indy rock band Modest Mouse as their percussionist/second drummer, alongside Jeremiah Green. Idle times has released two seven-inches, and Black Whales have an EP on Mt Fuji Records and a self-released full-length album. Mason's band the Girls are on Dirtnap Records.

Rock art by Indigenous Australians from the Upper Yule River, Pilbara, Western Australia. Re-drawn after Culture and menstruation is about cultural aspects surrounding how society views menstruation. A menstrual taboo is any social taboo concerned with menstruation. In some societies it involves menstruation being perceived as unclean or embarrassing, inhibiting even the mention of menstruation whether in public (in the media and advertising) or in private (among friends, in the household, or with men). Many traditional religions consider menstruation ritually unclean, although anthropologists point out that the concepts 'sacred' and 'unclean' may be intimately connected.Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l‚Äôinceste et ses origines. L‚ÄôAnn√©e Sociologique 1: 1-70. Reprinted as Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart. Different cultures view menstruation in different ways. The basis of many conduct norms and communication about menstruation in western industrial societies is the belief that menstruation should remain hidden.Laws, S. (1990). Issues of Blood: The Politics of Menstruation. London: Macmillan. By contrast, in many hunter-gatherer societies, particularly in Africa, menstrual observances are viewed in a positive light, without any connotation of uncleanness.Turnbull, C. M. 1960. The Elima: a premarital festival among the Bambuti Pygmies. Za√Øre 14: 175-92. Mythology The word \\"menstruation\\" is etymologically related to \\"moon\\". The terms \\"menstruation\\" and \\"menses\\" are derived from the Latin mensis (month), which in turn relates to the Greek mene (moon) and to the roots of the English words month and moon. According to the anthropologists Buckley and Gottlieb, cross-cultural study shows that, while taboos about menstruation are nearly universal, and while many of these involve notions of uncleanliness, numerous menstrual traditions \\"bespeak quite different, even opposite, purposes and meanings.\\"Buckley, T., and Gottlieb, A., eds. (1988). Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation. Berkeley: University of California Press. (p. 7) In some traditional societies, menstrual rituals are experienced by women as protective and empowering, offering women a space set apart from the male gaze and from unwanted sexual or domestic pressures and demands.Buckley, T. 1988. Menstruation and the power of Yurok women. In T. Buckley and A. Gottlieb (eds), Blood Magic. The anthropology of menstruation. Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 187-209. An instructive example is provided by the anthropologist Wynne Maggi, who describes the communal bashali (large menstrual house) of women in the Kalasha Valley (northwestern Pakistan) as their 'most holy place', respected by men, and serving as women's all-female organizing centre for establishing and maintaining gender solidarity and power.W. Maggi, 2001. Our Women are Free. Gender and Ethnicity in the Hindukush. Michigan: University of Michigan Press According to one body of cultural evolutionary scholarship, the idea that menstrual blood marks the body as periodically sacred was initially established by female coalitions in their own interests, although later, with the rise of cattle-ownership and patriarchal power, these same beliefs and taboos were harnessed by religious patriarchs to intensify women's oppression.Knight, C. 1995. Blood Relations: Menstruation and the origins of culture. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. Metaformic Theory, as proposed by cultural theorist Judy Grahn and others, places menstruation as a central organizing idea in the creation of culture and the formation of humans' earliest rituals. =Synchronisation with the moon= Menstruation in synchrony with the moon is widely assumed in myths and traditions as a ritual ideal. The idea that menstruation is‚Äîor ideally ought to be‚Äîin harmony with wider cosmic rhythms is one of the most tenacious ideas central to the myths and rituals of traditional communities across the world. One of the most thoroughgoing analyses of primitive mythology ever undertaken was that of the French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss, who concluded that, taken together, the indigenous myths of North and South America expressed men's worry that, unless women's periods were carefully monitored and synchronised, the universe might descend into chaos.L√©vi- Strauss, C. 1978. The Origin of Table Manners. Introduction to a Science of Mythology 3. London: Cape. In Aboriginal Australia, the supernatural being known as the 'Rainbow Snake' has been interpreted as, among other things, an indigenous way of conceptualising the ideal of synchronised tidal, lunar, menstrual and seasonal periodicities whose overall harmony (it is believed) confers spiritual power and fertility. To many, such cultural associations appear persuasive in view of the fact that in humans, the menstrual cycle quite closely approximates the moon's 29.5-day synodic cycle, unlike in chimpanzees (~36 days) or bonobos (~40 days).Martin, R.

Statistical information from hunter gatherers is lacking, but where large-scale western studies focus on women's peak reproductive years‚Äîremoving outlier values‚Äîthe cycle length gravitates around 29.1‚Äì29.5 days, while the figure for women in their thirties shortens toward 28 days. In no current human population has statistically significant lunar phase-locking been demonstrated. =Sacred and powerful= Yombe) fetish to regulate menstruation. In some historic cultures, a menstruating woman was considered sacred and powerful, with increased psychic abilities, and strong enough to heal the sick. According to the Cherokee, menstrual blood was a source of feminine strength and had the power to destroy enemies. In Ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder wrote that a menstruating woman who uncovers her body can scare away hailstorms, whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around the field, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the ears of corn. Menstrual blood is viewed as especially dangerous to men's power.Exploring Gypsiness: Power, Exchange and Interdependence in a Transylvanian, by Ada I. Engebrigtsen, p. 129. In Africa, menstrual blood is used in the most powerful magic charms in order to both purify and destroy.Iron, Gender, and Power: Rituals of Transformation in African Societies, by Eugenia W. Herbert, p. 226. Mayan mythology explains the origin of menstruation as a punishment for violating the social rules governing marital alliance. The menstrual blood turns into snakes and insects used in black sorcery, before the Maya moon goddess is reborn from it. Where women's blood is considered sacred, the belief is that it should be ritually set apart. According to this logic, it is when sacred blood comes into contact with profane things that it becomes experienced as ritually dangerous or 'unclean'.Durkheim, E. 1965 [1912]. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. New York: Free Press. Menstruating women have also been believed to be dangerous. Religious views The sociological theorist Emile Durkheim argued that human religion in its entirety emerged originally in connection with menstruation. His argument was that a certain kind of action ‚Äì collective ritual action ‚Äì could establish simultaneously totemism, law, exogamy and kinship in addition to distinctively human language and thought. Everything began, according to Durkheim, when a flow of blood periodically ruptured relations between the sexes. 'All blood is terrible', he observed,Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines. L'Ann√©e Sociologique 1: 1-70. Reprinted as Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart. 'and all sorts of taboos are instituted to prevent contact with it'. During menstruation, females would exercise a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. This same blood was thought to run through the veins of women and animals alike, suggesting the blood's ultimate origin in 'totemic'‚Äîpart- human, part-animal‚Äîancestral beings. Once menstrual blood had been linked with the blood of the hunt, it became logically possible for a hunter to respect certain animals as if they were his kin, this being the essence of 'totemism'. Within the group's shared blood resided its 'god' or 'totem', 'from which it follows that the blood is a divine thing. When it runs out, the god is spilling over'. =Judaism= In Judaism, a woman during menstruation is called \\"niddah\\" and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman.Leviticus 15:19-30, 18:19, 20:18 The ritual exclusion of \\"niddah\\" applies to a woman while menstruating and for about a week thereafter, until she immerses herself in a mikvah (ritual bath) which is basically intended only for married women. During this time, a married couple must avoid sexual intercourse and physical intimacy. Orthodox Judaism forbids women and men from even touching or passing things to each other during this period. While Orthodox Jews follow this exclusion, many Jews in other branches of the religion do not. In the Torah (Leviticus 15:19-30), a menstruating female is considered ritually unclean - \\"anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening\\" (New International Version). Touching a menstruating female, touching an object she had sat on or lain on, or having intercourse with her also makes a person ritually unclean. The extent to which these rules are observed in modern Judaism varies depending on the degree of conservatism/orthodoxy. =Christianity= Most Christian denominations do not follow any specific rituals or rules related to menstruation. Other denominations, such as those of Oriental Orthodox Christianity, follow the rules similar to those laid out in the Holiness Code section of Leviticus, somewhat similar to the Jewish ritual of Niddah. Pope Dionysius of Alexandria held with regard to menstruating women that \\"not even they themselves, being faithful and pious, would dare when in this state either to approach the Holy Table or to touch the body and blood of Christ.\\" As such, Oriental Orthodox Christian women, such as those belonging to the Coptic Orthodox Church, do not attend church while they are menstruating. Some Church Fathers defended the exclusion of women from ministry based on a notion of uncleanness. Others held that purity laws should be discarded as part of the Old Covenant.R. Hugh Connolly, Didascalia Apostolorum . Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1929. Retrieved on 18 July 2013. The 4th century text Apostolic Constitutions says: > For neither lawful mixture, nor child-bearing, nor the menstrual purgation, > nor nocturnal pollution, can defile the nature of a man, or separate the > Holy Spirit from him. Nothing but impiety and unlawful practice can do that. > (italics supplied) Some Christian denominations, including many authorities of the Eastern Orthodox Church and some parts of the Oriental Orthodox Church (also known as the Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, and Indian Orthodox Church), distinct from the Roman Catholic Church, advise women not to receive communion during their menstrual period, not because menstruation is considered to be sinful, but for more intense preparation to approach Christ. This is a fairly common practice throughout Greece and Russia and other historically Orthodox Christian countries, as well as by Orthodox Christians in countries where they are in the minority, including Egypt, India and Syria. =Islam= During menstrual periods, women are excused from performing prayers. Sets of rules are advised for women to follow while during menstruation. They should not fast and left over fasts of Ramadan are to be completed during other days. During menses pilgrimages are allowed; and circumambulation of the Kaaba is also permitted. They are permitted to enter the praying place of the mosque but are excused from prayer and are encouraged to be present at muslims gatherings and festivals (Eids). After the period, a bath (Ghusl), which is also required of both partners after sex, is also required before prayer may continue. The traditional Islamic interpretation of the Qur'an forbids intercourse, but not physical intimacy, during a woman's menstrual period. The Qur'an explicitly prohibits a menstruating woman from sexual intercourse. If a man is engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife and discovers that her period has started, he must immediately withdraw. On authority of Urwa: = Buddhism = In Buddhism (Theravada or Hinayana) menstruation is viewed as \\"a natural physical excretion that women have to go through on a monthly basis, nothing more or less\\". However, in certain branches of Japanese Buddhism, menstruating women are banned from attending temples. In Nichiren Buddhism (Japan) menstruation is not considered a spiritual obstacle to religious practice, although a menstruating woman may choose not to bow, for comfort.Toshie Kurihara (not dated) A History of Women in Japanese Buddhism: Nichiren‚Äôs Perspectives on the Enlightenment of Women =Hinduism= In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally advised rules to follow. Menstruation is seen as a period of purification, and women are often separated from place of worship or any object pertaining to it, for the length of their period. This forms the basis of most of the cultural practices and restrictions around menstruation in Hinduism. Hinduism's views on menstruation are diverse. The dharmashastra or Hindu law-books prohibit men from touching, seeing and having sexual relations with women during menstruation. It was believed that having sex with menstruating women would lead to the birth of evil-minded, villainous progeny. Menstruating women were directed to keep themselves confined to a room within the house in order to keep themselves out of vision of all other family members. They are also forbidden from cooking for the family & participating in religious activities during menstruation. After three days of menstruation, women had to take a special bath known as Ritusnana (‡§ã‡§§‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§®) after which they were considered pure again. Men were directed to have sex with women immediately after their Ritusnana in order to ensure pregnancy. The Puranas state that Indra, the King of the Devas had resorted to treachery in order to kill his enemy Vritrasura, and to free himself from the sin of treachery, he divided the sin among the womenfolk. Thus women bear the sin of treachery committed by Indra in the form of menstruation & in exchange, Indra granted them the ability to love for a man to their hearts' content. It is also stated that unlike men, women remain pure all the time (except when they are menstruating) and all the sins committed by a woman are cleansed away after she has undergone menstruation. On the days of Ambubachi, Hindus believe that Mother Earth herself undergoes menstruation and thus refrain from activities which involve digging into the earth. In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from Sabarimala Shrine as they were of the menstruating age. On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on the entry of women. It said that discrimination against women on any grounds, even religious, is unconstitutional.  Shaktism  Kamakhya Puja festival In Shaktism, which is a major sect of Hinduism, menstruation is celebrated during the Ambubachi Mela, an annual fertility festival held in June, in Assam, India. During Ambubachi (‡¶Ö‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ö‡ßÄ), the annual menstruation course of the goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the Kamakhya Temple. The temple stays closed for three days and then reopens to receive pilgrims and worshippers. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in India, attracting millions of visitors each year, particularly for Ambubachi Mela which draws upwards of 100,000 pilgrims per day during the 4-day festival. Before the temple is closed for Ambubachi, a white cloth is placed over the yoni (vulva) shaped stone in which the goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the temple. At the end of Ambubachi, when the temple is reopened and Ambubachi Mela is held, the assembled devotees are provided with fragments of that cloth, now reddened to signify menstrual blood. This cloth known as Raktobostro (‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) is considered especially holy by Hindus since it has been stained by the 'menstrual blood' of Kamakhya, the Mother of the Universe. =Sikhism= Guru NƒÅnak, the founder of Sikhism, condemned the practice of treating women as impure while menstruating. In Sikhism, the menstrual cycle is not considered a pollutant. Certainly, it can have a physical and physiological effect on the woman. Nonetheless, this is not considered a hindrance to her wanting to pray or accomplish her religious duties fully. The Guru makes it very clear that the menstrual cycle is a God- given process. The blood of a woman is required for the creation of any human being. Whether a person's clothes are blood stained or not (including clothes stained from menstrual blood) is not of spiritual importance. Thus, there are no restrictions placed on a woman during her menstruation. She is free to visit a Gurudwara, take part in prayers and do Seva. In The Feminine Principle in the Sikh vision of the transcendent, Nikky Guninder Kaur-Singh writes: : 'The denigration of the female body \\"expressed in many cultural and religious taboos surrounding menstruation and child-Birth\\" is absent in the Sikh worldview. ... Guru Nanak openly chides those who attribute pollution to women because of menstruation'.Kaur-Singh, Nikky-Guninder (1993). The Feminine Principle in the Sikh Vision of the Transcendent. Cambridge University Press . pp. 4. = Others =  Bah√° º√≠ Faith  Bah√°'u'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas abolished all forms of ritual impurity of people and things and stressed the importance of cleanliness and spiritual purity. Menstruating women are encouraged to pray and are not required to fast; they have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead.  Jainism  In Jainism, the bleeding that occurs in menstruation is thought to kill micro-organisms in the body, making the female body exhausted, causing cramps, and producing stress.\\"Jainism - beliefs\\", BBC.co.uk. Hence, women are expected to rest and not perform any religious duties for a duration of four days. In this time, the man of the house may take up the duties of the woman.  Shinto  In Japan, the religion of Shinto did and still does play a part in their society. The Kami, the spirits they worshiped, would not grant wishes to those who had traces of blood, dirt, or death on them. While menstruation is not entirely blood, the ancient Japanese did not know that. As a result, women who were menstruating were not allowed to visit any of the Kami shrines for the duration of their menstrual period. Even today, women are not allowed to enter Shinto shrines and temples during menstruation, and in some instances, women are completely banned from climbing the tops of sacred mountains due to their 'impurity'. Furthermore, the tradition is kept somewhat alive in the belief that the shedding of the endometrial lining is a kind of death. It is theorized that the Kami are the reason Japan is not kept clean and, in many houses, minimalistic.  Chinese Religions  In Chinese belief systems, women are not supposed to touch sacred statues, make offerings, or pray to sacred statues on their menstrual cycle. Before the revolution some temples only permitted men, and women who were very old or very young, to attend. = Wicca and paganism = Menstruation is mentioned in some Wiccan and pagan texts. There are collected books and material on Witchcraft and menstruation at the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic. In the 2010s public Wiccan and pagan practitioners began sharing rituals, spells and histories of menstruation in these belief systems. Pagan rituals and histories of menstruation is also discussed in books such as Penelope Shuttle and Peter Redgrove's The Wise Wound: Menstruation and Everywoman.Penelope Shuttle and Peter Redgrove, The wise wound. Menstruation and everywoman, London, Victor Gollancz, 1978,  By region  =Africa= Across the continent of Africa, a wide variety of menstruation-related customs have been recorded. Zambia A cloth torn from the traditional wrap (chitenge) is worn, part tied around the waist and part looped under the crotch, to catch menstrual fluid. Menarche (the first menstrual cycle at puberty) is traditionally treated as a sign that the girl is probably ready for sex and marriage, as well as for adult duties in the household. Initiation rites on menarche include instruction on sex and marital relations as well as on menstrual management. This is conducted by older women. It is taboo to talk about menstruation with men, or to learn from one's own mother. =South Asia= In some portions of South Asia, there is a menstrual taboo, with it frequently being considered impure. Restrictions on movement, behaviour and eating are frequently placed. More than one-third of girls across South Asia do not go to school during menstruation. Some of that is due to lack of safe and comfortable toilets at school (lack of water, sanitation and hygiene in schools in developing countries).  Laos  A small study in a rural area in Laos (Savannakhet) found that menstruation is considered taboo and shameful.Chin, L. (2014). Period of shame - The effects of menstrual hygiene management on rural women and girls‚Äô quality of life in Savannakhet, Laos. Master of Science in International Development and Management, Lund University, Sweden This makes it difficult for sharing knowledge in schools and in homes. Also, there is a low level of menstrual hygiene management. This has a negative effect on the female's social opportunities in achieving good health, to move around freely and to go to school. Some menstruating women (16%) wear double-layer skirts (sinhs) while in the private sphere, compared to 54% who wear disposable pads.  India  Hindus in India tend to view menstruation, especially first menstruation or menarche, as a positive aspect of a girl's life. In South India, girls who experience their menstrual period for the first time are given presents and celebrations to mark the occasion. In many traditional Hindu homes in India, girls and women face restrictive taboos relative to menstruation, such as being denied entry to the temple and the kitchen. They have to miss school and work. In areas around the Jhabua district, the belief is that \\"menstruation is a disease and not a normal biological process\\", and therefore women who are menstruating are not allowed to sleep on beds, enter kitchens, touch male members of their family or eat spicy foods. = Keddasa = Keddaso - Menstruation of Mother Earth celebration in Tulunadu, Karnataka Keddaso ‚Äì Festival of worshipping Mother Earth Keddaso also spelled Keddasa (Tulu: ke·∏ç·∏çasa ‡≤ï‡≥Ü‡≤°‡≥ç‡≤°‡≤∏ ), or Bhumi Puje, is popularly known as the \\"festival of worshipping Mother Earth\\" in the Tulu Nadu region of Karnataka, South India. Mother Earth (Bhoomi Devi) gets menstruate and the day is celebrated holistically in Tulunad in the name of ‚ÄòKeddasa‚Äô. This is an important four-day festival celebrated in the closing days of Tulu month Ponny (Gregorian month February). This festival shows the environmental awareness of the people residing at that regionhttp://vijaykarnataka.indiatimes.com/lavalavk/languages/tulu/-/articleshow/46265449.cms Costal Karnataka Festival- Vijaya Karnataka News paper In a 2014 study conducted in India, the researchers found that as many as 42% of women who participated in the study did not know about sanitary pads or the anatomical origin of their menstruation. The researchers noted that women reused old rags to deal with their menstrual discharge, and that \\"Most of them were scared or worried on first menstruation.\\" 88% of menstruating women in rural India use alternatives to sanitary pads such as old fabric, rags, sand, ash, wood shavings, newspapers and hay.USAID, Kiawah Trust, darsa. Spot on! Improving Menstrual Health and Hygiene in India Indonesia In Bali, a woman is not allowed to enter the kitchen to perform her usual duties, nor is she allowed to have sex with her husband while menstruating. She is to sleep apart from the family and has to keep her clothes that she wears while menstruating away from any clothes that she could wear to the temple. One of the most important regulations is that a woman is not allowed to attend temple while menstruating. In Sumba, women keep their cycles secret, which makes men see them as deceitful. Women from Sumba believe that because of their secrecy, they will always have control of the men. \\"Men will never know how much we really can do to control these things. We have all kinds of secrets, and they should always believe that we can control even more than we really can\\". Women are supposed to avoid intercourse while menstruating. It is believed that sexually transmitted diseases are the results of women deceiving men and having intercourse while they are menstruating. Gonorrhea translates as \\"disease you get from women\\" in Sumba; it has become a social problem. When a man would get this disease, the only way they believed he could rid himself of painful sores was to pass it to a woman. The reasoning was that a woman's body can absorb infection and purge it during a cycle.  Nepal  Hindus in Nepal traditionally keep women isolated during menstruation, when women who are menstruating are not allowed in the household for a period of 3 nights. This practise was banned by the Nepalese Supreme Court in 2005 but still continues.Sushil Sharma, \\"Women hail menstruation ruling\\" , BBC News, 15 September 2005. Chhaupadi is a social tradition associated with a menstrual taboo in the western part of Nepal. The tradition prohibits Hindu women and girls from participating in normal family activities while menstruating, as they are considered \\"impure\\". In some parts of western Nepal, the custom of chhaupadi requires menstruating girls and women to sleep in a hut called Chhau Goth some distance from the family home  Sri Lanka  Two-thirds of girls in Sri Lanka were unaware of menstruation before reaching puberty. =United States= The Yurok in North America practiced menstrual seclusion. Yurok women used a small hut near the main house.Kroeber, A. L. 1925. Handbook of the Indians of California. Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin No. 78. Washington, D.C. A survey conducted in 1981 showed that a substantial majority of U.S. adults and adolescents believed that it is socially unacceptable to discuss menstruation, especially in mixed company. Many believed that it is unacceptable to discuss menstruation even within the family.Research & Forecasts, Inc. (1981). \\"The Tampax Report: Summary of Survey Results on a Study of Attitudes towards Menstruation\\". New York: Research and Forecasts. Studies in the early 1980s showed that nearly all girls in the United States believed that girls should not talk about menstruation with boys, while more than one-third of girls did not believe it appropriate to discuss menstruation with their father.Williams, L. R. (1983). \\"Beliefs and Attitudes of Young Girls Regarding Menstruation\\". In Menarche, ed. Sharon Golub. Lexington, MA: Lexington. = United Kingdom = In 2017, Scottish MSP Monica Lennon began work to present an 'Ending Period Poverty' bill to government.Final Bill for consultation: http://www.parliament.scot/S5MembersBills/FINAL_Ending_Period_Poverty_consultation_document.pdf In 2019 it was officially lodged and debated in Holyrood. In 2019, the Government Equalities Office launched a Period Poverty Taskforce to research and end the problem of people who cannot afford menstrual products.  Society and culture  = Education = Menstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education in the US, although one study suggests that girls would prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty. A Nigerian study showed the following breakdown in menstruation education: ‚Äúparents of 56%, friends of 53%, books of 46%, teachers of 44%, internet of 45%, and health centers of 54‚Äù held the most influence in terms of menstruation education. Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty. The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people's understanding of the process. This is in part due to the segregation of male and female peers during educational sessions. Failure to teach an accurate understanding of menstruation to students of all genders has social implications for gendered relationships and the objectification of women‚Äôs bodies. Discomfort arises when students do not have access to the same information, reinforcing the belief ‚Äúthat menstruation is gross and should be kept hidden‚Äù. Girls are encouraged to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating in order to be considered desirable. Sexual harassment and teasing about menstruation cause girls anxiety as they must struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation. Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Several education and sexual health experts have studied the key features necessary for such programs. Some experts maintain that schools are an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place because they are an institution that young people attend consistently. Schools are intended to expand students‚Äô knowledge and thus serve as an appropriate site for conveying menstrual education. Other experts argue that programs led by peers or third-party agencies are more effective than those taught in the school classroom. This may be due to the use of small group interactions, the ability of these programs to target specific populations, or the possibility that many teenagers choose to participate voluntarily in these programs, rather than being mandated to attend school programs. =Advertising= Menstrual product advertising began in the early twentieth- century.Early ads included print magazine campaigns from Tambrands Inc (Tampax), Kimberly-Clark (Kotex) and brands that have since been discontinued. Advertising for menstrual products outside the US began somewhat later, with SABA in Norway starting after the Second World War. Historically, menstrual product advertising has had to balance frankness and information with taboos and censorship laws against discussing or showing menstrual themes. Educational pamphlets and school outreach has been an important way of marketing to young consumers during the twentieth century One common way that sanitary-product advertising avoids depicting menstruation is by pouring a blue, rather than red, liquid on the sanitary product to demonstrate its absorptivity. Historically, this has been due to strict censorship rules regarding menstrual product advertising. In 2010, the \\"Always\\" tampon brand created the first feminine hygiene ad to ever feature a tiny red spot, representing blood. The ad was created by intern and artist William Chyr who was working at Always' advertising agency, Leo Burnett. Originally the ad was created for the intern's personal portfolio, but then it caught the attention of the chief creative officer at Leo Burnett, and was subsequently published as an actual ad. There was some controversy when the ad was first released. In June 2016 the presence of red blood in a UK Bodyform commercial was greeted with approval in social media for its attempt to challenge the stereotypical menstruation ad, by showing women who struggle despite bleeding from cuts, blows and bruises they receive while playing various sports. Later, Bodyform's owner's Essity launched campaigns featuring blood-like liquid in the campaign Blood Normal. = Visual arts = Menstrual art engages with menstrual themes, including blood, pain, menopause and menstrual stigma. Although not new in the twentieth-century, a noted increase in artistic engagement began in the late 1960s with artists including Shigeko Kubota, Carolee Schneemann, Judy Clark, Judy Chicago, Catherine Elwes, Marina Abramoviƒá, Gina Pane, Ana Mendieta, and later Orlan. Since the 1960s, artists have continued to take an interest in menstrual art. Menstrual art highlights different issues regarding menstrual joy, taboos and pain. In 2015, artist Rupi Kaur was censored by Instagram for posting menstrual art series Period. Kaur critiqued Instagram's position, writing: \\"Thank you Instagram for providing me with the exact response my work was created to critique‚Ä¶. I will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak, when your pages are filled with countless photos/accounts where women . . . are objectified, pornified, and treated [as] less than human.‚Äù Instagram later reversed their decision, and menstrual art has since flourished on this platform. Art history has recently begun to explore this theme in art, drawing on a longer historiography of gender and the body in modern and contemporary art explored by feminist art historians, for example Ruth Green-Cole, Camilla M√∏rk R√∏stvik, Kathy Battista, and Bee Hughes. In 2015, artist Jen Lewis curated a menstrual art group-exhibition as part of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research' conference, which also resulted in a catalogue. In 2020, Norwegian Museum Telemark Kunstsenter held an exhibition about menstruation named SYKLUS. =Films= Movies and television also reflect the taboo nature of menstruation. Typically menstruation as a topic is avoided, except for scenes involving menarche or the first period. For example, as Elizabeth Arveda Kissling explains in her article, \\"On the Rag on Screen: Menarche in Film and Television\\", the 1991 film My Girl contains a scene where the main character, Vada, experiences her first period. The explanation given to her by a female role model of what is happening to her is done off-camera and the subject is never mentioned again, save when Vada pushes Thomas across the porch telling him, \\"Don't come back for five to seven days.\\" In the movie Carrie, the title character has her first period in high school, and becomes hysterical in the gym shower believing she is dying. The other girls tease her by throwing tampons and sanitary pads at her. The gym teacher tries to calm Carrie down, and eventually must explain the concept of menstruation to Carrie (because Carrie's mother had never done so). When Carrie returns home announcing she's a woman and inquiring why she was never told about periods, her fanatically religious mother yells at her and locks her into a closet fearing that menstruation will bring men and the sin of sex. Later in the movie, her classmates mock her ignorance of menarche again by pouring pig's blood on her at the prom. In Only Yesterday, one of the girls is found to be going through menstruation and is later teased about it, especially when a group of boys tell the others not to touch a ball she had touched by saying, \\"You'll catch her period\\". In the 2007 movie Superbad, Seth discovers menstrual blood on his jeans after dancing with a woman. He reacts with disgust, as do other men in the scene. In the 2018 Bollywood movie ‚ÄúPad Man‚Äô, Laxmikant Chauhan wishes to help his wife get better access to sanitary products after finding out that she has to live in separate quarters owing to her getting her period. He works hard in order to create a low-cost pad accessible to every women of India and the first pad is given to Pari Walia who unexpectedly got her period. =Menstrual suppression= With the recent FDA approval of menstrual suppression medications, researchers have begun to shift their focus to the attitudes of American women toward their periods. One study in particular found that 59% of the women they surveyed reported an interest in not menstruating every month. Of these, 1/3 said they were interested in not menstruating at all anymore. Anthropologists, Lock and Nguyen (2010), have noted that the heavy medicalization of the reproductive life-stages of women in the West, mimic power structures that are deemed, in other cultural practices, to function as a form of \\"social control\\".Lock, M. & Nguyen, V.-K., 2010. An Anthropology of Biomedicine. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell. Medicalization of the stages of women's lives, such as birth and menstruation, has enlivened a feminist perspective that investigates the social implications of biomedicine‚Äôs practice. \\"[C]ultural analysis of reproduction‚Ä¶attempts to show how women‚Ä¶exhibit resistance and create dominant alternative meanings about the body and reproduction to those dominant among the medical profession.\\" =Activism= Menstrual activism (otherwise known as radical menstruation, menstrual anarchy, or menarchy) is a movement that addresses menstrual taboos. Overcoming this taboo is a point of contention amongst feminists. The primary argument behind this movement is that if menstruation is normal, there is no reason why the topic should be avoided: \\"After a while it becomes psychologically disorienting for women to look out at a world where their reality doesn't exist.\\" Menstruation can be conceptualized as a stigmatized condition that both reflects and reinforces women‚Äôs perceived lower status in relation to men. Feminist scholars extend this theory to explain negative attitudes towards women's bodily functions. Such stigmatization occurs when menstrual blood is viewed as one of the \\"abominations\\" of the body and reflects a gendered identity among women, which leads to consequences for women's psychological and sexual well-being. Feminists such as Chella Quint have spoken against the use of shaming in advertising for feminine hygiene products. She created a zine, Adventures in Menstruating, to \\"help alter the visibility of menstruation, so that it's at least normal to talk about it. Because, right now, it's not\\". Other menstrual activists include Rachel Kauder Nalebuff, who published My Little Red Book; filmmaker and academic Giovanna Chesler, who created the documentary Period: The End of Menstruation; and artist Ingrid Berthon-Moine, who exhibited a video and series of photographs at the Venice Biennale. = Medicine = Blood from female menstruation has been used in medicines. In Chinese Daoist alchemy, menstrual blood from females who had not had sexual intercourse was used to make a substance to prolongue an individual's life, called red lead (). The substance was taken by the Ming dynasty Jiajing Emperor and the abuses inflicted on the palace women to ensure the blood's purity led to the Renyin palace rebellion. =Menstrual synchrony= Menstrual synchrony is an alleged process whereby women who begin living together in close proximity experience their menstrual cycle onsets (the onset of menstruation or menses) becoming more synchronized together in time than when previously living apart. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist. =Menstruation products= Menstrual products are part of menstrual culture, as they are prominent in shops, through advertising and through disposal methods (such as sanitary bins and bags). Throughout the twentieth-century applicator tampons like Tampax and pads such as Kotex were increasingly popular in the Global North. Menstrual pads There are environmental costs of using menstruation products containing plastic and chemicals.

It is the only species in the genus Cleithracara.Loiselle PV. (1994) The Cichlid Aquarium, Voyageur Press, The species is popular with fishkeeping hobbyists and is frequently kept in aquariums. Appearance The species is a small tan coloured ovate-bodied fish. It has a black spot on its upper flank which sometimes extends into a short stripe. This gives rise to the common name, keyhole cichlid, from which the genus name Cleithracara (meaning \\"lock acara\\") is derived.Kullander SO (2003) Cleithracara Guide To The South American Cichlidae When the species is startled or nervous it assumes a blotchy colouration and presses its body against rocks or logs in an attempt to camouflage itself. It is generally shy, peaceful and should not be kept with aggressive species. Reproduction and sexual dimorphism Keyhole cichlid with a clutch of eggs It is a monogamous, biparentally custodial breeder which spawns on flattened rocks, logs or leaves. Clutch size ranges from 300-400 eggs that are tended by both the male and female. The sexes are difficult to distinguish, though some males have a longer and more pointed dorsal fin. There has been a sighting of a keyhole cichlid laying 1000 eggs. Diet The species feeds on crustaceans, insects and other invertebrates. In the aquarium The species is suitable for the community aquarium and will accept a wide variety of prepared fish food in captivity. The environment in aquaria should mimic the natural habitat of the species and include plants and numerous hiding places. It will also eat beetles that have been dropped in the tank.

The Swift is a large cased .224 caliber cartridge and bullet that was created for small game such as prairie dogs, groundhogs and other vermin (or \\"varmints\\" in the US) such as marmots. When introduced it was faster than its nearest varmint-hunting competitor, which was the .22 Hornet (also .224 caliber). It was found to be an extremely accurate cartridge as well.220 Swift article at Gunners Den The .220 Swift remains the fastest commercial cartridge in the world, with a published velocity of using a bullet and of 3031 powder.Handbook for shooters and reloaders volume 1 P.O. Ackley Due to its very high velocity its bullet drop allows precise sighting on game such as groundhogs to ranges out to , and it is still considered an excellent cartridge for taking varmints by experienced Swift shooters. The original factory load from Winchester provided a bullet launched at . Handloaders could marginally improve on this but only at maximum loads. The Swift can be loaded with light bullets to reach .Cartridges of the World 12th Edition In recent times .224\\" bullets have been developed for use in high velocity .22 caliber rifles for taking larger game and long-distance shooting. Heavier bullets perform best in rifles that have an appropriate rifling twist rate taking into consideration the diameter, length, and other physical properties of the projectile. History The prototype for the .220 Swift was developed in 1934‚Äì35 by Grosvenor Wotkyns who necked down the .250-3000 Savage as a means of achieving very high velocities. However the final commercial version developed by Winchester is based on the 6mm Lee Navy cartridge necked down. The .220 Swift was developed by Winchester and introduced in 1935 as a new caliber for their Model 54 bolt-action rifle. When the Winchester Model 70 bolt action was first issued in 1936, the .220 Swift was one of the standard calibers offered and continued to be until 1964 when it was discontinued. Acceptance The Swift has the dubious privilege of being possibly the most controversial of all the many .224 in caliber cartridges, and has inspired equal heights of praise and criticism. Traditionalists have roundly condemned it as an overbore \\"barrel burner\\" which can wear out a chromoly barrel in as few as 200‚Äì300 rounds, especially if long strings of shots are fired from an increasingly hot barrel. Its supporters have maintained that the fault lies with poor-quality barrel steels and the failure of users to remove copper fouling after firing, and point to instances of rifles with fine-quality stainless steel barrels chambered for the Swift, which have maintained sub-MOA precision after well in excess of 4,000 shots. More popular, however, is the smaller and slightly lower velocity .22‚Äì250. .220 Swift maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm) plus Imperial (inches). Drawbacks The Swift's high-velocity performance comes at a price, Due to the cartridge being over capacity for the bore diameter and the extreme velocity of the projectiles Throat erosion is a common problem. Modern metallurgy and cryogenic treatment have vastly improved barrel life with the .220 Swift and other cartridges, although weapons firing these cartridges still usually require rechambering or rebarreling much sooner than those firing lower-velocity cartridges such as the .222 Remington and the .223 Remington. Hunting controversy The Swift remains a controversial deer caliber. Its use is prohibited in many US states and also in the Netherlands, England, Wales and Northern Ireland for large deer such as Red, Sika and Fallow, but some states, such as Minnesota, currently allow smaller caliber rounds like the .220 Swift to be used. In the cartridge's early days during the 1930s, expert red deer stalkers such as W.D.M. Bell used the .220 Swift on large stags with great success, and extolled the caliber's seemingly magical killing powers, which they attributed to massive hydrostatic shock waves set up in the animal's body by the impact of the very high-velocity bullet.Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders vol I, Book by P.O. Ackley; Plaza Publishing, 1962, Critics of the Swift have maintained that the light bullet leaves an inadequate margin for error in bullet placement for the average deer shooter's skills, and thus invites wounding, which would have otherwise been avoidable. There is, however, little debate about the Swift's proven effectiveness on small deer species, such as Roe, provided very fast- fragmenting \\"varmint\\"-type bullets are not used. Most factory Swift rifles come with a fairly slow twist-rate such as 1‚Äì12\\" or 1‚Äì14\\", designed to stabilize the lighter bullets popular in varmint hunting. Custom Swifts can have faster twist-rates such as 1‚Äì9\\" allowing them to stabilize heavy bullets, including those with a construction suitable for larger game. P.O. Ackley maintained that the .220 Swift was a fine round for medium-large game and used it extensively for example when culling wild burros in the American West.Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders vol.

Paxus Calta (born 1957), born Earl Schuyler \\"Sky\\" Flansburgh, is an American political activist, communitarian and writer. He has been involved with the anti-nuclear movement and is a member of the Twin Oaks Community. Biography Calta was born as Earl Schuyler Flansburgh, or \\"Sky\\" as a nickname, in 1957. Calta studied engineering and economics at Cornell University, where he served as a student member of the Board of Trustees and as a member of the Quill and Dagger society. Afterwards he worked as a software designer, helping to found and ultimately sell two software consulting firms. In 1982, he changed his name to Paxus Calta. In 1988, he hitchhiked on sailboats across the Pacific, settled briefly in Australia and then moved on to Hawai'i where he worked for Makai Ocean Engineering. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Calta moved to the Netherlands and worked for The World Information Service on Energy (WISE) in Amsterdam. Calta was invited by a Czech deep ecology organization, Hnut√≠ DUHA, to run the international campaign against the Temel√≠n Nuclear Power Station from Brno, Czechoslovakia in 1991, which remained his primary home base for most of the 1990s and from where he campaigned against nuclear power. During this time, he \\"moved up\\" in the Friends of the Earth hierarchy. In 1998, Calta moved to Twin Oaks Community, located in Virginia in the United States. Calta is a proponent of polyamory and writes on the topic. In 2004, he wrote a chapter of the book The Impossible Will Take a Little While (compiled by Paul Rogat Loeb), in which he detailed a successful campaign launched by an 18-year-old to overthrow the Bulgarian government. Political activism Throughout the 1990s, Calta was involved in campaigns to stop nuclear power plants in 6 countries in Central Europe. Calta was the Chair of the international campaign commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. and co-managed the FAIRE project (Free & Applied Internships in Renewables and Efficiency) which trained Central European activists in English language skills, campaigning and then placed them in western environmental groups as interns. The FAIRE project was funded by the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, which is affiliated with the German Green Party. Hnut√≠ DUHA invited Calta to be the lead international anti- nuclear campaigner after he left WISE. In 1994, Calta presented materials before the US House of Representative Subcommittee on International Development to block the Export-Import Bank of the United States from funding the Temel√≠n reactor.Transcripts of hearing on US Export-Import Bank before the Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade, and Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, House of Representatives, February 23, 1994\\" Calta initiated the Clean Energy Brigade project in the Czech Republic in which local activists installed energy saving hardware in residential homes and public buildings at materials cost in exchange for documentation of reduced energy use. This program was expanded to 11 Central and East European countries and is now called the International Energy Brigades. In aggregate, the efficiency upgrades from this project are abating literally thousands of tons of CO2 each year. More recently, he campaigned against a planned new reactor at North Anna in Virginia and was arrested and jailed for protests there. On December 4, 2009 Calta critiqued Stewart Brand on NPR on the merits of using nuclear power to stop climate change. Calta served on the board of directors of the anti-nuclear group Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS) from 1997 til 2010, and as the president of the board for the last 3 years. After the August 23, 2011 Virginia earthquake which closed down the North Anna nuclear power plant, Calta and others founded the organization \\"Not on Our Fault Line\\", for which Calta has been repeatedly a spokesperson. On November 30, 2011, Calta was arrested with 17 others in Charlottesville VA as part of the Occupy Charlottesville protest. In late 2013, Calta co-founded the Point A project designed to start income sharing communities in urban centers on the East Coast of the US. These communities would be part of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities. In 2015, the Point A project launched its first new income sharing project in Washington DC called Compersia. In January 2017, a talk on activism at Elon University was viewed as sufficiently Un-American as to be critically covered by the American Lens. In the summer of 2018, BBC 4 filmed part of their Utopia series at Twin Oaks, Calta was the principal guide. Lifestyle activism Calta authored a pamphlet about polyamory which has been translated into 5 languages. Calta considers himself an anarchist and is the principal organizer of the Fingerbook Propaganda Project, which produces and distributes \\"Fingerbooks\\" (small handbooks) on consensus decision-making, designing revolutions, polyamory, and intentional communities. He has also been a member of Twin Oaks Community since 1998, serving as the community's recruiting manager, manager of outside work and a general manager of Twin Oaks Hammocks, Inc. He has appeared on both CNN and Voice of America videos discussing the community. Family Calta is the son of the late Earl R. Flansburgh, a Boston architect, and the older brother of John Flansburgh, of rock band They Might Be Giants. Calta's mother, Polly Flansburgh, is the founder and president of Boston by Foot, which gives architectural walking tours of the city of Boston.

Biography He and his family were part of the Jewish immigration from Russia during the early 1880s. Victims of the pogroms and of social, economic, and political persecution, the Zimmermans were among hundreds who arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1882. The father, Nathan Zimmerman and Benjamin both found work as labourers with the Canadian Pacific Railway . When some capital had been saved, Nathan became a pedlar and, by 1884, had established a small clothing and dry-goods store with Benjamin assisting him. Three years later, his father established a pawnbroking business with another relative. Benjamin Zimmerman had also started a peddling company by 1890 and became a jobber specializing in clothing. By the turn of the century, he also had a pawnbroking business and was well known as a reputable lender. He and his family branched into other profitable areas of business and he became a leader of the growing Jewish community in Winnipeg. His prominence in the Jewish community allowed him to exert a great deal of influence on the politics of the time. He was appointed a JP during the provincial government of Thomas Greenway. He was a founder of Jewish charitable organizations within the community and a strong influence on the religious community with many positions within various synagogue congregations. He was also a JP in Winnipeg for almost 25 years and his judicial work was highly regarded. Most importantly, he was a hard-working first generation eastern European Jewish immigrant who became financially successful and integrated into the larger society and, as such stands as a representative of those people.

Pa≈°troviƒái stretches from the southernmost part of the Bay of Kotor, from the cape of Zavala to Spiƒç. Its historical capital was the island of Sveti Stefan. Pa≈°troviƒái was a province of Venetian Albania, a Venetian possession on the Adriatic coast, from 1423 until 1797, with interruptions by the Ottoman Empire. It was part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia from 1815 to 1918, then Yugoslavia, then became part of Montenegro only after World War II. It is historically one of two major \\"maritime tribes\\", the other being Grbalj. History 1632 manuscript including Venetian privileges to Pa≈°troviƒái. During the 6th and 7th century, Slavs settled in areas of today's Montenegrin littoral, where modern Pa≈°troviƒái live. In the centuries after, these older Slavic groups resettled from these areas and after 14th century, other Slavic groups from surrounding areas settled there and from them, Pa≈°troviƒái tribe was formed. The etymology of the name Pa≈°troviƒái is unclear. The JAZU derives it from the given names Pa≈°tro, Pa≈°troje, name with the meaning \\"a colorful man\\", derived from old-Slavic word of \\"pa≈°tr(o)\\" with the meaning \\"colorful\\". There are also theories that it derives from old Vlach word \\"pastro\\" which is derived from Latin word pastor, meaning \\"shepherd\\" (supported by Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá. The name is first attested in a text dating to 1355, regarding nobleman Nikolica Pa≈°troviƒá in the service of Serbian emperor Stefan Du≈°an (r. 1331‚Äì55), sent to the Republic of Ragusa. In 1363, Radak Pa≈°troviƒá donated to a church in Rac. Since 1377 they are regularly mentioned in Ragusan documents. In March 1399, several \\"people from Pa≈°troviƒái\\" are mentioned. Originally a family, it would expand into a tribe by the first half of the 15th century. During the Zetan‚ÄìVenetian First Scutari War (1405‚Äì13) they were under control of the related ƒêura≈°eviƒá family whose members held the most prestigious positions on the court of Bal≈°a III. In the Serbian‚ÄìVenetian Second Scutari War (1419‚Äì23) they at first served the Serbian Despotate, until January 1423 when the Republic of Venice managed to bribe them and other tribes in the region over to the Venetian side. Though none of these were mobilized militarily, they left the Serbian ranks and thus became potential danger to Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. The Pa≈°troviƒá assembly agreed to enter the service of Venice in April 1423, accepting Venetian suzerainty and taxes; in return they received promise to respect their tribal institution, guarantees of their present lands and recognition of their right to lost lands. Peace was signed in August 1423. Thus, by this 1423 treaty, the province of Pa≈°troviƒái received an autonomous status, while the brotherhoods (families) of Pa≈°troviƒái became a \\"tribe\\", building their free villager estate and internal self-government with kinship organization ‚Äì becoming petty nobility.

First introduced as The Family Channel in the early 1990s and later simply as Channel 3, it was one of the first exclusive channels of regulated cable television in Israel. History The channel was founded by Udi Miron in 1989 together with the establishment of ICP (Israel Cable Programming), and was one of the first cable channels in Israel with their launch in 1990. At first the channel's Program Schedule was mostly made of Dramas, some American shows from the past (Soap, All in the family), Soap Operas such as The Young and the Restless, and a few experimental original productions. Within a few years, the channel became the Israeli home of many successful television shows from America and other countries, adding the tag line \\"The best shows in the world\\". However, in 2002 the channel lost this privilege due to a financial dispute with Warner Bros. and could not continue to air content distributed by Warner. This resulted in Channel 3 losing shows such as Friends, ER, The Sopranos and The West Wing ‚Äì all of which were purchased by other channels. Since then the channel added more and more original content while continuing to air non- Warner purchased shows. The channel's name was changed to \\"Hot 3\\" in 2004, not long after the three Israeli cable companies united and became the \\"Hot\\" company. To date, the longest-running original show in the channel was Good Evening with Guy Pines, a televised magazine hosted by Guy Pines, covering the world of entertainment both in Israel and the world. This show aired at least 4 times a week for 13 seasons between 1997‚Äì2010, and an earlier version was the Israeli Entertainment Tonight, also hosted by Pines which aired from 1994 to 1996. Pines also covered events such as film festivals around the world before Good Evening started.

In overview, it is quite similar to POS and DTM. It was one of the major influences on the Resilient Packet Ring/802.17 standard. Protocol design DPT is implemented as two counter-rotating rings. This means the network is composed of two completely separate rings of fiber that are both able to transmit data concurrently. This design provides for redundancy in case of a fiber cut or link failure, and increased throughput in common situations. DPT as opposed to POS or normal SONET/SDH is able to use both rings at the same time whereas POS only uses one ring under normal circumstances but switches to the second upon failure of the first. Cisco claims that DPT can run with double the bit-rate of POS due to this characteristic. DPT is not a PPP whereas POS is, this means that traffic between two nodes of a DPT ring does not affect intermediate nodes. With the introduction of DPT came the introduction of another Cisco developed MAC layer protocol, Spatial Reuse Protocol or SRP. The use of SRP in conjunction with DPT makes it possible for DPT to communicate with the physical layer. Types of data in DPT networks As with most other lower layer protocols, there are methods for communicating not only application data between the nodes of a DPT network. It is necessary for the nodes to be able to communicate control data between each other in case of a fiber cut or link failure so the nodes can forward traffic on the appropriate interfaces and maintain network connectivity. Both control packets, and data packets are transmitted on both rings in order to maintain connectivity and full bandwidth utilization in normal situations; but once a failure occurs, the control data will notify the applicable routers of the failure and all the routers will switch to using only their active interfaces for data and control packets. DPT packet structure The structure of a DPT Packet is quite similar to that of Ethernet. It contains a source and destination MAC address (both 48-bits long), a protocol type identifier (used for identifying the upper layer protocol contained in the payload), and a frame check sequence used to validate the data. DPT topologies Both DPT and SRP are independent of their physical layers. This means that the DPT protocol can operate above several physical mediums such as SONET/SDH, Gigabit Ethernet, and others. As aforementioned, DPT is composed of two rings for fault tolerance and increased throughput. The method for switching between these two rings in the event of a failure is called Intelligent Protection Switching, or IPS. This ensures that a fiber cut or link failure (layer 1 error) will be rectified and IP traffic will be resumed within 50 ms. DPT also contains a \\"plug and play\\" feature which dynamically fetches the MAC addresses of neighboring devices which provides for very simple configuration with little to no setup prior to functional data transfer.

In 1935 she was a prosecution witness at two trials where Eric Mareo was convicted of the murder of his wife Thelma Mareo who was also Stark's lover. During the Second World War, she was a famed exotic dancer at Auckland's Wintergarden cabaret and nightclub, and a favourite of American troops stationed there, where she earned the title \\"Fever of the Fleet.\\" Early life Born in Kaeo in 1910, Stark was the daughter of James Stark, a shopkeeper, and Isabella Bramley. She attended St Benedict's School and Epsom Girls Grammar School after her parents shifted to Auckland shortly after her birth. Her father encouraged her to learn dance, and she began to do so at nine years of age. After leaving school, Stark worked as a clerical worker by day, and danced as \\"L'Etoile\\" during the evenings, and her repertoire included tap, high kicks, tumbles and hula. During the 1930s, she also learned classical ballet, as steps toward an advanced examination certificate at New Zealand's Academy of Dance, which she acquired in the late thirties. Mareo murder trials In 1933, Stark joined Ernest Rolls' revue, and met a young dancer named Thelma Trott, and the two women fell in love. In 1934, Stark was in the chorus of the Duchess of Danitz, while Trott starred. At this time, Trott married Eric Mareo, their conductor. The relationship was cut short in 1935 when Trott took a fatal overdose of the prescription drug Veronal in unexplained circumstances, leading to Mareo being charged with her murder. Mareo was tried twice for the murder of Trott, was twice found guilty, and was twice sentenced to death by hanging (later commuted to 12 years in prison). Waikato Law Review report of Mareo trials Stark was a prosecution witness at both trials and had to endure being outed as a lesbian, and constant subsequent accusations that she had given either mistaken or selective testimony while under oath which were never proven either way. Nude photographs of Stark were reproduced during the trial, but Stark remained unperturbed, and was later described as a model Crown witness. \\"Fever of the Fleet\\" During the Second World War, Stark was a clerical worker at the Colonial Ammunition Company during the day. At night, she entertained New Zealand and American troops at the Wintergarden cabaret and nightclub. At times, she was clad only in a feather headdress, a G-string and gold bodypaint. The appreciative American Expeditionary troops bestowed the title \\"Fever of the Fleet\\" on Stark, and often booked out the Wintergarden specifically to attend her performances, hiring an accompanying band and floorshow at the same time. Postwar career After the Second World War, Stark relocated to London, where she met and married Harold Robinson, a New Zealand-born dancer (and himself a gay man) at Sadler's Wells. The duo starred together in New Zealand-born Robert Steele's art film, Curves and Contrasts (1947), before their marriage ended by mutual consent. They did not divorce until 1973 and remained close friends. Although based in the United Kingdom, Stark frequently revisited New Zealand, before she returned permanently in 1970, and became a secretary at the University of Auckland. During the 1990s there was renewed interest in her days as a dancer, and her life was celebrated in a biography Freda Stark: Her Extraordinary Life and in Peter Wells and Stewart Mains' documentary, The Mighty Civic (1989). Stark died in the Abbey Heights Rest Home in Massey, Auckland, in March 1999. She is buried alongside Thelma Mareo (1906 ‚Äì April 15, 1935) at Waikumete Cemetery, Glen Eden, Auckland, New Zealand.

Francisco de S. Maspons y Labros, in Cuentos Populars Catalans. Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. Synopsis A poor girl got a job herding cows. One day, she heard a moan, and found a lion with a thorn in its paw. She pulled it out, and the lion thanked her by licking her hand, but she could not find the cows again. Her master beat her and set her to herding donkeys. A year later, she found the lion wounded again, and when she aided it, the donkeys vanished. Her master beat her again and set to her to herding pigs. A year later, the lion appeared for a third time, wounded, she aided it, the pigs vanished, and she decided to wait and see if she could find them. She climbed a tree and saw a man coming down a path and vanishing behind a rock at sunset. She decided to stay until she saw him come out. At dawn, a lion came out. She went down and behind the rock. A beautiful house stood there; she tidied it up and ate a meal before coming out to climb the same tree. The man came at the same time, and the next morning, the lion looked about before going on. After three days of this, she could not discover his secret, so she descended and asked him. He told that he was enchanted by a giant into that form by day and was the lion she had helped; furthermore, the giant had stolen the cows, donkeys, and pigs in revenge for her aid. She wanted to free the man. He told her that the only way was to get a lock of hair from the king's daughter and make a cloak from it for the giant. The girl got the princess to hire her as a scullion. She dressed very neatly every day, and it came to the ears of the princess, who set her to comb her hair. The girl begged a lock of hair from her until she gave it. The girl wove a coat from it, but it was too small. She went back to the princess, who gave her another lock on the condition that she would find her a prince to marry. The girl said she had already found him, took the lock, and made the coat larger. The giant asked her what reward she wanted. She wanted to turn the lion back into a man. After some argument, the giant told her to kill the lion, cut him up into pieces, burn them, and throw the ash into water. The prince would arise from it a man. She went away weeping, afraid that the giant had lied and she would kill the prince. The prince comforted her and told her to do it, and it worked. He said he would marry her. The girl told him she had promised the princess that she had found her a bridegroom. They went back to the princess, and her parents, the king and queen, knew him for their own son. So he married the girl who had saved him.

Description The garden is owned by a community nonprofit called Friends of Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden.. It is located at uphill (mauka) of the Hawaii Belt Road, known as MƒÅmalahoa Highway or Hawaii Route 11, on the western slope of Mauna Loa. Amy Beatrice Holdsworth Greenwell was born in 1920. Her father was Arthur Leonard Greenwell (1871‚Äì1951) and mother was Beatrice Hunt Holdsworth (1891‚Äì1981). She was one of the 23 grandchildren of Henry Nicholas Greenwell (1826‚Äì1891), who arrived in Hawaii in the 1850s and became a successful merchant and rancher in the area. Her maternal grandparents were merchant Edmund William Holdsworth and Edith Mary Winifred Purvis (1860‚Äì1950), who was a first cousin of Annie Oliphant Cornelia Purvis (1870‚Äì1947), great-great-grandmother of 23rd Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau,http://www.thepeerage.com/p42891.htm#i428909http://www.thepeerage.com/p63515.htm#i635143 and a distant cousin of William Herbert Purvis, a plant collector on the other side of the island. Greenwell attended Stanford University where she became a member of Gamma Phi Beta and served as a nurse in World War II. After the war she worked with Otto Degener of the New York Botanical Garden on a book series titled Flora Hawaiiensis on Hawaiian plants. From 1953 to 1957 she served on a Historical Site Commission for the Territory. She performed archaeology studies of early habitation sites of Hawaii including Ka Lae (South Point), and wrote other books on tropical plants. Later in her lifetime she transformed her property by planting native and Polynesian-introduced plants in the extant Hawaiian agricultural areas. She left the garden to the Bishop Museum on her death in 1974 to be opened to the public. The museum closed the gardens to the public on January 31st, 2016 and is trying to sell the land.http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/amy-bh-greenwell- ethnobotanical-garden-close-jan-31 The garden is slated to re-open on February 29, 2020. https://bigislandnow.com/2020/02/09/amy-greenwell-garden-to-reopen- during-grow-hawaiian-festival/ Today the garden contains over 200 species of endemic, indigenous, and Polynesian-introduced plants that grew in Kona before Captain James Cook's arrival. On Sundays the Garden is open from 9 am. until 2 pm. and it is sometimes possible to take a guided tour during which the use and significance of the more important plants are explained. The garden's landscape includes four ecological zones: coastal, dry forest, agricultural, and upland forest. Its native insect house features the Kamehameha butterfly (Vanessa tameamea). The garden sponsors a farmers' market known as the South Kona green Market on Sundays. It was originally held at the adjacent County of Hawaii park named for Arthur Leonard Greenwell, but is now held a few hundred feet to the southeast at the Kealakekua Ranch Center, named for the former Arthur Leonard Greenwell family ranch which extended up the mountain, overlooking Kealakekua Bay. Across the highway the Kona Coffee Living History Farm run by the Kona Historical Society preserves a Kona coffee farm that was another part of the Greenwell landholdings. In November of 2019, the Friends of Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden announced their successful purchase of the land from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. https://bigislandnow.com/2019/11/26/amy-bh-greenwell-botanical-garden-will- live-on-after-sale/ The organization plans to perpetuate the cultural and educational legacy of the garden.

The lyrics describe Colombian marijuana, Spanish cocaine and Tennessean moonshine being offered to the singer, who refuses it all. Harry Nilsson provides backing vocals. Some reissues and later pressings of the Ringo Starr version credit the song as \\"No No Song/Skokiaan.\\" This is presumably due to a copyright claim by the publishers of the latter song, although details are lacking. There are some similarities between parts of \\"Skokiaan\\" and the instrumental break between the second and third verses of Starr's version of the \\"No No Song,\\" but without documentation this is no more than a supposition. Reception Billboard described \\"No No Song\\" as a \\"good, fun Ringo cut.\\" Billboard expressed concern that the drug references may limit airplay, even though the lyrics have the singer rejecting drug use.  Covers  In 1975, the song's writer, Hoyt Axton, released his own version of the song, featuring Cheech and Chong, on his album Southbound.

Past members included James Barnett, guitarist Lalo Creme (son of former 10cc and Godley & Creme member Lol Creme) and drummer Sebastian Beresford. Arkarna has enjoyed sold out tours in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, as well as various headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. History Formed by Ollie Jacobs in England in the mid-1990s, Arkarna debuted in 1997 with the album Fresh Meat. Jacobs (Programmer and vocalist) had worked as an engineer and producer in his father's London studios, Rollover , from the age of 14. By the time he started the band, Jacobs had mixed for Dreadzone, Leftfield and Deep Forest. Acoustic guitarist and backing vocalist James Barnett, formerly a member of Lunarci, recorded for Big Life Records and regularly appeared on the Megadog club scene. Lalo Creme, son of Lol Creme of Godley & Creme fame, joined after playing guitar for a series of Trevor Horn sessions. Creme was directed to Rollover Studios where Jacobs and Barnett were in the embryonic stage of forming a group. The trio were signed to WEA Records by Clive Black and Raz Gold in June 1995 and later released their debut single \\"House on Fire\\" and the album, Fresh Meat. During this period they took the first steps in performing live, hiring drummer Sebastian Beresford before enrolled him as the fourth member before their 1997 tour of Australia. As a four-piece, they went on to tour across the world until after the release of their second album, The Family Album (2001). In 2010, Arkarna joined forces with session musicians Tim Owen (drummer) and Dave Landers (bassist) to perform in front of over 30,000 fans for Java Rockin'land in Ancol Dreamland, Jakarta, Indonesia. They headlined alongside the Smashing Pumpkins and Stereophonics and were voted the festival favorite and instantly won the hearts of young Indonesian adults across the nation. New material started to appear in 2011 for their third album; the first single from which was \\"Left Is Best\\". The promo video for \\"Left Is Best\\" first appeared on YouTube in December 2011. With millions of loyal fans in Indonesia, on 20 October 2014 Arkarna was invited back by Indonesian President Joko Widodo to perform live in front of over 250,000 people at the presidential inauguration in the National Monument MONAS ‚Äì Jakarta. On 17 August 2015, the band were summoned back to Indonesia to launch their new single, \\"Kebyar-Kebyar\\", in the Indonesian language to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the independence of Indonesia. Music Some of Arkarna's more popular songs are \\"House on Fire\\" and \\"Eat Me\\", both of which appeared on Arkarna's debut album Fresh Meat. \\"House on Fire\\" has featured on U.S. sitcom series Friends, The O.C. and also appeared on the Batman & Robin soundtrack. Another hit song from the Fresh Meat album, \\"So Little Time\\", was also the theme tune to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's TV show in the U.S., So Little Time. Arkarna's The Family Album produced the singles \\"Skin\\", \\"Rehab\\" and the number one radio tune in Southeast Asia, \\"Life Is Free\\". Several other international inroads over the past decade included soundtracking Levi's ads and Honda TV commercials in the United States. Ollie Jacobs Jacobs started out doing remixes for Frankie Goes to Hollywood (\\"Relax\\") before he went on to mix Leftfield's Leftism. Jacobs then began composing his own songs, and became the frontman of Arkarna. Jacobs was soon involved with East 17 and Take That and made an appearance on BBC One's Top of the Pops with Rozalla, performing behind the turntables on \\"Don't Go Lose It Baby\\". Jacobs has also collaborated with various well-known artists and producers including Madonna, Trevor Horn, Art of Noise, Barry Manilow, The Prodigy, Skunk Anansie, William Orbit, Tinchy Stryder, Stooshe, and Boyzone. Early on, Jacobs wrote and produced the number No. 1 hit \\"Mysterious Girl\\" for Peter Andre. Additionally, he has mixed the track \\"Pop Your Cork\\" for the Stanton Warriors (which features Twista) and also collaborated with Dave Hedger under the name West London Deep. In 2013, Jacobs was voted 'Top UK Hit Songwriter' for writing and producing the number No. 1 Saturdays hit, \\"What About Us\\", which has sold over 500,000 copies in the UK, plus 120,000 copies in the US alone without even charting on the Billboard Hot 100.

Forms of Internet taxation =Internet access tax= Internet access taxes normally take the form of taxation on Internet service provider (ISP) access charges. ISPs levy these charges on users. Currently, these fees are typically imposed at the state level. There is no national tax on ISP user charges. No uniform description of Internet access taxes is possible; they fall within the category of sales taxes in some states, and telecommunications taxes in others; and they are considered service charges, which are usually exempt from taxation, in still other states. Ten states (which were grandfathered under the Internet Tax Freedom Act as part of a political compromise) are allowed to provide for some manner of taxation on ISP charges. The ten states are Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington & Wisconsin. Under the grandfather clause included in the Internet Tax Freedom Act, Texas is currently collecting a tax on Internet access charges over $25.00 per month. Texas collected tax on internet access prior to the enactment of ITFA under the \\"Taxables Services\\" provision of its Tax Code, see older ¬ß 151.0101(a). Texas has refined its tax code to define \\"Internet access service\\", include it under \\"Taxable Services\\" and exempted the first $25.00 on a monthly basis, See current Texas Tax Code ¬ß 151.325 & 151.0101(a) E-mail tax E-mail tax is a specific type of bit-tax, which would tax based on volume of email sent or received, quantified either by number of messages or data size of the messages. This type of tax was mentioned in a 1999 report by the United Nations Development Program entitled \\"Globalization With a Human Face\\", as a type of bit tax which would raise an estimated $70 billion (US) if implemented globally.UNDP Human Development Report 1999 The e-mail tax has been the subject of numerous internet and political hoaxes.No, Newbies, There's No Email Tax Imposition of e-mail taxes by the U.S. government or any of its political subdivisions is banned by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Conceptual issues Beyond the questions of direct taxation of Internet access through levies such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes, email taxes, and franchise fees, a related issue concerns the imposition of sales taxes on Internet sales of goods and services. This taxation is not prohibited by federal statute, but rather by a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions including Quill Corp. v. North Dakota (1992).504 U.S. 298. Those cases held that state taxation of in- state sales by vendors with no significant physical presence in the state violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Because of this constitutional prohibition on collecting sales tax from so-called \\"remote\\" sales on the Internet, the issue of local jurisdictions taxing goods and services purchased from out of state by their residents using the Internet has not yet raised the conceptual questions discussed below. See tax-free shopping.'' =Location= The issue of locationof the Internet user, the user's counterparties in a commercial transaction, the headquarters facilities of any involved commercial entities, and even the servers and switchesis important for tax purposes. For example, of the nine U.S. states that currently tax access in some manner, four make reference to location. In each case, both the provision of service and the billing must take place within the state. Connecticut places the burden of determining whether this is so upon the Internet service provider. But in general, there is no simple way to determine location, owing largely to the Internet's lack of boundaries. Users can and routinely do access their accounts from remote locations; providers are almost always located in multiple taxing jurisdictions; and the data traffic itself, via the Internet's packet-switched architecture, is routed through myriad locations. Such issues are important not only for practical reasons of determining the incidence of the tax and its enforcement, but also because the U.S. Constitution requires that a state or taxing sub-jurisdiction have \\"nexus\\" with the transaction in order to exert its taxing power, and that determination rests precisely upon such considerations.See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992). =Setup v. monthly fee= In the United States, some states and taxing authorities distinguish between the initial setup fee for Internet access and the monthly, hourly, or per-minute billing fee for actual access. Nebraska taxes the initial setup, but only if software is provided. It does not tax subsequent monthly billing. Tennessee, on the other hand, taxes both. =Good vs. service= A basic issue in determining whether Internet access and Internet usage of various kinds is subject to sales tax, use tax, telecommunications tax, a combination of these taxes, or no taxes at all, is whether Internet access and usage is determined to be a \\"good\\" or a \\"service.\\" If access to the Internet or usage is deemed a service, in general no sales or use taxation applies, while the rates and variants of telecommunications taxes that apply can be different. However, if access requires downloading of user software, some U.S. states (e.g., Massachusetts) may deem that to be a \\"taxable sale\\" of goods for their residents. =Collection= Collection of Internet taxes presents a complex array of issues. These include whether states themselves should collect the tax; whether the burden instead should be placed on the Internet service provider; the extent to which retailers or value-added intermediaries can be required to perform collection duties; and in all cases, the ways in which this collection can be accurately and meaningfully enforced by the taxing jurisdiction. The roots of these issues stem from two debates. The first is the constitutionality of requiring internet businesses to collect taxes relating to the \\"Due Process\\" and \\"Commerce\\" clause of the constitution which require fair action by the government and no undue burden placed on interstate commerce. The second is whether the economic benefit gained from taxation outweighs the economic costs of enforcing the taxation. Internet tax by country =Africa= Uganda On May 30, 2018, the Ugandan parliament passed The Excise Duty Amendment Bill which proposed that; *A person providing an excisable service becomes liable to pay excise duty on that service on the earlier of the date on which the performance of the service is completed; the date on which payment for the service is made; or the date on which an invoice is issued. *A telecommunications service operator providing data used for accessing over the top services is liable to account for and pay excise duty on the access to the over the top services. ‚ÄúOver the top services\\" are defined as the transmission or receipt of voice or messages over the internet protocol network and includes access to virtual private networks but does not include educational or research sites prescribed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. =Americas= United States In 1996, several U.S. states and municipalities began to see Internet services as a potential source of tax revenue. The 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet, grandfathering existing taxes in ten states.Internet Tax Freedom Act, 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 151 (1998). In the United States alone, some 30,000 taxing jurisdictions could otherwise have laid claim to taxes on a piece of the Internet.Internet Taxation published by Duke University The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases. These continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed. The 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act was authored by Representative Christopher Cox, R-CA and Senator Ron Wyden, D-OR and signed into law on October 21, 1998 by President Bill Clinton in an effort to promote and preserve the commercial potential of the Internet. This law bars federal, state, and local governments from taxing Internet access and from imposing discriminatory Internet-only taxes such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes, and e-mail taxes. The law also bars multiple taxes on electronic commerce. The 1998 bill had been extended three times by the United States Congress since its original enactment and was last renewed on October 30, 2007 for 7 years.Internet tax moratorium bill goes to Bush - USATODAY.com On Feb. 11, 2016 the U.S. Congress passed the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act and sent the bill to President Barack Obama for his expected signature.Congress Passes Permanent Ban on Broadband Taxes - DSLReports.com =Asia= Bhutan In 2014, the Kingdom of Bhutan imposed a 5% sales tax on all internet services. Pakistan Government of Pakistan has imposed 14% tax on internet across Pakistan. With this new advance tax which can be reclaimed at the time of filing of returns 14% of the bill amount is supposed to get deducted on internet usage across Pakistan. A vast majority of people took to Social networking websites to voice their grievances. With the imposition of this tax, Pakistan became the most heavily internet-taxed region of the world. =European Union= In March 2018 European Commission proposed new rules for digital taxation, including interim tax, with long-term solution that profits should be registered and taxed where businesses have significant interaction with users through digital channels. In March 2019 the proposal was refused by European Council, being blocked by Ireland, Sweden and Denmark. However multiple Member States proposed national taxes based on the framwork of the proposed interim tax. Czech Republic In November 2019 the Government of the Czech Republic approved digital tax of 7% (not yet approved by the parliament) that will affect web-based services of businesses with an annual global turnover of over ‚Ç¨750 million.Ministerstvo financ√≠ do konce kvƒõtna p≈ôedlo≈æ√≠ n√°vrh podoby digit√°ln√≠ danƒõ..

Public school systems existed only in New England. In the 18th Century, the Puritan emphasis on literacy largely influenced the significantly higher literacy rate (70 percent of men) of the Thirteen Colonies, mainly New England, in comparison to Britain (40 percent of men) and France (29 percent of men)https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/laboreducation/literacy.pdfhttps://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Winter11/literacy.cfm How much education a child received depended on a person's social and family status. Families did most of the educating, and boys were favored. Educational opportunities were much sparser in the rural South. The New England Primer was the first and most popular primer designed to teach reading in the colonies. The Puritans valued education, both for the sake of religious study (they demanded a great deal of Bible reading) and for the sake of citizens who could participate better in town meetings. A 1647 Massachusetts law mandated that every town of 50 or more families support a 'petty' (elementary) school and every town of 100 or more families support a Latin, or grammar, school where a few boys could learn Latin in preparation for college and the ministry or law. In practice, virtually all New England towns made an effort to provide some schooling for their children. Both boys and girls attended the elementary schools, and there they learned to read, write, cipher, and they also learned religion. The first Catholic school for both boys and girls was established by Father Theodore Schneider in 1743 in the town of Goshenhoppen, PA (present day Bally) and is still in operation. In the mid-Atlantic region, private and sectarian schools filled the same niche as the New England common schools.Axtell, 1974 The north, overwhelmingly rural, had few schools of any sort until the Revolutionary era. Wealthy children studied with private tutors; middle-class children might learn to read from literate parents or older siblings; many poor and middle-class white children, as well as virtually all black children, went unschooled. Literacy rates were significantly lower in the South than the north; this remained true until the late nineteenth century.Knight, 1922 A unique exception to this state of Southern education is the Ursuline Academy in New Orleans. This institution, founded in 1727 by the Catholic sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula, was both the oldest, continuously-operating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States. It also holds many American firsts, including the first female pharmacist, first woman to contribute a book of literary merit, first convent, first free school and first retreat center for ladies, and first classes for female African-American slaves, free women of color, and Native Americans.Clark Robenstine, \\"French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century,\\" History of Education Quarterly (1992) 32#2 pp. 193‚Äì211 in JSTOR Secondary schools were rare outside major towns such as Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Charleston. Where they existed, secondary schools generally emphasized Latin grammar, rhetoric, and advanced arithmetic with the goal of preparing boys to enter college. Some secondary schools also taught practical subjects such as accounting, navigation, surveying, and modern languages. Some families sent their children to live and work with other families (often relatives or close friends) as a capstone to their education. Higher education The first colleges, not including pre-collegiate academies, were: *New College in Massachusetts (subsequently Harvard University) (1636) *College of William and Mary in Virginia (1693) *Collegiate School in Connecticut (subsequently Yale University) (1701) *College of New Jersey (subsequently Princeton University) (1746) *King's College in New York (subsequently Columbia University) (1754) *College of Philadelphia (subsequently the University of Pennsylvania) (1755) *College of Rhode Island (subsequently Brown University) (1764) *Queen's College in New Jersey (subsequently Rutgers University) (1766) *Dartmouth College in New Hampshire (1769) Only white males were admitted; some took students as young as 14 or 15, and most had some sort of preparatory academy for those who needed Latin or other basic skills. College faculties were generally very small, typically consisting of the college president (usually a clergyman), perhaps one or two professors, and several tutors, i.e. graduate students who earned their keep by teaching the underclassmen. All students followed the same course of study, which was of three or (more commonly) four years' duration. Collegiate studies focused on ancient languages, ancient history, theology, and mathematics. In the 18th century, science (especially astronomy and physics) and modern history and politics assumed a larger (but still modest) place in the college curriculum. Until the mid-18th century, the overwhelming majority of American college graduates became Protestant clergymen. Towards the end of the colonial period, law became another popular career choice for college graduates.David W. Robson, Educating Republicans: The College in the Era of the American Revolution, 1750‚Äì1800 (1985). Vocational education Although few youth of the colonial era had access to secondary or higher education, many benefited from various types of vocational education, especially apprenticeship. Both boys and girls were apprenticed for varying terms (up to fifteen years in the case of young orphans). Apprentices were typically taught a trade (if male) or sewing and household management (if female) as well as reading and basic religious knowledge. Of course, many children learned job skills from their parents or employers without embarking on a formal apprenticeship. Notes Further reading *Axtell, James.

Early life  Kennedy was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to an African-American family. Her father Wiley Kennedy was a Pullman porter, and later had a taxi business. The second of her parents' five daughters, she had a happy childhood, full of support from her parents, despite experiencing poverty in the Great Depression and racism in her mostly white neighborhood. Kennedy remembered a time when her father had to be armed with a shotgun in order to ward off the strong neighborhood Ku Klux Klan presence that was trying to drive her family out.\\"Florynce R.

Kennedy, Esq.\\", \\"Ms.blog\\" on the Ms. Magazine website (August 19, 2011). Accessed June 15, 2012. Kennedy graduated at the top of her class at Lincoln High School, after which she worked many jobs including owning a hat shop and operating elevators. After the death of her mother Zella in 1942, Kennedy left Missouri for New York City, moving to an apartment in Harlem with her sister Grayce. Of the move to New York she commented, \\"I really didn't come here to go to school, but the schools were here, so I went.\\" In 1944 she began classes at Columbia University School of General Studies, majoring in pre-law and graduated in 1949. However, when she applied to the university's law school, she was refused admission. In her autobiography Kennedy wrote, > The Associate Dean, Willis Reese, told me I had been rejected not because I > was a Black but because I was a woman. So I wrote him a letter saying that > whatever the reason was, it felt the same to me, and some of my more cynical > friends thought I had been discriminated against because I was > Black.Kennedy, Florynce R. Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times, > Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1976. Kennedy met with the dean and threatened to sue the school. They admitted her. She was the only black person among eight women in her class. In a 1946 sociology class at Columbia University Kennedy wrote a paper that analogized the discourses of race and sex. \\"Kennedy hoped that comparing 'women' and 'Negroes' would hasten the formation of alliances\\".Mayeri, Serena (2011), Reasoning from Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution, Harvard University Press, p. 9.  Career and acting  Kennedy graduated from Columbia Law School in 1951. By 1954, she had opened her own office, doing matrimonial work, and some assigned criminal cases. She was a member of the Young Democrats. In 1956, she formed a legal partnership with the lawyer who had represented Billie Holiday in regards to drug charges. Kennedy then came to represent Holiday's estate, and also that of Charlie Parker. Kennedy acted in the films The Landlord (1970, adapted from Kristin Hunter's 1966 novel), in which she played \\"Enid\\", and the independent political drama Born In Flames (1983, directed by Lizzie Borden), in which she played \\"Zella\\".\\"Florynce Kennedy (1916‚Äì2000)\\", IMDb.

In 1997, Kennedy received a Lifetime Courageous Activist Award, and the following year was honored by Columbia University with their Owl Award for outstanding graduates. In 1999 the City University of New York awarded her the Century Award.  Activism  Kennedy used Intersectionality as her approach to activism. Sherie Randolph, in her book Florynce \\"Flo\\" Kennedy: The Life of a Radical Black Feminist, quotes Flo saying: \\"My main message is that we have a pathologically, institutionally racist, sexist, classist society. And that niggerizing techniques that are used don't only damage black people, but they also damage women, gay people, ex-prison inmates, prostitutes, children, old people, handicapped people, native Americans.

Florynce \\"Flo\\" Kennedy: The Life of a Black Feminist Radical, USA: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 1, 157, 158. Kennedy kept revisiting the same aim: \\"urging women to examine the sources of their oppression.

Another trademark in public appearances were false eyelashes, which she referred to as her \\"Daffy Duck\\" lashes, and which she used to great effect. Kennedy had a summer home on Fire Island, and was a popular fixture on the social scene there, entertaining many activists whom she invited to visit her. Kennedy held regular salons in her apartment on East 48th Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. She would preside over networking and facilitate people meeting each other, sharing ideas, and was always coming up with projects. She would give tours of her apartment, directing guests to the \\"filthy room\\" and the \\"dirty room\\". = Early activism = Her activism began early.

Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 151. ‚ÄúKennedy recalled being arrested for the first time in 1965 when she attempted to reach her home on East 48th Street and police refused to believe she lived in the neighborhood. From that point on, she focused her attention on combatting racism and discrimination.\\"Kennedy, Florynce. Papers of Florynce Kennedy, 1915-2004 (inclusive), 1947-1993 (bulk) . Schlesinger Library: Kennedy, 2004. She worked as an activist for feminism and civil rights, and the cases she took on increasingly tended to be related to these causes. She was close friends with fellow Columbia law graduate Morton Birnbaum MD, whose concept of sanism she influenced during the 1960s.Burnbaum, Rebecca. \\"My Father's Advocacy for a Right to Treatment\\", Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law 38:1:115‚Äì123 (March 2010). Kennedy established the Media Workshop in 1966, \\"[using] these sessions to discuss strategies for challenging the media and to stress the importance of sharing tactical information across movement lines.\\"Randolph, Sherie (2009), Want to Start a Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle, New York University Press, p. 231. . She and others would picket and lobby the media over their representation of Black people. She stated that she would lead boycotts of major advertisers if they did not feature black people in their ads. She attended all three Black Power conferences and represented H. Rap Brown, Assata Shakur and the Black Panthers. Kennedy also represented prominent radical feminist Valerie Solanas, who was on trial for the 1968 attempted murder of Andy Warhol. Kennedy played a significant role in formulating the Miss America protest of 1968. The Miss America protest was used as a tool to demonstrate the \\"exploitation of women\\". Randolph noted in her book, Florynce \\"Flo\\" Kennedy: The Life of a Black Feminist Radical, that the responsibility lay with Kennedy to recruit other black feminists to this protest. During the protest multiple women were arrested and Kennedy took on their cases as their attorney. In the 1970s Kennedy traveled the lecture circuit with writer Gloria Steinem. If a man asked the pair if they were lesbians - a stereotype of feminists at the time - Kennedy would quote Ti-Grace Atkinson and answer, \\"Are you my alternative?\\"Martin, Douglas, \\"Flo Kennedy, Feminist, Civil Rights Advocate and Flamboyant Gadfly, Is Dead at 84\\", The New York Times, December 23, 2000. She was an early member of the National Organization for Women, but left them in 1970, dissatisfied with their approach to change. In 1971 she founded the Feminist Party, which nominated Shirley Chisholm for president. She also helped found the National Women's Political Caucus. Beginning in 1972 she served on the Advisory Board of the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective, a New York City theatre group that produced plays on feminist issues. Kennedy's \\"position on the role of black feminists was diplomatic without being evasive.\\" Kennedy supported abortion rights and co-authored the book Abortion Rap with Diane Schulder. The phrase \\"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament\\" is sometimes attributed to Kennedy, although Gloria Steinem attributed it to \\"an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston\\" whom she said she and Kennedy met.Bardi, Jennifer. \\"The Humanist Interview with Gloria Steinem\\", The Humanist (September‚ÄìOctober 2012). In 1972, Kennedy filed tax evasion charges with the Internal Revenue Service against the Catholic Church, saying that their campaign against abortion rights violated the separation of church and state. Sherie Randolph outlines in her article \\"Not to Rely Completely on the Courts\\" that Kennedy was one of the lawyers in the Abramowicz v. Lefkowitz case, the class action suit that wanted to repeal New York's strict abortion laws.Randolph, Sherie (2015). \\"Not to Rely Completely on the Courts: Florynce 'Flo' Kennedy and Black Feminist Leadership in the Reproductive Rights Battle, 1969‚Äì1971\\". Journal of Women's History: p. 137. Randolph stated: \\"This case was one of the first to use women who suffered from illegal abortions as expert witnesses instead of relying on physicians.\\" \\"These tactics were eventually used in the Roe v. Wade case, in 1973, which overturned restrictive abortion laws.\\" Kennedy was a lawyer for the Women's Health Collective and 350 plaintiffs in a similar lawsuit about abortion in New York.Price, Kimala (2010), \\"What is Reproductive Justice? How Women of Color Activists Are Redefining The Pro-Choice Paradigm\\", Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism, p. 45. = Later activism = After the 1971 rebellion at Attica Prison in New York State arose as a result of human rights abuse, the issue of solidarity arose between the black power movement and the feminist movement, often forcing activists to choose between the two. Kennedy addressed the discord that feminists had against those who supported both the black power movement and feminism by saying: \\"We do not support Attica. We ARE Attica. We are Attica or we are nothing.\\"Thompson, Becky (July 1, 2002). \\"Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism\\", Feminist Studies 28 (2): 337‚Äì360. doi:10.2307/3178747. In 1973 Kennedy co- founded with Margaret Sloan-Hunter the National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO), which also dealt with race and gender issues such as reproductive rights and sterilization campaigns that were aimed at specific races. In 1973, to protest the lack of female bathrooms at Harvard University, women poured jars of fake urine on the steps of the University's Lowell Hall, a protest Kennedy thought of and participated in. When asked about this, she said: > I'm just a loud-mouthed middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and > three feet of intestines missing and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe > you do too, but I never stop to wonder why I'm not like other people. The > mystery to me is why more people aren't like me. In 1974, People magazine wrote that she was \\"The biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground.\\"Patricia Burstein, \\"Lawyer Flo Kennedy Enjoys Her Reputation as Radicalism's Rudest Mouth\\", People, April 14, 1975, Vol. 3, No. 14. In 1977, Kennedy became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. A strong opponent of military and interventionist wars, especially the Vietnam War, Kennedy coined the term \\"Pentagonorrhea\\".  Personal life  In 1946, Kennedy wrote a monograph called \\"The Case Against Marriage\\", which she later summarized in her autobiography: > ...the idea being that marriage is a crock. Why should you lock yourself in > the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day?Kennedy, F. > (1976), \\"Just a Middle-Aged Colored Lady\\", in Color Me Flo, p. 2. In 1957 Kennedy married science fiction author Charles Dye (author), who was previously married to fellow science fiction author Katherine MacLean. Dye suffered from alcoholism and died circa 1960, in his mid-30s. Kennedy never remarried or had children. In 1986 on her 70th birthday, Kennedy had a birthday gala at the New York City Playboy Club, sponsored by Christie Hefner‚Äîdaughter of Hugh Hefner and former CEO of Playboy Enterprises.\\"ABOUT FLORYNCE 'FLO' KENNEDY\\". Retrieved November 21, 2015. Kennedy contributed the piece \\"Institutionalized oppression vs. the female\\" to the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. In 1976, Kennedy wrote an autobiography, Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall), in which she wrote about her life and career. She also collaborated with William Francis Pepper on the book Sex Discrimination in Employment: An Analysis and Guide for Practitioner and Student. She died on December 21, 2000, at her home in New York, aged 84. Kennedy was an atheist who was once noted as saying: \\"It's interesting to speculate how it developed that in two of the most anti-feminist institutions, the church and the law court, the men are wearing the dresses\\".  In popular culture  Kennedy was featured twice in 2020 biopics of other women. In ‚ÄúMrs. America‚Äù, an FX limited series about Phyllis Schlafly, Niecy Nash portrayed her, while in the 2020 Gloria Steinem biopic The Glorias, she was played by Lorraine Toussaint.

It is commonly found growing in rainforest in the North, South, Stewart and Chatham Islands and normally flowers in summer and early autumn. Description Dendrobium cunninghamii is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid herb that forms tufts up wide with wiry, cane-like stems up to long and in diameter. The rhizomes are similar to the stems and produce many roots. The leaves are narrow linear, long and about wide. Up to eight flowers white are borne on a short lateral flowering stem. The petals and sepals are white but some parts of the labellum are rose pink, purplish and green. The labellum has three lobes. The side lobe are erect, relatively small and pink or purple and the middle lobe has four or five greenish or yellowish ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from December to January. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium cunninghamii was first formally discovered in 1835 by John Lindley and the description was published in Edwards's Botanical Register. The specific epithet (cunninghamii) honours Allan Cunningham. David Jones, Mark Clements and Brian Molloy proposed changing the name of this species to Winika cunninghamii but the change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. :::\\"Winika is the accepted old MƒÅori language name for this orchid. The name Te Winika was given to the sacred war canoe of the Tainui people because this orchid grew on the t≈çtara tree (Podocarpus totara) which was hollowed out to form the hull.(Moore & Irwin, 1978) We assign the feminine gender to itWinika cunninghamii. The MƒÅori Queen, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, granted consent to use the name Winika, because of its particular cultural significance to her Tainui people.\\" Clements MA, Jones DL, Molloy BPJ. 1997.

The mosque is built in Turkish-style architecture, with a windowed mid-dome with birch wood panel and hand-painted tiles that cover the walls of the prayer room. The mosque minaret is 32.5 meters high. In the central prayer room, the women have their place of prayer on a 200 square meter high stand. The mosque also houses the residence of the imam of the assembly. In February 2013, the Botkyrka Islamic Cultural Association filed an application to the police to begin broadcasting the prayer calls from the Fittja Mosque. Since this is about repeated audio broadcast in public places, the case was with the police. According to the Islamic Society in Botkyrka, their request was for a short prayer call of 2-3 minutes, once a week, not five times a day as normal in Muslim-majority countries. In April 2013, the police authority issued a time-limited license, which was valid until March 20, 2014. The conditions for the permit were that the speakers, placed at the height of the balcony on the outside of the minaret, were to be directed only to three weather lines and that the noise level did not exceed 60 decibels. On April 26, 2013 at 12:57, it was the first time in Sweden that a prayer call from a minaret could be heard.

It is located in J√§gersro villastad, a neighbourhood in Husie, Malm√∂. It was inaugurated on 20 April 1984 and is administered by the organization Islamic Center. Adjacent to the mosque is a charter school, which is also run by the Islamic Center. There have been several attacks against the mosque, including an arson attack on 28 April 2003, which damaged the mosque and totally destroyed other buildings at the Islamic Center. History The idea of building a mosque in Malm√∂ arouse already in the beginning in the 1960s but the zoning for the construction started in the late 1970s. The construction started in April 1983. The initiator of the project was Bejzat Becirov, who led the Islamic Center and its mosque until he died in November 2018 at the age of 80. Malm√∂ Municipality was helpful by sparing a big plot of land of 32,000 square metres. After some standard procedures such as archaeological excavations, the construction started in April 1983. The mosque was inaugurated on 20 April 1984 and the first Friday prayers were held that day. Attacks There have been several attacks against the mosque. One of them, an arson attack in 2003, damaged the mosque and totally destroyed other buildings at the Islamic Center. The restoration cost was 17 million Swedish kronor. There were two smaller arson attacks in 2005 and the last of them cost 1 million Swedish kronor. No one was arrested for the attacks in 2003 and 2005. Between then (October 2005) and the reopening in 2004, there were at least 20 other cases of sabotage. The serial shooter Peter Mangs, who were responsible for the 2009‚Äì10 Malm√∂ shootings, was convicted for attempted murder on an imam in the mosque on 31 December 2009. He fired several shots against a window but missed his target, though the imam got hit by broken glass. Capacity and community size The mosque and the school The mosque is well-attended, both by Muslims from Scania and Copenhagen, Denmark. Due to the increasing muslim population in Malm√∂ in the 80s, a decision was made to expand the mosque. Today, the mosque is too small to satisfy the needs of the Muslim community in the city and region, which according to the Islamic Center stand at 45,000 and 100,000, respectively. Around 1,000 individuals attend the Friday prayers, and the mosque accommodates over 70,000 visitors per year. There are over 130 languages spoken among the members of the organization. School The charter school is called √ñg√•rdsskolan and was opened in 2000. It follows the Swedish curriculum but has an Islamic orientation. It is open for everyone.

Tod was one of three main regular characters on the program, and the only one to appear in all 116 episodes of the show's four seasons. Character history Tod was born March 12, 1936, in New York City at 4:30 AM, and raised in Rye (although he gives his birthplace as Connecticut on at least one occasion; his driver's license states that his hometown is Rye, New York), the son of Lee and Martha Stiles. His father was the owner of a shipping company in New York City. In 1960, shortly after Tod's graduation from Yale University, the elder Stiles suffered a series of business misfortunes that left him bankrupt. He then died of a coronary thrombosis, leaving Tod an inheritance consisting of little more than a brand new convertible Chevrolet Corvette. With his future now in his own hands, Tod and his best friend Buz Murdock (George Maharis), an ex-gang member whom Tod's father had taken under his wing, decided to hit the road in the new car, traveling across America to seek their fortune in a variety of different jobs. After more than two years of adventuring on the road, Buz became seriously ill and was unable to travel with Tod any longer. Tod traveled by himself for a while, and then while working in Houston he encountered ex-Army Ranger and P.O.W. Lincoln Case (Glenn Corbett), who had just returned from a stint in Vietnam. Although circumstances of their first meeting initially drew Tod and Linc into conflict (including a fistfight), the two soon became fast friends and Linc became his new traveling partner. After a year or so more of hopping around the country with Linc, Tod met Margo Tiffin (played by Barbara Eden), whose father Alexander had previously known Tod, in Tampa (where the episode was filmed). Mr. Tiffin had been so enamored of Tod that he left a stipulation in his will that required his daughter to marry him. Despite the forced circumstances of the relationship, Tod and Margo did indeed end up actually falling in love with each other and were married. After having to spend some time fending off the efforts of unscrupulous family members to claim Margo's father's fortune, Tod and his new bride determined to settle down, ending both Tod's nomadic lifestyle and the series. This occurred during the two-part series finale of Route 66, both episodes of which aired in March 1964. Personality Traits The boyish-faced Tod usually presents a glib, affable, extroverted front which lightly masks a deeply thoughtful, introspective nature. At heart, he is a serious and analytical personality type with a strong moral code of ethics. Although primarily a pacifist, when the occasion calls for it he demonstrates himself just as able in fisticuffs as his more streetwise companion Buz. Throughout the series Tod shows an interest in racing sports of all kinds, and in one episode even modifies the Corvette to become a race car. He is also a licensed pilot. His eventual marriage to Margo Tiffin, while it seems the result of a hurried and circumstantially forced romance, is actually very much in keeping with the tendency Tod displayed over the course of the series to fall quick and hard for whichever young female happened to be handy. In fact, on at least two previous occasions during the course of his adventures, Tod very nearly married women whom he had only briefly known.

It is part of the Southern Illinois University system, which includes a campus in Edwardsville as well as the flagship in Carbondale. The medical school was founded in 1970 and achieved full accreditation in 1972. It was founded to relieve a chronic shortage of physicians in downstate Illinois. Notability SIU was once the only medical school in Illinois with its main campus outside of Chicago or its suburbs until the Carle Illinois College of Medicine was formed in 2018 (although the University of Illinois at Chicago does maintain satellites in Peoria and Rockford). SIU was early to incorporate problem-based learning (PBL) into their curricula (see below) and \\"standardized patients\\" for medical student testing purposes. Being able to interact with standardized patients now comprises the majority of one of the four major exams that all US allopathic medical students must pass (the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills). SIU students begin care of patients in a clinical setting within the first two weeks of classes. By the end of their first trimester, they are tested on their ability to obtain medical histories from, examine, and diagnose the diseases simulated by standardized patients. Such education measures and SIU's large primary care faculty led US News and World Report to rank SIU in the top 10 medical schools in the country for primary care in the early 1990s.U.S. News & World Report; 3/18/96, Vol. 120 Issue 11, p96 However, for the 2021 US News and World Report rankings, SIU was Unranked in both Primary Care and Research. SIU students also receive in depth training in medicolegal issues thanks to the medical school's close relationship with the Southern Illinois University School of Law and the retention of attorneys on its Springfield faculty in the Department of Medical Humanities. In 2013, SIU School of Medicine was the only medical school in the world to receive three international ASPIRE awards for medical education from the International Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE). In 2015, the School of Medicine received its second consecutive LCME accreditation with no findings of concern ‚Äì a rare achievement among medical schools. In 2016, Dr. Jerry Kruse began serving as the dean and provost, only the fourth dean in the medical school's 45-year history. Curriculum The School of Medicine offers the following degree programs: medical, MD/MPH, MD/JD, doctoral, master's, and physician assistant studies. The School of Medicine has more than 300 full- time faculty members as well as more than 900 part-time and volunteer faculty members. Medical students spend the first year at the main campus of Southern Illinois University in Carbondale before moving to Springfield. Physician assistant students learn during their first year at the Carbondale campus. SIU-Med employs problem-based learning, which involves using small groups of students, along with a faculty mentor. The students are presented with a clinical scenario and must approach it as if they were trying to diagnose and treat a real patient. Each clinical scenario is accessed on a secure website that provides information about the patient. When the students face basic science and clinical problems that they do not know, they incorporate these issues into a list and divide the list amongst themselves for self-directed learning. At their next faculty-supervised meeting, the students teach each other what they have learned, with input also provided on the topics by the faculty member. Each case also has set learning issues, so that all students in all the small groups within the class learn the objectives planned by the faculty in both basic and clinical science for that particular case. Each case is designed to be completed over three meetings lasting around 9 hours in total. This style of learning is also used with traditional lectures and laboratory sessions over the first two years of medical school. Simulated patients and nurse educators are also used to assist with learning clinical skills. Since it is more interactive, these methods promote better problem- solving skills useful in real life situations than traditional lecture-based learning. Nearly every medical school in the U.S. uses the problem-based learning model. Patient care Training programs in Springfield are supported primarily by the city's two large tertiary care hospitals ‚Äì Memorial Medical Center (507 beds) and HSHS St. John's Hospital (431 beds). Combined, these hospitals have more than 45,000 admissions and more than 123,000 emergency room visits annually. Services include the only Level 1 trauma center in the area between Peoria and St. Louis and a regional burn center. SIU has additional affiliations with hospitals in Quincy, Decatur and Carbondale. Outreach clinics go to 100 sites in 46 communities. SIU partners with many hospitals and addition clinics in other communities in central and southern Illinois. To complement the hospital-based setting, SIU HealthCare, the ambulatory clinics of SIU School of Medicine, employ nearly 300 full-time physicians who supervise more than 477,000 clinic visits per year in our primary and specialty care clinics as well as approximately 145,000 hospital visits. The patient base of the Springfield region includes more than 500,000 people in at least 10 counties. The Simmons Cancer Institute at SIU has dedicated clinics for patients with breast, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, hematologic, skin, pediatric, prostate, and lung cancer. Research Research at SIU School of Medicine, as of 2016, consists of numerous projects underway in 100-plus laboratories. Notable areas of research include hearing loss, including tinnitus, noise-induced and age-related hearing loss, Alzheimer's Disease and aging. One of the other leading areas of research at SIU is in oncology, with the Simmons Cancer Institute at SIU being the largest oncology facility in Illinois outside of Chicago. Ongoing research includes projects on basic molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis, identifying molecular biomarkers for early detection of cancer, developing an effective vaccine against herpes simplex and identifying targets for molecular level cancer treatment. The Springfield Combined Laboratory Facility is a five-story building, and an additional facility that houses immunology and virology laboratories and a biomedical research imaging suite. The Springfield and Carbondale campuses have multiple other medical research buildings. For the 2021 US News and World Report rankings, SIU was Unranked in Research. =HSV Vaccine Controversy= A Herpes Simplex Virus vaccine developed at SIU School of Medicine came to be at the center of a 2017 controversy over human trials. Clinical trials were conducted without institutional review board oversight and approval, and in apparent violation of SIU and federal rules for medical research. The findings were rejected from peer-review academic publication for both scientific and ethical deficiencies. Investigations were later launched by the St. Kitts and Nevis Ministry of Health and Social Services, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and SIU's institutional review board. Residency programs SIU School of Medicine offers 21 residency programs in dermatology, emergency medicine, family medicine (5 programs at 5 sites), general surgery, internal medicine, medicine/psychiatry, neurology, neurological surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics and rehabilitation, otolaryngology, pediatrics, plastic and reconstructive surgery, psychiatry, radiology, urology and vascular surgery. It has fellowships in adult reconstructive surgery, cardiology, child and adolescent psychiatry, colon and rectal surgery, endocrinology hand surgery, hematology/oncology, infectious diseases, pulmonary critical care, and sports medicine. Library and budget The SIU School of Medicine Medical Library houses more than 108,000 volumes, 3,300 print and electronic periodicals, 3,900 audiovisual programs, and a collection of historical medical documents. SIU's total annual budget is approximately $159 million; $10.8 million is from state appropriations.

The concert hall and the DR Town are located in the northern part of √òrestad ‚Äì an ambitious development area in Copenhagen, Denmark. The concert complex consists of four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It is the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra. With a total surface of 25,000 m¬≤, the concert hall complex designed by Jean Nouvel includes a concert hall of 1800 people and three recording studios with variable acoustics. The scenography of the concert hall and three recording studios was designed with dUCKS sc√©no. The acoustic studies were realized by Nagata Acoustics.http://www.jeannouvel.com/en/desktop/home/#/en/desktop/projet/copenhagen- denmark-concert-house-danish-radio1 The construction, begun in February, 2003, was finished in January, 2009. The Queen of Denmark inaugurated the venue on January 17, 2009. The architect Interior Pritzker Prize winner Jean Nouvel is the architect of the project. The structure can be likened to a meteor covered by big blue screens, supposed to resemble water, that can be used to project visual content on. Nouvel says on the project : > \\"Building in emerging neighborhoods is a risk that has often proved fatal in > recent years.

As of 2007 it had reached almost 300 million dollars making Koncerthuset the most expensive concert hall ever built at the time. The former record holder for cost had been the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles at 274 million dollars. The current record holder is the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg at 836 million dollars. The Danish government has refused to grant extra funds for the buildings so, the budget expansion has meant drastic cutbacks in DR staff and funding. Various The project has been a front-page feature in respected El Croquis magazine N.112/113. Construction commenced in February 2003. The official opening was celebrated on January 17, 2009, making the total time of construction just a little under 6 years. The concert hall contains a pipe organ with 91 voices, 118 ranks, and approx. 6000 pipes, built by Dutch organ builders J. L. van den Heuvel.

The battle is considered to be \\"the first decisive conflict of Islam on the deep\\"Ridpath, John Clark. Ridpath's Universal History, Merrill & Baker, Vol. 12, New York, p. 483. as well as part of the earliest campaign by Muawiyah to conquer Constantinople. Dating Al-Tabari records two possible dates for this naval battle: 651-2 (A.H. 31) on the authority of al-Waqidi and 654-5 (A.H. 34) on the authority of Abu Ma'shar al-Sindi. The chronicles of the Armenian Sebeos and Byzantine Theophanes concur with the latter date. Background In the 650s the Arab Caliphate finished off the Sasanian Empire and continued its successful expansion into the Byzantine Empire's territories. In 645, Abdallah ibn Sa'd was made Governor of Egypt by his foster brother Rashidun Caliph Uthman, replacing the semi-independent 'Amr ibn al-'As. Uthman permitted Muawiyah to raid the island of Cyprus in 649 and the success of that campaign set the stage for the undertaking of naval activities by the Government of Egypt. Abdallah ibn Sa'd built a strong navy and proved to be a skilled naval commander. Under him the Muslim navy won a number of naval victories including repulsing a Byzantine counter-attack on Alexandria in 646.Carl F. Petry (ed.), The Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume One, Islamic Egypt 640‚Äì1517, Cambridge University Press, 1998, 67. In 654, Muawiyah undertook an expedition in Cappadocia while his fleet, under the command of Abu'l-Awar, advanced along the southern coast of Anatolia. Emperor Constans embarked against it with a large fleet. Battle The two forces met off the coast of Mount Phoenix in Lycia,Probably Mount Olympos south of Antalya, see \\"Olympus Phoinikous Mons\\" in Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, map 65, D4. near the harbour of Phoenix (modern Finike). According to the 9th century chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, as the Emperor was preparing for battle, on the previous night he dreamed that he was in Thessalonica; awaking he related the dream to an interpreter of dreams who said: Emperor, would that you had not slept nor seen that dream for your presence in Thessalonica ‚Äì according to the interpreter, victory inclined to the Emperor's foes.Theophanes the Confessor, Chronographia, in J.P. Migne, Patrologia Graeca, vol.108, col.705Thessalonike can be read as ¬´Œ∏·Ω≤œÇ ·ºÑŒªŒª·ø≥ ŒΩ·Ω∂Œ∫Œ∑ŒΩ¬ª, i.e., ¬´give victory to another¬ª. See Bury, John Bagnell (1889), A history of the later Roman empire from Arcadius to Irene, Adamant Media Corporation, 2005, p.290. The interpreter interpreted the dream this way because ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ (\\"Thessaloniki\\") sounds similar to the words (), which mean 'give victory to another'. Due to the rough seas, Tabari describes the Byzantine and Arab ships being arranged in lines and lashed together, to allow for melee combat. The Arabs were victorious in battle, although losses were heavy for both sides, and Constans barely escaped to Constantinople. According to Theophanes, he managed to make his escape by exchanging uniforms with one of his officers.  Siege of Constantinople of 654  Following their defeat, the respite the Byzantines were granted is typically ascribed to the Arab fleet retreating after its victory and conflict over the authority of Uthman among the crew, the first stirrings of a civil war among the Muslims. No further naval attacks on this expedition are recorded in traditional Arabic sources. However the Armenian historian Sebeos records that the Arab fleet continued on beyond the battle at Phoenix to attempt a siege of Constantinople. The siege was unsuccessful, however, due to a fierce storm that sunk the ships with war machines aboard, an event the Byzantines attributed to divine intervention. The land force led by Muawiyah in Chalcedon, having lost their artillery and siege engines, returned to Syria thereafter. Muslim sources do not mention this event but it corresponds to notices in other Christian histories of the eastern Mediterranean, such as the chronicle of Theophanes. It suggests the early 650s invasions of Rhodes, Cyprus, and Asia Minor were preparatory to a full-scale assault on the walls of Byzantium. Also it provides a strategic explanation for the Arab fleet's retreat following the victory in the Battle of the Masts, since the First Fitna would not break out until a year later, perhaps influenced by setbacks against the Byzantines and in the Caucasus. Aftermath The Battle of the Masts was a significant milestone in the history of the Mediterranean, Islam and the Byzantine Empire, as it established the superiority of the Muslims at sea as well as on land. For the next four centuries, the Mediterranean would be a battleground between Byzantines and Muslims.

He served as the head football coach the University of Denver from 1929 to 1931, at the University of San Francisco in 1941, and at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1942 to 1950, compiling a career college football record of 74‚Äì43‚Äì9. In nine seasons under Cravath, the USC Trojans football team compiled a 54‚Äì28‚Äì8 record, won four Pacific Coast Conference titles, and made four appearances in the Rose Bowl Game. Cravath introduced the T formation to the USC program. Early life Cravath was born in Breckenridge, Colorado. His mother died in childbirth and his father died when he was six. Cravath was raised by his maternal grandparents, Augustus and Kate Cravath, of Santa Ana, California, as well as his uncle, Major League Baseball outfielder Gavvy Cravath, and grandparents in Kansas. Jeff was a nickname given to him when he was very young as he was a \\"fighter\\" like James J. Jeffries. He was called \\"little Jeffries\\". Playing career Cravath graduated from Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California, and entered the University of Southern California, starring as a center on the football team from 1924 to 1926. Among his teammates were John Wayne and Ward Bond. Cravath also became a Sigma Chi member at USC. In his senior year, in which he was team captain, USC began its intersectional rivalry with Notre Dame. The team finished 8‚Äì2, with losses to Stanford and Notre Dame both coming by 13‚Äì12 scores. All-American teammate Jesse Hibbs later noted, \\"I played with Jeff the year we opened the series against Notre Dame. He should have been made All-America center. That year the Notre Dame center [Bud Boeringer] made the team and Jeff completely outplayed him. He was a champ on and off the field.\\" Cravath went on to play in the January 1927 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. Coaching career Cravath c. 1945 Cravath served as an assistant coach under Howard Jones in 1927 and 1928. The 1928 team won a national championship. Cravath next became the head coach at the University of Denver from 1929 to 1931, with a record of 11‚Äì9‚Äì1, and then served one year as an assistant at Chaffey College. He returned to USC as an assistant coach from 1933 to 1940, including the 1939 national championship team on which he was the line coach, and was head coach at the University of San Francisco for one year in 1941, with a record of 6‚Äì4. Jones died in July 1941, with assistant Sam Barry taking over the USC team for that season; but when World War II began and Barry entered the Navy, he recommended Cravath for the position on a permanent basis; ;Barry returned as an assistant from 1945 to 1950. The new coach, rejected for military service due to poor eyesight, became the first USC alumnus to lead the program. In nine seasons Cravath led USC to the Rose Bowl four times, after the 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1947 campaigns. The Trojans defeated Washington, 29‚Äì0, in the 1944 Rose Bowl and Tennessee, 25‚Äì0, in the 1945 game, but lost to Alabama in 1946 and to Michigan in 1948‚ÄîUSC's first losses in the Rose Bowl after eight victories. Known for their excellent defense, Cravath's 1943 team began the year with six consecutive shutouts, and his undefeated 1944 team ended the season ranked seventh in the nation. After the 1945 season, Cravath was offered a five-year contract by Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall, and he told acquaintances he was going to accept, but he ultimately changed his mind and signed a five-year extension with USC. He signed another four-year extension in August 1949. Cravath's players at USC included Ralph Heywood, Jim Hardy, John Ferraro, Paul Cleary, and Frank Gifford. His later teams showed a sharp decline in performance from those of the war years. USC was 11‚Äì11‚Äì4 from the third game of 1948 through 1950. His final game was a 9‚Äì7 victory over Notre Dame, his first win in six tries against USC's major rival, and also USC's 300th victory all-time. Although he had a record of 8‚Äì3‚Äì1 against crosstown rival UCLA. The three losses were the first for USC in the series, including a 39‚Äì0 defeat in the second to last game of 1950. Cravath was also criticized for losing his last three games against California, each by six points. He was forced to resign when the 1950 season ended with a 2‚Äì5‚Äì2 mark after beginning the year ranked 12th in the nation. He was succeeded by former USC player Jess Hill, who was an assistant under Cravath from 1946 to 1948. After football Following his coaching career, Cravath became a racing official at Santa Anita Park for two winters before moving to El Centro, California, and becoming a rancher. He also served as a technical advisor on the 1953 football film Trouble Along the Way, starring his old teammate John Wayne. Cravath died in Calexico, California, at the age of 50, one day after suffering numerous injuries when his pickup truck collided with a dump truck; he underwent an emergency tracheotomy but never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Colegrove (1907‚Äì2010), and their two daughters, Anne (born 1930) and Carol (born 1933). Sportswriter Braven Dyer noted, \\"For a man who was orphaned early in life, he grew out of rough surroundings to a point where he seemed always to know the right thing to say in public. I have known Cravath for something like 30 years. In many ways there was no better sport in the football coaching ranks than Cravath.\\" Jim Hardy said, \\"I would go to Cravath for advice where I would not even have gone to my family. He was a friend of all his players and a good coach. He was subjected to unreasonable pressure in his last year at SC, but he never lost his interest in the game and his deep attachment to the men who played for him.\\" Cravath was a 2005 inductee to the USC Athletic Hall of Fame.

On December 7, 1983, Newman was included in a large, three-team trade that saw the Expos send him to the San Diego Padres and starting pitcher Scott Sanderson to the Chicago Cubs. To round out the trade, the Padres sent Gary Lucas to the Expos while the Cubs sent Carmelo Martinez, Craig Lefferts, and Fritzie Connally to the Padres. Newman started the 1984 season back at the AA level, playing for the Beaumont Golden Gators in the Texas League, before being traded back to the Expos on July 20, 1984, for starting pitcher Greg Harris. Newman spent the rest of the 1984 season and much of 1985 season with the Expos' new AAA team, the Indianapolis Indians. Major Leagues (1985‚Äì1992) Primarily a second baseman, Newman also played shortstop, third base and left field at some point in his career. He made his major league debut on 14 June 1985 when he was brought in as a pinch runner and scored a run.New York Mets vs Montreal Expos - June 14, 1985 Box Score Newman was used sparingly by the Expos, playing in 32 games in 1985 and 95 games in 1986. On July 6, 1986, Newman hit his only Major League home run (off Atlanta's Zane Smith), in the same game that the Braves' Bob Horner hit four home runs in one game. Newman ended his career with a staggering 4.000 slugging percentage against Smith as this home run was hit in his only at bat versus the pitcher. Prior to the beginning of the 1987 season, Newman was traded to the Minnesota Twins for career minor league pitcher Mike Shade. Upon first arriving in Minnesota and seeing Kirby Puckett take batting practice, Newman was quoted as saying, \\"He's the eighth wonder of the world!\\" Newman saw much more playing time with the Twins, proving to be a valuable utility player and pinch runner, but had trouble hitting for average in 1987, including a 0‚Äì31 hitless streak.Elias Says Newman was a member of two World Series teams in 1987 and 1991 and had 2 hits, including a triple, and 1 walk and 1 RBI in 8 World Series plate appearances.Al Newman World Series Statistics by Baseball Almanac His most productive season came in 1989 with the Twins, when he posted career-highs in stolen bases (25), hits (113), doubles (18), runs batted in (38), runs (62) and batting average (.253). During the 1989 season, Newman was interviewed along with teammate Gary Gaetti about playing the \\"hot corner\\" (third base) for the Minnesota Twins. Newman recounted an experience playing the position when future Hall of Famer (and future Twin) Dave Winfield came to the plate, \\"Dave Winfield hit one right at me last year. I had no chance to move. I looked and the ball was in my glove. I made like I knew what I was doing.\\" In 1990, Al Newman was a part of setting a major league record as the Twins turned two triple plays in one game against the Boston Red Sox, making the final throw in both. Also during the 1990 season, teammate and future Hall of Famer, Kirby Puckett, was moved around the field from his normal centerfield position to play right field, third base, shortstop, and second base in a single game. Newman jokingly remarked to the press following the game, \\"I'm glad Puck's one of us utility guys now. Maybe he'll raise the salary structure a little.\\" Only weeks after the 1991 World Series victory, Newman was granted free agency by the Twins and was not re- signed. After weighing his options, Newman signed with the Cincinnati Reds on February 2, 1992 but was released on April 1 during the final roster cutdowns. However, Newman was signed just two days later by the Texas Rangers in what would turn out to be his final major league season. In 246 at-bats in 1992, Newman amassed 54 hits, 25 runs, 9 stolen bases, and 34 walks. In an eight- season career, Newman was a .226 hitter with one home run and 156 RBI in 854 games.Al Newman Statistics As his career hitting statistics would indicate, Newman did not exactly excel at the plate and displayed little power. Newman finished with the third-most career at-bats of any player with only one home run since World War II.Opposites attract when Kuiper calls Bonds' 756th In 1992, to commemorate the Twins' World Series victory of the previous year, the team issued a set of playing cards on which Newman was featured on the \\"3 of Clubs\\".Al Newman 1992 US Playing Card Team Set #3C Coach, Manager, and Scout (1992‚Äì2006) Following his playing career, Newman managed the Twins AA team, the New Britain Rock Cats of the Eastern League for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In 1996, his team finished last at 61‚Äì81, but showed improvement in 1997, posting a 70‚Äì72 record and finishing third to last. In the 1997 Arizona Fall League, Newman managed the Sun City Solar Sox finishing second in their division with a 22‚Äì23 record. in 1998, he was the bench coach for the Twins' AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake City Buzz. From 1999 to 2001, Newman was the manager of the Twins' rookie league Gulf Coast League Twins. After a 33‚Äì32 record in 2000, Newman added former 1991 World Series teammate Jarvis Brown to his coaching staff. In 2002, following Twins manager Tom Kelly's retirement, Newman accepted the job of third base coach (formerly occupied by Ron Gardenhire, who was named the new manager). Newman would be the Twins thirdbase coach from 2002 to 2005. In April 2003, Kirby Puckett had fallen out of favor with the public after a Sports Illustrated article chronicled a personal life much different from his public persona. Newman sympathized with his long-time friend, saying, \\"I'm scared to death for him. I'm scared because of his health and about his frame of mind. He's a baseball man and the game that gave him everything  the game that got him out of the Chicago ghetto  is gone from him now. The people who loved him don't love him anymore. He's on an island by himself and he's trying to figure out how to get home.\\" Puckett's fall from grace tough to reconcile During the 2003 season, Newman said of pitcher Jamie Moyer \\"He's like a fine wine, he gets better with age. No, actually, he just gets slower.\\"Moyer deal nothing to Bragg about for Boston On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago during a tight pennant race, Newman took a turn in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits. Shortly after completion, Newman collapsed on the field and was immediately rushed to the hospital. After several tests, it was determined he had suffered a brain hemorrhage. His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, \\"For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down like that, because this is the guy who pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard.\\" While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute.2 Teammates, 2 Coaches, 2 Survivors On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay. By March 4, 2004, Newman had returned to the Twins including being on the field a Grapefruit League pre-season game versus the Cincinnati Reds. During Newman's first weeks in return to the Twins, he experienced issues with high blood pressure and was prescribed medication and relaxation. In 2006, Newman left the Twins and became an advance scout with the Arizona Diamondbacks. On March 12, 2006, Newman, along with former Twins players Kent Hrbek, Torii Hunter, Dave Winfield, and Harmon Killebrew, former manager Tom Kelly, former general manager Andy MacPhail, and longtime Oriole Cal Ripken, Jr., spoke at Kirby Puckett's funeral. Newman and Puckett played together throughout Newman's career with the Twins and were good friends and known as pranksters around the clubhouse.Hrbek, Killebrew, Ripken to honor PuckettSpirited Group After Baseball On January 22, 2008, Newman announced the creation of \\"Newmie Rewards LLC\\", a business created to aid in fund raising for athletic teams.Newmie Rewards LLC On July 27, 2008, Newman began broadcasting \\"The Al Newman Show\\" on radio WWTC AM1280 \\"The Patriot\\" in Minneapolis, MN. The short- lived program was a weekly family-friendly show about sports. Al Newman has long been involved in the youth baseball player development. As noted above, throughout his coaching career, and also by holding off-season clinics for youth sports. In 2010, Newman participated in the opening ceremonies for the Target Field, the new home of the Twins, alongside many other former Twins such as Jim Kaat, Bert Blyleven, and Jack Morris. Today, Newman serves as a field manager for the Saint Cloud Rox in the Northwoods League and is an instructor at Acceleration Baseball in Saint Cloud. There he remains in the game he loves, and gets to instruct young players on a daily basis.

Leadership The first president of Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah was Sheik Kamal Adham, who served from 1965 to 1979. Then Turki Al Faisal served as the president of Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah until 2001. Prince Turki resigned abruptly from his post tens days before the 9/11 attacks in 2001 (in which 14 Saudi nationals hijacked and crashed US commercial airliners) despite having had his appointment extended in May 2001 for another four years. Nawaf bin Abdulaziz replaced Prince Turki on 1 September 2001. The organization was renamed \\"The General Intelligence Presidency\\" during Nawwaf's tenure. Nawwaf was relieved of his duty as the head of GIP by Crown Prince Abdullah on 25 January 2005. For nine months, nobody was appointed to head the presidency. Then, Muqrin bin Abdulaziz was appointed as head of the General Intelligence Presidency by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz in October 2005. Additionally, King Abdullah relieved Prince Saud bin Fahd of his duties as vice president of GIP. Faisal bin Abdullah bin Mohammed was appointed as new vice president of GIP. On 20 July 2012, Prince Bandar bin Sultan was appointed director general of Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah, replacing Muqrin bin Abdulaziz. Another Saudi royal, Prince Abdulaziz bin Bandar, who had been vice head of the directorate, was relieved from his post, and Youssef bin Ali Al Idrisi replaced him as vice head in October 2012. On 15 April 2014, Prince Bandar bin Sultan was removed from his position \\"at his own request\\" according to the announcement in the Saudi state media. It was reported that He would be replaced by his deputy, Youssef bin Ali Al Idrisi. However, Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud became the director general of the Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah on 30 June 2014. His term ended on 29 January 2015 when Khalid bin Ali Al Humaidan replaced him in the post. History The role of intelligence was recognized by King Abdulaziz Al Saud who had used it in his unification of Saudi Arabia. His interest in modern communication increasingly grew when he set up the first radio communications system in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom started the intelligence service in 1955 under the name of Al-Mabahith Al Aammah. During the reign of King Saud bin Abdulaziz, the General Intelligence was separated from the Mabahith (General Investigation Directorate). Intelligence was established as an independent security service with the issuing of the Royal Decree 11 in 1957 that ordered the setting up of a special department under the title of Maslahat Al-Istikhbarat Al-Aammah or (General Intelligence Department). During this period two branches of the Presidency were set up locally, the western branch in Jeddah, and eastern one in Dhahran. The GIP expanded under King Faisal bin Abdulaziz, with the opening of offices abroad. The agency expanded its monitoring of internal threats after the 1979 capture of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The GIP's charter was changed by King Khaled bin Abdulaziz in 1982, by Royal Decree M-5, dated 19 December 1982, which set out its responsibilities, duties, and the limits of its activities. This established the internal organization of the agency with a General Department for Operations, the General Department for Administration and Finance, the General Department for Training and Planning, and the General Department for Technical Affairs. Along with the National Research Center, and the Center for Media and International Communications (previously Center for Translation and Media). In 1997, the Office for External Communications was transferred to the Presidency from the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Its name was also changed to the General Department for External Communications, and it was strengthened with the addition of high-tech equipment and specialists in radio surveillance. This period saw the expansion of the activities of the agency abroad with the establishment and development of more offices in other countries, and through more effort to organize its work. During the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz the Higher Committee for Development was set up and was chaired by the President of the General Intelligence Presidency; its membership consisted of the heads of the various departments of the GIP. Also during the tenure of King Fahd, the administrative structuring of the Information Center was approved. In late January 2013, interior minister Prince Muhammad bin Nayef announced that Saudi women would be allowed to work at the directorate. =Safari Club= The Safari Club was an alliance of intelligence services formed in 1976 that ran covert operations around Africa at a time when the United States Congress had clipped the CIA‚Äôs wings over years of abuses.U.S. Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels, The New York Times, 23 January 2016 Its formal members were Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and France. The group maintained informal connections with the United States. The group executed a successful military intervention in Zaire in response to an invasion from Angola. It also provided arms to Somalia in its 1977‚Äì1978 conflict with Ethiopia. It organized secret diplomacy relating to anti-Communism in Africa, and has been credited with initiating the process resulting in the 1979 Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty. =Soviet Afghan War= The Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War lasted over nine years, from December 1979 to February 1989\\\\. Insurgent groups known collectively as the mujahideen, as well as smaller Maoist groups, fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet Army and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan government, mostly in the rural countryside. The mujahideen groups were backed primarily by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, making it a Cold War proxy war. =Iran Contra affair= =Cargo planes bomb plot= On 29 October 2010, two packages, each containing a bomb consisting of of plastic explosives and a detonating mechanism, were found on separate cargo planes. The bombs were discovered as a result of intelligence received from Saudi Arabia's security chief. They were bound from Yemen to the United States, and were discovered at en route stop- overs, one at East Midlands Airport in the UK and one in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. One week later, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) took responsibility for the plot, and for the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6. American and British authorities believed Anwar al-Awlaki of AQAP was behind the bombing attempts, and that the bombs were most likely constructed by AQAP's main explosives expert, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. The bombs were probably designed to detonate mid-air, with the intention of destroying both planes over Chicago or another city in the U.S. Each bomb had already been transported on passenger and cargo planes at the time of discovery. =Syrian Civil War= Saudi Arabia's involvement in the Syrian War involved the large- scale supply of weapons and ammunition to various rebel groups in Syria during the Syrian Civil War. The Financial Times reported in May 2013 that Qatar was becoming a larger provider of arms to the various groups. In the summer of 2013, Saudi Arabia emerged as the main group financing and arming the rebels.Saudi edges Qatar to control Syrian rebel support retrieved 6 June 2013 Saudi Arabia financed a large purchase of infantry weapons, such as Yugoslav- made recoilless guns and the M79 Osa, an anti-tank weapon, from Croatia via shipments shuttled through Jordan. The weapons began reaching rebels in December 2012 which allowed rebels' small tactical gains against the Syrian army. This shipment was said to be to counter shipments of weapons from Iran to aid the Syrian government. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar have received criticism from the Western Media for backing certain Syrian rebels associated with the Army of Conquest, which includes the al-Nusra front, an al-Qaeda affiliated group. In August 2017, the Syrian opposition was informed by the Saudi foreign minister that the Kingdom was disengaging from them. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia has taken a more conciliatory stance towards the Syrian government. =Timber Sycamore= Timber Sycamore was a classified weapons supply and training program run by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and supported by Arab intelligence services, including the security service in Saudi Arabia. Launched in 2012 or 2013, it supplied money, weaponry and training to rebel forces fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War. According to US officials, the program trained thousands of rebels.

Fibers to be spun are bound to a distaff held in her left hand. Spinning is an ancient textile art in which plant, animal or synthetic fibres are drawn out and twisted together to form yarn. For thousands of years, fibre was spun by hand using simple tools, the spindle and distaff. It was only with the invention of the spinning wheel in the Islamic world circa 1030, and its subsequent introduction to China, India and Europe in the High Middle Ages, that the output of individual spinners dramatically increased. Mass production later arose in the 18th century with the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. Hand-spinning remains a popular handicraft. Characteristics of spun yarn vary according to the material used, fibre length and alignment, quantity of fibre used, and degree of twist. History The origins of spinning fibre to make string or yarn are lost in time, but archaeological evidence in the form of representation of string skirts has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic era, some 20,000 years ago.Barber, Women's Work, 42‚Äì45. In the most primitive type of spinning, tufts of animal hair or plant fibre are rolled down the thigh with the hand, and additional tufts are added as needed until the desired length of spun fibre is achieved. Later, the fibre is fastened to a stone which is twirled round until the yarn is sufficiently twisted, whereupon it is wound upon the stone and the process repeated over and over. The next method of spinning yarn is with the spindle, a straight stick eight to twelve inches long on which the yarn is wound after twisting. At first the stick had a cleft or split in the top in which the thread was fixed. Later, a hook of bone was added to the upper end. The bunch of wool or plant fibres is held in the left hand. With the right hand the fibres are drawn out several inches and the end fastened securely in the slit or hook on the top of the spindle. A whirling motion is given to the spindle on the thigh or any convenient part of the body. The twisted yarn is then wound on to the upper part of the spindle. Another bunch of fibres is drawn out, the spindle is given another twirl, the yarn is wound on the spindle, and so on. The distaff was used for holding the bunch of wool, flax, or other fibres. It was a short stick, on one end of which was loosely wound the raw material. The other end of the distaff was held in the hand, under the arm or thrust in the girdle of the spinner. When held thus, one hand was left free for drawing out the fibres. A spindle containing a quantity of yarn rotates more easily, steadily, and continues longer than an empty one; hence, the next improvement was the addition of a weight called a spindle whorl at the bottom of the spindle. These whorls are discs of wood, stone, clay, or metal with a hole in the centre for the spindle, which keep the spindle steady and promote its rotation. Spindle whorls appeared in the Neolithic era.Watson, Textiles and Clothing, pp. 3‚Äì14Barber, Women's Work, 37. They allowed the spinner to slowly lower, or drop, the spindle as it was spinning, thus allowing a greater quantity of yarn to be created before it had to be wound onto the spindle; hence the name \\"drop spindle,\\" which is now most commonly used for the hand spindle with whorl attached. =Spinning wheel= Modern top-whorl drop spindles The spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by 1030. It later spread to China by 1090, and then spread from the Islamic world to Europe and India by the 13th century. In medieval times, poor families had such a need for yarn to make their own cloth and clothes that practically all girls and unmarried women would keep busy spinning, and \\"spinster\\" became synonymous with an unmarried woman. Subsequent improvements with spinning wheels and then mechanical methods made hand-spinning increasingly uneconomic, but as late as the twentieth century hand-spinning remained widespread in poor countries: in conscious rejection of international industrialization, Gandhi was a notable practitioner. The hand spinning movement that he initiated as a part of the Indian freedom struggle has made the handwoven cloth known as \\"Khadi\\" made from handspun cotton yarn world-famous. Women spinners of cotton yarn still continue to work to produce handspun yarn for the weaving of Khadi in Ponduru, a village in South India. A great wheel (also called a wool wheel, high wheel or walking wheel) is advantageous when using the long-draw technique to spin wool or cotton because the high ratio between the large wheel and the whorl (sheave) enables the spinner to turn the bobbin faster, thus significantly speeding up production.Brown, Rachel, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Weaving, Spinning and Dyeing Book‚Äô‚Äô, pp. 230-7, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, NY, 1978. A Saxony wheel (also called a flax wheel) or an upright wheel (also called a castle wheel), can be used to spin wool or cotton, but are invaluable when spinning flax (linen). The ends of flax fibres tend to stick out from the thread unless wetted while being spun. The spinner typically keeps a bowl of water handy when spinning flax, and on these types of wheels, both hands are free (since the wheel is turned with a treadle, rather than by hand), so the spinner can use one hand to draft the fibres and the other to wet them. =Industrial Revolution= A mule spinning machine at Quarry Bank Mill, UK Modern powered spinning, originally done by water or steam power but now done by electricity, is vastly faster than hand-spinning. The spinning jenny, a multi-spool spinning wheel invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves, dramatically reduced the amount of work needed to produce yarn of high consistency, with a single worker able to work eight or more spools at once. At roughly the same time, Richard Arkwright and a team of craftsmen developed the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny. Too large to be operated by hand, a spinning frame powered by a waterwheel became the water frame. In 1779, Samuel Crompton combined elements of the spinning jenny and water frame to create the spinning mule. This produced a stronger thread, and was suitable for mechanisation on a grand scale. A later development, from 1828/29, was Ring spinning. In the 20th century, new techniques including Open End spinning or rotor spinning were invented to produce yarns at rates in excess of 40 meters per second. Characteristics of spun yarns =Materials= Yarn can be, and is, spun from a wide variety of materials, including natural fibres such as animal, plant, and mineral fibres, and synthetic fibres. =Twist and ply= S-twist and Z-twist yarns The direction in which the yarn is spun is called twist. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram). Tightness of twist is measured in TPI (twists per inch or turns per inch).Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, , p. 197 Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or plied to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist.Plying Yarn with a Spinning Wheel, The Joy of Handspinning This is a cultural preference differing in some areas but surprisingly common. It is important, however, to spin the single plies in one direction and then spin them together in the opposite direction  in this way, the opposite-direction plying keeps the spun yarn from untwisting itself. =Plying methods= Yarns can be made of two, three, four, or more plies, or may be used as singles without plying. Two-ply yarn can also be plied from both ends of one long strand of singles using a centre-pull ball, where one end feeds from within a ball of yarn while the other end feeds from the outside. \\"Andean plying\\", in which the single is first wound around one hand in a specific manner that allows unwinding both ends at once without tangling, is another way to ply smaller amounts of yarn. The name comes from a method used by Andean spinners to manage and splice unevenly matched singles being plied from multiple spindles. \\"Navajo plying\\", a.k.a. \\"chain-plying\\" is another method of producing a three-ply yarn, in which one strand of singles is looped around itself in a manner similar to crochet and the resulting three parallel strands twisted together. This method is often used to keep colours together on singles dyed in sequential colours. Cabled yarns are usually four-ply yarns made by plying two strands of two-ply yarn together in the direction opposite to the plying direction for the two-ply yarns. Contemporary hand spinning Nepali charka in action A Tibetan woman spinning wool in Pokhara/Nepal Hand- spinning is still an important skill in many traditional societies. Hobby or small scale artisan spinners spin their own yarn to control specific yarn qualities and produce yarn that is not widely available commercially. Sometimes these yarns are made available to non-spinners online and in local yarn stores. Handspinners also may spin for self-sufficiency, a sense of accomplishment, or a sense of connection to history and the land. In addition, they may take up spinning for its meditative qualities. Within the recent past, many new spinners have joined into this ancient process, innovating the craft and creating new techniques. From using new dyeing methods before spinning, to mixing in novelty elements (Christmas Garland, eccentric beads, money, etc.) that would not normally be found in traditional yarns, to creating and employing new techniques like coiling,Toil, Toil, Coils and Bubbles, Knitty Magazine this craft is constantly evolving and shifting. To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners can vary all the same things as in a machined yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, the direction of the twist, etc. A common misconception is that yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as from llama or angora rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as mohair, to prevent yarn breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique. The fibre can be dyed at any time, but is often dyed before carding or after the yarn has been spun. Wool may be spun before or after washing, although excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause felting. When done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap. =Education= There are number of guilds and educational institutions which offer certificate programs in handspinning. The Handweavers Guild of America (HGA) offers a Certificate of Excellence in Handspinning.Certificates of Excellence Program Overview Olds College in Alberta, Canada offers a Master Spinner program both on campus and by distance education. The Ontario Handweavers & Spinners offer both a Spinning Certificate and a Master Spinning Certificate. These programs feature in-depth examinations of handspinning topics, as well as extensive assignments and skill evaluations. =Techniques= *Watch video #1: Demonstration of hand spinning: short draw technique to spin wool on a Saxony wheel A tightly spun wool yarn made from fibre with a long staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same direction as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn. Short draw spinning is used to create worsted yarns. It is spun from combed roving, sliver or wool top. The spinner keeps his/her hands very close to each other. The fibres are held, fanned out, in one hand, and the other hand pulls a small number from the mass. The twist is kept between the second hand and the wheel. There is never any twist between the two hands. Long draw is spun from a carded rolag. The rolag is spun without much stretching of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This is done by allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again. =Spinning in the grease= Irreler Bauerntradition shows carding, spinning on Saxony wheels and knitting in the Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum Handspinners are split, when spinning wool, as to whether it is better to spin it \\"in the grease\\" (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional spinners are more willing to spin in the grease, as it is less work to wash the wool after it is in yarn form. Spinners who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the spinner's hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the spinner's hands. Spinning in the grease works best if the fleece is newly sheared. After several months, the lanolin becomes sticky, which makes the wool harder to spin using the short-draw technique, and almost impossible to spin using the long-draw technique. In general, spinners who use the long-draw technique do not spin in the grease. Such spinners generally buy their fibres pre-washed and carded, in the form of roving, sliver, or batts. This means less work for the spinners, as they do not have to wash out the lanolin. Spinners then have available predyed fibre, or blends of fibres, which are hard to create when the wool is still in the grease. As machine carders cannot card wool in the grease, pre-carded yarn generally is not spun in the grease. Some spinners use spray-on lanolin-like products to get the same feel of spinning in the grease with carded fibre.

His career spanned six decades. He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball from 1935 to 1937, coached two national championship teams in track and field, and went on to become the first person to both play for and coach Rose Bowl champions. Early life and collegiate athletic career Hill was born in Yates, Missouri and moved with his family to Corona, California as a boy, attending Corona High School and Riverside City College. After transferring to USC, he earned letters in football, track, and baseball. He played as a fullback for the 1928 USC football team, which won a national championship, and was a senior on the 1929 team that won the 1930 Rose Bowl, leading the Pacific Coast Conference with an average of 8.2 yards per carry. As a junior, he won the national title in the broad jump at the IC4A meet on June 1, 1929 at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, with a jump of 25 feet 7/8 inch, breaking the intercollegiate record by 2¬Ω inches. He also won a baseball conference batting championship with a .389 average as a senior in 1930. Career as a professional athlete After graduation, Hill signed a baseball contract with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, and hit a home run against the crosstown Los Angeles Angels in his first professional at bat. His contract was sold to the New York Yankees in January 1932, and he reached the major leagues as a left fielder in , batting .293 in 107 games. On September 22 of his rookie year, he barely lost to Ben Chapman in a 75-yard promotional race held before a game with the Boston Red Sox. In January 1936 he was traded to the Washington Senators, and he hit .305 in a reserve role. After beginning with a .217 average in 33 games, and switching to center field, he was sent to the Philadelphia Athletics, and hit .293 over the rest of the year. Afterwards he was sent to the Oakland Oaks of the PCL, where he played two more years. Over his major league career, Hill batted .289 with 6 home runs, 175 runs, 108 runs batted in, 277 hits and 43 stolen bases. Coaching career Hill began his coaching career at California high schools and colleges during baseball offseasons. He joined the Navy during World War II, and was discharged in 1946 as a lieutenant commander; during the war he worked with USC athletic director Willis O. Hunter in the Navy's V-5 (aviation cadet) program, and Hunter hired him in 1946 to coach freshman football and track. Hill was an assistant coach on USC's 1947 Rose Bowl team. Hill became USC's head track coach in 1949 and 1950, succeeding Dean Cromwell, and won national titles in both years. He returned for one season as track coach in 1962 after the sudden death of Jess Mortensen. He served as USC's head football coach from 1951 to 1956, with his teams posting a record of 45‚Äì17‚Äì1, including Rose Bowl appearances after the 1952 and 1954 seasons. His 1952 squad finished the year ranked fifth in the nation with a 10‚Äì1 record, outscoring their opponents 254-47 and leading the nation in scoring defense at 4.7 points per game; the only loss was a 9‚Äì0 contest at Notre Dame which ended the regular season. In the Rose Bowl, USC defeated Wisconsin 9‚Äì0; it was the only time between 1947 and 1959 that the Pacific Coast Conference champion beat the Big Ten Conference champion. Hill's 1954 team lost the Rose Bowl to Ohio State, 20‚Äì7. During his tenure, Hill's players included Frank Gifford, Rudy Bukich, Jim Sears and Jon Arnett. For the 1956 season opener at Texas, Hill made the decision to change hotels after discovering that USC's integrated team could not stay at the segregated Austin hotel that had been booked; USC went on to win the game, 44‚Äì20, as fullback C. R. Roberts, an African American, ran for a school-record 251 yards. USC ended the year with wins over UCLA and Notre Dame, the only time in his six years that they won both games. Athletic director Hill stepped down from his football post to become USC's athletic director from 1957 to 1972, during which period the university won 29 team national championships: eight tennis titles (1958, 1962‚Äì64, 1966‚Äì69) under coach George Toley; six College World Series titles (1958, 1961, 1963, 1968, 1970‚Äì71) under coach Rod Dedeaux; six track titles (1958, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967‚Äì68) under coaches Jess Mortensen and Vern Wolfe; five swimming titles (1960, 1963‚Äì66) under coach Peter Daland; two football titles (1962, 1967) under coach John McKay; one indoor track title (1967) under coach Vern Wolfe; and one gymnastics title (1962) under coach Jack Beckner. Hill then became commissioner of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, retiring in 1978. Hill died at age 86 in Pasadena, California, of complications of Alzheimer's disease and buried at the Sunnyslope Cemetery in Corona. He had one daughter and one son, and grandchildren. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in its second class in 1995.

In 1991, she served on a committee that recommended against the spraying malathion to combat the city's mosquito population.Val Werier, \\"Ban mosquito fogging forever\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press. Re-elected in 1992, Thomas soon emerged as an opponent of new mayor Susan Thompson, who succeeded five-term incumbent Bill Norrie. Thomas was appointed to both the Planning and Community Services Committee and the Protection, Parks and Culture Committee in 1993, when the left and right wings of council formed a temporary alliance to overturn Thompson's planned appointments.Dan Lett, \\"Alliance approves postings: Civic factions unite to bypass mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 November 1993.

Buz was one of three main regular characters on the program, and his tenure lasted for two and a half of the program's four seasons. It ended with Maharis' departure from the show. All told, Buz appeared in 71 of the 116 original episodes. Character history Although Buz's actual birth date is unknown, it was sometime around September 1937. He spent his early childhood in an orphanage, the St. Francis Home for Foundlings. Later, he grew up in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York City. Buz's troubled early youth led to his involvement in juvenile delinquency and street gangs. However, Buz was eventually able to escape this life due to the intervention of two individuals. One was a dedicated social worker named Chuck Brennan. The other was a shipping company owner named Lee Stiles who gave Buz a job on one of his barges. Buz became close friends with his employer's Ivy League son Tod (portrayed by Martin Milner), who worked under Buz's supervision on a barge each summer. Following the death of the elder Stiles in 1960, it was revealed that he was bankrupt. Virtually his sole legacy to Tod was a brand new Chevrolet Corvette. Buz and Tod then teamed up to seek their fortune, traveling throughout America and taking various odd jobs. Some conflicting information is given over the course of the series concerning the circumstances surrounding Buz's origin. In \\"The Mud Nest\\" he was said to have been left on the doorstep of an orphanage and to have never known who his real parents were. In that episode, he goes on a quest for his mother on the assumption that she is still alive. However, in an earlier episode, the previous season's \\"Like a Motherless Child\\", Buz stated that he knew for a fact that both his parents were dead. After two years of adventuring with Tod, Buz briefly became ill with an unspecified malady. He missed the final four episodes of the second season. And, although he returned for the premiere of season three, after only a handful of episodes Buz would become ill and disappear from the show again, this time never to return. During the period of Buz's absence, Tod travelled and had adventures on his own. He can often be seen in some of these episodes writing letters to and having one-way phone conversations with an unseen Buz who is said to be hospitalized. George Maharis continued to receive on-screen credit for these episodes although Buz does not appear in them. The last episode to feature Buz Murdock was \\"A Gift For a Warrior\\", which originally aired on January 18, 1963 (although it was probably filmed much earlier in the season in relation to the order in which the episodes aired, the last full episode Maharis actually completed filming was \\"Hey Moth, Come Eat the Flame.\\") After this episode, the character of Buz Murdock was never so much as mentioned in the series again. Eventually the role of Tod's sidekick was taken up by the character of Lincoln Case (Glenn Corbett), who finished out the remainder of the series. In the short-lived sequel series to Route 66 which aired for just four episodes during the summer of 1993, Buz Murdock is established as the illegitimate father of the character Nick Lewis (portrayed by actor James Wilder). The premise of the more recent series is that Buz willed the car to Nick following Buz's death. However, this is inconsistent with the fact that it was Tod, not Buz, who was the owner of the car and that the two had parted ways (with Tod keeping the car) long before the conclusion of the original series. Furthermore, many fans of the original series felt that it would have been grossly out of character for Buz as portrayed therein to knowingly abandon a son he had fathered, especially considering the trauma of Buz's own background as an orphan. Personality Traits Dark-featured Buz has a soft, handsome face which belies a fiery, intense nature and a rabid zest for life. Although he lacks the Ivy League education of his close friend Tod, he is capable of being just as articulate, witty and intelligent. Despite his refinement, Buz is not above reverting to his rough past and using his fists when the occasion calls for it - and very rarely does he come out on the losing end of a scrap. He is a music aficionado with a particular taste for jazz, as well as a fan of old-time movies with an encyclopedic knowledge. One of Buz's most renowned characteristics that he displays during the course of the series is his penchant for going on inspired, poetic rants filled with righteous anger against people and situations that he feels are wrong or unjust. He displays just as much an eye for the ladies as his friend Tod. And while he doesn't quite share Tod's penchant for serious romances, he has had a few of those on occasion himself. The prevailing not so subtle \\"secret backstory\\" to Buz' character was that the raven haired sometimes poet was a tv refined replication of Jack Kerouac or more accurately his \\"Sal Paradise\\" character from the similarly themed \\"On The Road\\" novel of two characters, dark haired and blonde, navigating odd adventures around the country from behind the wheel of a car. There was speculation Kerouc contemplated suing Stirling Silliphant and Chevrolet for misappropriating the characters and themes from his iconic \\"Road\\" novel.

The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of optimization and equilibrium problems and the dynamical world of ordinary differential equations. A projected dynamical system is given by the flow to the projected differential equation : \\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\\\Pi_K(x(t),-F(x(t))) where K is our constraint set. Differential equations of this form are notable for having a discontinuous vector field.  History of projected dynamical systems  Projected dynamical systems have evolved out of the desire to dynamically model the behaviour of nonstatic solutions in equilibrium problems over some parameter, typically take to be time. This dynamics differs from that of ordinary differential equations in that solutions are still restricted to whatever constraint set the underlying equilibrium problem was working on, e.g. nonnegativity of investments in financial modeling, convex polyhedral sets in operations research, etc. One particularly important class of equilibrium problems which has aided in the rise of projected dynamical systems has been that of variational inequalities. The formalization of projected dynamical systems began in the 1990s. However, similar concepts can be found in the mathematical literature which predate this, especially in connection with variational inequalities and differential inclusions.  Projections and Cones  Any solution to our projected differential equation must remain inside of our constraint set K for all time. This desired result is achieved through the use of projection operators and two particular important classes of convex cones. Here we take K to be a closed, convex subset of some Hilbert space X. The normal cone to the set K at the point x in K is given by : N_K(x) = \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in V \\\\langle p, x - x^* \\\\rangle \\\\geq 0, \\\\forall x^* \\\\in K \\\\\\\\}. The tangent cone (or contingent cone) to the set K at the point x is given by : T_K(x) = \\\\overline{\\\\bigcup_{h>0} \\\\frac{1}{h} (K-x)}. The projection operator (or closest element mapping) of a point x in X to K is given by the point P_K(x) in K such that : \\\\x-P_K(x) \\\\\\\\leq \\\\x-y \\\\for every y in K. The vector projection operator of a vector v in X at a point x in K is given by : \\\\Pi_K(x,v)=\\\\lim_{\\\\delta \\\\to 0^+} \\\\frac{P_K(x+\\\\delta v)-x}{\\\\delta}.  Projected Differential Equations  Given a closed, convex subset K of a Hilbert space X and a vector field -F which takes elements from K into X, the projected differential equation associated with K and -F is defined to be : \\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\\\Pi_K(x(t),-F(x(t))). On the interior of K solutions behave as they would if the system were an unconstrained ordinary differential equation. However, since the vector field is discontinuous along the boundary of the set, projected differential equations belong to the class of discontinuous ordinary differential equations. While this makes much of ordinary differential equation theory inapplicable, it is known that when -F is a Lipschitz continuous vector field, a unique absolutely continuous solution exists through each initial point x(0)=x0 in K on the interval [0,\\\\infty). This differential equation can be alternately characterized by : \\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = P_{T_K(x(t))}(-F(x(t))) or : \\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -F(x(t))-P_{N_K(x(t))}(-F(x(t))). The convention of denoting the vector field -F with a negative sign arises from a particular connection projected dynamical systems shares with variational inequalities. The convention in the literature is to refer to the vector field as positive in the variational inequality, and negative in the corresponding projected dynamical system.

At Easton, which today is the home of The National Canal Museum, the Delaware Canal also connected with the Morris Canal built to carry anthracite coal to energy starved New Jersey industries. Later, with a crossing-lock constructed at New Hope, the New Hope 'outlet lock' (1847) connected by Cable Ferry to a feeder navigation/canal at Bull's Island along the opposite shore from Lumberville, which ran over south along the left bank through Trenton to Bordentown, the west end of the Delaware and Raritan Canal (1834) to New York City via New Brunswick. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the Delaware canal to feed anthracite stone coal to energy- hungry Philadelphia as part of its transportation infrastructure building plan known as the Main Line of Public Works‚Äîa legislative initiative creating a collection of self-reinforcing internal improvements to commercial transportation capabilities. The Delaware Canal, like the Lehigh Canal, was primarily meant to carry the \\"fuel of choice\\" of the day, anthracite coal, and other bulk goods such as gravel and limestone, cement, and lumber‚Äîfrom northeastern Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. In reverse flow, the two canals carried manufactured goods, iron products and (a few decades later) steel products to the northeastern cities. The Delaware and Lehigh Canals also connected from Easton by ferry services across the Delaware River to New Jersey and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, connecting industrial loads to New York City. First opened in 1832, the Delaware Canal still has most of its original locks, aqueducts, and overflows. Although the two canals reached their peak shipping in 1855, after which coal transport down the Lehigh corridor was taken up increasingly by railroads, the canals stayed in operation until the Great Depression in the early 1930s. According to the National Park Service, it was the \\"longest-lived canal in the country\\". This is a map of the lower division (the original) of Lehigh Canal, which was a navigation built parallel to the course of the Lehigh River. The Delaware Canal, in comparison, was a ditch dug parallel to the main banks of the Delaware River and, although about 35% longer, had only half as many levels. Barge crews preferred the Delaware over the Lehigh because they could go faster, farther, longer before having to go through locks again. History The Pennsylvania Canal system was spurred by the early success of the Erie Canal in New York State, which had opened in 1825. Construction on the Delaware Canal started in 1829, accomplished entirely with hand tools using primarily imported labor from Ireland. The canal runs down a channel dug parallel to the Delaware River from Easton to Bristol, Pennsylvania; its line of travel is generally within sight of the river. Originally in length, the canal is approximately wide with a depth of about . After the original construction failed in 1830, it had to be re-engineered by Josiah White of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, who had offered to engineer and build the Delaware Canal for a break in fees in 1824. The state sold the canal to the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company in 1858. The Delaware Canal took over the easy part of the journey for the coal barges transiting down the rapids strewn path of the Lehigh Valley from Mauch Chunk and the heights of Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania and the huge coal fields that connected beyond them. Millions of tons of coal traveled from Wilkes-Barre down the Lehigh Valley transportation infrastructure, then finished the journey on the Delaware Canal's barges. But competition from the railroad led to a decline in barge traffic. By the 1920s, anthracite coal was waning as a source of fuel. The last commercial through traffic traveled the canal in October 1931 and the bankrupt Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company sold the canal back to the state for a nominal fee. In 1933, a private group called The Delaware Valley Protective Associationhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0n14xVmyZ70J:www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateParks/parks/delawarecanal/landuse/u1lesson10lp.doc+delaware+valley+protective+association&cd;=9&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us (DVPA) was founded to protect the canal as a historic asset. The DVPA persuaded the state to resume maintenance of the canal in 1940, when its towpath became Theodore Roosevelt State Park. The berms were restored and the canal was refilled with water. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the canal was left mostly untouched. In the early 1960s, however, Pennsylvania officials explored plans to pave over the canal and create a road for cars. Local residents fought for the canal's protection. In 1964, Bucks County historian and DVPA member Willis M. Rivinus wrote the first Guide to the Delaware CanalGuide to the Delaware Canal, Willis M. Rivinus, photographs by Louis Comfort Tiffany, Route maps by Edith C. Smith, New Hope, PA, 1964, 1967, 1972, 1978, 1984, 1989, 1993, 2004 to call attention to the canal's value. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the DVPA and other influential citizens sought to secure federal landmark status to protect the Canal. In 1974, the Canal was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark,http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/designations/Lists/PA01.pdf helping to guarantee its preservation. The towpath itself was named an official National Recreation Trail. In 1988, the U.S. government created the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, covering a 165-mile north- south swath of eastern Pennsylvania that includes the Delaware Canal.The Complete Guide to the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, Lehigh River Foundation, Bethlehem, PA, 1994 In 1989, Theodore Roosevelt State Park was renamed Delaware Canal State Park. However, public funding for the canal often has been inadequate and, as in other parts of the country, private non- profit groups have been created to fill the void. In 1983, Bucks County resident Betty Orlemann organized the Friends of the Delaware Canal (FODC),http://www.fodc.org now the canal's largest fund-raising and volunteer group. (The DVPA no longer exists). Under long-time executive director Susan Taylor, the FODC also functions as a watchdog group, ensuring goals are to met to make the towpath trail walkable over its entire length and to eventually get the canal fully watered from Easton to Bristol. Portions of the Delaware Canal towpath were washed away or damaged during successive floods in 2004, 2005 and 2006. A number of sections of the towpath were closed and impassable, including a long stretch north of Washington Crossing and sections south of Riegelsville. In February 2008, a section of the towpath collapsed and of the canal lost water.http://infoaboutdelaware.com/general-news/23-miles-of- delaware-canal-loses-water-in-towpath-collapse-wilkes-barre-times-leader Through funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (PA DCNR) currently is refurbishing the washed out sections of the canal. As of October 2009, according to Delaware Canal State Park manager Rick Dalton, 75 percent of the towpath had been restored and was expected to be fully walkable by summer 2010. Engineering The canal in New Hope. At New Hope, engineers connected an undershot water wheel to another wheel with buckets, which lifted water from the Delaware River up into the canal using only the force of the river current. A few hundred yards above, there was an outlet lock to the Delaware River, and on the other side of the river a lock to the Delaware and Raritan canal. To enable boats to cross the river, engineers devised a system whereby two cables of unequal length attached to wheels on a spanning cable across the river would hold a boat at a diagonal to the current, thereby acting as a sail, pushing the boat across.Old Towpaths, p. 307 Mule Barge Tourist Ride Mule-drawn barges, operated by private concessionaires, provided rides for chartered private parties running from a landing at Lock #11 at New Hope north to a point about above Centre Bridge, for a total one-way ride length of . Tourist rides were also offered, however, they stopped in the vicinity of the Rabbit Run bridge, which carries PA 32 over the canal, about north of Lock #11. These rides were offered from approximately 1954 to 2006. Each boat could transport between 55 and 80 passengers and were pulled by two mules. Four boats, the Americana (painted red, white & blue), the Independence, the Liberty, and the Spirit of New Hope were used from the inauguration of the tourist ride until the 1997 season, when they were replaced by two new boats, the Molly Pitcher and the Myfanwy Jenkins (pronounced \\"Mivanway\\"). Yardley. Since 1997, operation of the barges have been under regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard (for example, steersmen are required to obtain a Master Mariner's license) and, if reopened, would face regulations imposed in 2009 on its sister operation on the Lehigh Canal in Easton, PA by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for crew members in \\"sensitive shipboard and dockside locations\\".The Morning Call article on requirements by the Transportation Security Administration A camelback bridge spanning the canal near Washington Crossing.

The canyon is often described as a smaller cousin of the Grand Canyon because of its scenic beauty. State Route 89A enters the canyon on its north end via a series of hairpin turns before traversing the bottom of the canyon for about until the highway enters the town of Sedona. Geography Oak Creek above Sedona Oak Creek Canyon is about long, ranging in width from . The depth of the canyon ranges from . However, due to the faulting that played a major role in its formation, the west rim of the canyon is higher than the east rim. The average elevation of the west rim is while the east rim elevation is . =Oak Creek= Oak Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, flows along the bottom of the canyon, and is one of the few perennial streams in the high desert region of northern Arizona. Oak Creek is largely responsible for carving the modern Oak Creek Canyon, although movement along the Oak Creek Fault, a long north-south normal fault line, is thought to have played a role as well. Oak Creek has an elevation of just north of Sedona to at the northern terminus of the canyon.Google Earth Oak Creek enters more open country below Sedona. It meanders past the communities of Page Springs and Cornville, and reaches its confluence with the Verde River about 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Cottonwood.TopoQuest - USGS Cornville (AZ) Topo Map In June 2006, the southern portion of the canyon, near Slide Rock State Park, was affected by a wildfire known as the \\"Brins Fire\\". Geology Sandstone formation in Oak Creek Canyon Geologic evidence suggests the formation of an ancestral Oak Creek Canyon along the Oak Creek Fault about eight to ten million years ago. The ancestral Oak Creek Canyon was then filled in by gravel deposits and a series of lava flows between 6-8 million years ago during the Miocene Epoch. About this time, the Oak Creek Fault became active again and the modern Oak Creek Canyon began to develop along the fault zone as a result of the erosional action of Oak Creek. The normal, down-to-the-east motion of the Oak Creek Fault during the most recent faulting period resulted in the west rim of the canyon being about 700 feet (210 meters) higher than the east rim. The spectacularly eroded walls of the canyon are formed mostly of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Exposures of the Kaibab Limestone, (the geologic formation found at the top of the Grand Canyon), and the Toroweap Formation are found only at the northern end of the canyon. The more predominant rock units exposed in the cliffs of southern Oak Creek Canyon are the buff to white colored, frequently cross-bedded Permian Coconino Sandstone and the red sandstones of the Permian Schnebly Hill Formation. Unlike all the other formations exposed in Oak Creek Canyon, the Schnebly Hill Formation is not present at the Grand Canyon. The youngest rocks exposed in the canyon are a series of basalt lava flows that form the east rim, the youngest of which is an estimated 6 million years old. Recreation Fishing in Oak Creek, Cathedral Rock in background, 1959. Oak Creek Canyon is located within the Coconino National Forest. Portions of the canyon have been designated federal wilderness areas as part of the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness. The United States Forest Service operates several campgrounds, picnic areas, and recreation areas within the canyon. Slide Rock State Park, home to a natural water slide along Oak Creek, is also located within Oak Creek Canyon. Other recreational activities include swimming and fishing in Oak Creek. There are 49 fishable miles along the creek where rainbow trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, catfish (channel) and catfish (flathead) can be found. Hiking the many trails leading into side canyons or up to the rim of the canyon is a popular activity for the area. The trail leading the first 3 miles (4.8 km) up the West Fork of Oak Creek, a 14-mile (22.4 km) long narrow side canyon, is the most popular trail in the Coconino National Forest. 2014 slide fire On May 20, 2014, at around 4 PM, a wildfire was reported just north of Slide Rock State Park. The fire was 100% contained on June 4, 2014, with 21,227 acres burned. Total personnel included over 1,230 firefighters, 50 crews, 29 engines, and 9 helicopters. After the fire, the Sedona Fire District installed 9 Outdoor Warning Sirens throughout the Canyon. They are used for situations including: wildfires, flash flooding, severe weather, and other emergencies. The siren system is tested yearly, in the Summer months.

He began climbing at the age of 17 and was soon at the leading edge of the fledgling sport. He and Oliver Perry-Smith, an American college student and fellow climber living in Dresden, became as close as brothers and formed a team which pushed the limits of risk and difficulty on the steep sandstone spires, making many first ascents. Early on, Fehrmann exerted leadership in both climbing ethics and environmental protection. He imagined the purest of climbing routes as \\"great lines\\", ascending directly up steep faces and cracks and sometimes presenting considerable difficulties, and he encouraged the use of rope-soled slippers and a minimum of metal protective devices in order to avoid destroying the fragile rock. In 1903, Fehrmann began climbing on the Schrammsteine rocks.Extract from Fehrmann's report, Wie ich Bergsteiger wurde Before long, he became one of the best mountain climbers in Saxon Switzerland and ascended a number of important climbing peaks. Among his 'firsts' were, in 1904, the Chinesische Turm (Alter Weg, Saxon grade V), in 1905, the Barbarine (grade VI), the H√∂llenhund (grade V(VIIa)) and the Schwedenturm (grade V). Among his other firsts, were the Fehrmannweg route (VIIa) on the M√∂nch in 1904 and the S√ºdriss (VIIb) on the Dreifingerturm in the Schrammsteine in 1906. Fehrmann also climbed in the Alps and Dolomites, as well, creating new routes there. In 1908, he published a climbing guide for the sandstone spires near Dresden, his favorite area, entitled \\"Der Bergsteiger in der S√§chsischen Schweiz\\". Fehrmann joined the NSDAP in its early stages, and became a Party functionary. As a lawyer, he served during World War II as a military judge. He was able, during this time, to work out accessibility issues regarding the rocks along the Elbe, assisting the climbing community. He was captured at the end of the war and interned in an East German war prisoner camp, where he died a natural death at the age of 61 in 1947.

He was the head football coach at Michigan State College in 1928 and at the University of Michigan from 1929 to 1937, compiling a career record of 49‚Äì30‚Äì5. During his nine-year tenure as head coach at Michigan, Kipke's teams compiled a 46‚Äì26‚Äì4 record, won four conference titles, and captured two national championships in 1932 and 1933. He is one of only three coaches, along with Fielding H. Yost and Bo Schembechler, in Michigan football history to direct teams to four consecutive conference championships. Kipke was also the head baseball coach at the University of Missouri for one season 1925 while he was an assistant football coach at the school. He was inducted into of the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1958. Early years Kipke was born in Lansing, Michigan, in March 1899. His father, Charles W. Kipke, emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1872. His mother, Minnie Kipke, emigrated from Germany in 1888. Kipke had two older sisters (Lena and Marie), an older brother (William), and three younger brothers (Herbert, Walter, and Ray).https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat;=19681205&id;=FE4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=F78EAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7333,1365405 At the time of the 1910 United States Census, the family was living in Lansing, and the father was working as an assembler in a motor works.Census entry for Charles W.

University of Michigan Kipke in 1922 Kipke attended the University of Michigan. He is one of the few individuals in Michigan Wolverines history to have been a letterman nine times, doing so in football, basketball, and baseball. Kipke played halfback and punter for the football team under head coach Fielding H. Yost. He was named an All-American in 1922 and is regarded as one of the school's all-time greats as a punter. His ability to punt out of bounds near the opposition's goal line helped Michigan to a 19‚Äì1‚Äì2 record from 1921 through 1923. Kipke was also the captain of the 1923 Michigan team that went 8‚Äì0 and won a national title. Kipke wore number 6 and weighed 158 pounds. Coaching career After serving as an assistant coach at the University of Missouri for four years, Kipke was named the head football coach at Michigan State University in 1928. Michigan State had a 3‚Äì4‚Äì1 record in 1928. The following year, Kipke was hired to take over as head football coach for the Michigan Wolverines. In his first year as head coach in 1929, the Wolverines struggled, finishing in an eight place tie in Big Ten Conference with a 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 record. But Kipke quickly turned things around, leading the Wolverines to four straight conference championships and two national titles between 1930 and 1933. The 1932 and 1933 national championships teams did not lose any games, and featured All-Americans Harry Newman, Charles T. Bernard, Ted Petoskey, and Francis Wistert. Kipke called his system \\"a punt, a pass, and a prayer\\" in a 1933 article for The Saturday Evening Post. He also reportedly coined the phrase, \\"A great defense is a great offense.\\" In 1934, Kipke's Wolverines fell from national champions to a tenth-place finish in the conference with a 1‚Äì7 record. The one bright spot in the Wolverines 1934 season was the play of the team's most valuable player, center and future President of the United States, Gerald Ford. Ford lacked the money to attend the university, but Kipke's assistance helped him to do so. The principal of Ford's high school wrote to Kipke and invited him to Grand Rapids to meet Ford. Kipke accepted the invitation and met with Ford and his family. Though there were no opportunities to obtain scholarships on the basis of playing football at the time, Kipke helped Ford find a job at the university hospital waiting on tables to earn his meals. Ford later called the opportunity to go to U of M \\"the luckiest break I ever had.\\" http://umich.edu/ford/timeline.html In a 1975 speech, Ford recalled losing seven out of eight games in 1934, including a 34‚Äì0 loss to Ohio State. Ford joked that \\"what really hurt me the most was when my teammates voted me their most valuable player. I didn't know whether to smile or sue.\\" http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4764 Between 1934 and 1937, Kipke's team accumulated a 10‚Äì22 record. Kipke resigned after the 1937 season and was replaced by Fritz Crisler. Before resigning, Kipke recruited Tom Harmon to play at Michigan and advised the future Heisman Trophy winner to stay with Michigan despite the coaching change. After coaching From 1940 to 1947, Kipke was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan. In 1942, he joined the United States Navy and later became president of the Coca-Cola Company of Chicago. Kipke was inducted into of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1958 and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1968. In September 1972, Kipke died at a hospital in Port Huron, Michigan, where he had lived for several years. Two days after he died, the crowd at Michigan Stadium stood in a moment of silence during halftime in honor of Kipke. Students, alumni, and fans can continue to remember Kipke's impact and achievements at Michigan as they walk past Kipke Drive, named after him, just outside Michigan Stadium (\\"The Big House\\").http://localwiki.org/ann- arbor/Harry_Kipke Head coaching record See also * History of Michigan Wolverines football in the Kipke years * List of Michigan Wolverines football All-Americans * University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor References External links * Profile at Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan Athletics History  * 1899 births 1972 deaths American football drop kickers American football halfbacks Forwards (basketball) Guards (basketball) Michigan State Spartans football coaches Michigan Wolverines baseball players Michigan Wolverines football coaches Michigan Wolverines football players Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players Missouri Tigers baseball coaches Missouri Tigers football coaches Regents of the University of Michigan All-American college football players All-American college men's basketball players College Football Hall of Fame inductees Sportspeople from Lansing, Michigan Players of American football from Michigan Baseball players from Michigan Basketball players from Michigan American men's basketball players ","title":"Harry Kipke"},{"id":"5779320","text":"Blowers is a surname, and may refer to: * Andrew Blowers (born 1975), New Zealand rugby union player * Bruce G.

His flamboyant style of guitar playing also influenced Jimi Hendrix. Career In the 1960s Jenkins was the leader of the Pinetoppers, who employed a young Otis Redding as singer. As Jenkins did not have a driver's license, Redding also served as his personal driver. During a recording session in 1962 organized by the band's manager, Phil Walden, Jenkins left forty minutes of studio time unused. Redding used this time to record a ballad, \\"These Arms of Mine\\", on which Jenkins played guitar. Scott Freeman, in his biography of Redding, Otis!: The Otis Redding Story, gives several accounts of that chaotic day at Stax Records. In 1964, Jenkins released an instrumental single, \\"Spunky\\" (Volt V-122). With Phil Walden concentrating on Redding's flourishing career, Jenkins was sidelined, and it was not until after Redding's death in 1967 that Walden again concentrated on Jenkins's career. In 1970, Jenkins released the album Ton-Ton Macoute!. The opening track, a cover of Dr. John's \\"I Walk on Guilded Splinters\\", has been sampled by numerous musicians, including Beck (Loser), and Oasis (Go Let It Out). Several tracks on Ton-Ton Macoute! featured Duane Allman on guitar and dobro. With Walden again becoming involved in other projects, Jenkins became disillusioned with the music industry and did nothing of note until 1996. By then Walden had persuaded him to make a comeback, and he released the album Blessed Blues, recorded with Chuck Leavell. Two further albums followed: Handle with Care and All in Good Time. Jenkins died from a stroke in June 2006 in the same town where he was born: Macon, Georgia. He was 67. Jenkins was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2012. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed his previous band, The Pinetoppers, among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It can be round, angular, oval, or irregular in shape. This feature shows up in tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength. How far the center is embedded within the CDO, and the temperature difference between the cloud tops within the CDO and the cyclone's eye, can help determine a tropical cyclone's intensity. Locating the center within the CDO can be a problem for strong tropical storms and with systems of minimal hurricane strength as its location can be obscured by the CDO's high cloud canopy. This center location problem can be resolved through the use of microwave satellite imagery. After a cyclone reaches hurricane intensity, an eye appears at the center of the CDO, defining its center of low pressure and its cyclonic wind field. Tropical cyclones with changing intensity have more lightning within their CDO than steady state storms. Tracking cloud features within the CDO using frequently updated satellite imagery can also be used to determine a cyclone's intensity. The highest maximum sustained winds within a tropical cyclone, as well as its heaviest rainfall, are usually located under the coldest cloud tops in the CDO. Characteristics Southern hemisphere tropical cyclone Winston with a large CDO surrounding its eye It is a large region of thunderstorms surrounding the center of stronger tropical and subtropical cyclones which shows up brightly (with cold cloud tops) on satellite imagery. The CDO forms due to the development of an eyewall within a tropical cyclone. Its shape can be round, oval, angular, or irregular. Its development can be preceded by a narrow, dense, C-shaped convective band. Early in its development, the CDO is often angular or oval in shape, which rounds out, increases in size, and appears more smooth as a tropical cyclone intensifies. Rounder CDO shapes occur in environments with low levels of vertical wind shear. The strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection within the CDO, which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops. The radius of maximum wind is usually collocated with the coldest cloud tops within the CDO, which is also the area where a tropical cyclone's rainfall reaches its maximum intensity. For mature tropical cyclones that are steady state, the CDO contains nearly no lightning activity, though lightning is more common within weaker tropical cyclones and for systems fluctuating in intensity. Eye The eye is a region of mostly calm weather at the center of the CDO of strong tropical cyclones. The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area, typically in diameter. It is surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms surrounding its center of circulation. The cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye, and can be as much as 15% lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm. In weaker tropical cyclones, the eye is less well-defined, and can be covered by high cloudiness caused by cirrus cloud outflow from the surrounding central dense overcast. Use as a tropical cyclone strength indicator Common developmental patterns seen during tropical cyclone development, and their Dvorak-assigned intensities Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones, there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity. The central dense overcast (CDO) pattern is one of those patterns. The central dense overcast utilizes the size of the CDO. The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5, equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity, . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered. The farther the center is tucked into the CDO, the stronger it is deemed. Banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center, using a ten degree logarithmic spiral. Using the 85‚Äì92 GHz channels of polar-orbiting microwave satellite imagery can definitively locate the center within the CDO. Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between and can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery, which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge. Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the CDO using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery, whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half-hour.

It is considered a satellite town of Moonta which is located directly to the east of Port Hughes. At the , Port Hughes had a population of 571. Description Port Hughes is a popular tourist destination, with attractions including a Greg Norman-designed links style golf course, the beach and the jetty. Boating is facilitated by the availability of a boat ramp. The beach is regarded as safe for swimming, which attracts families going on vacation. Fishing is a popular pastime. Fishing takes place on the jetty which is also a popular scuba diving site. Also, boats are available for charter to go fishing. Tourists are catered for with accommodation at the caravan park, which features onsite cabins and villas. There is also a general store and tavern. History The government town of Port Hughes was surveyed in April 1863 and named after Sir Watson Hughes. The boundary of the town was extended in April 1960 and again in October 1985. Boundaries were created for the locality now known as Port Hughes in January 1999 which include the full extent of the former government town. The locality was enlarged in July 2008 by the addition of land from the adjoining locality of Moonta Bay. In recent years, Port Hughes has been the subject of significant interest from land developers, with several land subdivisions in the local area. The most significant recent developments are the Patrick's Cove and Patrick's View land subdivisions, which have resulted in new housing being constructed and an influx of new residents. In June 2007, \\"The Dunes Port Hughes\\", a major new residential development was announced, including the construction of the first Greg Norman designed golf course in Australia, as well as a hotel and convention facility, as part of a major housing development. On 11 July 2012 Ferrier Hodgson partners David Kidman and Martin Lewis were appointed as receivers and managers to sell the remaining allotments and development properties.

He was also a high school football coach for 24 years in the state of Ohio. Early life and playing career Commings was born on Christmas Eve at the height of the Great Depression. He grew up in Ohio and played high school football at Youngstown's East High School. After graduating from high school in 1952, he enrolled at the University of Iowa. Commings spent his first two years at Iowa, lettering as a sophomore in 1953. That season, Coach Forest Evashevski's Hawkeyes finished the year ranked ninth in the nation in the final AP Poll. With the Korean War raging abroad, Commings signed up with the Marine Corps, serving for two years before returning to Iowa. He played his junior season in 1956 on the offensive and defensive lines. That Iowa team won the Big Ten Conference title, and Commings started in the 1957 Rose Bowl for the Hawkeyes, helping Iowa to a 35‚Äì19 victory. As a senior in 1957, Commings helped Iowa to a 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and a number six ranking in the final AP Poll. He was good friends with fellow lineman Alex Karras, who later had success as a professional athlete and actor. Though Karras won the 1957 Outland Trophy, it was Bob Commings at the end of the year that was voted as Iowa's 1957 MVP. In his three years at Iowa, Commings helped the Hawkeyes to a 21‚Äì5‚Äì1 record, and Iowa finished the year ranked in the top ten of the AP poll in each of his three years as a Hawkeye player. Early coaching career Commings was an assistant coach at Iowa for two seasons in 1958 and 1959 before leaving to become a high school coach in Ohio. He coached Struthers High School in Struthers, Ohio, for seven seasons from 1962‚Äì1968, compiling a 50‚Äì16‚Äì4 record. Commings then took over at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio. In five seasons from 1969‚Äì1973, Commings' teams had a combined 43‚Äì6‚Äì2 record. His 1970 Massillon team had an undefeated 10‚Äì0 record, outscoring their opponents 412‚Äì29 and winning a state poll championship. His 1971 team lost two games by one point each but outscored their other eight opponents 287‚Äì18. His 1972 team took a 10‚Äì0 record to the first Ohio state playoffs before losing. His 1973 team was unbeaten before dropping its season finale to archrival Canton McKinley. The 21‚Äì0 loss to the Bulldogs was his worst loss in five years at Massillon. Iowa coaching career In 1974, Iowa football was in the midst of an extended slump, having not had a winning season since 1961. The school had just fired their previous coach, Frank Lauterbur, for having a 4‚Äì28‚Äì1 record over three years, and Iowa was gaining a reputation as a coaching graveyard, and many wondered if any coach could win at Iowa. Commings let it be known that he wanted the job badly, and he even came to Iowa to campaign for it. At one of these rallies, Commings told reporters, \\"I feel I can win at Iowa. Obviously, it's going to take football players, but I don't feel anybody has a better rapport with the high school players than me. We have always had a very sophisticated football program at Massillon. My coaching staff (nine men) is larger than at most colleges.\\"25 Years With The Fighting Hawkeyes, 1964-1988, by Al Grady, Page 53 (ASIN: B0006ES3GS) Commings appealed to Iowa fans, because he had a Hawkeye background as a player and assistant coach during the Rose Bowl years. Though he had never coached at the college level, he had had tremendous success coaching high school football in Ohio, a state known as a hotbed for football talent. Finally, his enthusiasm for the job was evident. Commings stated that the Iowa job was the only college job he would ever want, and he offered to work with a one-year contract if necessary. If he did not deliver on his promise to win at Iowa, he could be let go after just one year. Commings said, \\"All I want is the job. If they had told me I had to pick corn in the off-season to get the job, I'd have done it.\\"Grady, Page 54 Iowa athletic director Bump Elliott took Bob Commings up on his challenge, making him the 23rd head coach in the history of Iowa football by signing him to a one-year contract for the 1974 season. He was the third Iowa graduate to take the reins as Iowa's head football coach, joining John G. Griffith in 1909 and Leonard Raffensperger in 1950‚Äì1951. Unfortunately, Iowa was riding a school- record 11 game losing streak, and Iowa's first four games in 1974 were against teams ranked in the top 20 of the AP Poll. After a road loss at Michigan, Commings coached his first home game in Iowa City against #12 UCLA. He told his team, a two touchdown underdog, before the game, \\"You are unique. In addition to being ridiculed for last season, you have the nation's toughest schedule. Now you have a chance to show people all over America what desire and determination can prove. It may be that you are the chosen children.\\"Grady, Page 56 The Hawkeyes shocked the country, and most of its fans, by pulling a 21‚Äì10 upset. Iowa fans sported \\"Chosen Children\\" badges, and Commings' contract was extended to three years. The Hawks also defeated Northwestern to snap a nine game conference losing streak in 1974 and ended the year with a 3‚Äì8 record. Iowa had another 3‚Äì8 record in 1975, but three of the losses were by four points or less. The Hawkeyes were competitive again, and Commings' contract was extended through 1979. In 1976, the Hawkeyes, nicknamed the \\"Wild Bunch\\", stunned Penn State, the number 11 ranked team in the nation, in Happy Valley for Iowa's first non-conference road win in 11 years. Iowa finished the 1976 season with a 5‚Äì6 record, agonizingly close to a winning record. The 1977 season was highlighted by Iowa's first game with Iowa State in 34 years. The first meeting between the two schools after such a long suspension in the series was met with great anticipation across the state. Seemingly, the only person unexcited about the game was Coach Commings, who said, \\"I'd rather be playing Utah.\\"Grady, Page 66 Before the game, Iowa State coach Earle Bruce had Iowa State change into special jerseys emblazoned with the phrase \\"Beat Iowa\\" across the chest above the numbers. Iowa defeated the Cyclones, 12‚Äì10, in a defensive struggle. Although Commings was not a big fan of the rivalry, that win probably earned him another year after a disappointing season in 1977. Iowa had a record of 4‚Äì7, although some sources note that UCLA was forced to forfeit their win against Iowa due to an ineligible player and list Iowa's record that season as 5‚Äì6. Whether it was 4‚Äì7 or 5‚Äì6, the fact remained that Iowa had posted its 16th consecutive non- winning season, which was now the longest streak in the nation. The feeling among fans seemed to be that Commings, in his fifth year, needed to deliver a winning season in 1978. Iowa's starting quarterback in 1978 was Bob Commings, Jr. He performed well, but the team did not. After winning the opening game, the 1978 Hawkeyes lost their next eight games and ended the year with a 2‚Äì9 record. Commings, who had one year left on his contract, said that he thought the school had a \\"moral and legal\\" obligation to allow him to coach in 1979. Bump Elliott disagreed, and Bob Commings was relieved of his duties after the 1978 season. Bob Commings had accepted the Iowa football head coaching job with glee. Later, he admitted, \\"It's a tougher job than I figured. No one outside of coaching has a concept of what it takes. I guess the answer still is that it takes time. There are so many things involved.\\"Grady, Page 69 His Iowa ties and the fact that he considered the Hawkeye coaching position as his dream job made his firing especially painful. But while he delivered several shocking wins, the overall record was poor. Commings was the tenth man to coach Iowa for at least five years, and his record of 17‚Äì38 was the poorest among the ten.Grady, Page 75 Commings was replaced by Hayden Fry, who would coach the Hawkeyes for 20 years and have the most wins of any coach in Iowa football history. Return to high school ranks Commings turned down an offer from the university to take another job within the athletic department. He remained in Iowa City for several months as a representative of an insurance agency. During the 1979 season, he was a color commentator for Iowa football games. But coaching was always in his blood. In 1980, Commings took a job at GlenOak High School in Canton, Ohio. He coached there for 12 seasons, compiling a 76‚Äì44‚Äì1 record. Bob Commings was diagnosed with cancer in 1991 and turned his football team over to his son, Bob Commings, Jr. He died within six months, survived by his wife, Sharon, and another son, Don.Commings Had Passion For Football In 24 seasons as a high school coach in Ohio, Commings had a 169‚Äì66‚Äì7 record.

In her career, Kaliopi has progressed from singing lead vocal with her eponymous band in 1980s Yugoslavia to being an established vocalist and composer working in North Macedonia and across former Yugoslavia. She represented Macedonia twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, first in 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan with \\"Crno i belo\\" and a second time in 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden with the song \\"Dona\\".

Gall, Jeneen Hobby as ed., Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life: Europe, Edition 2, Gale, 2009, , p. 516. She showed interest in music at a young age. In 1976, she entered a Macedonian children's festival called \\"Zlatno Slavejƒçe\\", which she won with the song \\"Mojata uƒçitelka\\". She later toured with the choir of Zapro Zaprov \\"Razvigorƒçe\\", performing in Czechoslovakia, Slovenia (then within Yugoslavia) and Austria between 1978 and 1980. She then joined the class of Marija Nikolovska, where she studied solo singing for four years, before continuing her training at the Music Academy in the class of Blagoja Nikolovski in 1984. Kaliopi competed in the 1984 Yugoslavian solo singing contest, finishing in third place and competing as the youngest classical music singer at the festival. =Band formation, Kaliopi and Rodjeni= In 1984, Kaliopi founded the band \\"Kaliopi\\" with Romeo Grill, recording their first two songs, \\"Tomi\\" and \\"Nemoj da me budis\\" at the request of Macedonian Radio. The band won best interpretation for the song \\"Leo\\" at the Festival Opatija, an award voted for by the journalists of Yugoslavia. In 1986, the band released their eponymous debut album on the ZKP RTLJ record label. In the same year, they participated in the Split Festival, where they won the best debut performer award for their song \\"Da more zna\\". In 1987, the band released their second album, \\"Rodjeni\\", which was recorded in Zagreb and was highly successful, producing the hit song \\"Rodjeni (Bato)\\" created by the author Romeo Grill. The band was active in the music scene, performing at festivals, recording television specials for TV Zagreb, TV Belgrade, TV Sarajevo and TV Titograd and performing a concert tour that included performances in the Soviet Union. At the height of the band's popularity, Kaliopi and Romeo Grill moved to Switzerland. After an extended absence from the music scene, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia, the band was officially dissolved. =Solo comeback, Oboi me and Ako denot mi e nokj= Kaliopi returned to the music scene as a solo performer in North Macedonia (then the Republic of Macedonia) and competed at the 1996 edition of Skopje Fest, the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 1996. With the song \\"Samo ti\\", she was awarded first place by the jury and the audience, winning the right to be the first representative for North Macedonia at the Eurovision Song Contest. However, the 1996 Contest saw an influx of new participants and at a non-televised audio pre-selection, North Macedonia was eliminated from the Contest. Kaliopi later competed in Skopje Fest 1998, but only managed ninth place with the song \\"Ne zaboravaj\\". Kaliopi began re- establishing herself in the music scene of North Macedonia, composing songs for other artists and releasing her solo debut album, \\"Oboi me\\" in December 1999. The album was promoted via a television special broadcast on MRT, single releases for the songs \\"Oboi me\\" and \\"Daj da pijam\\" and a promotional tour in summer 2000. The album was the last collaboration with her former bandmate Romeo Grill until 2012. In 2000, Kaliopi established her own record label Kaliopi Music Production, which exclusively dealt with her releases in North Macedonia. In January 2001, Kaliopi announced the release of a new album and a new collaboration with producer Darko Dimitrov. The album's title track \\"Ako denot mi e nokj\\" was the first single release; this was followed by the release of \\"Na pat do Makedonija\\", \\"Dali me sakas\\", \\"Mesecina\\" and \\"Za samo eden den\\". The album was promoted through a television documentary titled \\"Kaliopi Again\\" on MRT, an unplugged concert at the ancient Heraclea Lyncestis amphitheatre in Bitola and the \\"Na pat do Makedonija\\" concert tour, which commenced in November 2001 and included eleven concert dates across North Macedonia. On 16 February 2002, Kaliopi took part in Skopje Fest 2002 as a composer and a backing vocalist for the song \\"Pesna za nas\\", which was performed by Gorgi Krstevski. The song placed fifth in the competition.

In November 2004, along with five other artists, Kaliopi was selected for the Macedonia pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. She opted out of the selection in the initial stages after learning that the process would be competition based rather than an internal selection. However, she still remained part of the competition as a composer, supplying selection finalist Aleksandra Pileva with the song \\"Ne\\", which ultimately placed third. In early 2006, Kaliopi released the single \\"1000 Bozji Cvetovi\\", which garnered media interest because it was billed as a duet with Kaliopi herself.

Mar Ukba ben Judah (Hebrew: ◊û◊® ◊¢◊ï◊ß◊ë◊ê ◊ë◊ü ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î; early tenth century) was the Babylonian Exilarch from 890 up until his banishment in 917. He was briefly reinstated again in 918, however the following year he was disposed and succeeded by his contentious cousin, David ben Zakkai.  Biography  Born in the mid-ninth century in Baghdad, Iraq, his father Judah ben David was Exilarch from 840-857, and a fifth-generation descendent of Bostanai. Following his uncle, Zakkai ben Ahunai's death in 890, he succeeded Zakkai as Exilarch, rather than Zakkai's son David, who was deemed too controversial for the position. Mar Ukba's early years as Exilarch were relatively calm, however, following the appointment of Kohen Tzedek Kahana ben Joseph as Pumbedita Goan in 917, a violent controversy broke out between him and Mar Ukba, over the question of the income of the academy from the region of Khorasan. This ultimately resulted in a boycott by Kohen Tzedek's wealthy and influential friend, Joseph ben Phinehas, who convinced Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtadir to dipose Mar Ukba, which he did in 917. Soon afterward, Mar Ukba moved to Kermanshah in the spring of 917. However, after the young Caliph moved to his summer palace in Safran, Mar Ukba devised a scheme to win the royal favour by meeting Al- Muqtadir's secretary daily in his gardens and greeting him with the recitation of beautiful verses of poetry. These pleased the Caliphs secretary so much that he wrote them down and showed them to his master, who in his turn was so delighted that he sent for Mar Ukba. When the Caliph saw Mar Ukba, he asked him to express any wish. To this, Mar Ukba requested to be reinstated as Exilarch. The Caliph granted this wish, and soon after, Mar Ukba returned to Baghdad, where he was reinstated as Exilarch in 918. However, only a few months after his reinstatement, Kohen ·∫íede·∏≥ and his friends once again succeeded in securing his deposition and banishment from the country. Following this, Mar Ukba moved to Kairouan, Tunisia, where he was received with great esteem as a member of the House of David. In the Kairouan synagogue, a throne was built or him near the Torah ark, and he was always the third to read the weekly parashah. His immediate descendants are unknown, however, they probably immigrated to Francia. According to Jewish tradition, Yitskhak Eizik Meisels (b. 1425), the progenitor of the Meisels family was a 10th generation descendant of Mar Ukba.

He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State College from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68‚Äì35‚Äì6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8‚Äì1‚Äì1, won the Big Ten Conference title and defeated the California Golden Bears in the Rose Bowl. Though they finished second to the LSU Tigers in both major pre-bowl game polls, the 1958 Hawkeyes were recognized by the Football Writers Association of America as national champions after all the bowl games had been played. Evashevski served as Iowa's athletic director from 1960 to 1970, and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2000. Early years Evashevski was born in Detroit, Michigan. In grade school, he captained the basketball, baseball, soccer, and track teams. At Northwestern High School, however, he was not allowed on the football practice field in his sophomore or junior years. The school's varsity football coaches felt that Evashevski was too small at just 128 pounds.Brian Chapman and Mike Chapman, Evy and the Hawkeyes, p. 27. So he played intramural football at Northwestern. As a senior, he had grown to 180 pounds and his intramural football squad scrimmaged against the varsity football team. Evashevski led his intramural team to an upset of the varsity squad, and the coaches let him join the team. Evashevski started at tackle and linebacker as a 16-year-old Northwestern High School senior; he was allowed to skip a few grades in grade school to help him maintain interest academically. After his first varsity football game, a writer from The Detroit News said he was a sure-fire all-state pick, if he could stay healthy. But Evashevski suffered from headaches and vomiting after the game. In his next game, he hit a punt returner, forcing a fumble. Evashevski was knocked out cold and spent the next several months in the hospital. He said, \\"In the second game, I suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. They did three spinal taps on me before they decided to operate. I was supposed to be through with football. But when something is taken away from you like that, I believe you want it even more than you did before.\\"Mark Dukes & Gus Schrader, Greatest Moments In Iowa Hawkeyes Football History, p. 87. Playing career Eighteen months later, Evy enrolled at the University of Michigan. Michigan football coach Fritz Crisler wanted Evashevski on the field, so Evy was moved from the center position to quarterback one week before his first varsity game. In Crisler's single-wing system, the quarterback position required mostly calling signals and blocking for the running back, and Evashevski had the blocking skills and intelligence necessary to become a star. He started and was an all-Big Ten Conference performer three straight seasons. He played from 1938 to 1940 and paved the way for halfback Tom Harmon, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1940. Evashevski also played in the same Michigan backfield with David M. Nelson, a fellow alumni of Northwestern High. Nelson would go on to a noteworthy coaching career; among his many contributions was the wing-T formation.Football plays site . Harmon said, \\"Evy seemed to think right with Crisler...[A]s a linebacker, he had a fantastic instinct for smelling out the play...As a blocker, I never saw a better one.\\"Dukes & Schrader, p. 87. Although Harmon won the Heisman, Evashevski was the team's captain. Evashevski was also the most dynamic personality on the team. Once, Crisler's Wolverines were leading a foe 21‚Äì0 at half. He feared a letdown, so he ordered his team to consider the game scoreless. Crisler then asked, \\"OK, Evy, what's the score?\\" Evashevski replied, \\"You can't kid me, coach. The score is 21‚Äì0.\\"Chapman, p. 21. On another occasion, Evashevski shocked both his coach and teammates by lighting a victory cigar on the sidelines with thirty seconds to play in a 1939 win over Ohio State.Chapman, p. 27. Before a game against Minnesota, Crisler implored his team in a pregame speech to be 11 lions on offense and 11 tigers on defense. Evashevski spoke up and said he would not play unless he could be a leopard. On another day, Crisler, who demanded punctuality of his players, arrived for practice a little late. \\"Fritz\\", Evashevski barked, daring to use Crisler's nickname, \\"we begin practice at 3:30. It's now 3:35. Take a lap around the field\\"; Crisler did. He was named to the 1939 College Football All Polish-American Team. The Wolverines were 20‚Äì4 from 1938 to 1940. Crisler later called Evashevski \\"the greatest quarterback I ever had.\\"Dukes & Schrader, p. 85. Evashevski won the Big Ten Medal given to the school's best senior student-athlete. He was the baseball catcher, the senior class president, and an honor society member. Evashevski graduated with a sociology major and a psychology minor. He wanted to take labor law at the University of Michigan Law School, but his plans were interrupted with the outbreak of World War II and the Americans entering the War. Military service and early coaching career Evashevski coached Hamilton College to a 5‚Äì2 record in 1941 and served as an assistant coach for spring football at the University of Pittsburgh in 1942. Evashevski then enrolled at the Iowa Naval Pre-Flight School in Iowa City, teaching the students hand-to-hand combat and playing for the Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Then he left to serve three years in the military from 1943 to 1945. Evashevski obit When he returned from the military, Evashevski went back to Ann Arbor to try to enroll at Michigan's law school. Evashevski and his wife could not find a room because of all the military veterans returning from the war. When Clarence \\"Biggie\\" Munn, Crisler's line coach at Michigan and then head football coach at Syracuse University, offered Evashevski an assistant coaching job in 1946, Evashevski took it. He followed Munn to Michigan State University one year later and served as his assistant coach there from 1947 to 1949. In 1950, Evashevski accepted a head coaching job out west in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) at Washington State College in Pullman. He compiled a 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 record in 1950, and improved to 7‚Äì3 in 1951, the Cougars' best record in two decades. Head coach at Iowa \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\"Chapman, p. 38. With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in southeastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach. Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight.Bert McCrane & Dick Lamb (1964). 75 Years With The Fighting Hawkeyes, p. 190. Dubuque, Iowa: W.C. Brown. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\"McCrane & Lamb, pp. 189‚Äì90. In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, but Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\"Schrader, p. 84. =Early years (1952‚Äì1955)= The Hawkeyes struggled to an 0‚Äì4 start in 1952, surrendering more than 32 points per game during that stretch. Iowa was scheduled to play Ohio State for homecoming, and Evashevski's Hawks were three-touchdown underdogs. Ohio State had never played in Iowa Stadium, having not played in Iowa City in a quarter century. Evashevski completely retooled his offense the week before the game, and Iowa shocked the Buckeyes, 8‚Äì0. The Des Moines Register wrote, \\"Put your license plate back on the family auto, citizen, for Iowa won a football game Saturday.\\"Gridiron Glory, University of Iowa, 1952. Register sports editor Sec Taylor added, \\"It was like my 8-year-old granddaughter out-boxing Sugar Ray Robinson.\\"Gridiron Glory: 1952 The Associated Press (AP), in a year-end poll, voted it the third biggest upset of the year.Chapman, p. 54. Before the season, Evashevski had warned the school administration to expect some eyebrow-raising behavior from him. He strongly believed that the team had to be instilled with a fighting attitude, and that the Big Ten needed to be made aware of Iowa's presence in the league.Chapman, p. 55. In a loss to Minnesota, Gopher fans on the sideline yelled at Iowa coaches and players to stop obstructing their view. Words were exchanged, and several men wound up charging Evashevski, with one fan taking a swing at Evashevski and missing.Chapman, p. 56. The following week against Illinois, a very physical game turned dirty in the fourth quarter. More than one brawl cleared both benches, and players from both sides were ejected from the game. Evashevski stormed on to the field to protest a call, which fired up the Iowa crowd. When an official tried to mark off an Illinois penalty against Iowa, the Hawkeye crowd started throwing apple cores at the officials. After the game, as the Illinois team was trying to leave the field, an Illinois player got into an argument with an Iowa student and punched him, breaking his jaw. Several Illinois players and ten Iowa players were hurt during the game, with four being sent to the hospital. This incident led to a suspension of the Iowa‚ÄìIllinois series for 15 years.Chapman, p. 61. Iowa improved in Purdue, 26‚Äì0, and Minnesota, 27‚Äì0, in consecutive weeks to set up the most controversial game in school history. The final game of the season was against #1 Notre Dame in South Bend. Notre Dame was a 13-point favorite. In fact, not only was Notre Dame the top-ranked team in the nation, the AP writers had voted the Irish number one by the largest margin in their poll's history. With just seconds remaining in the first half and Iowa holding a 7‚Äì0 lead, Notre Dame was stopped for no gain on Iowa's seven-yard line. A tackle for the Irish screamed and fell to the ground, and the clock was stopped for the injury with just two seconds remaining. The Irish broke huddle and the officials signaled for the clock to start. Notre Dame was able to set down the lines, call signals, and snap the ball before time expired, and Notre Dame completed a touchdown pass on the final play of the half. The game was tied at halftime, 7‚Äì7. Iowa scored another touchdown with two minutes remaining in the game. With just 32 seconds left on the clock, Notre Dame advanced the ball to the Iowa 19-yard line. But the clock was running, and Notre Dame had no timeouts remaining. Again, an injury timeout was granted, but this time, two Notre Dame players fell at the same time, apparently unaware of the other. Both players left the field unassisted, and Notre Dame quickly resumed their drive. With six seconds to play, Notre Dame completed another touchdown pass and salvaged a 14‚Äì14 tie. The Fainting Irish Gridiron Glory Iowa sportscaster Bob Brooks said, \\"In retrospect, faking an injury was common in those days. That's what teams did, anything to get a timeout. However, it was abnormal in that Frank Leahy, the Notre Dame coach, had the Irish fainting all over the place. Players went down like they were shot.\\"Ron Maly, Tales From The Iowa Sidelines, p. 131. Critics labeled Notre Dame the \\"Fainting Irish\\",Maly, p. 131. and while there was no official rule against faking injuries, many critics questioned the practice. When Notre Dame star Johnny Lattner was asked about it, he responded, \\"Pretty smart thinking, wasn't it?\\"Chapman, pp. 98‚Äì99. Famed sportswriter Grantland Rice stated, \\"I consider it a complete violation of the spirit and ethics of the game and was sorry to see Notre Dame, of all teams, using this method. Why, in heaven's name, was it allowed? If this violates neither the rules nor the coaching code, let's throw them both out the window. Some people are calling it smart playing. I think it was disgraceful playing.\\"Chapman, p. 99. Evashevski attended a pep rally when he returned to Iowa City, and he parodied Rice himself when he said, \\"When the One Great Scorer comes to write against our name, He won't write whether we won or lost, but how come we got gypped at Notre Dame.\\" Evashevski said, \\"Don't celebrate a tie; celebrate a victory. I was there Saturday, and if ever a team won a game, Iowa won a victory at Notre Dame Saturday.\\" School officials eventually ordered Evashevski to apologize for his remarks.Chapman, p. 101. The tie cost the Irish the #1 spot in the final AP Poll, dropping them to a distant #2. Iowa rocketed into the AP rankings, finishing the year ninth in the nation and garnering six first place votes. It was Iowa's highest ranking since 1939, and the tie gave the Iowa program national attention. The Hawkeyes started the 1954 season 5‚Äì2, but Iowa suffered two tough losses to end the season at 5‚Äì4. In 1955, the Hawkeyes finished a disappointing 3‚Äì5‚Äì1, but lineman Cal Jones won the Outland Trophy at the end of the season. =Rose Bowl years (1956‚Äì1958)= In 1956, Iowa opened with five wins, but Michigan scored a touchdown with 66 seconds remaining to upset the Hawkeyes, 17‚Äì14. Evashevski dropped to 0‚Äì4 at Iowa against his alma mater, but if Iowa could win their next two football games, they would go to the Rose Bowl. Minnesota was Iowa's next opponent, and the Gophers were in the lead in the Rose Bowl race. Rather than a pregame speech, Evashevski used a pregame altercation to fire up his Hawkeye team. The Iowa team filed off the team bus outside Minnesota's stadium and huddled together, shivering in the cold. Evashevski was the last man off the bus and, as he walked over to the gate, he was scolded by the gatekeeper. \\"You know better than this!...[Y]ou were given tickets, and you can't get in without them!\\", the gatekeeper said.Chapman, p. 139. Evashevski, who had his hand on the team's passes and was about to produce them, saw an opportunity. He shoved the passes back into his pocket and engaged in a verbal battle with the gatekeeper, as his cold and angry Hawkeye team watched. Finally, the gatekeeper let the team pass, but he detained the coaches. The players were in the locker room, not knowing where the coaches were, until Evashevski and his assistants filed in moments before kickoff. The Hawkeyes took out their frustration on the Gopher team. The Hawks scored a touchdown off a turnover just a few minutes into the game. Iowa forced six fumbles and three interceptions from Minnesota and won, 7‚Äì0. Iowa then faced Ohio State for the Big Ten title. Led by head coach Woody Hayes, the Buckeyes had just defeated Indiana by rushing for 465 yards as a team, setting a Big Ten Conference record. The win over the Hoosiers was Ohio State's 17th consecutive conference win, also a Big Ten record. With a win over Iowa, the Buckeyes would clinch a third consecutive outright Big Ten title. Iowa, on the other hand, was playing for their first Big Ten title in 34 years. A sign in Iowa's locker room said, \\"You have sixty minutes to defeat Ohio State, and a lifetime to remember it.\\" In one of the most hard-hitting and memorable games in Iowa history, Iowa defeated Ohio State, 6‚Äì0, to clinch Iowa's first Rose Bowl trip in school history. Following a scoreless first half, Iowa took the lead on a 17-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ken Ploen to receiver Jim Gibbons. The Hawks then allowed Ohio State just 53 yards total offense in the second half to punch home the win. The game was so exciting, University of Iowa president Virgil Hancher had to be hospitalized with an apparent heart attack.Gridiron Glory, University of Iowa, 1956. After a forty-point win over Notre Dame, which stands as one of the worst losses in the history of the Irish, the Hawkeyes prepared for the Rose Bowl. Such a happy occasion was marred, however, by the tragic news that former Hawkeye Cal Jones had just died in a plane crash in Canada. One week later, the Hawkeyes flew to Pasadena, California. The team quietly dedicated the game to Jones' memory and defeated Oregon State, 35‚Äì19. Ploen was named the Rose Bowl MVP. The Hawks sent the game ball to Jones' mother in Steubenville, Ohio.McCrane & Lamb, p. 214. Iowa was nearly as good in 1957 as they had been the previous season. Iowa again opened with five wins before traveling to Ann Arbor to play Michigan. This time, the Hawkeyes fell behind by two touchdowns and trailed at halftime, 21‚Äì7. Iowa rallied with two unanswered touchdowns and tied the game at 21. With three minutes to go, the Hawks regained possession of the ball; Iowa ran out the clock and settled for the tie. Quarterback Randy Duncan had left the game with leg cramps, crippling Iowa's offense. Evashevski calmly explained that a tie did not hurt Iowa's Big Ten title chances, while it all but ended Michigan's. Time magazine published a story in which they called the Hawkeyes \\"quitters\\".Chapman, p. 179. The tie set up another showdown for the Big Ten title with Ohio State. However, unlike the previous season, the Buckeyes got revenge this time and handed Iowa a 17‚Äì13 defeat. It was Iowa's only loss of the year, as the Hawkeyes finished with a 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and ranked sixth in the nation.1958 recordIowa in the polls The 1958 Hawkeyes played Air Force to a surprising 13‚Äì13 tie. The Air Force Academy had only existed since 1954, and few thought their football team would give Iowa's a challenge. But Air Force salvaged a tie and finished the regular season with a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 record. The tie gave the Hawkeye players a lesson in humility, and they illustrated that they had learned their lesson by winning five straight conference games, clinching the Big Ten title earlier than any team in conference history.Chapman, p. 194. The most notable win was a 37‚Äì14 defeat of Michigan, Evashevski's first and only win over his alma mater. For the first time, the Hawkeye team was able to force their coach to accept the game ball. A week after Iowa clinched the league crown, Ohio State spoiled Iowa's undefeated record with a 38‚Äì28 win in a terrific contest. Iowa went back to the Rose Bowl and clobbered California, 38‚Äì12. The Hawkeyes set or tied six Rose Bowl records in that game. Running back Bob Jeter rushed for a Rose Bowl record 194 yards on just nine carries, including an 81-yard touchdown run, another Rose Bowl record. Jeter was the game's MVP. Evashevski, who had battled the flu and a temperature the week of the game, could barely give the halftime speech.Gridiron Glory, University of Iowa, 1959 Iowa finished the year ranked #2 in the AP Poll, behind 11‚Äì0 LSU, although that vote was taken before the bowl games. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), arguably the most prestigious organization at the time to vote on a national champion after the bowls were played, gave their national championship trophy, the Grantland Rice Award, to Iowa. =Feud with Brechler (1959‚Äì1960)= Iowa went 5‚Äì4 in 1959, a season marred by a very public feud between Evashevski and Brechler. Crisler had warned Brechler about Evashevski's stubbornness before Evashevski was hired. Brechler and Evashevski were both reportedly very good at their respective jobs, but relations between the two men quickly deteriorated. Evashevski and Brechler had a long and often bitter feud in the late 1950s. Evashevski called the conflict \\"[a] complete destruction of confidence in each other\\".Rick Brown (July 23, 1989). \\"Forest Evashevski, University of Iowa, 1989\\" , Des Moines Register (Iowa). At the end of the 1959 season, Brechler announced that he was leaving Iowa to become the commissioner of the Skyline Conference, the forerunner to the Western Athletic Conference. Evashevski had repeatedly mentioned that he did not intend to grow old in coaching. After the 1957 season, he conceded that his health was not the best and that \\"my wife has wanted me to get out of coaching for some time\\".Chapman, p. 187. Evashevski clearly wanted the athletic director job. Members on the Board of Athletics, however, were concerned about the prospect of the ambitious Evashevski holding both positions.Maly, pp. 134‚Äì35. The Board told Evashevski that he could take either job: head football coach or athletic director. Evashevski chose to become Iowa's athletic director and promised to appoint a new football coach after the 1960 season. Evashevski's final season as football coach at Iowa was another memorable one. The 1960 team overcame a fierce schedule and finished the year 8‚Äì1. The Hawkeyes defeated Ohio State on the last game of the conference season to clinch a share of the league crown with Minnesota. It was Evashevski's third Big Ten title at Iowa. The Hawkeyes were ranked third in the final AP Poll, which was taken before the bowl games. Iowa's only loss that season was at Minnesota, which finished first in the final AP Poll with an identical 8‚Äì1 record. During his tenure, Evashevski compiled a 52‚Äì27‚Äì4 record. His teams won three Big Ten titles and two Rose Bowls, and finished in the top ten of the final AP Poll five times. Though he had been a head coach for only 12 years in total, Evashevski was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1989 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000. Athletic director at Iowa Evashevski succeeded Brechler as Iowa's athletic director in 1960. He hired his assistant coach, Jerry Burns, to replace him as head football coach. Iowa began the 1961 season ranked first in the initial AP Poll but staggered to a disappointing 5‚Äì4 record. A defeat of Notre Dame on the final game of the season gave Iowa a winning record for the year; it would be Iowa's last winning season for the next 20 years. Three sub- par seasons put Burns on the hot seat entering 1965, but the 1965 team was predicted to do well. Instead, Iowa finished the year 1‚Äì9, and Burns was fired by his former mentor Evashevski. Burns went on to a long and successful coaching career in professional football, serving as an assistant to Vince Lombardi with the Green Bay Packers, which won the first two Super Bowls, and then as offensive coordinator for 18 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings under Bud Grant, when Minnesota went to four Super Bowls between 1969 and 1976. Burns was head coach of the Vikings from 1986‚Äì1991, posting a 53‚Äì42 mark and three playoff appearances. Jerry Burns' coaching record There are those who insist that Evashevski wanted to be called back as football coach and that rather than helping Burns to succeed, he hampered him with rules and regulations that were not in force when Evashevski was the coach.Al Grady (1989). 25 Years With The Fighting Hawkeyes, 1964‚Äì1988, p. 12. University of Iowa. When Evashevski was in his final year as coach in 1960, Look magazine wrote, \\"Close friends are not at all sure (Evy) will quit. They feel he is not sure himself.\\" Schrader, p. 88. One of Burns' assistant coaches said, \\"From the moment he became athletic director, Evy cut down the cost of maintaining the football program to the bare bones. He cut down on traveling expenses for recruiting, phone calls, entertainment of prospective recruits, you name it. When Evy was coach, we took visiting recruits and their parents to fine restaurants to eat. After Evy became the athletic director, the staff was told that visiting recruits and their parents would eat at the Quadrangle cafeteria. We were told if we recruited in Chicago one week, we were not to go back the next. The football players knew Jerry couldn't make it because of Evy's attitude towards him. It was a very antagonistic situation right from the start that got worse through the years.\\"Grady, p. 12. Evashevski, for his part, denied the charges and continued to maintain that he never intended to grow old in coaching. However, despite his public statements, rumors swirled that Evashevski would appoint himself to succeed Burns.Grady, pp. 14‚Äì15. Evashevski hired Ray Nagel from the University of Utah, although Nagel's record at Utah was not stellar. Some speculated at the time that finding a new coach had been difficult due to the problems Burns reportedly experienced with Evashevski. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported, \\"At least four coaches either turned down the Hawkeye job or expressed no desire to talk about it.\\"Grady, p. 15. Nagel's hiring was questioned even more after he had a 3‚Äì16‚Äì1 record in 1966 and 1967 at Iowa. However, the Hawkeyes set several school and conference offensive records in 1968 and finished with a 5‚Äì5 record. A boycott by several black players at Iowa in 1969 hurt the Hawkeye football squad and was a factor in their 5‚Äì5 record that season. Friction between Nagel and Evashevski began to take public effect in January 1970 when Nagel dismissed offensive line coach Gary Grouwinkel for \\"disloyalty\\", which Grouwinkel later revealed was his allegiance to Evashevski instead of Nagel.Mike Finn & Chad Leistikow, Hawkeye Legends, Lists, & Lore, p. 132. Less than one month later, star quarterback Larry Lawrence and fullback Tom Smith quit the team and transferred to Miami, loudly proclaiming that they would never stay and play for Nagel. About two weeks later, Lawrence's roommate, a non-athlete, submitted to the Iowa Board of Athletics a written statement charging Evashevski with participating in a rebellion aimed at getting Nagel fired and that would allow Evashevski to succeed him as head football coach.Finn & Leistikow, p. 132. Lawrence's roommate stated that Lawrence was recruited to gather player support for Nagel's removal, but that Lawrence's efforts were unproductive. Evashevski vehemently denied the charges, and Iowa's athletic board took no action. In May 1970, the State Auditor of Iowa announced that the athletic department was under investigation for \\"padded expense accounts\\". Nagel not only denied wrongdoing, but claimed that they were shown how to fill out their expense accounts by Evashevski himself. Charges and counter-charges followed, and after a long investigation the Iowa Board of Athletics relieved both Forest Evashevski and Ray Nagel of their respective duties on May 19. Nagel was rehired a few days later, but Evashevski was replaced as athletic director at Iowa by Bump Elliott. The news headlines reported Evashevski as resigning and Nagel as being fired. The Iowa Attorney General submitted a report to the Iowa Board of Athletics that stated, in part, \\"Mr. Evashevski's attitudes and other things he has done all tend to support the view of Coach Nagel and four of his five assistants that this is part of a vendetta against him...[Evashevski] did the university and people of Iowa, many of whom have almost worshiped him, a great disservice.\\" The Attorney General never interviewed Evashevski while investigating the issue. Personal life Evashevski retired at a relatively young age. He was only 42 when he retired from coaching and just 52 when he was fired as Iowa's athletic director. He briefly worked as a color analyst on ABC's college football coverage before moving back to northern Michigan. It was announced in mid-October 2009 that the 91-year-old Evashevski was battling cancer that had spread to his liver. He died on October 30, 2009. He was survived by his wife Ruth, seven children, 14 grandchildren, and five great grandchildren. Evashevski obit His youngest daughter, Kassie, is a literary agent in Los Angeles. During the game following Evashevski's death, Iowa paid tribute to the old coach by wearing a small sticker on their helmets that read \\"EVY\\", Evashevski's nickname.

It was written in 1905. As with much of Debussy's work, it is referred to as Impressionistic, meaning that it expresses emotions and senses by making use of non-functional harmony and ambiguous key signatures, its tonality being mainly non-diatonic and usually having a sense of modality. Musical analysis Reflets dans l'eau opens in a slow tempo (andantino molto) with a melody of A, F, E (which is repeated through much of the piece) while the right hand is playing a set of chords to accompany the melody. It shares the main characteristics of French music of this period, similar to works by Ravel such as Jeux d'eau. For instance, the piece is characterized by ambiguous and fast-changing harmonies. Stephen Walsh, \\"Debussy: A Painter in Sound\\" The piece has several brief melody statements and climaxes that are more glimpses of music than full ideas, which is typical of Debussy's middle and late piano works. By writing \\"images\\", Debussy was intending to depict a scene rather than create linear musical progression. This is one of the many pieces Debussy wrote about water; in particular, light reflecting off its surface, and ripples in the water moving outwards. The piece creates an image of water being not quite still, then becoming rapid, then decreasing in motion again. Reflets dans l'eau is also an example of the new tone colors Debussy discovered for the piano in this part of his life, and although he later refined this style, this piece is part of the greater achievements Debussy reached with the instrument.Lederer, Victor (2007).

Sweet and sour Bid-bid (Pacific Tenpounder) balls  Description  The Pacific ladyfish have very round bodies with terminal mouths, and profound gill formations known as pseudobranchiae. They have a larger number of dorsal fin rays than most Arizona fish, with numbers ranging from 27 to 35. Anal fin rays usually range from 13 to 19, and they have 12 to 16 pelvic rays. This species is very different from most chordates in that it has no conus arteriosus, a tendinous band of tissue from which the pulmonary artery arises. Because of this absence, they have a much smaller pulmonary artery. This fish's lateral lines are unbranched, and lateral line scales are usually within ranges of 95 to 120. All scales are silvery and cycloid, along with the overall color of the fish; however, yellow pigment can occur in the eyes. Some aids to identification include the prominent auxiliary and inguinal processes.  Distribution and habitat in Arizona  This species is restricted primarily to the Southwest United States. Most records come from the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California, as they spawn here and then travel southwest into Arizona. They were also common in the Salton Sea in California, but their numbers have been slowly declining. During floods, Pacific ladyfish enter the Lower Colorado River from the Gulf. They can be found in Yuma Colorado River portions, with records as far south as certain Mexican dams. Pacific tenpounders are primarily a marine form, meaning they require a higher salinity water content then most freshwater fish. Because of this, they have evolved efficient swimming techniques allowing them to swim in lagoons and estuaries with higher salinities. Their maximum depth is around .  Reproduction  This species uses a wide range of water salinities when spawning. Under normal conditions, the Pacific tenpounder are located in brackish water, but they travel deep into oceanic, salty waters for breeding. They place their eggs far from shore in more planktonic regions to provide them with nutrients as juveniles. The larvae look like eels at birth, but their forked tails distinguish them. Their young usually feed on the crustaceans in the brackish or coastal waters. This may explain their instinct to move from the Gulf of California into the Lower Colorado during flood conditions.  Biology  Pacific ladyfish are pelagic, marine forms preferring either brackish or fresh water unless they are breeding. They prefer specific water depths of no more than . Little is known about the ecology of this species, but they are known to be highly carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans. This behavior is very similar to their relative, the Atlantic ladyfish. Maximum size is relatively larger than most Arizona fish, reaching lengths of . A negative correlation exists between size and presence in the Colorado River. As they become larger in size, they enter more brackish waters for unknown reasons. Larval and juvenile stages of fish have large records of distribution near Rocky Point, in the Sea of Cortez tidal inlets. Their spawning areas are usually closer to coastal areas, because they use saltier waters for their young.  Threats  This species uses estuarine areas and hypersaline lagoons; changes in the quality of these habitats may affect this species' population dynamics. Although this species may not be closely associated with any single habitat, it may be adversely affected by development and urbanization.Adams, A. J., et al. (2014).

It is a rare species that is seldom found in the wild. The erect trunk is 4‚Äì5 m tall, approximately 10 cm in diameter and may be covered in stipe bases in the upper regions. C. baileyana is notable for being able to develop offshoots from the base of the trunk. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and may be exceptionally long, up to 7 m, though they are usually around 2‚Äì3 m. The rachis and stipe are dark to darkish red, scaly and may be warty, but lack spines. Scales on the rachis and stipe are purplish brown to black and have a long hair-like apex. Characteristically of this species, the last pair of pinnae are separated from the others along the rachis and may form a clump (the \\"wig\\") around the trunk apex. Sori are circular and occur in one to three rows along the pinnule midvein. They lack indusia. The specific epithet baileyana commemorates Australian botanist Frederick Manson Bailey (1827-1915). The common name \\"wig tree fern\\" refers to the pinnae that cluster around the crown of this species, forming a structure that resembles a wig. This \\"wig\\" is green in younger plants, but may become brownish in older specimens. Alsophila baileyana is a relatively slow-growing species. In cultivation, it should be able to withstand several degrees of frost. It is reportedly difficult to propagate.

History The band was formed in 1994 after drummer Al Sobrante (John Kiffmeyer) left the previous incarnations, The Ne'er Do Wells and Thee Shatners. Sobrante was replaced by drummer Julie Rose, formerly of Red No. 9\\\\. Julie remained with the band through the recording of the first Lookout! Records album Welcome To My Mind. The title track was a minor hit on college radio and modern rock stations. Julie left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Evan Mendel from Benicia. The band was asked to open for Green Day during the 1994 Dookie tour, along with Pansy Division. Evan left the band after the tour and was replaced by Danny Seelig from The Phantom Surfers. The band won a category in the 1996 Bay Area Music Awards (\\"Bammies\\") for \\"Outstanding Alternative Pop/Rock Group\\" and embarked on a tour in the United States and Japan with the Mr. T Experience. While on U.S. tour with The Queers, Jess and Danny both quit the band onstage after a fight. They returned to record the second album And A Whole Lotta You, but both were soon replaced with Steve Faine, previously of Decal and The Stimmies; and Gary Gutfeld of Redemption 87. The 1998 album Get Down followed. John Denery married Judy (from Judy and the Loadies), moved to Hawaii and back, and have two kids, while Chris Imlay became a graphic designer for such magazines as Gearhead, MacAddict, PlayStation: The Official Magazine, and Wired.

Created by Andr√© Franquin, it was first published in Tintin magazine on October 19, 1955. Publication history In 1955 comic-book artist Andr√© Franquin got into a dispute with Dupuis, the publishers of Spirou magazine, over financial arrangements concerning his characters. Since Franquin was unable to find the written confirmation of their agreement, he left to join the staff of the rival Tintin magazine, where he introduced the series Modeste et Pompon. Writers who contributed to the series included Ren√© Goscinny (the writer of Asterix), Peyo (creator of the Smurfs), Greg (another leading writer and artist) and even Franquin's mother-in-law. Franquin later found the written confirmation and the matter was settled with Dupuis. However, he was on a five-year contract with Tintin and was thus obliged to provide to both magazines, an unusual arrangement in the comic industry. He thus contributed a weekly page to Tintin and a weekly page-and-a-half to Spirou. In 1959 the publishers of Tintin bought the rights to the characters. Franquin's obligation to Tintin ended and he stuck to Spirou and Gaston Lagaffe. Modeste et Pompon continued until 1988, handled by other writers and artists. Characters F√©lix hurries off after a sale has gone wrong, Modeste is in a typical mood, Pompon appeals for calm and the boys look on. *Pompon is Modeste's best friend. Her main occupation is to appeal to him to stay calm. *Modeste is a short-tempered young suburbanite who is easily angered when things go wrong. Among those causing him to lose his cool are: *F√©lix, a friend and a cousin but also a pesky salesman whose products invariably lead to disaster; *A group of boys who are F√©lix's and Modeste's nephews, but who hang around Modeste most of the time; *Mister Dubruit, a neighbour with a noisy family (Du bruit is the French for \\"noise\\"), only featured by Goscinny; *Mister Ducrin, another neighbour with whom Modeste is always feuding, only featured by Greg; *Uncle Symphorien who sometimes stays with Modeste, bringing along his pet rooster Jules, whose crowing proves very trying to Modeste's nerves. Trivia After a short stay with his pet rooster, Modeste's uncle is about to leave for home and Modeste serves up a goodbye meal, the main course of which is coq au vin (\\"rooster with wine\\"). Uncle Symphorien suddenly has a horrid suspicion. \\"JULES!?!\\" \\"Ah! Ah! Ah! Er... a... a silly thought... Tee, hee, hee!... Yes! Silly!... Er... Pay no attention... Er, by the way, my train leaves at 6 tomorrow morning, nephew... Tee, hee!\\" Drawn by Franquin, written by Greg Franquin's period on the strip is seen as a good reflection of the fashions of the 1950s, from Pompon's dress to Modeste's modern furniture (which, along with his temper, rather belies his name). The items Felix tries to sell to Modeste include a TV remote control and a battery-powered drill which, though common enough today, were rather new at the time. The artists who succeeded Franquin updated the fashions to their own time periods and even removed Pompon's namesakes from her hair. When the group of boys were first introduced, they were F√©lix's five cousins. Later they became his nephews and numbered four before settling on just three. Franquin only named one of them: D√©d√©. Later writers varied the names. The boys appear to be identical and wear different-coloured shirts. At one stage Modeste was asked to look after a relative's baby and faced the dilemmas of feeding, changing and sleepless nights. This set of stories coincided with the early months of the life of Franquin's daughter Isabelle (who was to lend her name to another popular comic series in which her father was involved).

He represented Transcona on the Winnipeg City Council from 2002 to 2018, and at times served as a member of the city's executive policy committee. His father, Reg Wyatt, was a councillor from 1983 to 1986. Early life and career Wyatt studied Political Science at the University of Winnipeg and worked for the Wyatt Insurance Group, a family company, before entering public life.\\"Transcona\\", Winnipeg Votes 2006, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, accessed 8 February 2008; \\"Seeking city hall seats\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 July 1998.

In 1993, Wyatt recommended that the City of Winnipeg introduce \\"park-and-ride\\" areas to improve public transportation.Bill Redekop, \\"City agrees to study park-and- ride idea\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 July 1993. \\"Park-and-ride\\" areas are for drivers who choose to park their cars before taking public transportation. During the 1997 federal election, he argued that renewed debates over national unity were drawing attention away from pressing issues such as job creation, and credited the New Democratic Party as the only political party willing to discuss the economy.Russ Wyatt, letter, 2 June 1997, A11. He led a petition drive against bus fare increases in 1998.Kim Guttormson, \\"City budget plan secretive, too rushed, councillors told\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 February 1998, A4. Wyatt planned to run for city council in the 1998 municipal election with an endorsement from the New Democratic Party of Manitoba,Linda Quattrin, \\"10 New Democrats run under banner\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 August 1998, A3. but withdrew just before the nomination deadline.\\"Wyatt departs race; leaves two to vie for Transcona seat\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 October 1998, A8.

He called for improved municipal infrastructure, and an increased police presence in his ward.Carol Sanders, \\"Transcona win sends message: new councillor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 October 2002, A10. After the election, he was appointed to the city's protection and community services committee.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Rookies win plum positions on city council\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 2002, A6.

He also emerged as a prominent opponent of Mayor Glen Murray, with whom he frequently clashed at council meetings. Some accused Wyatt of grandstanding, and of acting in an undiplomatic manner toward other councillors.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Shouting match erupts between mayor, councillor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 July 2003, A3. ;Police services Wyatt opposed Winnipeg's 2002 police restructuring plan, in part because his ward was slated to lose its station to the St. Boniface area.Leah Hendry, \\"Police stations at risk\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 December 2002, A1; Leah Hendry, \\"Police station plan 'alienates' Transcona\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 January 2003, A6; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Councillor threatens to 'fight' city hall\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 2003, B3. Following unsuccessful attempts to block the plan on council, he launched a billboard campaign that called for Transconans to protest Murray's handling of the issue. Murray described this move as \\"very unprofessional\\", adding that it was based on the flawed assumption that he was personally driving the policy.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Councillor targets police station plans\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 July 2003, A7. Council approved the restructuring plan in July 2003.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"New police stations win council approval\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 July 2003, A3. ;Other issues Wyatt remained a vocal supporter of public transportation, and endorsed rapid transit services for Winnipeg in 2002.Leah Hendry, \\"Higher fares for bus riders get council OK\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 December 2002, A12. He opposed Mayor Murray's plans to introduce a sales tax, on the grounds that it would unfairly target the city's working and middle classes.Daniel Lett, \\"'Get off the fence,' Tory chief tells Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 September 2003, A6. He also proposed a \\"Taxpayer's Bill of Rights\\" in 2004, arguing that it could be used to give citizens a direct vote on new taxes and major capital investments.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Committee rejects bill of rights for city taxpayers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 2004, B3. Wyatt indicated his support for urban reserves in June 2003, as a means of alleviating poverty among aboriginal communities in Winnipeg.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Urban reserves to tackle poverty?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 June 2003, A1. In the same year, he argued that Winnipeg had fallen behind in its efforts to hire greater numbers of women and visible minorities, and called for a department-by-department investigation into the existing state of employment equity programs.Patti Edgar, \\"City slighting employment equity: Wyatt\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 May 2004, B2. He also opposed the possibility of private companies overseeing Winnipeg's trash services, arguing that municipal employees were more reliable.\\"Privatized garbage pickup debated\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 April 2004, A5. ;2004 mayoral election Glen Murray resigned as Mayor of Winnipeg in mid-2004 to run for the House of Commons of Canada. Wyatt considered running for mayor in the by-election that followed, but eventually chose to endorse Garth Steek. He said that he was impressed with Steek's \\"law and order\\" focus, and particularly his pledge to crack down on the Hells Angels biker gang.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Eight could run for mayor's crown\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 2004, B1; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Election battles begin brewing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 2004, B2; \\"Hockey, law and order take the podium\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 May 2004, A1. He later became disillusioned with the campaign, however, and suggested that Steek was actually trying to ensure the election of rival candidate Sam Katz by attacking Katz's more serious opponents and otherwise keeping a low profile.Patti Edgar, \\"Steek denies campaign winding down\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 June 2004, A1; Patti Edgar, \\"Mihychuk says Katz team made her unsolicited offer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 June 2004, B3.

He supported Katz's decision to shelve a rapid transit bus line in September 2004,Mary Agnes Welch, \\"City transit boss quits\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 September 2004, A1. and was appointed chair of the city's Rapid Transit Review Task Force the following month.\\"Who got what\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 October 2004, A8. After several months of public consultation, the force called for Winnipeg to re-establish a rapid transit plan with a more citywide focus.Leah Janzen, \\"$312-M transit vision unveiled\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 May 2005, A1; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"The path of least resistance\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 May 2005, B5. The task force later removed Katz's preferred option of a downtown light-rail system, following a second round of consultations. This created a rift between Katz and Wyatt, and by the summer of 2005 Wyatt had returned to his previous role as a critic of the administration.Patti Edgar, \\"Light-rail plan derailed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 July 2005, B1. The task force ultimately recommended a bus transit corridor.Bartley Kives, \\"The bus stops here\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 June 2008, B1. When the final report was submitted, Wyatt expressed concern that Katz's inner circle would cherry-pick its least expensive recommendations and simply ignore the rest.Patti Edgar, \\"Rapid transit years away\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 October 2005, B1. By 2008, he accused Winnipeg Transit of watering down the report beyond all recognition, and described the task force's work as a waste of public money.Bartley Kives, \\"Transit task force a $200,000 'waste'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 May 2008, A5. Veteran Winnipeg activist Nick Ternette criticized the task force's conclusions, arguing that light rail transit is more effective than bus rapid transit.Nick Ternette, \\"Light rail better than buses\\" [letter], Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 2008, A12. ;Other issues Wyatt opposed the provincial government's plan to construct the Waverley West suburb in 2005, arguing that it would incur significant infrastructural costs.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Waverley West rainy-day funds touted\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 January 2005, B1. He voted against Sam Katz's anti-panhandling bylaw later in the same year.Patti Edgar, \\"Panhandlers be warned\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 June 2005, B1. Wyatt supported malathion spraying to target the city's mosquito population,Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Looming infestation swats city's 'greener' approach\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 July 2005, A1. and supported an unsuccessful motion to introduce term limits in March 2006.Bartley Kives, \\"Council nixes vote on term limits\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 March 2006, B1. Wyatt also supported a similar motion in 2007.

Some described this as a savvy move on Katz's part, in that it would shift Wyatt's opposition from the council chamber to the political backrooms.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Vocal critic gets a promotion\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 November 2006, B1. Wyatt was also named chair of a municipal Red Tape Commission in February 2007, and was appointed to the municipal Housing Commission the following month.\\"Katz gives one-time critic Wyatt red-tape job\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 February 2007, Web Extra; \\"Katz names appointees to housing committee\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 2007, Web Extra. In April 2007, he recommended removing licences for home-based businesses. See Bartley Kives, \\"City 'cash grab' could be history\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 2007, B2. Wyatt openly disagreed with Katz on several issues. He was the only cabinet member to oppose the creation of an Assiniboine Park Conservancy in June 2007, arguing that he could not support more private-sector control of the city's parklands.Bartley Kives, \\"Save the park...and the riverbank...and our bridges...\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 June 2007, B2. In September 2007, he broke with the mayor and voted in favour of a proposed commission into police conduct.Bartley Kives, \\"Police service 'isn't working': Katz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 September 2007, A5. He later criticized Winnipeg's decision to ban pesticides, describing it as part of a \\"national fad\\".Bartley Kives, \\"Pesticide ban passes  with a bit of tweaking\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 May 2008, B3. He was strongly critical of Katz's decision to close the Disraeli Freeway for sixteen months in 2008, and to permit Canadian Pacific Railway queue-ups in the Transcona area. On one occasion, Wyatt argued that Katz was undermining Transcona's interests with these decisions, and accused him of supporting only \\"personal business friends or residents in places like South Tuxedo\\", an upscale south Winnipeg neighbourhood. Katz did not publicly reprimand Wyatt for these remarks, and kept him as a member of the municipal cabinet.Bartley Kives, \\"Katz's council allies become critics Disraeli Freeway, CPR issues spark rare attacks from two staunch supporters\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 June 2008, B1. Wyatt called for a single agency to manage Winnipeg's downtown development in February 2008, arguing that existing responsibilities were divided among too many organizations.Bartley Kives, \\"Who's driving this thing?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 February 2008, B2. He has also supported calls for a municipal integrity commissioner, with ombudsman powers over all municipal governments in Manitoba.Bartley Kives, \\"Letter to Katz in question in tax dispute - He said he wasn't involved in firm\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 September 2008, A3. Mayor Katz shuffled his municipal cabinet in October 2008, and gave Wyatt a new position as secretary of infrastructure renewal.\\"Katz shuffles council executive to seize 'renaissance\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 October 2008, A1. Bill Clement, who chairs Winnipeg's public works and infrastructure renewal committee, expressed concern that Wyatt's new responsibilities would overlap with his own. Katz rejected this suggestion.Bartley Kives, \\"Job overlap for councillors?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 November 2008, A3. One of Wyatt's first acts in his new position was to order a review of Winnipeg's unfunded infrastructure projects, which was issued in January 2009.Bartley Kives, \\"$2.1 billion Cost of infrastructure improvements planned by the city over the next six years\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 January 2009, B1. Following Katz's shuffle, Wyatt proposed the introduction of a 1% municipal sales tax to target road and bridge repairs. The provincial government was skeptical of the idea, and the Association of Manitoba Municipalities subsequently voted against pursuing the option.Bartley Kives, \\"NDP rebuffs call for sales tax levy by municipalities\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 2008, B3; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Municipalities drop bid for share of tax - infrastructure funding\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 November 2008, A5. As of 2008, Wyatt is Winnipeg's representative on the AMM board. See Bartley Kives and Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Why Manitoba municipalities are insisting on new sales tax\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 November 2008, A4. In November 2008, Wyatt tabled a motion to have Winnipeg's chief administrative officer devise with a strategy for reducing environmentally damaging plastic bags. The motion was passed by a vote of 7-0 by the executive policy committee.Joel Paraskevas, \\"Control of plastic bags back on councillors' plate\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 2008, A3. Wyatt later supported a proposal by Jim Maloway to expand Winnipeg's Disraeli Bridge from four lanes to six.Bartley Kives, \\"Strip off lawns sought for freeway\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 March 2009, B2. At a December 2008 meeting of the Executive Policy Committee, Wyatt and fellow councillor Mike Pagtakhan unexpectedly voted against a $476.1 million public works plan on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient resources for bicycle and pedestrian trails.Joe Paraskevas, \\"Bike paths split civic committee\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 December 2008, B3. Both councillors later tried, without success, to have expenditures for these trails added to the budget at a regular meeting of council.Joe Paraskevas, \\"Council refuses to budge on funds for bicycle paths\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 December 2008, B1. ;2010 election Russ Wyatt was re- elected in the 2010 Municipal Election defeating Vlad Kowalyk 9503 to 1885. = Bowman Administration = In October 2014, Brian Bowman was elected Mayor of Winnipeg. Wyatt was re-elected over his opponent, Ray Ulasy. Nearing the end of his term, Wyatt took a leave of absence from his duties as City Councillor to attend rehab for drug and alcohol abuse.

Early history of the property The earliest reference to the property of Wiawaka is in the tax records of the town of Caldwell (now Lake George) where it is referred to as the old \\"garrison ground\\".

Next, he enlarged the hotel, changing the name to Crosbyside, and housed several customers from cities who retreated to Lake George for a vacation in the country. With a new wave of tourism, Mr. Crosby was very successful and he soon built several Victorian cottages as lodging for his best and most loyal customers. These are Mayflower Cottage, c. 1873 and Rose Cottage, c. 1873. He also built a house for himself and his family soon after in 1876 (it was later named Fuller House). The Second Empire style residence is very little altered in its appearance today. In 1890s, Crosbyside was sold to a new owner and declined in the shadow of resorts like the bigger and more luxurious Fort William Henry Hotel.  \\"The Great Spirit of Woman\\" over the years  In 1902, Katrina Trask and her husband Spencer Trask acquired the property. Spencer and Katrina Trask built Wakonda Lodge, formerly called \\"Amitola\\", in 1905 as their first experiment in a building an artists' colony before receiving artists at Yaddo. The famous artist Georgia O'Keeffe later stayed in this lodge. Katrina gradually handed over her land to her friend Mary Wiltsie Fuller who had a vision of providing retreats from the polluted city to women factory workers from Troy (known then as The Collar City). Using the original structures built by Mr. Crosby, Mary Fuller opened her retreat center in 1903 and named it Wiawaka Holiday House. Wiawaka is derived from the Abenaki word meaning \\"The Great Spirit of Woman\\". Mary proved the existence of the collective \\"Great Spirit\\" as she formed a board of women to run and look out for the interests of Wiawaka. Eventually, Wiawaka added workshops covering different skills to add an additional dimension to the guests' vacations.  Today  Mary Fuller died in the 1940s, but her vision of providing vacations to hard working women continues today, although women of all socio-economic backgrounds are welcome. Wiawaka also takes pride in continuing to offer a diverse range of workshops like those held since its founding. These components combined with its historic foundation lay the cornerstones for its mission statement which follows: \\"Wiawaka is a non-sectarian retreat and educational center dedicated to enriching the lives of women, and helping disadvantaged women, including but not limited to women with disabilities, economically disadvantaged women, victims of domestic abuse, the elderly, and other women in transition, to develop skills and personal resources necessary to meet the challenges they face in life. Wiawaka is steward of the preservation, maintenance and operation of its historic property.\\" In order to give all women the opportunity to go to Wiawaka, room and board is offered on a sliding scale according to income. All three meals are served on site in the same communal dining room that guests have used since 1903. Today, a very diverse range of workshops are offered, all of which have been opened up to the public (the calendar is easily accessible on their website). Some recent workshop topics have included creative writing, poetry readings with Yaddo poet Joan Murray, holistic healing, yoga, quilting, historical lectures, jewelry making, and tours of the historic property. Not only have workshops been opened up to the public, but Wiawaka has also started to offer day use passes as well for those who are not overnight guests yet would like to take advantage of the serene property. Many of Wiawaka's guests return year after year to meet friends, attend workshops, volunteer, live the history, and take in the magical peace tranquility, and spirit that is Wiawaka.  Importance  Wiawaka is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under nine categories of significance and is listed by the National Park Service as a \\"Place Where Women Made History\\". Its place on the National Register is significant as the National Park Service holds high standards regarding the historic value of sites to which it grants this status. Its Victorian cottages, Adirondack lodge, and House of Trix (built directly over the water) are points of historic architectural interest and are listed on the register. A marker on the shore points out the location of the Wiawaka Bateaux which are also on the National Register of Historic Places.

Raj Ahten, fleeing the battlefield and struggling with wounds inflicted to him by Binnesman's wylde, encounters some of his flameweavers, who warn him that his earthly body is dying from the Earth's curse. However, Raj Ahten has no time to waste, as word reaches him that the Lord of the Underworld himself has arisen in Kartish, and he races off to defend his people. Meanwhile, Gaborn and his companions rest in the nearby village of Balington until dawn, when they will give chase to the fleeing Reaver horde. Binnesman, sensing strong Earth powers within Averan, promptly begins to train her, as well as train his own wylde, Spring. Binnesman also does his best to heal the injured Sir Borenson, and Gaborn, upon learning of Averan's special powers, hatches a plan to track down and extract information from the Waymaker, the only Reaver that knows the underworld path to the One True Master of the Reavers. While Erin Connal and Prince Celinor travel north to gain support for the Earth King, Gaborn and his company move south, attacking and harassing the Reavers whenever possible. Borenson and Myrrima travel south towards Inkarra, to seek out Daylan Hammer, the Sum of All Men, and to ask the Storm King Zandaros for aid. In a final battle, Gaborn and his warriors defeat the remaining Reavers, sending the few remaining creatures scuttling back into the underworld. Averan finds the Waymaker and learns from him the path to the One True Master, afterwards agreeing to lead Gaborn to him. Raj Ahten, after a disastrous battle against the Reavers in his own nation of Indhopal, manages to slay the Reaver Fell Mage, but his own life fails him. In order to remain in the world of the living, he gives himself to the element fire, transforming into Scathain, Lord of Ash. Borenson and Myrrima are attacked by wights on their journey to Inkarra, and Myrrima apparently dies from her wounds. Stunningly though, she comes back from near death, and we learn that she is in fact a water wizard.

Taking Binnesman, Averan, and Iome with him, he seeks the Lair of Bones in the heart of the Reavers' home. As he descends, Gaborn's powers grow as he takes many endowments, vectored through his dedicates. Gaborn and his companions follow the trail of the previous Earth King, Erden Geboren, to its furthest, and when attacked by Reavers, they are forced to leave Binnesman behind and press on without him. Meanwhile, Borenson and Myrrima venture into Inkarra in search of Daylan Hammer, only to be captured and brought before King Zandaros. The forces of Raj Ahten, fresh off their victory over the Reavers, march north to Carris once more. Erin and Celinor meet Celinor's father, King Anders, who claims to be the new Earth King after Gaborn's loss of power, and they are forced to follow him south into Mystarria. During all this, mysterious earthquakes and countless falling stars herald the very world's shifting in the heavens, as the chaotic forces of destruction seek to unmake the Earth, as the One True Master attempts to bind the Rune of Desolation with the Runes of the Inferno and the Heavens. When Averan is captured by a Reaver, Gaborn has no choice but to leave Iome behind and press forth on his own. Eventually, he reunites with Averan, Iome, and the wylde, and he begins slaying dedicate Reavers of the One True Master. Meanwhile, Borenson and Myrrima escape Inkarra with the help of a Days named Sarka Kaul.

Also near Carris are the massed armies of Raj Ahten, Queen Lowicker of Beldinook, and King Anders of South Crowden. Right before the Reaver attack, Binnesman arrives at Carris to aid his fellow men for one last time. In the underworld, while Averan attempts to destroy the Rune of Desolation, Gaborn battles the One True Master. With the battle raging at Carris, Gaborn, with aid from the Earth, the wylde, and Glories and with Iome slaying dedicate vectors to the One True Master, is able to defeat the Reaver queen, and Averan, instead of destroying the Rune of Desolation combines it with the four other heavenly runes, creating a perfect rune to heal the Earth. With the One True Master's host dead, the remaining Reavers at the Battle of Carris flee to the underworld, and the Earth transports Gaborn, Iome, and Averan to the battlefield. Raj Ahten, seeing his chance to finally kill Gaborn, rejects the Earth King's guidance and is subsequently struck by an ensorcelled arrow, shot by Myrrima. Before he can recover, Raj Ahten is attacked by dozens of Runelords, who hack his body to pieces and throw him in the river, killing the man and drowning the fire spirit within him.

The ordinary mixer has two input signals and one output signal. If the two input signals are sinewaves at frequencies f1 and f2, then the output signal consists of frequency components at the sum f1+f2 and difference f1‚àíf2 frequencies. In contrast, the harmonic and subharmonic mixers form sum and difference frequencies at a harmonic multiple of one of the inputs. The output signal then contains frequencies such as f1+kf2 and f1‚àíkf2 where k is an integer. Background The classic frequency mixer is a multiplier. Multiplying two sinewaves produces just the sum and difference frequencies; the input frequencies are suppressed, and, in theory, there are no other heterodyne products. In practice, the multiplier is not perfect, and the input frequencies and other heterodyne products will be present. An actual multiplier is not needed. The significant requirement is a nonlinearity, and at microwave frequencies it is easier to use a nonlinearity rather than an ideal multiplier. A Taylor series expansion of a nonlinearity will show multiplications that give rise to the desired higher order products. Design goals for mixers seek to select the desired heterodyne products and suppress the undesired ones. Diode mixers. Overdriven diode bridge mixers. Drive signal looks like odd harmonic waveform (essentially a square wave). Harmonic mixer One classic design for a harmonic mixer uses a step recovery diode (SRD).. RF input is 0.11 to 18.0 GHz; LO 62 to 154 MHz; output 20.278 MHz. See page 8-39. For step recovery circuit and power spectra, see page 8-35. The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1 watt. That signal then drives a step recovery diode impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18 GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a diode mixer (also called a sampler). The SRD usually has a very high frequency multiplication ratio, and can be used as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once. This forms the basis of many simple 'bug detectors' where the intention is to detect transmission on any frequency, even if not known in advance. (This is not the same as a 'rake' receiver which is a correlation device.) When the required frequency multiple is lower, such as doubling, tripling or quadrupling, then Schottky diode circuits are more common. The conduction angle can be adjusted by changing drive level or temperature, and determines which part of the I/V curve is used and therefore the relative strengths of the different harmonically related outputs. If an even multiple is desired then an anti-parallel pair of diodes will suppress the odd local oscillator contribution, to the level that the diodes can be made identical and experience the same source impedance. Unlike a normal mixer, there is a fairly clear optimum drive level, above which the conversion loss increases. A harmonic mixer can be used to avoid the complexity of generating a microwave local oscillator, and is common as a simple and reliable frequency extender to a low frequency design.An example home made spectrum analyzer using harmonic mixer techniques Usage Subharmonic mixers (a particular form of harmonic mixer where the LO is provided at a sub multiple of the frequency to be mixed with the incoming signal) are often used in direct-digital, or zero IF, communications system in order to eliminate the unwanted effects of LO self- mixing which occurs in many fundamental frequency mixers. Used in frequency synthesizers and network analyzers. A variation on the subharmonic mixer exists that has two switching stages is used to improved mixer gain in a direct downconversion receiver. The first switching stage mixes a received RF signal to an intermediate frequency that is one-half the received RF signal frequency. The second switching stage mixes the intermediate frequency to baseband. By connecting the two switching stages in series, current is reused and harmonic content from the first stage is fed into the second stage thereby improving the mixer gain.

The Crown Mission Carter was born in Birmingham. He took over England's first Pentecostal Bible School. In 1913 an organization called the Crown Mission began in the city, and shortly afterwards Carter became the leader of this group. By 1916 he became involved in a second Pentecostal work, and had to quit his regular work to maintain leadership of the two churches. In prison In World War I, Carter was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs as a conscientious objector, and then spent time in Princetown Work Centre in the former Dartmoor Prison. While in prison he received the revelation of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. These teachings, based on the text of 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, are still used today as the primary teaching on the gifts of the Spirit within all major Pentecostal Christian belief systems. From 4 September 1918 to 11 June 1919 he was a 'brother' on the staff of Wallingford Farm Training Colony, an institution run by the National Union for Christian Social Service for 'difficult' boys mainly referred by Boards of Guardians.Register of Brothers, Turners Court Youth Trust Archive, Oxon County Record Office Hampstead Bible School In 1921, Carter was handed over leadership of Hampstead Bible School, originally to be on a temporary basis until a more suitable person was available to fill the opening. That never happened, as he held this position for some 27 years. Under Carter's leadership the school grew so much that they had to purchase a nearby house, and two more Bible schools were opened up. He took his work so seriously at the school that he did not receive any of the money donated to the school for his own use unless it was marked specifically for him, and he paid his own room and board to the school out of his salary. Assemblies of God Howard Carter later became a founding member of Assemblies of God in Great Britain and Ireland.John Nelson Parr, Incredible (published by the author, Fleetwood, Lancs., England, 1972), Chapters 6 and 7, and Appendix A. He served on the General Council of these groups as vice-chairman 1929-1934, and as chairman 1934-1945. His final days Howard Carter left the Hampstead Bible School in 1948 and moved to the United States where he eventually married Ruth (Fisher) Steelberg. She was the daughter of Elmer Kirk Fisher, who was the founder of the Upper Room Mission in Los Angeles, California. She had previously been married to Wesley Rowland Steelberg, who was general superintendent of the Assemblies of God U.S.A. Steelberg had died while on a trip to Wales in 1952. Carter spent the rest of his life in the U.S., and began to travel extensively as a preacher until his death in Springfield, Missouri, in 1971. His final days lasted 23 years. Lester Sumrall  Howard Carter and Lester Sumrall first met in Eureka Springs, Arkansas when Carter was in his forties and Sumrall was in his early twenties. They formed an immediate relationship and traveled the world together as missionaries preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Sumrall wrote about Carter in his books Adventuring with Christ and Pioneers of Faith. Sumrall also expounded on Carter's teachings of the nine gifts of the Spirit in his book The Gifts and Ministries of the Holy Spirit.Although Carter played such a significant part in the expansion of the Pentecostal message throughout the world, few of his recorded sermons exist to today. One sermon is available for sale through the Flower Pentecostal Heritage Center, of the Assemblies of God, in Springfield, Missouri.

Commanded for almost its whole existence by Lieutenant General Boris Shteifon, it served primarily as a guard force for factories and mines between late 1941 and early 1944, initially as the \\"Separate Russian Corps\\" then Russian Factory Protective Group. It was incorporated into the Wehrmacht on 1 December 1942 and later clashed with the communist-led Yugoslav Partisans and briefly with the Chetniks. In late 1944, it fought against the Red Army during the Belgrade Offensive, later withdrawing to Bosnia and Slovenia as the Germans retreated from the Balkans. After Shteifon‚Ä≤s death in Zagreb, the Independent State of Croatia, on 30 April 1945, Russian Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin took over and led his troops farther north to surrender to the British in southern Austria. Unlike most other Russian formations that fought for Nazi Germany, Rogozhin and his men, who were not formally treated as Soviet citizens, were exempt from forced repatriation to the Soviet Union and were eventually set free and allowed to resettle in the West. Background and formation In the Balkans before World War II there were approximately 15,000 White Russian √©migr√©s who had fled there in the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution. On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. The country was then dismembered, with Serbia being reduced to its pre-1912 borders and placed under German military occupation. General Milan Nediƒá, a pre-war politician who was known to have pro-Axis leanings, was then selected by the Germans to lead the collaborationist Government of National Salvation in the German occupied territory of Serbia. Over the course of the Uprising in Serbia in the summer of 1941, the communist-led Partisans killed approximately 300 Russian √©migr√©s and injured many more, sometimes in acts of vengeance. In response, local Russians began to organize themselves into self-defense units. At the time, there were an estimated 10,000 Russian men within the borders of Yugoslavia, the majority of whom lived in occupied Serbia. alt=a map The Russian Protective Corps was founded in Belgrade under the command of General Mikhail Skorodumov on 12 September 1941, and was initially known as the \\"Separate Russian Corps\\" (). It was established by an order of the German Military Commander in Serbia, General der Flieger Heinrich Danckelmann, with the agreement of the Nediƒá regime. The key German personality involved in organising the Corps was Danckelmann's chief of staff, Oberst Erich Kewisch. Recruitment and screening of volunteers was carried out by Major General Vladimir Kreyter, a White Russian √©migr√© in German service who was the head of the Russian Intelligence Office () in Serbia. Its initial manpower was drawn from √©migr√© White Russians and officers of the Russian Imperial Army, which had been defeated by the communists in the Russian Civil War twenty years earlier. They had been living in occupied Serbia, and sided with the Germans because of their opposition to communism, and because they believed that their only hope of a non-communist Russia lay in a German victory in World War II. Skorodumov's concept of the Corps was that once the Corps had fulfilled its obligation to Serbia, the land that had taken them in, they would go to Russia to fight. The force was renamed the \\"Russian Factory Protective Group\\" () on 2 October. Due to age, illness, and his lack of familiarity with the rank and file of White Russian √©migr√©s, Skorodumov was replaced within a month by his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Boris Shteifon, who was said to have had \\"warm and friendly relations with [Milan] Nediƒá.\\" It was envisaged by the Germans that the new force would be 3,000-strong and organized into three regiments, tasked with protecting factories, other industrial concerns, and mines that were producing materials to support the German war effort. The Corps initially consisted of a single regiment, organized into four battalions. Major General Egorov commanded the 1st Battalion, Colonel Shatilov the second, Colonel Endrzheevskiy the third, and Colonel Nestrenko the fourth. A second regiment was set up on 18 October, commanded by Colonel Zhukov. At first, the group was an independent force reporting to the German plenipotentiary general for economic affairs, NSFK-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Franz Neuhausen. Operations =General= Although its ultimate aim was to help defeat the communist forces in the Soviet Union, the Corps was used almost exclusively to fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest operational unit. The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger √©migr√©s and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian √©migr√©s living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its command language was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained good relations with the Nediƒá administration. While guarding facilities, members of the Corps were largely assigned to manning brick bunkers, protecting the railway in the Ibar River valley, the Bor, Trepƒça, Majdanpek, and Krupanj mines, as well as the borders of the occupied territory along the Danube and Drina rivers. They were often deployed alongside various Serbian collaborationist forces such as the Serbian State Guard (SDS) and the Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK), with whom they were most closely allied. The Corps also closely cooperated with the Croatian fascist Usta≈°e when operating in the neighbouring NDH. Members of the Corps also plundered peasants in the areas within which they operated. =Early actions= The Corps was initially used to guard mines at Krupanj in the west of the territory, and later at Bor in the west and Trepƒça in the south. The 1st Regiment was initially deployed in Loznica, Ljubovija and other towns along the Drina river, which formed the western border of the occupied territory. The 2nd Regiment first operated in towns such as Negotin, Bor, and Majdanpek near the eastern border with Romania. At the time, the two regiments were operationally subordinated to the German 704th Infantry Division. In November 1941, the Corps began actively collaborating with the Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá against the Partisans. On 8 December 1941, the Corps defended the Stolice mine near Krupanj against the Partisans. By late 1941, it had 1,500 members. The 3rd Regiment was established in Banjica near Belgrade on 8 January 1942, placed under the command of Colonel Shapilov, and deployed to Kosovska Mitrovica near the Trepƒça mines in the south, where it was operationally subordinated to the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps. The 4th Regiment was established on 29 April with General Cherepov as commander and was deployed to the central west region of the occupied territory area around Kraljevo. In May, the Corps was divided into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was placed under the command of Major General Dratsenko and its headquarters was established in the town of Aranƒëelovac on 22 May. Also in May, Kewisch submitted a report stating that if he were permitted to recruit from all areas of Europe under German control, he could raise a force of about 25,000 men. He also urged the higher authorities to re-organise the Corps and integrate it more closely with the Wehrmacht. After considerable discussion, on 29 October the German High Command ordered a re-organization, renaming it the \\"Russian Protective Corps\\" and subordinating it completely to the German Commanding General in Serbia. On 30 November, the 4th Regiment was disbanded, its 1st Battalion assigned to the 1st Regiment and the rest of its manpower assigned to the 2nd Regiment. On 1 December 1942, the Corps was incorporated into the Wehrmacht and all its members were required to swear an oath to German leader Adolf Hitler. The Corps grew in numbers throughout 1942, following an influx of volunteers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Greece. By late 1942, the Corps totalled about 7,500 men, all of whom were Russian. During the re- organization, an attempt was made to expand the Corps further by recruiting Soviet POWs, but the first experiment with 300 POWs proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. On 9 December 1942, the 1st Regiment started to be transformed with the arrival of Kuban Cossacks led by Major General Naumenko. By January 1943, it consisted entirely of Cossacks. On 17 March 1943, Major General Gontarev replaced Shapilov as commander of the 3rd Regiment. The 1st Regiment fought in Loznica in April and participated in a large operation in Zapolje just south of Krupanj over the border with the NDH on 11‚Äì15 May, where it engaged in heavy combat with Partisan forces. From 1‚Äì8 July, the regiment was again stationed in Loznica and Ljubovija, participating in the defence of the Drina Bridge at Zvornik against the Partisans. During this time the regiment allowed the passage of 379 wounded Croatian soldiers and civilians, 1,000 healthy soldiers and as many refugees, sustaining casualties of two killed and seventeen wounded. It clashed with the Partisans over the village of Nedelica on 19 July. Meanwhile, the 2nd Regiment clashed with the Partisans around the town of Negotin. The 4th Regiment was re-established on 15 December, and was based in Jagodina, Paraƒáin and ƒÜuprija in the centre of the occupied territory. =Retreat, surrender, disbandment= From the spring of 1944, the Corps focused increasingly on fighting the Partisans penetrating Serbia from Bosnia and the Sand≈æak, and the first clashes with Chetnik groups did not occur until 1944. On 5 January 1944, combat with the Partisans in Klenak resulted in the deaths of three Cossacks of the 1st Regiment. On 18 January, the 5th Regiment was formed in Obrenovac. The 3rd Regiment outfought a 2,400-strong Partisan force advancing towards Jo≈°aniƒçka Banja on 31 March. On 28 April, the 1st Regiment prepared defences along the Drina in Zvornik, Bajina Ba≈°ta and Loznica areas expecting the 16th and 17th Partisan Divisions to attempt a crossing there. On 30 April, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment was moved to Aleksinac. On 1‚Äì2 May, the 5th Regiment fought the Partisans in the village of Mravinci, sustaining casualties of 11 killed and 25 wounded. That summer, the Corps mediated an agreement between one group of Chetniks and the Germans in which the two parties agreed to fight the Partisans in Serbia. On 18 July, the 5th Regiment fought in Jo≈°aniƒçka Banja and its regimental headquarters was moved there from Obrenovac, with battalion headquarters being established in Zveƒçan, Jo≈°aniƒçka Banja, U≈°ƒáe and Vuƒçitrn. Elements of the 3rd and 5th Regiments fought the Partisans on 4‚Äì5 August near the village of Rudnik. The Partisans attacked the positions of the 5th Regiment in Leposaviƒá on 24 August. In September, the Corps reached its peak of 11,197 members. Several skirmishes occurred between the 1st Regiment and the Partisans in the Zvornik and Valjevo areas that month. On 7/8 September, the 2nd Regiment fought Partisans at the Ibar River, trying to deny them crossing. On 9 September, elements of the 3rd Regiment moved to Po≈æega and on 11 September to ƒåaƒçak. On 20 September, the 1st Regiment fought a group of Partisans south of Loznica. Major combat between the 1st Regiment and Partisans erupted in Loznica itself on 23 September, causing the regiment to fall back to ≈†abac with losses of 7 killed and 23 wounded. Combat continued daily throughout September with the 1st Regiment suffering up to 53 casualties per day. On 22 September, combined Soviet Red Army and Bulgarian People's Army forces began entering the occupied territory from the east, and joined Partisan forces as part of the Belgrade Offensive, aimed at capturing the Serbian capital. On 8 October, the 2nd Regiment headquarters in Po≈æarevac was evacuated as Soviet armour approached the town. As parts of the regiment moved towards Belgrade and Grocka, they came into contact with Soviet troops and armour in the Ripanj area south of Belgrade, sustaining heavy casualties. On 10 October the Russian Protective Corps was renamed the \\"Russian Corps in Serbia\\". On 15 October, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment was moved to ƒåaƒçak. Elements of the 2nd Regiment arrived in ≈†abac on 22 October, then moved to Hrvatska Mitrovica in the NDH on 23 October, Vukovar two days later, Osijek on 26 October and then to Vinkovci and Stari Jankovci two days later. Further parts of the regiment moved to Zemun on 13 October, Ruma on 14 October, Vinkovci on 16 October, and Stari Jankovci on 24 October. On 19‚Äì22 October, the 4th Regiment fought advancing Soviet troops and Partisans and defended the ƒåaƒçak-Kraljevo road. On 23 October, the 1st Regiment abandoned ≈†abac and Klenak and moved to Laƒáarak, and then to Tovarnik on 24 October where they were ordered to hold their ground. The 4th Regiment fought in the ƒåaƒçak area from 27 October to 2 November. It faced the Red Army and the Chetnik 2nd Ravna Gora Corps before being overpowered and forced to abandon the city. The Chetniks captured 339 of its soldiers and turned them over to the Soviets. On 12 November, the 1st Regiment moved via railway through Vinkovci to Brƒçko, with elements deployed north across the Sava in Gunja. On 8 December it regrouped north of the Sava and on 11‚Äì13 December it fought the Partisans in and near the village of Vrbanja, killing forty-three. The 4th Regiment arrived in Sarajevo in the NDH on 13‚Äì18 December. Elements subsequently moved to nearby Kiseljak on 18 December, fighting Partisans in the Kiseljak-Busovaƒça area on 26‚Äì27 December. During this time, the 1st Regiment and a battalion of the 2nd Regiment guarded a bridgehead north of Brƒçko in order to allow German forces to withdraw through the town. In January 1945, elements of the Corps participated in the German capture of Travnik, part of Operation Lawine. Afterwards, they withdrew to Slovenia. On 30 April, Shteifon died while passing through Zagreb, in the Esplanade hotel; Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin took over as commander. On 12 May, Rogozhin surrendered to the British near Klagenfurt. At the time of surrender, the Corps consisted of 4,500 men, according to Pu≈°kadija-Ribkin; 3,500 men, according to Granitov. Timofejev writes that the Corps consisted of 5,584 men by the end of the war. Between 1941 and 1945, 6,709 of its members were killed, wounded or went missing. In total, 17,090 men served in its ranks over the course of the war. According to Rogozhin, several hundred men and their families, who had fled the camp in Lienz and who were subject to forced repatriation to the USSR, joined the Russian Corps from mid-June 1945 in order to avoid deportation to the Soviet Union. Rogozhin‚Ä≤s men were spared that fate because they were not regarded as Soviet citizens. After examining the history of the Corps, the British decided to demobilise it in October. Its members were then sent in the Kellerberg Camp northwest of Villach, Austria; Rogozhin on 1 November 1945 issued an order that notified his subordinates of demobilisation. Former members of the Corps were subsequently allowed to resettle in the West, mainly in the United States and Argentina. Order of battle At its maximum strength, the Russian Corps was composed of: *1st Cossack Regiment General Zborovski *Infantry Regiments II, III, IV, V In May 1942, the Corps was divided into two brigades. The 4th Regiment was disbanded on 30 November 1942, and re-established on 15 December 1943. The 5th Regiment was created on 18 January 1944. Commanders The Russian Corps had three commanders during its existence: Uniform Members of the Corps wore the uniform of the Russian Imperial Army from 12 September 1941 to 30 November 1942 as well as the Czechoslovakian helmet. The uniform was sometimes worn with pips of the Royal Yugoslav Army, alongside special rank insignia on the collar. Wehrmacht uniforms and insignia were adopted on 1 December 1942, but the old uniforms continued to be worn for some time. Notes References ;Books       ;Journals * Further reading  M.V.

It runs from Loudonville to Troy and traverses the Hudson River via the Menands Bridge. NY 378 once connected to Menands Road in the village of Menands; however, Menands Road has since been split in two by a now-closed exit ramp. NY 378 connects the western part of Menands Road with Troy. It also connects with NY 377 at Van Rensselaer Boulevard. NY 378 continues west of U.S. Route 9 (US 9) as Osborne Road (County Route 154). At its eastern terminus, NY 378 continues north as US 4\\\\. US 4 southbound is accessed by an eastward turn at the terminus.  Route description  NY 378 eastbound through Colonie NY 378 begins at an intersection with US 9 (Loudon Road) in the Loudonville section of Colonie as a continuation of County Route 154 (Osborne Road). NY 378 progresses southeast as Menand Road, a two-lane residential street through Colonie. The road expands to four lanes before intersecting with the northern terminus of NY 377 (Van Rennselaer Boulevard). After this intersection, NY 378 becomes a divided four-lane arterial, crossing eastbound through Colonie and into Menands. The route turns to the northeast, passing to the north of Ganser-Smith Memorial Park, crosses over a railroad line via a bridge, before entering into an interchange with NY 32 (Broadway). NY 378 becomes further divided into six lanes for a short distance after NY 32, entering interchange 7E and 7W of Interstate 787. NY 378 goes back to four lanes before crossing the Hudson River on the Menands Bridge, entering the city of Troy. Crossing over another railroad line on the other shore, NY 378 becomes known as High Street before curving northbound and terminating at an intersection with US 4 (Mill Street / Burden Avenue) in Troy. History NY 378 was assigned in the mid-1930s to Menands Road, a short connector road between US 9 in Loudonville and NY 32 in Menands. The Troy‚ÄìMenands Bridge linking Menands to Troy was initially unnumbered. In the early 1940s, NY 2 was extended south from Troy to downtown Albany by way of the bridge. NY 378 was realigned east of NY 377 in the early 1950s to follow a new highway connecting directly to the Troy‚ÄìMenands Bridge. On January 1, 1970, NY 2 was truncated to Troy on its western end.

He founded Kenzo, a worldwide brand of perfumes, skincare products, and clothes, and was the honorary president of the Asian Couture Federation. Early life Takada was born on 27 February 1939 in Himeji, Hy≈çgo Prefecture. He was one of seven children of Kenji and Shizu Takada, who ran a hotel. His love for fashion developed at an early age, particularly through reading his sisters' magazines. He briefly attended Kobe City University of Foreign Studies, but after his father died during Takada's first year at university, he withdrew from the program against his family's wishes. In 1958, he enrolled at Tokyo's Bunka Fashion College, which had then just opened its doors to male students. During his time at Bunka, Takada won a fashion design competition, the Soen Award, in 1961. At this time, Takada gained experience working in the Sanai department store, where he designed up to 40 outfits a month as a girl's clothing designer. Takada was inspired by Paris, especially designer Yves Saint Laurent. His interest in Paris was further fostered by his teacher at Bunka, Chie Koike, who was educated at L'√âcole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. In preparation for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the government demolished Takada's apartment in 1964, providing him with some monetary compensation. Under the advice of his mentor, and using his compensation money, Takada went on a month-long trip by boat to Paris, stopping along the way at various cities like Hong Kong, Saigon, Mumbai, and Marseille. He ultimately arrived at the Gare de Lyon train station on 1 January 1965. Takada's first impression of Paris was that it was \\"dismal and bleak\\", but began to warm to the city when his taxi took him past the Notre Dame de Paris, which he described as \\"magnificent\\". Fashion career Bottle of the fragrance Flower by Kenzo Takada initially struggled in Paris, selling sketches of designs to fashion houses for each. He had intended to leave Paris for Japan after a few months, but vowed not to do so until he had created something there, as he was determined to open a boutique fashion house in an area where his peers had not opened one. During this time, Takada worked as a stylist at a textile manufacturer named Pisanti. In 1970, while at a flea market, Takada met a woman who wanted to rent out a small space in the Galerie Vivienne to him cheaply. Takada accepted the offer, and opened up shop as a designer. With very little money to work with, he mixed and matched $200 in fabrics from the Saint Pierre market in Montmartre, creating an eclectic and bold first fashion collection. Takada presented the collection at his first fashion show at the Galerie Vivienne. With no money to afford professional fashion models for the event, Takada and his friends opted to paint the pimples of an acne-covered model green. Inspired by painter Henri Rousseau, and in particular The Dream, Takada painted the interior of his shop with a jungle-like floral aesthetic. Wanting to combine the jungle aesthetic with his homeland, the designer decided to name his first store \\"Jungle Jap\\". The store's name did not go without controversy: in 1971, the Japanese American Citizens League issued a summons to Takada while on his first visit to the United States, challenging him to remove the word \\"Jap\\" from his business's name. However, the State supreme court upheld the ability to use the term as part of a trademark the following year. Takada and his team opted to rename the brand once Takada returned to France. Takada's efforts paid off quickly ‚Äì in June 1970, Elle featured one of his designs on its cover. He moved locations from the Galerie Vivienne to the Passage Choiseul in 1970. Takada's collection was presented in New York City and Tokyo in 1971. The next year, he won the Fashion Editor Club of Japan's prize. In October 1976, Takada opened his flagship store, Kenzo, in the Place des Victoires. Takada proved his sense of dramatic appearance when, in 1978 and 1979, he held his shows in a circus tent, finishing with horsewomen performers wearing transparent uniforms and he himself riding an elephant. Takada even had the chance to direct a film called Yume, yume no ato, which was released in 1981. left Takada's first men's collection was launched in 1983. In August 1984, The Limited Stores announced that they had signed Takada to design a less-expensive clothing line called Album by Kenzo. A children's line called Kenzo Jungle, as well as men's and women's jeans, was released in 1986. Takada also made ventures into the perfume business. He first experimented with perfumes by releasing King Kong in 1980, which he created \\"just for fun\\". In 1988, his women's perfume line began with Kenzo de Kenzo (now known as √áa Sent Beau), Parfum d'√©t√©, Le monde est beau, and L'eau par Kenzo. Kenzo pour Homme was his first men's perfume (1991). FlowerbyKenzo, launched in 2000, was listed by Vogue's website as one of the best classic French perfumes of all time. In 2001, a skincare line, KenzoKI was also launched. Since 1993 the brand Kenzo is owned by the French luxury goods company LVMH. In 2016, he created a perfume for Avon. Retirement from and subsequent activity in the fashion industry Takada in June 2008 Takada announced his retirement in 1999 to pursue a career in art, leaving Roy Krejberg and Gilles Rosier to handle the design of Kenzo's men's and women's clothing, respectively. However, in 2005 he reappeared as a decoration designer presenting Gokan Kobo (‰∫îÊÑüÂ∑•Êàø \\"workshop of the five senses\\"), a brand of tableware, home objects, and furniture. After a few years off, he wanted to take a new direction, stating \\"when I stopped working five years ago, I went on vacation, I rested, I traveled. And when I decided to work again, I told myself it would be in decoration, more than fashion.\\" Additionally, in 2013 Kenzo joined the Asian Couture Federation as the organisation's inaugural Honorary President. In 2010 Kenzo's paintings were the subject of a one-man exhibition in Paris titled \\"Un Certain Style de Vie\\", A Certain Way of Life\\". Takada was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 2 June 2016. He was further honored by a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 55th Fashion Editors' Club of Japan Awards in 2017. That same year, Takada unveiled a new collection with Roche Bobois, giving its Mah Jong sofa new upholstery and creating a line of ceramics. Following his departure from the fashion industry, Takada occasionally ventured back into fashion. In 2019 he designed costumes for a production of Madama Butterfly by the Tokyo Nikikai Opera Foundation. He also used his eye for design in other ways, collaborating with the Mandarin Oriental Jumeira in Dubai to design the hotel's first publicly- displayed Christmas tree during the 2019 holiday season. In January 2020, Takada announced that he would be launching a new lifestyle brand named K3. The brand made its first appearance on 17 January 2020 at the Maison et Objet trade show, as well as in a Parisian showroom.  Personal life and death Takada was in a relationship with Xavier de Castella, who died in 1990 from an AIDS-related illness. De Castella helped design Takada's 14,000-square-foot Japanese-style house, which started construction in 1987 and was completed in 1993. Takada died on 4 October 2020 from complications of COVID-19 while hospitalized at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He was 81 years old.

It was built between 1970 and 1978 together with the Mohelno Dam as a water source for the nearby Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. As it has the fastest-starting turbines of all dams in Czech republic (less than 1 minute to full power) it also acts as emergency source in case some of the reactors in Dukovany shut down (for that reason it was also initially equipped with total capacity of 450 MW to back-up one of the four 440MWe VVER440 reactors). Thanks to the turbine capability to act as pumps it also plays significant balancing role for distributing network when it pumps water back to the higher reservoir during the night, and uses it again to produce electricity during the daily consumption peaks. The gravity dam is high (the highest in the Czech Republic, second-highest rockfill dam in Europe), so the reservoir is also the deepest in the Czech Republic . The reservoir has a capacity of . Mohelno Dam The Mohelno Dam is through-flow dam, acting as the lower reservoir of the Dale≈°ice-Mohelno pump-dam complex. The gravity concrete dam is long, 7.75/32 m wide and 38.65 m tall. It creates 7-km-long lake and has total capacity of . It includes single Kaplan turbine (1.2 MW) and single Francis turbine (0.6 MW). In case of total blackout, the Mohelno turbines can jumpstart the Dale≈°ice Francis turbines and together start the Dukovany NPP. Thanks to this the whole Dale≈°ice-Dukovany complex is certified for fully autonomous operation independent of the external distribution network.

These speed tests also helped promote sales from Renault's newest car in the United States, the Dauphine. The √âtoile Filante later appeared at motor shows all over the world. In the early 1960s, however, the end of the gas-turbine era stopped Renault from making a second car, and its speed record was neglected. In the mid 1990s, Renault decided to restore the car, with a view to getting it running again. Renault completely dismantled the car at its Billancourt factory in Paris, respraying the chassis and repairing the engine. In front of an expectant crowd, the car was fired up and moved under its own power for the first time since 1956. It's now conserved as a part of Renault's Historical Cars Collection. Return to Bonneville In 2016, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the √âtoile Filante's 1956 record run, the car was fitted with an electric motor and brought back to the Bonneville Salt Flats with Nicolas Prost, son of Alain Prost, at the wheel.

Weber was born at Freinsheim. From 1824 to 1839 he was the editor of C√§cilia, a musical periodical published in Mainz, which influenced musical thought in Germany during the early Romantic era. He died at Bad Kreuznach. His most important work is his Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst (Theory of Musical Composition) (Mainz, B. Schott, 1817‚Äì21), which introduces several concepts that have since become important in the study of music theory. In this work Weber develops the idea of \\"Mehrdeutigkeit\\" (that is, \\"multiple meaning\\"), a term initially introduced by Georg Joseph Vogler. Weber's ‚Äúmultiple meaning‚Äù refers to individual tones and harmonies, based on their context in a piece of music, i.e., a C major triad may serve as I in C major, IV in G major, V in F major, etc. ‚ÄúTo analyze a chord, a theorist must ask not only ‚ÄòWhat notes are in it?‚Äô but also 'How is it behaving in the harmonic progression?'\\" (Thompson); see diatonic function. In the same work, Weber also further develops Vogler's idea of Roman numeral designations applied to chords. Unlike Vogler, Weber implements upper and lower case symbols to show not only the position of each chord related to the scale degree upon which it is built, but also the quality of each chord, i.e. major, minor, diminished, etc. Weber's Roman numeral system of analysis is in wide use in Universities all over the world today to varying degrees, albeit with some modifications. Weber‚Äôs Theory of Musical Composition was the first work on music theory to be translated into English for publication in the United States (transl. by James F. Warner.

The documentary was a co-production of the Imperial War Museum, the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The narrator was Michael Redgrave, with readings by Marius Goring, Ralph Richardson, Cyril Luckham, Sebastian Shaw and Emlyn Williams. Each episode is long. Production Image from the Imperial War Museum photo archive, part of the opening titles. In August 1963, at the suggestion of Alasdair Milne, producer of the BBC's current affairs programme Tonight, the BBC resolved to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War with a big television project. The series was the first to feature veterans, many of them still relatively fit men in their late sixties or early seventies, speaking of their experiences after a public appeal for veterans was published in the national press. Those who appeared in the series included Edward Spears, Henry Williamson, Horace Birks, Benjamin Muse, Gustav Lachmann, Melvin Krulewitch, George Langley, Keith Officer, Douglas Wimberley, Charles Carrington, Egbert Cadbury, Euan Rabagliati, Robert Cotton Money, Norman Demuth, Walter Greenwood and Cecil Arthur Lewis. Others who were interviewed by the BBC but not featured in the series included Norman MacMillan, Mabel Lethbridge, Edgar von Spiegel, Edmund Blunden, Martin Niem√∂ller, John Shea, Hans Howaldt, William Ibbett, Marthe Bibesco, Philip Joubert de la Fert√© and Eric Dorman O'Gowan. =Title sequence= The series title sequence used a rostrum camera to create a montage of three images, the first showing a silhouetted British soldier standing over the grave of a comrade, the camera first focuses on the cross, where the almost imperceptible words IN MEMORY are glanced, the second shows a uniformed, skeletal corpse by the entrance to a dugout. The final image shows a lone British soldier, looking directly into the camera apparently surrounded by corpses, which is a montage of several images combined for dramatic effect. The original image of the staring soldier, showing him surrounded by fellow soldiers rather than corpses, was taken from photograph Q 1 in the Imperial War Museum photograph archive but has been described as having quickly become symbolic of the First World War. This title sequence was set against the series theme music, composed by Wilfred Josephs and performed by the BBC Northern Orchestra. Episode listing The episode titles are taken from quotations, the origins of which are shown in parentheses. With few exceptions, successive blocks of episodes are devoted to each year of the war: episodes 1‚Äì6 to 1914, 7‚Äì10 to 1915, 11‚Äì14 to 1916, 15‚Äì19 to 1917, 20‚Äì23 and 26 to 1918. Two \\"Extra\\" episodes exist on the dual-layer DVD edition: # \\"Voices from the Western Front\\" # \\"The Finished Fighter\\" Musical score The music for the series was composed by Wilfred Josephs. It was performed by the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra conducted by George Hurst. His expressive yet unsentimental score was widely acclaimed at the time and many have recalled the strong contribution it made to the series. In August 2007, Guardian columnist Ian Jack remembered how at the start of each episode Josephs' 'ominous music ushered the audience into the trenches'. Much use was made of 20th Century symphonies, including Shostakovitch's 11th Symphony and Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antartica'. Reception Each episode of The Great War was seen by an average audience of over eight million people, a 17 percent share of the estimated viewing population. The fourth episode, the most popular of the series, reached an audience of over eleven million (22.6 percent of the audience). =Awards= Following transmission of the series by the Republic of Ireland's national TV station, Telef√≠s √âireann, The Great War won a Jacob's Award at the 1964 presentation ceremony in Dublin.

He is most known for his writings defending the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Biography Lindsay earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Brigham Young University in 1986, where he had also earned his undergraduate degree. He then was a faculty member at Georgia Tech's institute of Paper Tech Science from 1987 to 1994. He then began work for Kimberly-Clark Corporation in Wisconsin. He later went to work for Innovationedge in Neenah, Wisconsin, as director of solution development. Lindsay was the lead author of the book Conquering Innovation Fatigue.Latter- day Saint scholars testify bio of Lindsay LDS apologetics Apart from his professional activities, he is also known for his writings dealing with the purported plausibility of the Book of Mormon and to a lesser extent for his work in Mormon history, in particular responding to various statements from anti-Mormon sources and frequently asked questions about the LDS Church. His writings are primarily on his website at JeffLindsay.com, particularly his LDSFAQ section (LDS Frequently Asked Questions), though he has blogged regularly on the Mormanity Blog since 2004. More recently, he was selected as one of the bloggers for Orson Scott Card's Nauvoo Times where he blogs weekly. The Mormon Interpreter, a pro-LDS website featuring scholarship and apologetics, prominently featured Lindsay in the 2014 article \\"Eye of the Beholder, Law of the Harvest: Observations on the Inevitable Consequences of the Different Investigative Approaches of Jeremy Runnells and Jeff Lindsay\\" by Kevin Christensen. According to Christensen, Lindsay deals with the issues raised in Runnells' popular critical work \\"at greater length, over a much broader span of time, consulting a wider range of sources, providing far more documentation, and including far more original research than Runnells.\\" Original contributions from Lindsay mentioned include his satirical treatment of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass as \\"evidence\\" of Book of Mormon plagiarism as well as treatments of the Book of Abraham and other topics. At the Mormon Interpreter, Lindsay has also been cited for a \\"thoughtful blog response to [a] New York Times article\\" Several of Lindsay's writings have been published or cross-posted at another pro-LDS website, FAIRMormon.org, including his analysis of a critical response to one aspect of the Arabian Peninsula evidence for the Book of Mormon. Lindsay has written an article Does DNA Evidence Refute the Book of Mormon?, in which he concluded that many Latter- day Saints incorrectly assumed that Lehi's group was the primary genetic source for all Native Americans and recommended that such errant assumptions be abandoned. Additionally, he noted that the Book of Mormon does not make such claims regarding Lehi and therefore only encourages a more enlightened view rather than complete abandonment of the Book of Mormon. This was one of the early articles on DNA-Book of Mormon issues noted by the Church and made available as a PDF file on their LDS Newsroom at LDS.org. A more recent version of his paper can be found on his web site. Lindsay is on the Executive Board of the Interpreter Foundation, an LDS apologetics organization. Some of Lindsay's claims have been criticized.For an example of a point-by-point dealing with some of Lindsay's points, see this blog entry from exmormon.org For example, Richard Abanes, a writer critical of Mormonism, refers to Lindsay's work as \\"numerous self-published articles, not scholarly, extremely biased, articles often based on misinformation\\". Some Latter Day Saints also disagree with some of Lindsay's viewpoints. Lindsay worked in China for a time, leaving in early 2020.

Described by botanist Dennis Stevenson in 1990, it is the most recently named genus, and the name refers to a Spanish transliteration of the common name given to cycads by the indigenous peoples of Colombia. The species are found in wet lowland rainforests at 100‚Äì200 m altitude. Both species are listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List. The whole genus is listed under CITES Appendix I / EU Annex A, and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of these species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance for scientific research. Plants have a subterranean globose stem. The leaves emerge singly and are straight, oblong, and pinnately compound. The petiole and rachis have spines. leaflets are opposite, lanceolate, and jointed at the base. They have a toothed margin with a distinct midrib and forking parallel side veins. Male cones are cylindrical and covered in short hairs. They are held on long erect stalks and have hexagonal sporophylls. Female cones are broadly cylindrical and hairy, held on very long peduncles two to three times the length of the cone. The female sporophylls are also hexagonal and have distinct bumps. The elliptical seeds are pink or red in color. Chigua is very closely related to the genus Zamia. Chigua restrepoi was collected as early as 1918 by Francis Pennell, but the new species was placed in Zamia. It was not collected again until 1986, and two subsequent collections in 1987 and 1988 became the basis for the establishment of a new genus. Because the genus has only been collected four times, there is little known about its conservation problems. The population sizes for the species are unknown, and nothing is known about the cones or seeds of Chigua bernalii, which is only known from the 1986 collection. Because political conflict in Colombia has made travelling dangerous there, the genus is unlikely to be well known for a while. Cattle grazing, mining, and oil exploration have threatened the habitat in the region. References *Jones, David L. Cycads of the World: Ancient Plants in Today's Landscape.

However, instead of water skis, the sport uses a skurfboarda floating platform the user balances on, similar to a surfboard, but typically much shorter, with two footstraps to prevent falling off the board and three fins positioned on the bottom that make it easier to maneuver when the board is being towed. The word itself is a portmanteau of skiing and surfing. Skurfing is often considered the precursor to wakeboarding.  Water skurfing  A person water skurfing Water skurfing was inspired by an unknown man being pulled by a boat on a surfboard in Lake Havasu, Arizona. Water skurfing is a form of water skiing that uses a surfboard or similar board instead of skis. The skurfer is towed behind a motorboat at planing speed with a tow rope similar to that of knee boarding and wakeboarding. It shares an advantage with kneeboarding in that the motorboat does not require as much speed as it does for water skiing. Skurfing is a towed sport and it is very similar to water skiing. The skurfboard, however, is a surfboard and is usually shorter by about two feet, wider and has three larger fins that make the board easier to maneuver while being pulled behind a boat. The planing speed of the motorboat is equivalent to the speed generated by a wave and allows the skurfer to ride behind the boat the same way a surfer would ride a wave. One of the advantages of skurfing, when compared with surfing, is that when the water is flat, skurfing is still possible. Skurfing can be done behind a boat, on a jet ski, river or in an ocean. The maneuver on a skurfboard are similar to those on a surfboard. These maneuver include: * Cut-backs * 180¬∞ rotations * 360¬∞ rotations * Serial jumps * Power slides * Freeriding Freeriding is when the wake is surfed without the rope. First, the rider pulls themselves up the rope so that they are skurfing in the largest part of the wake. The rider then gently pumps the board to maintain speed and moves their weight further forward to help them stay on the wake wave. Once they are being propelled by the wake the rope is thrown back into the boat. Skurfing has developed into its own unique sport but has also been used in adapting other sports such as surfing. Before skurfing was invented there were limitations to paddling onto larger waves when surfing because surfers lacked the speed needed to stay in front of the wave. Skurfing has shown the world the potential of big wave surfing by towing the surfer towards big waves. Therefore, giving the surfer the speed needed to catch the wave successfully. The early usage was a portmanteau of skiing (as in water skiing) and surfing, and was used to describe a popular surface water sport in which the participant is towed on a surfboard behind a boat with a ski rope. In 1985, California surfer Tony Finn invented the Skurfer, a shorter, narrow version of a surfboard with foot straps. Although the \\"Skurfer\\" was originally trademarked by Tony Finn, the word skurfing was potentially first coined in New Zealand by surfboard shaper Allan Byrne. Allan Byrne lent a surfboard to Jeff Darby and friends in Queensland Australia who started to make their own and later came in contact with Tony Finn who was to later produce the brand 'Skurfer' under royalty. Many years prior to Tony Finn and the 'Skurfer', Australian surfboard shaper and inventor Bruce McKee along with associate Mitchell Ross, launched the world's first mass-produced plastic roto-molded construction skurfboard named the \\"Mcski\\", later renamed \\"SSS\\" skiboard and then 'Wake-snake' in Australia. The board had adjustable rubber foot straps, concave tunnel bottom and a keel fin. Two smaller side fins were later added for greater hold and more maneuverability. Bruce McKee and associate Mitchell Ross negotiated with USA's Medalist Waterskis and the first American production was launched. The launch of the product's American version being named the 'Surf-Ski' was in 1984 at Chicagos 'IMTEC' show. At the show McKee also met Tony Finn who was the proposed Californian representative. Tony Finn, went on to do his own negotiations with Darby and company from Australia and the result as mentioned above were the US boards later launched under the 'Skurfer' brand name. Surfing is highly popular in the state of Western Australia and in many other places in the world. Unlike most other water sports where the participant is towed, water skurfing is not a professional sport and has no official competitions. It is a freestyle sport with highly individualistic style and form. There are no defined styles or conventions, rather it is about personal style. The first Skurfer championships were televised on ESPN in 1990. Water skurfing is considered by many to be a precursor to wakeboarding, as the skurfboards evolved in the late 1980s into compression-molded products ( \\"skiboards\\") then eventually into the twin- tipped wakeboard. = Styles = There are two main styles of water skurfing, the noseriding style, mostly used by people who surf on a longboard. The alternative is with cutbacks, carves and other turns. Some skurfers even get air over the wake. A new style of water skurfing has recently emerged in the sport where the fins are removed from the bottom of the board. This finless style requires more balance and finesse than having the fins attached. Not having fins limits cutbacks and carving, but allows the rider to spin the board around in a 360-degree rotation.  Street skurfing  A person street skurfing This usage is a portmanteau of skateboarding and surfing. See also Freeline skates. Street skurfing is the melding of many elements of skateboarding with the technical and practically applicable skills gained from slalom, downhill, or any other side-sport disciplines such as surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, and casterboarding. It focuses heavily on spins, slides, \\"stance\\" changes, and carving. There are no set rules, tricks, or techniques except the heavy emphasis of a fluid and surf-like execution through a course. The usually adopted terrain is a mix of steep grade roads, driveways, concrete banks, and ditches. = Styles = There are two types of styles for street skurfing. The first style involves a single board (often a skateboard or custom-cut deck). The second style is actually a common term used for caster skating. It involves two separated boards or skates instead of a single skateboard. One of the advantages of having separated skates is that the rider can maneuver with both feet individually. In addition, street skurfing involves making much tighter turns, s-shape motions, and even traveling up and down hills.

This article only discusses those proposals which involve some form of government intervention. Other models, such as the street performer protocol or voluntary collective licenses, could arguably be called \\"alternative compensation systems\\" although they are very different and generally less effective at solving the free rider problem. The impetus for these proposals has come from the widespread use of peer-to-peer file sharing networks. A few authors argue that an ACS is simply the only practical response to the situation.Gervais, D. \\"The Price of Social Norms: Towards a Liability Regime for File Sharing\\", 12 Journal of Intellectual Property Law 39, 2004. But most ACS advocates go further, holding that P2P file sharing is in fact greatly beneficial, and that tax or levy funded systems are actually more desirable tools for paying artists than sales coupled with DRM copy prevention technologies. Artistic freedom voucher The artistic freedom voucher (AFV) proposal argues that the current copyright system providing a state enforced monopoly leads to \\"enormous inefficiencies and creates substantial enforcement problems\\". Under the AFV proposed system, individuals would be allowed to contribute a refundable tax credit of approximately $100 to a \\"creative worker\\", this contribution would act as a voucher that can only be used to support artistic or creative work. Recipients of the AFV contribution would in turn be required to register with the government in similar fashion to that of religious or charitable institutions do so for tax-exempt status. The sole purpose of the registration would be to prevent fraud and would have no evaluation of the quality or work being produced. Alongside registration, artists would also now be ineligible for copyright protection for a set period of time (5 years for example) as the work is contributed to the public domain and allowed to be freely reproduced. The AFV would not affect creative workers ability to receive funds via live performances. Proponents claim that this system could create up to $20 billion annually to pay artists, which is far greater than what currently flows to them through copyrighted material. At $100 per adult voucher, over 500,000 writers, musicians, singers, actors, or other creative workers could be paid some $40,000 a year. Baker also states that it is realistic to assume that the savings from the reduced expenditures on the copyrighted work would vastly exceed the cost of the AFV. The majority of these savings would come from individuals deciding to use AFV supported work in place of copyrighted work as well as lower advertising costs because the AFV material would be public domain. Copyright enforcement demand would also decrease as AFV material increased. The assumptions made are that in the low end direct costs to the public of copyrighted material would be reduced around 20 percent while in the high end all the way up to 60 percent. Over time it is also likely that the savings would increase due to the lesser costs of the system and brighter prospects.Baker, D. The Artistic Freedom Voucher: Internet Age Alternative to Copyrights 2003. \\"Related Views\\" In a 2010 article critical of the AFV proposal, graphic designer Mark Stanley writes: \\"Like school vouchers, the flat tax, and other pretenders, the AFV assumes the necessity of state intervention, and tries to bend liberty around such strictures. Freedom isn‚Äôt so forgiving to such manipulation.\\",Mark Stanley , The False Freedom of Art Vouchers =Donation-based record labels= While the systematic restructuring of copyright laws proposed by AFV is far from being put into practice, the concept of paying artists with donations has been tested, with some success. In 2006, musician Jeff Rosenstock founded Quote Unquote Records, which advertised itself as the first donation-based record label. Artists on this label make their music available to download for free, and invite listeners to make a small donation if they want to. Between donations and ticket sales for live shows, Quote Unquote Records has been successfully recording music and expanding the number of bands on their label for the past twelve years. Architectural details =Where does the money come from= Proposals have included targeted levies on internet connections, blank CDs, digital media players, etc. (many of these goods are levied various countries' existing private copying schemes); income taxation; or optional payments by users. In terms of economic theory, consumer \\"opt in\\" regimes are very different from universal ones, but depending on how the scheme was administered, the differences might not be so large. For example, if the default option for ISP subscribers was to pay an ACS surcharge, which could be avoided by filing a signed commitment not to make unauthorised downloads from P2P networks, the effects might be quite similar. This scheme however is unsuitable for business owners who maintain free internet connections as incentive for customers. It would then be the responsibility of the business owner to monitor his or her customer's internet use. =Where does it go= Various proposals have been made to base the distribution of royalties on measures of consumer downloading, usage or voting. The computer security issues to be addressed in collecting this data are considerable. The privacy and verifiability obstacles are very similar to those encountered in Internet voting; they may be soluble, but only with hardware assistance not currently available on ordinary PCs. The most practical way to deploy an ACS in the short term would be to collect statistical samples from a much smaller population. The actual distribution of royalties would likely be carried out by a copyright collecting society. Advantages and disadvantages Alternative compensation systems have two very significant advantages over digital copyright. They do not impose artificial scarcity on copyright works: everyone can download as many songs, ebooks and films as they want (in economic terns, ACS eliminate the deadweight loss of copyright monopolies). They also avoid the very high technological and social costs of digital copyright enforcement. The two greatest drawbacks of ACSes are the excess burden of the taxation that is collected, and the need to decide what tax/levy rates to use for the system (although methods such as contingent valuation may help a little with that question). Alternative compensation systems in practice Canada's private copying levy had the unforeseen result of temporarily creating an ACS for some kinds of P2P downloading. In BMG v. Doe, a dictum suggested that this should also apply to uploading; but the dictum was criticised on appeal. In France, the December 2005 DADVSI amendments that were passed by the Senate would have created an ACS called a \\"global license\\". These amendments were removed before the bill finally became law. In 2009, the German Social Democratic Party added a proposal for an ACS variant called a \\"cultural flat-rate\\" to its party platform.http://www.ip- watch.org/weblog/2009/05/11/the-world-is-going-flat-rate/ See also * Anti- copyright notice * Copyright abolition * Criticism of copyright * Free-culture movement * Freedom of information * Information wants to be free * Television licensing in the United Kingdom, in effect an annual flat-tax in the United Kingdom, which is then used by the BBC to create content References Bibliography * Baker, D.

He was the head coach at the University of Idaho (1986‚Äì1988), the University of California, Berkeley (1992‚Äì1995), and the University of Washington (2003‚Äì2004), compiling a career college football record of 55‚Äì51. Gilbertson retired in 2011 as a coach. Early life and playing career The son of a high school football coach, Gilbertson grew up in Snohomish, Washington, northeast of Seattle. He graduated from Snohomish High School in 1966 and attended Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Columbia Basin College, the University of Hawaii, and returned to Central Washington, where he received a bachelor's degree in social sciences in 1971. He later earned a degree in education from Western Washington University in 1974.2003 Washington Football Media Guide, p. 78-79 Coaching career After three stints as a graduate assistant, Gilbertson became an offensive coordinator in 1977 at Utah State under head coach Bruce Snyder. After five seasons in Logan, he joined Dennis Erickson's new staff at Idaho, who immediately turned the Vandal program around in 1982, going 8‚Äì3 in the regular season and advancing to the quarterfinals of the I-AA playoffs. Shortly after, Gilbertson departed for the Los Angeles Express of the newly-formed USFL, where he coached as offensive coordinator for three spring seasons. Following the demise of the league, Gilbertson returned to Idaho in 1985, and the Vandals won their first Big Sky Conference title in fourteen years. Erickson departed for Wyoming in December, and Gilbertson was promoted to head coach of the Vandal program. In his three seasons in Moscow as head coach (1986‚Äì88), Gilbertson's win-loss record was , which remains the best in UI history. His record in conference play was the best-ever in the Big Sky. Following consecutive conference championships and advancing to the Division I-AA semifinals, Gilbertson interviewed at UTEP in December 1988 but withdrew from consideration. Days later he accepted an offer to coach the offensive line in the Pac-10 at Washington in Seattle under head coach Don James and offensive coordinator Gary Pinkel. The compensation was similar to his Idaho salary, about $55,000; Gilbertson replaced Dan Dorazio on the UW staff. (After three wins to start the 1988 season, the Huskies finished 6‚Äì5 and 3‚Äì5 in conference, with losses to USC, UCLA, Oregon, Arizona, and WSU.) Gilbertson's three-year stint concluded with the undefeated 1991 national championship team, for which he was also offensive coordinator. Two weeks after winning the Rose Bowl, Gilbertson became the head coach at California in January 1992. Despite leading Cal to a 9‚Äì4 record in 1993 with a decisive victory in the Alamo Bowl, he was dismissed after his fourth season when the 1995 Bears went 3‚Äì8. Gilbertson's overall record at Cal was After Cal, he was an assistant coach for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks for three seasons (1996‚Äì98) under Erickson; the last two years as tight ends coach. In 1999, he returned to the Washington Huskies as an assistant head coach under new head coach Rick Neuheisel. Gilbertson became the head coach at Washington in 2003 following the abrupt summer dismissal of Neuheisel. His first season was fairly respectable at 6‚Äì6; only a blowout loss to Cal in the next-to-last game of the season kept the Huskies out of a bowl game. The bottom fell out a year later, in which the Huskies finished 1‚Äì10, including only their second winless PCC/Big Five/Pac-8/Pac-10 record in peacetime. He was fired near the end of the season; his record at Washington was , at the time the worst in the history of the program; it has since been surpassed by that of his successor, Tyrone Willingham.Raley, Dan - Gilbertson ousted as UW coach.

Its colours are dark blue and yellow in a hooped design. The BOPRU govern the running of the Bay of Plenty representative team which have won New Zealand's first-tier domestic competition National Provincial Championship (Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) once. Their most recent victory was the 1976 competition, they were the first side to win the competition. Bay of Plenty also acts as a primary feeder to the Chiefs, who play in the Super Rugby competition. The union also administers all club rugby within the region, including the Bayfair Baywide competition and other senior club rugby. As well, the union is responsible for school rugby. History Bay of Plenty played a prominent role in the early history of rugby in New Zealand. The 1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Natives (the first New Zealand representative rugby team to tour beyond Australia) included five Warbrick brothers from the small Bay of Plenty settlement of Matata. Dave Gallaher, the captain of the legendary 1905 All Black Originals, grew up in Katikati. But it was not until 1911 that a separate Bay of Plenty Rugby Football Union was established. Before then Bay of Plenty was included within the South Auckland union. The current nickname for the team is the \\"Steamers\\". =Representatives= Bay of Plenty-based players were amongst the most prominent in the formative years of the game, but it was not until 1911 that the Bay of Plenty union was fully affiliated to the national body. Up until this time the BOP union was included within the South Auckland union boundaries. As the boundaries of the new union grew, and new sub-unions were formed, the union achieved its first national representation when A.L. McLean was selected for the All Blacks in 1921. McLean was the first of 22 men who have represented New Zealand while wearing the blue and gold hoops, in addition to the many players who received their rugby education in the Bay of Plenty before achieving higher honours elsewhere. As the heartland of Maori rugby the region has produced a large number of MƒÅori All Blacks, while age group and secondary school teams from throughout the union have also established a long and successful heritage that is the envy of many. =Great players= Les McLean was the first of the 20 players who have so far been selected for the All Blacks from Bay of Plenty. He played as a forward in the second and third tests against the 1921 Springboks ‚Äì and at full-back against New South Wales in 1923. Bay of Plenty's most capped All Black is Hika Reid. Hailing from NgongotahƒÅ near Rotorua, Reid's grandfather, J. Hikatarewa, played for New Zealand Maori in 1913. Reid was selected for the All Blacks in 1980 when test incumbent Andy Dalton was unavailable for what turned out to be a disappointing tour of Australia. Reid's performances at hooker, however, were impressive. A dynamic runner with ball in hand, he revolutionised the way in which hookers played the game. Sean Fitzpatrick was the most famous of those to adopt this high-energy approach. His try in the second test victory over Australia in Brisbane has been described as one of ‚Äòthe most spectacular tries in test history‚Äô. He started and finished a move that began 10 m from his own try line. Despite this sort of ability, for much of his career Reid was Andy Dalton's understudy. By 1986 he had also slipped behind Fitzpatrick, and he was overlooked for the 1987 World Cup. Greg Rowlands, a 1976 All Black to Argentina, holds the record for the most games ‚Äì 161 ‚Äì and most points ‚Äì 1008 ‚Äì for Bay of Plenty.

It has a capacity of 19,800, which was almost attained when Bay of Plenty had the Ranfurly Shield run of 2004. Baypark was subsequently shunned in favour of Tauranga Domain due to the stadium's poor surface and the lack of proximity between the fans and the players due to the racing track circling the pitch. =Rotorua International Stadium= With a capacity of 34,000, Rotorua International Stadium is one of the larger stadiums in New Zealand, but doesn't get the matches that will draw the crowds. It is one of the two stadiums that the Steamers use as a home field, with many considering it the home of Bay of Plenty Rugby. It is also known as \\"The Hangi Pit\\", because of the mud-pools around Rotorua. Other representative teams In addition to the Men's 1st XV, the BOPRU has a number of other representative teams for both Men and Women. BOPRU is part of the Women's Provincial Championship.

A few days later on 25 March, services between Paris and Istanbul via Panƒçevo commenced, the first international flights to or from Belgrade. On 9 September the same year, the first aircraft took off on a scheduled service from Belgrade to Bucharest. This was also the first commercial night flight in the history of aviation. CFRNA (Compagnie franco-roumaine de navigation a√©rienne) decided that flying at night was the only way for its aircraft operating on the Paris-Belgrade- Bucharest-Istanbul service to beat the famous Orient Express train to Istanbul.

The cowboy is winking one eye. He's lifting his left hand, and pointing that thumb towards the building to his right. A lighted cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth. He's wearing a cowboy hat, boots, and a scarf. Glowing neon tubes highlight the outlines of the cowboy, the cigarette, his boots, and the folds of his tied scarf. Vegas Vic is a neon sign portraying a cowboy which was erected on the exterior of The Pioneer Club in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 1951. The sign was a departure in graphic design from typeface based neon signs, to the friendly and welcoming human form of a cowboy. The sign's human-like abilities of talking and waving its arm received an immediate acceptance as the unofficial welcoming sign, reproduced thousands of times over the years and all over the world. The sign can still be found at 25 E Fremont Street, where it has been since 1951 on the exterior of what used to be The Pioneer Club but is currently a souvenir shop. The trademark is currently owned by Pioneer Hotel, Inc., which owns and operates the Pioneer Hotel and Gambling Hall on the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nevada. Laughlin has a twin of the Vegas Vic image on another large sign referred to as River Rick. History 1948 Postcard of Vegas Vic's first use Although the Pioneer Club no longer operates as a casino, the neon cowboy that was its mascot still exists. In 1947, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce hired a West-Marquis firm to draw visitors to Las Vegas. The company then created the first image of Vegas Vic and his friendly \\"Howdy Podner\\" greeting. Due to the popularity of the cowboy, Young Electric Sign Company was commissioned to build a neon-sign version by the owners of the Pioneer Club. They then commissioned Pat Denner, who modeled it after the image in use by the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. The neon version was complete with a waving arm, a moving cigarette, and a recording of \\"HOWDY PODNER!!!!!\\" every 15 minutes. Vegas Vic was then erected on the exterior of the Pioneer club in 1951 on the southwest corner of First Street and Fremont Street replacing the sign that simply said Pioneer Club with an image of a horse drawn covered wagon. In 1966, Lee Marvin was filming The Professionals and staying at the Mint Hotel. Marvin complained that Vegas Vic was too loud, so casino executives silenced Vegas Vic and it was left that way for nearly two decades. The speaking was restored in the 1980s, but as of 2006 no longer works. The arm stopped waving in 1991. Bag of Durham tobacco When the Fremont Street Experience was under construction in 1994, several feet were cut off of the brim of Vegas Vic's hat to make him fit properly under the curve of the canopy of the Fremont Street Experience. After the Pioneer Club closed in 1995, Vegas Vic fell into disrepair. The Neon Museum at the Fremont Street Experience stepped in and offered to restore and maintain the sign if the building owner paid for the electric bill to operate it. Under the proposal, the building owner would retain ownership of the sign but has since acknowledged that the Federally Registered Trademark for Vegas Vic is owned by Pioneer Hotel, Inc.. If the building is sold, the sign would become the property of the Neon Museum who would then maintain it from that point on. The building owner ultimately declined the offer and eventually restored the sign themselves. The red circle on his pocket is supposed to represent a Durham Tobacco tag that is dangling from a yellow string attached to the bag that is stowed away in his pocket (Vegas Vic represents a time when a cowboy rolled their own cigarettes from a bag of tobacco). Vegas Vic was the first of what would become three neon cowboys at Nevada casinos. Wendover Will was erected a year later in 1952 at Stateline Casino and River Rick was erected in 1981 at the Pioneer Hotel & Gambling Hall in Laughlin. River Rick is virtually an identical copy of Vegas Vic, outfitted with a different color scheme.

Standing over the Girls of Glitter Gulch strip club, she was known as Vegas Vickie (sometimes erroneously referred to as \\"Sassy Sally\\", for the nearby casino). Vic and Vickie were \\"married\\" in a 1994 ceremony during construction of the Fremont Street Experience. Vickie was removed in 2017 in preparation for the demolition of the strip club along with Mermaids Casino, La Bayou and the Las Vegas Club. Plans are for her to be returned to Fremont Street after the completion of a new resort on the site planned to open in 2020. Vegas Vic has received new paint schemes through the years. Originally, from the '50s through the '60s, his shirt was white with yellow checkered stripes. Later during an early restoration in the '70s, his shirt was painted solid yellow. When he was restored in 1998 his shirt was painted a red and yellow checkered pattern. In popular culture * In the Obsidian Entertainment video game Fallout: New Vegas, a robot named Victor acts as an ally to the player and a servant of the owner of New Vegas, Mr. House. Victor is based on Vegas Vic, bearing a similar face and greeting the player with \\"Howdy, partner!\\" * The Belgian comics hero Lucky Luke strongly resembles Vegas Vic. * A 1994 commercial for Miller Genuine Draft beer has a neon cowboy and cowgirl, similar to Vegas Vic and Vickie, \\"coming to life\\" in downtown Vegas to the tune of JJ Cale's \\"After Midnight\\". * During the Wonderful Wonderful tour, The Killers, who formed in Las Vegas and make frequent references to the city in their music and videos, included the image of Vegas Vic in the background on the song \\"The Man\\". * Vegas Vic makes an appearance in The Simpsons episode \\"I Married Marge\\". * Vegas Vic and Vickie both appear in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, when the enlarged Adam Szalinski is treating Fremont Street like a playground for him. At one point, he nearly hits Vic while playing with a convertible carrying his big brother Nick and babysitter in it, and also damages Vickie's leg when he places the car on it, causing it to buckle under the strain and nearly drop Nick and the babysitter to the street below, before Adam saves them, while Vickie's leg somewhat recovers from the damage.

Route 114 is not related to Route 114A in Seekonk, which is actually related to Rhode Island Route 114 and is located about away from Massachusetts Route 114. Route description Route 114 westbound in Middleton Route 114 begins in Lawrence at Route 28, at the southern end of the O'Leary Bridge. It heads eastward along Merrimack Street before turning southward onto Parker Street, passing Lawrence Station as it does. It then bends southeastward at Andover Street, intersecting I-495 at Exit 42. It then crosses the Shawsheen River into North Andover, becoming the Salem Turnpike. In North Andover, Route 114 crosses Route 133 before beginning a concurrency with Route 125 which lasts for over half a mile, passing Merrimack College in the process. It then continues through the town into Middleton, where it has a short wrong-way concurrency with Route 62 in the center of town. From Middleton, Route 114 heads into Danvers. In Danvers, Route 114 has interchanges with U.S. Route 1 and I-95 in quick succession before entering into Peabody.

It is part of the North Carolina Community College System and serves Vance, Granville, Franklin, and Warren counties. It was established in 1969 by the North Carolina General Assembly as Vance County Technical Institute (VCTI). VGCC is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate degrees.Logistics & Supply Chain Programs  History  After Vance County was unsuccessful in persuading the state of North Carolina to support a community college in Vance, community leaders managed to obtain a \\"technical institute\\" in 1968. The General Assembly officially established the new school on July 1, 1969. Local educator William D. Payne was named acting president until a permanent leader, Donald Mohorn, could be hired. VCTI moved into its first permanent home in January 1970: a renovated hospital building in downtown Henderson. From those humble beginnings, Vance-Granville has become a key player in economic development in the four counties its serves. Throughout its history, the college has sought to provide better opportunities for citizens to learn and to train for meaningful employment. The college began by offering technical, vocational and continuing education courses to residents of Vance County. In 1972, Vance and Granville counties pooled their resources to support a $2 million bond referendum for a larger, more permanent facility (to be called Vance-Granville Technical Institute) to educate residents of both counties. The ultimate result, combined with the legislature's approving the addition of a college- transfer program, was the construction and subsequent opening of the new Vance‚ÄìGranville Community College campus in 1976 on an tract in Vance County, midway between Henderson and Oxford, off Interstate 85. With this location still serving as the college's main campus, Vance-Granville has experienced significant progress over the years. In fact, phenomenal growth in its physical facilities and student enrollment necessitated a move in 1978 to expand its offerings to include the populace of Franklin and Warren counties. Today, the main campus, picturesque with a lake and attractive landscaping, has nine permanent buildings that include a student services complex, civic center and daycare unit. Along with administrative and faculty offices, auditorium, student lounge and learning resources center, these facilities provide 36 classrooms, 10 shops and 20 labs in which students may train in 35-plus curriculum programs, as well as extension, economic development, continuing education, and small business classes. Its total value is approximately $33 million. In 2000, voters approved a Higher Education Facilities bond, from which VGCC received $17.1 million over the next six years. These funds have led to construction on all four campuses. = Satellite campuses = Vance-Granville also maintains three satellite campuses: South Campus, located between Butner and Creedmoor in Granville County; Warren County Campus, which operates in downtown Warrenton; and Franklin County Campus, situated on NC Highway 56 just outside Louisburg. Calling an tract home, South Campus is a single-story, semicircular structure that houses classrooms, shops/labs, offices and a reception area. In 2000, an addition was constructed to provide space for an expanded cosmetology department, computer lab and EMS/Public Service classroom. In addition, the Granville County Library South Branch occupies one section of the complex. Like all of the other campuses, South has an Early College high school. Occupying three one-story brick buildings totaling more than , Warren County Campus encompasses general classrooms, an ABE/GED learning/testing center, labs, multi-purpose shop, reception areas and offices. The Warren County Campus,Warren County SchoolsEarly College holds Open House at VGCC Warren Campus Franklin County Campus, located on a scenic site, has a two-building, complex that opened its doors to students in Fall 1998. It contains general classrooms, vocational, computer and science labs, a childcare center, computer and conference room, book store, and faculty and administrative offices, and other skills training areas. In the spring of 2001, a new biotechnology lab and classroom building were added along with a multipurpose building. Since their formal dedication in the fall of 1988, both South Campus and Warren Campus have been renovated, enlarged and improved to accommodate a growing number of students. Franklin Campus, which first opened its doors to students in 1991, shared space in the Louisburg Human Services Building before moving in 1998 to its permanent new home. The combined value of these three campuses is approximately $7.3 million.VGCC websiteVance-Granville Community College: The First Thirty Years by Jan Pogue (1999) = Presidents = * Dr. Donald R.

Sometimes mistakenly believed to have coined the term \\"the Establishment\\", an analysis of how \\"all the right people\\" came to run Britain largely through social connections. He spent 36 years as a prominent freelance writer on both sides of the Atlantic, appearing in The Spectator, The New Republic, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, and many other papers and magazines. He was also the author of five books, most notably The Kennedy Promise, an early revisionist critique of the US presidency of John F. Kennedy. In 2009, Yale University Press published Bite the Hand That Feeds You: Essays and Provocations (), an anthology of his work edited by Newsweek correspondent Jeremy McCarter. Biography Fairlie was born in London, the fifth of seven children in a family of Scottish descent. His father, James Fairlie, was a heavy-drinking editor on Fleet Street; his mother, Marguerita Vernon, was the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. Fairlie attended Byron House and Highgate School before studying Modern History at Corpus Christi, Oxford.McCarter, Jeremy, ed. (2009) Bite the Hand That Feeds You: Essays and Provocations by Henry Fairlie. New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 3‚Äì4. After taking his degree in 1945, Fairlie began his journalism career at the Manchester Evening News, followed by a brief stint working for David Astor at The Observer. During this time he married Lisette Todd Phillips, with whom he would have a son and two daughters.McCarter, pp. 4‚Äì5. Fleet Street In 1950, Fairlie joined the staff of The Times, rising at an early age to become the chief writer of its leaders on domestic politics.McCarter p. 5. In 1954, he gave up the security of that post to assume the greater independence of a freelance writer, which he remained until the end of his life. As the author of the \\"Political Commentary\\" column in The Spectator, first under the nom de plume \\"Trimmer\\", then under his own byline, he helped define the modern political column.Watkins, Alan (2000). A Short Walk Down Fleet Street. London: Duckworth, p. 66. In September 1955, Fairlie devoted a column to how the friends and acquaintances of Guy Burgess and Donald Duart Maclean, two members of the Foreign Office widely believed to have defected to Moscow, tried to deflect press scrutiny from the men's families. He defined that network of prominent, well-connected people as \\"the Establishment\\", explaining: > By the 'Establishment', I do not only mean the centres of official > power‚Äîthough they are certainly part of it‚Äîbut rather the whole matrix of > official and social relations within which power is exercised. The exercise > of power in Britain (more specifically, in England) cannot be understood > unless it is recognised that it is exercised socially.\\"Political > Commentary\\", The Spectator, 23 September 1955. The term was quickly picked up in newspapers and magazines all over London, making Fairlie famous.Fairlie, Henry. \\"Evolution of a Term\\", The New Yorker, 19 October 1968. The Oxford English Dictionary would cite Fairlie's column as its locus classicus. However, he would later determine that Ralph Waldo Emerson had really been the first to use \\"the Establishment\\" in this fashion. As Fairlie became better known, his personal life grew chaotic. He drank heavily and conducted a series of extramarital affairs, including one with the wife of his friend Kingsley Amis that nearly ended their marriage.leader, Zachary, ed.

These heterodox politics helped him find a perch at The New Republic, where he was a regular contributor from the mid-1970s until his death in 1990. In the mid-1980s, when he was unable to keep up payments on his apartment, he was even reduced to living in his office there, sleeping on a couch next to his desk.McCarter, p. 24. Fairlie devoted much of the second half of his career to trying to explain America to Americans. Between 1976 and 1982, he wrote \\"Fairlie at Large,\\" a bi-weekly column for The Washington Post. In those pieces he often abandoned political subjects to write about American manners and morals: for instance, why Americans would do well to give up showers in favour of more contemplative baths.Fairlie, Henry. \\"The Importance of Bathtubs,\\" The Washington Post, 22 January 1978. His romantic attachment to the possibilities of American life found its fullest expression in a long essay titled \\"Why I Love America,\\" which The New Republic published on 4 July 1983. In the winter of 1990, Fairlie fell in the lobby of The New Republic, breaking a hip. After a brief hospitalisation, he died on 25 February. His ashes were buried in the family plot in Scotland.McCarter, pp. 33‚Äì4.

Education and career Born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Spottswood William Robinson II [1893-1954], a lawyer, and Inez Irene Clements [1893-1994], a homemaker, Robinson an undergraduate degree from Virginia Union University and a Bachelor of Laws from Howard University School of Law in 1939, graduating first in his class and achieving the highest scholastic average in the history of the law school. He was a member of the faculty of Howard University School of Law from 1939 to 1948. He was in private practice of law in Richmond from 1943 to 1960. He was counsel and representative for the Virginia NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1950. He was southeast regional counsel for the NAACP from 1951 to 1960. He was Professor and Dean of Howard University School of Law from 1960 to 1963. He was a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights from 1961 to 1963. =NAACP LDF cases= Harold Boulware, Thurgood Marshall, and Spottswood Robinson III in 1953 conferring during Brown case In the early 1950s, Robinson and his law-partner Oliver Hill, working through the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, litigated several civil rights lawsuits in Virginia. In 1951, Robinson and Hill took up the cause of the African- American students at the segregated R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia who had walked out of their dilapidated school. The subsequent lawsuit, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, was consolidated with four other cases decided under Brown v. Board of Education by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954. In his arguments before the Court, Robinson made the first argument on behalf of the plaintiffs. Robinson also participated in Chance v. Lambeth, which invalidated carrier-enforced racial segregation in interstate transportation. Federal judicial service Robinson received a recess appointment from President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 6, 1964, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge James Ward Morris. He was nominated to the same seat by President Johnson on February 3, 1964. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 1, 1964, and received his commission on July 2, 1964, becoming the first African-American to serve on this court. His service was terminated on November 8, 1966, due to elevation to the D.C. Circuit.

Times Hollywood Star Walk was a motion picture comedian. He began his career in vaudeville and wrote more than 150 plays and sketches. Career Born in Binghamton, New York, Herbert \\"had many serious roles, and for years was seen on major vaudeville circuits as a pathetic old Hebrew.\\" The advent of talking pictures brought stage-trained actors to Hollywood, and Hugh Herbert soon became a popular movie comedian. His screen character was usually absent- minded and flustered. He would flutter his fingers together and talk to himself, repeating the same phrases: \\"hoo-hoo-hoo, wonderful, wonderful, hoo hoo hoo!\\" So many imitators (including Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, Mickey Rooney as Andy Hardy and Etta Candy in the Wonder Woman comic book series) copied the catchphrase as \\"woo woo\\" that Herbert himself began to use \\"woo woo\\" rather than \\"hoo hoo\\" in the 1940s. Herbert's earliest movies, like Wheeler & Woolsey's feature Hook, Line and Sinker (1930), cast him in generic comedy roles that could have been taken by any comedian. He developed his own unique screen personality, complete with a silly giggle, and this new character caught on quickly. He was frequently featured in Warner Brothers films of the 1930s, including Bureau of Missing Persons, Footlight Parade (both 1933), Dames, Fog Over Frisco, Fashions of 1934 (all 1934), and Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), as well as A Midsummer Night's Dream (also 1935), a film adaptation of Shakespeare's play. He played leads in \\"B comedies\\", notably Sh! The Octopus (1937), a comedy-mystery featuring an exceptional unmasking of the culprit. Herbert was often caricatured in Warners' Looney Tunes shorts of the 1930s/40s, such as Speaking of the Weather (1937) and The Hardship of Miles Standish (1940). One of the minor characters in the Terrytoons short The Talking Magpies (1946) is also a recognizably Hugh Herbertesque bird. In 1939 Herbert signed with Universal Pictures, where, as at Warners, he played supporting roles in major films and leading roles in minor ones. One of his best-received performances from this period is in the Olsen and Johnson comedy Hellzapoppin' (1941), in which he played a nutty detective. Herbert joined Columbia Pictures in 1943 and became a familiar face in short subjects, with the same actors and directors who made the Stooges shorts. He continued to star in these comedies for the remainder of his life. Herbert wrote six screenplays, co-writing the screenplays for the films Lights of New York (1928) and Second Wife (1930) and contributing to The Great Gabbo (1929), among others. He acted in a few films co-written by the much more prolific (but unrelated) screenwriter F. Hugh Herbert: Fashions of 1934 (1934), We're in the Money (1935) and Colleen (1936). He also directed one film, He Knew Women (1930). Recognition Herbert has a star at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated February 8, 1960. Personal life and death Herbert was married to Rose Epstein, who was also known by the name Anita Pam. Herbert died on March 12, 1952 at the age of 66 from cardiovascular disease in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Brother Hugh's brother, Tom Herbert, was a screen comedian who played mildly flustered roles. He is featured in the Warner Brothers short subject Double or Nothing (1940) as his brother Hugh's movie double. Selected filmography *Husbands for Rent (1927) ....

Biological organization spans several scales and are determined based different structures depending on what the system is. Examples of biological systems at the macro scale are populations of organisms. On the organ and tissue scale in mammals and other animals, examples include the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and the nervous system. On the micro to the nanoscopic scale, examples of biological systems are cells, organelles, macromolecular complexes and regulatory pathways. A biological system is not to be confused with a living system, such as a living organism. Organ and tissue systems thumb352x352pxAn example of a system: The brain, the cerebellum, the spinal cord, and the nerves are the four basic components of the nervous system. These specific systems are widely studied in human anatomy and are also present in many other animals. * Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm. * Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, oesophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, rectum and anus. * Cardiovascular system (heart and circulatory system): pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels. * Urinary system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine. * Integumentary system: skin, hair, fat, and nails. * Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons. * Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands. * Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream; includes the lymph and the nodes and vessels. The lymphatic system includes functions including immune responses and development of antibodies.  Immune system: protects the organism from foreign bodies. * Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system and sense organs.  Sensory systems: visual system, auditory system, olfactory system, gustatory system, somatosensory system, vestibular system. * Muscular system: allows for manipulation of the environment, provides locomotion, maintains posture, and produces heat. Includes skeletal muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac muscle. * Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostate. History The notion of system (or apparatus) relies upon the concept of vital or organic function:Fletcher, John (1837). \\"On the functions of organized beings, and their arrangement\\". In: Rudiments of physiology. Part 2. On life, as manifested in irritation. Edinburgh: John Carfrae & Son. pp. 1-15. link. a system is a set of organs with a definite function. This idea was already present in Antiquity (Galen, Aristotle), but the application of the term \\"system\\" is more recent. For example, the nervous system was named by Monro (1783), but Rufus of Ephesus (c. 90-120), clearly viewed for the first time the brain, spinal cord, and craniospinal nerves as an anatomical unit, although he wrote little about its function, nor gave a name to this unit.Swanson, Larry (2014). Neuroanatomical Terminology: A Lexicon of Classical Origins and Historical Foundations. Oxford: Oxford University Press. link. p. 489. The enumeration of the principal functions - and consequently of the systems - remained almost the same since Antiquity, but the classification of them has been very various, e.g., compare Aristotle, Bichat, Cuvier.Bichat, X. (1801). Anatomie g√©n√©rale appliqu√©e √† la physiologie et √† la m√©decine, 4 volumes in-8, Brosson, Gabon, Paris, link. (See pp. cvj-cxj).Cuvier, Georges. Lecons d'anatomie compar√©e 2. √©d., cor. et augm. Paris: Crochard, 1835-1846. link. The notion of physiological division of labor, introduced in the 1820s by the French physiologist Henri Milne-Edwards, allowed to \\"compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man.\\" Inspired in the work of Adam Smith, Milne-Edwards wrote that the \\"body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual.\\" In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or systems (called by him as appareils).R.

Residency programs are also located in Selma, Huntsville and Montgomery. It is part of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). History =Founding and growth= The School of Medicine at UAB can trace its roots to the 1859 founding of the Medical College of Alabama in Mobile, Alabama. In the early 1900s, due to the work of Abraham Flexner, the medical school became more closely affiliated with the University of Alabama. The move of the college from Mobile to Tuscaloosa took effect in 1920. In 1936, the University of Alabama Extension Center was opened in Birmingham. In 1943, Governor Chauncey Sparks created the four-year Medical College of Alabama with the passage of the Jones Bill (Alabama Act 89). In 1944, Roy R. Kracke was named dean of the Medical College of Alabama and began assembling teaching staff.{Robert R. Kracke and William G. Kracke, The University of Alabama Medical Center: the Past, the Present, the Future,‚Äù Alabama Lawyer 28(1967):78-88} In 1945, the Medical College of Alabama was moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham and the university's medical center was founded. In November 1966, the Extension Center and the Medical Center were merged to form the \\"University of Alabama in Birmingham,\\" an organizational component of The University of Alabama. In 1969, UAB became an independent institution, one of three autonomous universities within the newly created University of Alabama System. The university's name was changed in 1984 from the \\"University of Alabama in Birmingham\\" to the \\"University of Alabama at Birmingham.\\" As of 2019, the School of Medicine has 805 students, 990 residents and 1,483 faculty in 27 academic departments. The UAB School of Medicine is home of The Kirklin Clinic, a multi-disciplinary medical home; University Hospital, one of the largest academic hospitals in the country; and faculty serve the new Children's of Alabama hospital. =Regional and national emergence= Tinsley R. Harrison M.D. became dean of the new medical school and chairman of the Department of Medicine in 1950. Dr. Harrison began a program of recruitment aimed at making the school a major research and health care center. In 1966, John W. Kirklin, M.D., joined UAB as chairman of the Department of Surgery and Surgeon-In-Chief for University Hospital from Mayo Clinic. He was most noted for revolutionizing cardiovascular surgery through his development and refinement of the heart-lung machine. =Leadership= Selwyn Vickers, M.D. On August 15, 2013, UAB announced Selwyn Vickers, M.D., would be the next senior vice president for Medicine and dean of the School of Medicine effective October 15, 2013. Vickers spent his formative years as a young faculty member at UAB, beginning in 1994, and he directed the section of gastrointestinal surgery from 2000 to 2006. He was previously the Jay Phillips Professor and Chair of the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Anupam Agarwal, M.D., served as interim dean of the School of Medicine for eight months from February to October 2013 after Ray Watts, M.D., former dean of the School of Medicine, was named the seventh president of UAB in January 2013. Agarwal returned to his position as director of the Division of Nephrology and vice chair for research in the Department of Medicine on October 15, 2013. =Campuses= The main campus of the School of Medicine at UAB is located in Birmingham, not to be confused with the original University of Alabama campus located in Tuscaloosa, AL. All students complete their first two years at the main campus in Birmingham. The remaining two years can be completed in Birmingham or at one of three branch campuses in Tuscaloosa, Montgomery or Huntsville. Tuscaloosa In 1974 the University of Alabama created the College of Community Health Sciences. This is a college organized under the University of Alabama, and in conjunction with the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine provides medical education for the 3rd and 4th years of students who choose to study in Tuscaloosa. Huntsville The School of Medicine maintains a branch campus in Huntsville affiliated with Huntsville Hospital. The Huntsville campus was originally a part of the University of Alabama in Huntsville; however, in 1974 UAB assumed control over the Huntsville program. Montgomery UAB's Montgomery campus is a collaborative effort among UAB, Baptist Health and the city of Montgomery. Beginning in May 2014, 10 third-year medical students began taking classes in Montgomery. Admissions For the class entering in 2013, the average MCAT score was 30.0 and the median undergraduate GPA was a 3.72. Of this same year 2,866 applied, 373 were interviewed, 267 were accepted, and 185 matriculated. Distinctions *In 1960, Dr. Basil Hirschowitz was the first to explore the stomach with his new invention, the fiber-optic endoscope, which is now in the Smithsonian Institution. *UAB heart surgeon, the late John W. Kirklin, developed a computerized intensive care unit that became a model for modern ICUs around the world. They help improve care and reduce complications. Kirklin initially gained fame by improving the safety and usefulness of the heart-lung bypass pump. *The Diabetes Research and Education Hospital was dedicated in March 1973, as the first public, university-affiliated diabetes hospital in the nation. *In 1977, Dr. Richard Whitley administered systemic antiviral for the treatment of the deadly HSV (herpes simplex virus) encephalitis, leading to the world's first effective treatment for a viral disease. *The first use in the United States of color doppler echocardiography for visualizing internal cardiac structures was introduced by Dr. Navin C. Nanda and occurred at UAB Hospital in 1984. *In 1986, Dr. Thomas N. James, then chairman of UAB's Department of Medicine, presided over the tenth World Congress of Cardiology held in Washington, D.C. *World's first genetically engineered mouse-human monoclonal antibody was used at University Hospital in the treatment of cancer in 1987. *Dr. John Richard Montgomery, known for co-implementing the environmental bubble used to protect David Vetter, has served as the chief of pediatric programs at the Huntsville campus. *The first simultaneous heart- kidney transplant in the Southeast was performed at UAB by doctors David C.

Known as Berry Road, the state highway runs from MD 210 in Accokeek east to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) and MD 5 Business in Waldorf. MD 228, which is a four- lane divided highway for its entire length, is a major commuter route between southwestern Prince George's County and northern Charles County. In conjunction with MD 210, the state highway serves as an alternative to US 301 and MD 5 as a route to Washington, D.C. from Southern Maryland. MD 228 also serves as part of the connection, again via MD 210, between Waldorf and Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center. MD 228 did not originally connect Waldorf with Accokeek; instead, the state highway headed west from Waldorf and turned south near the Prince George's - Charles county line, following what is now MD 229 to Pomfret. The state highway was built from Pomfret to Berry in the late 1920s. MD 228 was completed between Berry and Waldorf in the mid-1930s. MD 228 was expanded to a divided highway in Charles County and extended into Prince George's County in the mid-1990s. In 2000, the Prince George's County section of the state highway was reconstructed as a divided highway west to the MD 210 intersection, which was rebuilt as the second continuous-flow intersection in the U.S. Route description View east along MD 228 near MD 229 near Bennsville MD 228 begins at a continuous-flow intersection with MD 210 (Indian Head Highway) in Accokeek. Three lanes leave southbound MD 210 and intersect northbound MD 210\\\\. A short distance to the southeast, those lanes intersect a single lane from westbound MD 228 to southbound MD 210; that lane intersects northbound MD 210 to the northwest. The two lanes from westbound MD 228 seamlessly join northbound MD 210, while a single lane ramp from northbound MD 210 joins eastbound MD 228\\\\. The auxiliary lanes from the continuous-flow intersection merge into the state highway's four-lane divided profile before intersecting Manning Road East (unsigned MD 810I), which serves a shopping center to the west and the historic home Bellevue to the east. MD 228 heads east through a forested area, intersecting Bealle Hill Road (unsigned MD 228A) immediately before crossing over Mattawoman Creek into Charles County. On the east side of the stream crossing, the state highway intersects MD 229 (Bensville Road), the old alignment of MD 228\\\\. MD 228 continues east between residential subdivisions along the northern tier of Charles County. The state highway crosses Piney Branch, a tributary of Mattawoman Creek, and passes the highway's old alignment of Bunker Hill Road to the south in the hamlet of Berry. MD 228 curves to the southeast after passing Ironwood Drive and enters Waldorf. At Western Parkway, a county-maintained suburban boulevard that parallels US 301 to the west through Waldorf, MD 228 gains continuous right- turn lanes in both directions and enters a commercial area. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at US 301 (Robert Crain Highway). The roadway continues on the east side of the intersection as MD 5 Business (Leonardtown Road), which heads southeast through the center of Waldorf before intersecting MD 5 on the east side of town. MD 228 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length. History Westbound MD 228 approaching its continuous-flow intersection with MD 210 in Accokeek MD 228 originally included Bensville Road and Berry Road east of the highway's modern intersection with MD 229. The two named roads met at a defunct intersection with Bealle Hill Road south of Mattawoman Creek. A wide gravel road was constructed from MD 227 in Pomfret to Bennsville in 1925 and 1926. The highway was extended to the crossing of Piney Branch in 1927 and to Berry in 1928. MD 228 was constructed west from MD 3 (later US 301 and now MD 925) to Hamilton Road (now Western Parkway) in 1933. The state highway was completed in 1936 when the gap between Berry and Hamilton Road was filled. The Berry Road portion of MD 228 was reconstructed in 1958 and 1959, leaving behind Bunker Hill Road as an old alignment. The reconstruction of MD 228 in its modern form and course began in the early 1990s. The state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 301 west to Sharpersville Road in Berry in 1993. MD 228 was extended into Prince George's County on a pair of new bridges over Mattawoman Creek in 1995. The divided highway extended to just west of a new intersection with Bealle Hill Road; the state highway continued west as a two- lane road to a standard intersection with MD 210. Bennsville Road was renumbered as MD 229 by 1997. The MD 228 divided highway was extended west to MD 210 and the MD 228-MD 210 junction was reconstructed as a continuous-flow intersection in 2000. That intersection became the second continuous-flow intersection in the U.S. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 228A is the designation for a section of Bealle Hill Road immediately to the north of the highway's intersection with MD 228 just west of Mattawoman Creek in Accokeek.

It is the largest genus of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika and also the largest genus in the tribe Lamprologini, which includes Altolamprologus, Chalinochromis, Julidochromis, Lamprologus, Lepidiolamprologus, Telmatochromis and Variabilichromis. The latter is a monotypic genus doubtfully distinct from Neolamprologus. It is already known for some time that according to mtDNA sequence analysis, this genus is very probably polyphyletic. It is likely that it will be revised eventually; if Variabilichromis is split off, at least some of the more ancient lineages currently placed in Neolamprologus are probably worthy of separation also. However, the morphological similarity and numerous undescribed species do not make analyses easier, and as with many cichlids, recent speciation and abundant hybridization seriously confound molecular studies to the point where single-gene studies or those using only mtDNA or nDNA are essentially worthless for resolving Lamprologini phylogeny.Sturmbauer et al. (1994), Day et al. (2007) While lineages are clearly different in their morphology, habits and ecology, gene flow between genera and species is common enough due to extremely low postzygotic isolation. Males of Neolamprologus apparently have always readily and successfully mated with females of other Lamprologini they found ready to spawn: mtDNA lineages similar to other Lamprologini genera are widely encountered in species placed in Neolamprologus. And not only do such hybrids seem to be fertile at least to a limited extent in many cases, new species often appear to originate from such interbreeding.Day et al.

Johnson (born July 14, 1945), former publisher of Newsday, is now better-known as one of the most prominent men so far accused of child pornography offenses. On August 4, 2006, he pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to one count of possession of child pornography and one count of destroying computer records, and was sentenced to fifteen months in federal prison on December 15, 2006. In 2004, citing personal reasons, he resigned as CEO of the financial information and document management firm Bowne & Co, as well as from his position as a member of the New York State Board of Regents. The present article is concerned with Johnson's Newsday years, when he played a leading role in Long Island's governmental and environmental affairs, not only overtly as a dynamic public figure and an activist publisher, but also behind the scenes, particularly in his role as an influential board member of the Long Island Association.  Newsday publisher 1986-1994  Johnson served as publisher of Newsday during a difficult and eventful period in the Long Island daily newspaper's history, from 1986 to November 1994. During his tenure, Newsday made the transition to full-color printing, and tried to maintain a New York City edition. Johnson was responsible for Newsday's wholesale hiring of top journalists away from the city's other dailies; at one point its roster of columnists and critics was arguably the most prestigious in the United States. While at Newsday, Johnson was also the driving force behind a series of ill- fated campaigns to try to promote economic growth on Long Island, and to reduce the political influence of environmentalists and local civic associations, which he regarded as obstructionist. (See, e.g., Urban Development Corporation section on \\"The Long Island Partnership\\".) His close relationship with the noted developer Wilbur Breslin raised some eyebrows, particularly when the two men travelled together to Washington to lobby for relaxation of real estate lending regulations, which had become much stricter following the Saving and Loan debacle. Also controversial was Johnson's collaboration with Howard J. Rubenstein's public relations firm, which was then engaged in composing attacks on environmentalists on behalf of a coalition of Long Island real estate developers and construction labor union leaders, several of whom were indicted for homicide. (See Note 1 below.) Prior to Johnson's arrival on the scene, Newsday had a hard-earned national reputation for its relentless investigations of criminal corruption. Then the legendary reporters Bob Greene and Tom Renner were sidelined, one by a family tragedy and the other by cancer. Soon after Greene went into semi-retirement and Renner died, Newsday's investigative teams were quietly decommissioned. (See Note 2) The announcement of Johnson's appointment as Publisher had specified that he \\"will be responsible for its daily operations, including the news department and editorial policy.\\"  Biography  The following is a reduced version of a biography formerly displayed on the New York State Board of Regents website. Robert M. Johnson, of Huntington, Long Island, New York was elected to a five-year term as the Regent for the Tenth District (Nassau and Suffolk Counties) effective April 1, 1995, and re-elected to serve through March 31, 2005. Born in Joliet, Illinois, Johnson attended Lockport Central High School. He graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, in 1968, majoring in Business Finance and Management. He received a Juris Doctor degree in 1971 from the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He has also received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from St. John's University, an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Hofstra University, and an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Dowling College. Johnson was admitted to the Bar in Illinois and Washington, D.C. and joined the firm Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather and Geraldson, specializing in representation of the media. He became a partner in 1976 and left the firm to become Vice-President and General Manager of the Dispatch Printing Company of Columbus, Ohio in 1978. He was recruited to join Newsday as President and Chief Operating Officer in 1982 and was promoted to Publisher and Chief Executive Officer in 1986, a position he held until he resigned in November 1994. (See Note 3, below.) During his nine years as Newsday's Publisher, the paper expanded into New York City, grew from the ninth to the fifth largest newspaper in the U.S., became the largest selling paper in the New York metropolitan area, and won seven Pulitzer Prizes. Regent Johnson later served as the Chairman and CEO of Bowne & Co., Inc., an international leader in supporting the information and document management needs of the financial services industry, headquartered in Manhattan. After moving to Long Island in 1982, Johnson served as a Director of the New York State Business Council, the Long Island Association, and currently serves as a director of the New York City Partnership. He also has served as a director of the Long Island Philharmonic, the New York Blood Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the South Street Seaport Museum, the Advertising Council, the Audit Bureau of Circulations, and Hofstra University. The Johnsons have a daughter, now a teacher, and a son, both graduates of the public school system in New York State. In 2000, Mr. Johnson received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\"  Notes  Note 1. Newsday and the Construction Lobby in the Johnson Era: For a general overview of the membership and methodology of the \\"Business-Labor Coalition\\" editorially endorsed by Newsday circa 1989-91, see the hard-to-find and unindexed 1990 report of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force et al., Corruption and Racketeering in the New York City Construction Industry: Final Report to Governor Mario M. Cuomo. New York, NY: New York University Press. Although the title refers to New York City, the report also covers organizations and events on Long Island. Starting in the late 1980s, Howard J. Rubenstein Associates provided public relations services for the Association for a Better Long Island and for labor unions belonging to the Building Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk. The latter's fifty-plus member groups include Long Island locals of the Teamsters (Local 282 and others), Carpenters, Laborers,, Ironworkers, Electrical Workers, Painters, Steamfitters, and many other construction unions.The language in the quotes attributed to Rubenstein's clients in his firm's press releases bore an uncanny resemblance to the language of Newsday editorials at the time, particularly in their intemperate denunciations of \\"NIMBY\\"civic group leaders. Members of both ABLI and the BTC appear prominently, and often, in news stories and government reports on organized crime activity in New York City and Long Island. ABLI members sometimes show up as semi-victims, as when the Racanellis are shown reluctantly cooperating with mob extortion. But they also appear as spokesmen and promoters for Mob business interests, as when Wilbur Breslin's attorney Herb Balin was previously working for the notorious John Cody of Local 282. To be fair, most of the murder charges against members of ABLI and the BTC tend to be dropped, and the rare convictions are often overturned. This is perhaps a tribute to the skills of their usual criminal attorney, Stephen Scaring, who is now a member of Robert M. Johnson's defense team. In some cases, charges are never brought in the first place, as when union leaders opposing corruption are murdered (e.g., an Ironworkers official named Leone shot down in his front yard following the release from prison of other officials from the same union, a Carpenters candidate for leadership of a local found dead on the union office floor). Biographies and trial transcripts of Mafia bosses often mention the union locals they've been involved with, and in the New York area these generally include BTC-affiliated locals. A murder case involving an ABLI board member concerned the death of a construction foreman who preferred to work with a non-Mafia cement supplier; in that case, the developer's chauffeur was convicted, the cement connection was ruled a coincidence, and the accused developer served a brief jail term for the charge of trying to cover up evidence. (See Discussion page accompanying this article.) During Johnson's years at the helm of Newsday, the ABLI-BTC \\"Business-Labor Coalition\\" was promoted in editorials as a movement to save Long Island from the stranglehold of \\"NIMBY\\" environmental groups and civic associations. During this time, the \\"Coalition\\" engaged directly in political campaigns (see 1989 Newsday archived articles on Suffolk Legislators Blass and Prospect). In early August 1991, a Carpenters- led demonstration to promote construction of \\"WillyWorld\\" climaxed in an occupation of Brookhaven Town Hall; that night, the BTC's friends in the Suffolk County Police physically prevented members of the public (including local Suffolk Legislator Nora Bredes) from attending the town's public hearing on \\"WillyWorld\\". Newsday's coverage of this extraordinary event was blandly uninformative; the pertinent facts were barely mentioned, and then only in a subjective column by Paul Vitello a day after the main story. Note 2. Investigative Team Decommissioned. For a while after the departure of Greene and Renner, Newsday continued to publish occasional major investigations into mob-related corruption in the construction industry. During 1991, the Long Island Business Journal, a small monthly published in Westhampton by Sheahan Communications , reported in a brief gossipy item that the Association for a Better Long Island was deeply displeased with on-going \\"business-bashing\\" in the pages of Newsday, and considering an advertising boycott or the creation of a competing newspaper. A later issue had an even briefer follow-up, indicating that they had met with Johnson and resolved their differences. Coincidentally or not, this coincided with the end of Newsday's rigorous scrutiny of Mob-infested businesses. It's also possible they could have been referring to the scrupulously objective in-depth stories by star business reporter Greg Steinmetz, but he may have already left for the Wall Street Journal by the time of Johnson's negotiations with the ABLI. Note 3. Resignation from Newsday. Johnson's resignation was reported at the time (in Newsday, the New York Times, and local business publications) as involuntary, following a long and stormy meeting with his Times-Mirror bosses. The contents of the discussion were not made public. Immediately following his ouster, Johnson was hired for an undisclosed sum to work as a consultant for Wilbur Breslin.

He served as the head football coach at Tulane University (1976‚Äì1979), the University of Arizona (1980‚Äì1986), the University of Southern California (1987‚Äì1992), and the University of Missouri (1994‚Äì2000). In Smith's 24 seasons as a head coach, his teams were 143‚Äì126‚Äì7. Early life Smith was a native of Van Wert, Ohio, where he was a three- sport star at Van Wert High School, graduating in 1957. He earned an appointment to West Point, but transferred to Bowling Green State University a year later to pursue coaching. He played two-way end at for the Falcons, playing on a small-college national championship team as a sophomore in 1959; he won all-league honors as a junior and was team captain as a senior.Former USC Head Football Coach Larry Smith Dies, USCTrojans.com, January 28, 2008.

Known as a defense-oriented, no-nonsense coach, Smith began coaching as an assistant with Shawnee High School in Lima, Ohio for two seasons (1962‚Äì63) and then head coach the next three years (1964‚Äì66). In 1967, he joined Bo Schembechler's staff at Miami University, serving as defensive end coach for two seasons. He moved with Schembechler to Michigan, serving as offensive line coach for four seasons (1969‚Äì72). When fellow assistant coach Jim Young (also a native of Van Wert, OH and high school football teammate) was hired as head coach at Arizona, Smith moved with him and served as the assistant head coach/defensive coordinator there for three years (1973‚Äì75). Coaching career =Tulane= After the departure of Bennie Ellender, Tulane hired Smith as the head coach in 1976. His first team went 2‚Äì9, then improved over the following years to 3‚Äì8 and 4‚Äì7.Tulane Yearly Results: 1975-1979 , College Football Data Warehouse, Accessed January 30, 2008. Smith's Green Wave teams experienced a break-out year in 1979: Tulane opened the season defeating #13 Stanford and later defeated #19 SMU. In the regular season finale, Tulane defeated rival LSU, 24‚Äì13, in the Louisiana Superdome; the crowd of 73,496 remains the highest attendance to see the Green Wave play at the Superdome. Tulane ended the regular season with a 9‚Äì2 record, ranked #15 and was invited to play in the 1979 Liberty Bowl. Its first bowl game in six years, Tulane lost to Penn State, 9‚Äì6, but Smith's ability to finish the season 9‚Äì3 attracted attention and he was hired away by Arizona.Former Football Coach Larry Smith Dies At Age 68 , TulaneGreenWave.com, January 28, 2008. Smith's tenure with Tulane ended with a 17‚Äì27 record. Under his guidance, ten Tulane players earned All-America honors, including two-time All-Americans quarterback Roch Hontas and kicker Eddie Murray as well as offensive tackle Eric Laakso and tight end Rodney Holman. Six of his Tulane players entered the NFL. =Arizona= Smith arrived at Arizona in time for the 1980 season, the Wildcats' third season in the Pacific-10 Conference (along with rival Arizona State [ASU], they had joined the former Pacific-8 in 1978). Smith put great emphasis on in-state recruiting, built up the rivalry game with ASU, and focused the team on what he called \\"running and hitting\\". His first team went 5‚Äì6, including a 44‚Äì7 blowout loss to ASU; it would be his only losing season at Arizona. The highlight of the season was a 23-17 upset of 2nd ranked UCLA (the Bruins were poised to become #1 as top ranked Alabama had lost earlier in the day).Larry Smith: 1939-2008 , Arizonaathletics.com, January 28, 2008.

Under his leadership, the Wildcats became competitive in the conference, began dominating the rivalry with the Sun Devils, and culminated with consecutive bowl appearances, in the 1985 Sun Bowl, where a tie with Georgia gave the Wildcats an 8‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, and the 1986 Aloha Bowl, where a victory over North Carolina allowed the Wildcats to finish with a 9‚Äì3 record in his final season. Smith's tenure with the Wildcats ended with a 48‚Äì28‚Äì3 record. Seven Arizona players earned All-America honors during his tenure, including two-time consensus All-American linebacker Ricky Hunley and All-Americans linebacker Lamonte Hunley (Ricky's younger brother), Morris Trophy-winning center Joe Tofflemire, safety Allan Durden, placekicker Max Zendejas, linebacker Byron Evans, and safety Chuck Cecil. Over twenty of Smith's Wildcats players went on to play professionally. =USC= After success at Tulane and Arizona, Smith was hired as USC's first coach without previous Trojan ties since Howard Jones in 1925. His tenure at USC started strong as his first three Trojans teams went 27‚Äì8‚Äì1, won a then-school-record 19 consecutive Pacific-10 Conference games, earned three consecutive conference titles from 1987 to 1989, and went to three consecutive Rose Bowls.Jerry Crowe, Larry Smith, 68; led USC to Rose Bowl three times, Los Angeles Times, January 29, 2008.

USC's Rose Bowl berth- clinching win over UCLA that year was its first-ever against the Bruins in Pasadena since they moved to the Rose Bowl in 1982. Smith's USC team entered their final regular season game ranked #2 against the #1-ranked rival Notre Dame; the Fighting Irish defeated the Trojans, 27‚Äì10, en route to a national title. The Trojans went on to play in the Rose Bowl, losing to Michigan. His 1989 team went 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 in the regular season and beat Michigan in the 1990 Rose Bowl to avenge the previous year's loss. Smith's next two Trojans teams were not as successful, losing the John Hancock Bowl (now Sun Bowl) in the 1990 season followed by a difficult 3‚Äì8 1991 season that began with a major upset loss at home to unheralded Memphis State.Mal Florence, Memphis State Didn't Buy USC Mystique : Tigers: Stobart had his team ready to face the music in the Coliseum, Los Angeles Times, September 3, 1991, accessed August 2, 2013. The 1990 season was marked by a strained relationship with quarterback Todd Marinovich, culminating in a heated verbal barrage on Smith in full view of a national TV audience during the 1990 bowl loss and Marinovich getting arrested for cocaine possession a month later; Marinovich soon left for the NFL after his sophomore year. After the 1990 season three players were arrested on charges of sexual assault (and later acquitted), and after spring practice there were the arrests and subsequent convictions of two players in a kidnapping-robbery spree. The 1991 season itself was only the third time the Trojans had had a losing season in over thirty years.Richard Hoffer, Where Are The Good Old Days?, Sports Illustrated, August 31, 1992, Accessed September 10, 2008. The 1992 season proved to be Smith's undoing with USC. The Trojans had a disappointing 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 regular season that included a 31‚Äì31 tie with San Diego State (a game in which the Aztecs' Marshall Faulk shredded the USC defense for over 250 yards), a 31‚Äì23 loss to intersectional rival Notre Dame, and a gut-wrenching 38‚Äì37 loss to archrival UCLA. The then #23-ranked Trojans accepted a berth in the 1992 Freedom Bowl, a lower tier bowl game in Anaheim, California, against an unranked Fresno State team in the first match between the two programs. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Trent Dilfer-led Bulldogs won in a 24‚Äì7 upset victory that angered many USC supporters. Smith caused further furor after the game in declaring that \\"Names and logos don't mean anything. You don't beat someone just because of your name and logo.\\" Within days of the Freedom Bowl loss and his commentary, Smith was fired by USC with three years left on his contract. Smith finished with a 44‚Äì25‚Äì3 record at USC, 17‚Äì17‚Äì2 in his final three seasons. During his tenure he coached 13 All- American first teamers, including Heisman Trophy-runner-up Rodney Peete, Thorpe Award-winning safety Mark Carrier, linebacker Junior Seau, wide receiver Curtis Conway and defensive tackle Tim Ryan. Thirty-three of his USC players were selected in the NFL Draft, six in the first round. =Missouri= After a year away from coaching, Smith was hired before the 1994 season as the 30th head coach of Missouri, replacing Bob Stull, who had been reassigned as assistant athletic director after five losing seasons.SPORTS PEOPLE: FOOTBALL; Coach for Missouri, The New York Times, December 16, 1993.Reaction To Death Of Former Coach Larry Smith, MUTigers.com, January 28, 2008.

The 1981 edition of Guinness claimed that Miller had been undefeated in eating contests since 1931, resulting in a fifty-year winning streak. Despite a diet consisting of up to 25,000 calories a day - reflected in his former 5' 7¬Ω\\", 280-300 pound physique - Miller lived to the age of 89. Miller had by then retired from competitive eating and weighed considerably less than he did during his heyday. Miller believed he received his nickname when his father, who travelled the country with Bozo's mother in a vaudeville show, was performing as a clown. He married Janice Bidwell, a former Princess of the Pasadena Rose Bowl. She died on March 28, 2001 after many years of illness and invalidity stemming from a brain haemorrhage and through which Miller cared for her. \\"Bozo\\" and wife Janice had three daughters together: Virginia \\"Cooky\\" Logan, Candice Blackman, and Janice \\"Honey\\" Miller who died in a car crash in the 1970s. The death of his daughter ultimately led to Miller's retirement from professional eating. \\"Bozo\\" Miller worked as a restaurateur and then as a liquor distributor. His drinking ability was almost as impressive as his gastronomic feats. He once drank a lion under the table. Miller was an avid horse racing fan and witnessed many of the major races of the racehorse Seabiscuit. Miller died on January 7, 2008, having struggled with diabetes and heart disease in his final years. Early obituaries gave his age as 99 and his year of birth as 1908, but according to obituaries in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Daily Telegraph, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, Miller was born in 1918 and, according to the Wall Street Journal obituary, habitually exaggerated his age.
