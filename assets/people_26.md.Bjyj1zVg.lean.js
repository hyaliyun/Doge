Development and usage The aircraft was designed in 1929 by a Romanian engineer Romulus Bratu, who worked in France. Quite unusual was its arrangement, with one engine in a fuselage front, and the other two in a common nacelle over a wing, in a push-pull configuration. A model was tested in a laboratory of St. Cyr Aeronautical Institute. Parts of the plane were made in a factory at Athis-Mons, and assembled in the CIDNA workshops at Le Bourget airport. The prototype was flown on 26 November 1932 and after tests, received a French airworthiness certificate. The plane had high useful load 4500 kg and could fly on two engines. In March 1933 it was shown to the French Minister of Air Pierre Cot.  Description  High-wing cantilever monoplane of wooden construction, with closed cab, three engines, and a fixed landing gear. Sparless wing, with slightly swept leading edge, straight rear edge and rounded tips, was basing on a geodetical structure of crossing ribs. Crew sat in a cab before the wing. Next and below in the fuselage, under the wing, there was a cabin for 10 passengers, with rectangular windows and access doors in front and at the rear. The landing- gear was of the conventional-type, with a tailwheel. A single Gnome-Rh√¥ne Jupiter 420 hp radial engine was mounted in the nose of the fuselage, while two Gnome-Rh√¥ne Titan 230 hp radial engines were in a common nacelle on struts above the fuselage and wing, one of them was tractor, the other one pusher (push-pull configuration). All engines drove two-blade propellers and had no covers.

Stearns, 678 F. Supp. 2d 980 (C.D. Cal. 2008), was filed in spring 2006 by Association of Christian Schools International against the University of California claiming religious discrimination over the rejection of five courses as college preparatory instruction. On August 8, 2008, Judge S. James Otero entered summary judgment against plaintiff ACSI, upholding the University of California's standards. Lawsuit The suit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleged that the university system's rejection of several courses, including a history course, a government course, and science courses, was \\"viewpoint discrimination\\" that violated the constitutional rights of applicants from Christian schools whose high school coursework is deemed inadequate preparation for college. The books in particular were published by A Beka Books and Bob Jones University Press. They contained problems such as statements that where science and the Bible contradict, the student must choose the Bible, and judgment of the value of American historical figures on their religion. The UC board concluded that those books did not offer proper preparatory instruction for the university. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of six children who had not been rejected from the university, but were required to take additional, remedial courses. In August 2006, the case was allowed to proceed against the university while lawsuits against individual school officials were thrown out. The Association retained leading intelligent design proponent Michael Behe to testify in the case as an expert witness. Behe's expert witness report claimed that the Christian textbooks were excellent works for high school students and he defended that view in a deposition.Behe, Michael J. (April 2, 2007) Expert Witness report in Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Stearns et al.United States District Court for the Central District of California (May 30, 2007) Deposition of Michael Behe in Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Stearns et al. Decision On March 28, 2008, the defendants won a legal victory when their motion for partial summary judgment was granted, and the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was denied. In part of the judgment, the court focused on several creationist/intelligent design texts and quoted Behe's testimony against the plaintiffs: Biologist PZ Myers wrote, \\"The judge pointed out that the books that Behe approved flatly state that Christians must accept creationist conclusions‚Äîunlike our biology books, which don't demand any religious litmus test of their readers‚Äîand were therefore perfect examples of exactly the problem he was complaining about.\\" The August 2008 ruling concluded that various books offered by the school shouldn't be used for a college-preparatory history class because \\"it didn't encourage critical thinking skills and failed to cover 'major topics, themes and components' of U.S. history\\", Otero wrote. The judge said Calvary provided little admissible evidence to the contrary. On January 26, 2009, ACSI filed an appeal on the decision. On January 12, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court's summary judgment in favor of the University of California. On October 12, 2010, the Supreme Court declined to review the case, effectively ending it. (cert. denied).

At the 2001 census its population was 238 and at the 2011 census it was 229. The town is situated on the confluence of Merkys River with its tributaries ≈†alƒçia and Gelu≈æa. About east of Valkininkai there is Valkinink≈≥ Gele≈æinkelio Stotis, a settlement that grew around a train station on the Warsaw ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway and now has more residents. History It is believed that Valkininkai was first mentioned in a letter from Grand Duke Jogaila to his brother Skirgaila in 1387. The settlement developed on a large island (since then disappeared) in Merkys River. Situated near the Hrodna‚ÄìVarƒóna‚ÄìVilnius route, the settlement had a royal estate that Grand Dukes used as a hunting lodge. The route further grew in importance after the 1385 Union of Krewo as it connected the Lithuanian capital in Vilnius with the Polish capital in Krak√≥w. In 1418, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great gifted the estate to his wife Juliana Olshanska. In 1503, the town was mentioned as a seat of a volost. In 1516, King Sigismund I the Old accepted envoys of Charles, King of Spain and future Holy Roman Emperor in Valkininkai. A royal cannon foundry, established in 1551 and powered by a watermill, is credited for the growth of the town. Needed iron ore was collected in local swamps and imported from abroad. During the Wallach reform, craftsmen were given land and relocated from the town to nearby villages, which were often named after their craft. Such villages included ƒåebatoriai (shoemakers), Puod≈æiai (kettle makers), Kani≈´kai (hostlers), Juodieji Kalviai (blacksmiths), Strielƒçiai (bowmen). In 1571, Valkininkai was granted city rights under Magdeburg law (the privilege was later renewed in 1723 and 1792). According to 1601 register, the town had 150 families (900‚Äì1050 people), 19 butchers, 89 pubs, and 157 craftsmen. The town grew as a trade and craft center and attracted the first Jewish settlers. Valkininkai suffered from a series of wars. The town was devastated during the Second Northern War (1655‚Äì1660) and lost 75‚Äì80% of the population. The royal cannon foundry was looted and closed. In 1701, during the Lithuanian Civil War between Sapieha family and other magnates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a major battle was fought near the town. The town somewhat recovered, and its population reached about 800 residents in 1749 and 949 residents (including 273 Jews) in 1790. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Valkininkai was part of Trakai Voivodeship. In 1795, Valkininkai was annexed by the Russian Empire in the course of the Third Partition of Poland. In 1812, the town was ravaged by Napoleon I armies during the French invasion of Russia. Instances of famine, caused by the war, were recorded as late as 1822. Completion of the Warsaw ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway in 1862 and increased demand for local timber helped the town to recover and grow: the population increased from 1516 in 1841 to 2619 (including 1126 Jews) in 1897. However, industrialization was slow: a large paper and cardboard factory, employing some 100 people, was established in the last decade of the 19th century and a turpentine factory (10‚Äì14 employees) was established in 1923. The population decreased to 1244 in 1919. Around 400 Jews from Valkininkai were executed in Ei≈°i≈°kƒós in September 1941 by Rollkommando Hamann and only five Jews (four of them hidden by friendly Lithuanians) survived World War II. After the war the population decreased to 769 in 1959, 410 in 1970, and 277 in 1987. Religion The first church was built in the early 16th century. In 1581, Queen Bona Sforza built a new Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and established a parish with the seat in Valkininkai. The wooden church burned down in 1655 and 1772, and was wrecked by a storm in 1818. The present-day brick and stone church was built in 1823‚Äì1837 in Neoclassical style. In 1896‚Äì1898, the length of the church increased twofold when a transept and apse were added, giving the church traditional cross-shaped floor plan. The central nave has a cylindrical vault; the original construction plan envisioned a small dome, but it was never built. From 1910 to 1916, Vladas Mironas, future Prime Minister of Lithuania, was the pastor at Valkininkai church. The church displays sacred relics of Boniface of Tarsus, a 4th-century martyr, whose body was excavated from Roman catacombs and transported to Lithuania in 1765. In 1635 or 1636, Franciscan friars established a monastery, which became the most prominent structure in the town. It was closed in 1832 after the failed November Uprising against the Russian Empire and turned into military barracks. After the January Uprising of 1863, the former monastery church was turned into a parish church of the Eastern Orthodox, even the new parish had only 75 Orthodox believers, mostly Russian officials. Such decision was part of wider Russification campaign, that included the Lithuanian press ban. In 1883, the Orthodox church was reconstructed and acquired features of Byzantine Revival. During World War I most of the Orthodox community evacuated to Russia and the church was abandoned. However, it was not returned to the Catholics ‚Äì the church was transformed into a hall for dances, concerts, and plays. During World War II, Germans used the former monastery as a camp for war prisoners. In 1944, the monastery and its church were burned down and demolished. The Jewish community built a wooden synagogue in Valkininkai at the end of the 18th century. It was rebuilt in 1801. According to a legend, Napoleon stopped in the town during his invasion of Russia and was greeted by the Jewish community. Impressed with the hospitality Napoleon gifted his red velvet saddle pad, richly decorated and bearing his initials. The gift was prominently displayed in the synagogue. In 1880, a smaller synagogue was built nearby. The synagogues were burned during the first days of the occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany. Architecture The urban layout, which formed in the 16th century and is preserved to this day, was declared an urban monument and is protected by the state. Most valuable monuments are the street grid and main market square. The market square formed at the crossing of four main roads. It is long (its length is 8 times its width) and irregularly triangle. Coat of arms Valkininkai together with 73 other towns was granted city rights and coat of arms in 1792 by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski during the Four-Year Sejm. The arms depicted a golden lion with silver tongue, teeth, and nails. The shield was surrounded by two laurel branches with red berries. The arms and city rights were abolished the same year after the Second Partition of Poland‚ÄìLithuania. The coat of arms were modernized by artist Taida Balƒçi≈´naitƒó and reinstated by a presidential decree in February 1993.

The company was acquired by Fahlgren Inc. in March 2010 and officially joined forces with Fahlgren‚Äôs public relations business unit, Fahlgren Mortine Public Relations, on June 28, 2010. With the acquisition of Edward Howard, Fahlgren Mortine became the largest public relations firm in Ohio and is ranked 22nd on the recent O‚ÄôDwyer‚Äôs ranking of top independent public relations firms. At the time of its acquisition, Edward Howard was the nation‚Äôs longest-established independent public relations firm and was 100 percent employee owned. Fahlgren Mortine is known for its expertise in public relations, marketing communications, media relations, crisis communications, reputation management, investor relations, public/government affairs, and more recently, for its leadership in social media and interactive online communications.  History  = 1925 - 1950 = Edward Howard was founded in 1925 by Edward Howard II, then a young employee who served as an advertising manager for The Cleveland Trust Company. Among other duties, he edited Cleveland Trust's employee publication and promoted the sale of liberty bonds to help raise finances for World War I through propaganda posters at bank branch offices. Previously, Edward Howard II had worked as a police and sports reporter for The Plain Dealer and had obtained a year of law school education. With $400 in start-up capital, the support of his young wife Claire McMurray Howard, and two clients, he began a new career in the fledgling field of public relations. Over the next 29 years, he established and expanded the firm beyond its original two clients ‚Äì a stock brokerage and a bank (Cleveland Trust) ‚Äì to include leading organizations such as Hanna Mining Co., Cleveland Graphite Bronze (later Clevite) and the Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia.

It is one of two palazzi in the city designed by Andrea Palladio for members of the Porto family (the other is Palazzo Porto, for Iseppo Porto, in contr√† Porti). Only two bays of it were ever built, beginning shortly after 1571. Why the patron, Alessandro Porto, did not continue with the project is not known.The sobriquet Casa del Diavolo mentioned by Banister Fletcher, Andrea Palladio His Life and Work (1902:53-55) may have accounted for its incompletion in fanciful ways.  History  For completing the scheme, which was probably intended to have been seven bays wide, the Porto family's 15th- century case, still standing to the left of the great architectural torso, would have been incrementally demolished. The structure was completed after Palladio's death by Vincenzo Scamozzi. The project seems to have been initiated immediately following the publication in 1570 of Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura, in which its design does not appear. It was illustrated by Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi in 1776,Le fabbriche e i disegni di Andrea Palladio, 1776. who called it the Casa Porto and traced the extent of foundations built for it, suggesting that an interior courtyard with an exedra end was contemplated, of which part was built. Bertotti Scamozzi attributed its design to Vincenzo Scamozzi.Fletcher 1902.  Architecture  Palazzo Porto in Piazza Casello shows the influence of Palladio's Roman visit. Its grandiose scale was not purely competitive with the Thiene, with whom the Porto were connected by contemporary marriages and whose palazzo faces it across the broad piazza, but corresponds with its urban position, intended to shape and dominate a great open space. The two standing bays fully define the programme of the intended fa√ßade: a giant order of engaged Composite columns stand on high socles ‚Äì themselves on bases that are taller than a person's heightThe proportions of base to column here violate Palladio's own canons of proportion. ‚Äì against the crisp and flat urbane rustication of the basement. The full expression of the order in columns breaks the entablature boldly forward over each column; it is one-fifth the height of the columns and pierced with windows in the manner of Baldassare Peruzzi, to give light to rooms of a mezzanine. A frieze carved with swags of oak garlands in bold relief, hung from the abaci of the capitals, passes between them, creating a richly sculptural unbroken band across the fa√ßade. Windows with alternating triangular and segmental pediments are each provided with a balustraded balcony supported by brackets.

Trick bowling often involves special pin setup, multiple bowling balls, or obstacles placed on the lane. Trick Bowling has a rich history in bowling leagues across the country, and has more recently become a staple of the world's most popular and largest professional bowling league, the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA).  Popular trick shots  Multiple Pin Strike: As opposed to the standard 10-pin bowling setup, this trick is set up with more than 10 pins (usually between 30 and 120 pins) in the same triangular formation as the standard 10-pin setup and played on an open area instead of a bowling lane. The bowler usually releases the ball with a great strength and/or a very precision technique to ensure that the ball has enough strength to start a chain reaction that will knock down all pins. This trick is often implemented in bowling video games, with Wii Sports being the most famous example. Spinning Ball Spare Conversion: The bowler spins one ball slowly down the lane, and sends a second ball down the lane normally. The second ball is meant to knock down nine pins, while the first slowly spun ball picks up the spare. Towel Shot: A shot perfected by PBA Legend Norm Duke. The bowler wraps the ball in a handtowel, and releases it in a slingshot-like manner down the lane. This shot is very difficult because the bowler has no fingers in the ball, and it is very difficult to create spin and maintain accuracy. Multiple Ball Roll: A bowler will take three or more balls in one hand and attempt to knock down as many pins as possible pick up a difficult split. Off-hand bowl: The bowler takes the ball and bowls it with his off hand, or the hand he would not normally bowl with. For instance, a right- handed bowler bowling with his or her left hand. Backwards approach shot: The bowler, facing away from the pins, throws the ball between his legs without looking down the lane. Marked Shots: The bowler will place a marker on the lane, the most common being a small piece of tape, and the ball must cross over that marker before knocking down the pins. Reduced finger shots: Instead of putting the normal two fingers and a thumb in the ball, the bowler will use only two, or even one finger in the ball and roll it down the lane trying to knock down the required number of pins, usually a spare pickup. Prop Shots: A prop shot is where the bowler places an object or person in the lane to create an obstacle for the shot and make it more difficult. The most common props are chairs and people. Chairs are set up in the lane, and the bowler must either bowl over them or through the legs. For people, the most common setup is to bowl through their legs.. A variation of this trick is to throw the ball to the air from a distance, and landing onto the lane. Flying Eagle: A variation of the hardest spare pickup in bowling: the 7‚Äì10 split. This shot requires two lanes. The 7 pin is set up in the lane that the bowler throws the ball down, while the 10 pin is set up in the lane to the right. Another pin is set up further up in the lane with the 7 pin. The bowler must hit the lead pin, send it flying into the adjacent lane to knock down the 10 pin, and the ball must continue through and hit the 7 pin.  Trick bowling at the professional level  In the days before the PBA's existence, Andy Varipapa was well known for his trick bowling. More recently, the PBA brought trick bowling to the national spotlight by creating a trick bowling competition, similar to the All-Star games of other professional sports leagues, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Football League, and National Hockey League. The PBA's trick bowling competition is known as the \\"skills challenge.\\" Some of the PBA's top bowlers have participated in the competition, including Parker Bohn III, Norm Duke, Chris Barnes, Del Ballard, Jr., Wes Malott, Doug Kent, Brian Voss, Danny Wiseman and Chris Johnson. The format in the skills challenge is like a game of \\"horse\\" in basketball. One bowler attempts the trick shot, and his opponent has the chance to match it. If the opponent cannot match the challenger's shot, the challenger gets a point. The first bowler to three points wins.  Changes in format  In the 2006-2007 Skills Challenge, the format changed from a head-to-head style competition to a team-based competition, with teams of two. This added a new dynamic to the competition, because partners could bowl together and create more difficult shots. However, after negative reactions from the fanbase, the format was changed back to head-to-head in the 2007-2008 competition.

This work also hypothesized in part over why the English had chosen St George as their patron saint. Godsal suggested that after the defeat of the Norman Conquest the English, would have consoled themselves with memories of 'bygone days', in Old English, geogeara, and that the name of St George could have been confused with this echo of former glory.Contemporary Review, Colman Rebecca, 1 April 1997 Subsequent works included Woden's, Grim's and Offa's Dykes (1913) and Mona Badonicus, the battle of Bath (1914) Later in life Godsal also wrote The Conquests of Ceawlin, The second Bretwalda, where he charted the arrival of the West Saxons through to the fall of Ceawlin.

The incident occurred during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. It occurred in the tidal trench between Texel and the mainland that was known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen.  Background  During the War of the First Coalition the Dutch Republic was invaded in 1794 by the armies of the French Republic, which led to the flight of Stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange, to England, and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic. This Republic now changed sides in the war, entering into an offensive and defensive alliance with France. In the course of the War of the Second Coalition, which actually was a continuation of the first war, without France, Great Britain, or the Batavian Republic having concluded a peace, Great Britain and Russia decided to launch an invasion of the Batavian Republic in the peninsula of North Holland in August 1799. It was hoped that this invasion would cause a popular uprising of the Dutch population against their republic. The former Stadtholder and his eldest son the Hereditary Prince tried to support the expedition by propaganda- efforts and intrigues with disaffected officers. The loyalty of the Batavian navy was especially in doubt, as this was a hotbed of Orangist sentiment. The British Major General George Don, who conducted a reconnaissance of the Republic in July, estimated that the Helder squadron of the Batavian fleet would fall into British hands without a fight, if the Allies played their cards right.Roodhuyzen, p. 164. To accomplish this bloodless coup, the invading fleet came well stocked with flags of the previous regime, propaganda pamphlets, and Dutch √©migr√©s, the most important of whom was the Hereditary Prince.Dutch: Erfprins. The title used by the future king William I of the Netherlands, as eldest son and heir of the Prince of Orange, the Hereditary Stadtholder William V; the office of stadtholder had formally nothing to do with the fact that it was often held by a Prince of Orange One of the Orangist officers who had left the Navy in 1795, Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, had on behalf of the Prince contacted two of his former colleagues, Theodorus Frederik van Capellen and Aegidius van Braam (who had re-enlisted in the Batavian navy), with the object of getting them to organize a mutiny in the Helder squadron (where they each commanded a ship-of-the-line). However, it is not clear whether the two officers indeed made a determined organizational effort before the fatal day. The invasion fleet of about 200 warships and transports left England on 13 August. Inclement weather at first prevented it from approaching the Dutch coast. However, on 22 August, British Vice-Admiral Mitchell was able to approach the roadstead of Den Helder where the squadron of Admiral Story lay at anchor. Mitchell sent over parlimentaires demanding that Story defect to the Prince with his fleet, but Story refused indignantly. He replied further that he would ask for further instructions from the Batavian government. The British ships then withdrew and the weather again turned bad for a few days. On 26 August an Anglo-RussianThe squadron comprised at least two Russian ships: Mitchiloff (64) and Ratzivan (68); De Jonge, p. 468, fn. 1 invasion fleet of eleven ships-of-the-line and seven frigates arrived at the roadstead of Texel, flying the flag of the Prince of Orange. They started to disembark troops on the 27th, without opposition from the Batavian fleet, that had withdrawn into the Zuider Zee. General Herman Willem Daendels, the commander of the Batavian landforces, ordered the evacuation of the coastal forts of Den Helder after losing the Battle of Callantsoog (1799).  Mutiny and surrender  On 28 August, Admiral Story returned with his squadron to the Vlieter roadstead. He was forced to anchor because of adverse winds that prevented the fleet from mounting a direct attack on British. Enervated by the sight of the Orangist flags on the forts and church steeples of Den Helder, several ships' crews began to mutiny. Among the ships whose crew rebelled was Van Braam's ship, the Leyden. He later admitted he could have easily suppressed the revolt aboard his ship, but that he decided against it. Instead, he informed his commanding officer, Admiral Story‚Äîwho himself had to counter an incipient mutiny on the flagship Washington‚Äîof the \\"precarious situation\\" aboard the other ships of the fleet.Roodhuyzen, p. 166. Story subsequently sent his flag captain, Van Capellen, and Cerberus captain, De Jong, under a flag of truce to parlay with the commander of the British squadron, Admiral Mitchell. Van Capellen and De Jong were to instruct Mitchell that the Dutch fleet intended to give battle in accordance with explicit orders from the agent for the Navy of the Batavian Republic, Jacobus Spoors, but that Story had requested further orders and proposed to await those. Story requested a temporary truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. He would later go on to state that this had merely been a ruse to buy him some time‚Äînecessary to restore order back to the fleet.De Jonge, pp. 470‚Äì472. Mitchell did not fall for this ruse, probably because the two Dutch negotiators were actually the mutiny ringleaders.Roodhuyzen, pp. 165‚Äì166. Mitchell issued an ultimatum of one hour for Story to defect, or face the consequences. Faced with this ultimatum, Story convened a council of war aboard his flagship with all his captains. According to Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Maitland, who was present at the discussions on board Washington as a British parlimentaire, Van Capellen, De Jong, and Van Braam did their best to influence the council in the direction of accepting the ultimatum. He later asked in a letter to General Dundas that \\"the opinions and sentiments expressed by the captains Van Capelle, Van Braam and the [sic] Jong generally in the presence of Admiral Story might not become public and those officers thereby endangered. To you in this letter, I apprehend I do right inform you, that above mentioned captains did declare their attachment to the Stadholder and the former government and their disgust at the present government and their French connections ...\\" Before this council started, the crew of the Washington had already begun a full mutiny, refusing to man the guns, and throwing munitions into the sea. Attempts by Van Braam and by Story himself to reason with the mutineers had been of no avail. When asked during the council of war to describe the situation aboard their ships, all except Captain Van Senden of Batavier had similar stories. In these circumstances it seemed impossible to engage in battle. Besides, the officers calculated that their continued resistance would contribute little to the fight against the invasion, as the disembarkation had already taken place. Scuttling the fleet seemed impossible, because the crews would not allow it. Finally, some calculated that it would be better to surrender without resistance, because in that case the ships would end up in the possession of the Stadtholder, instead of becoming war booty for the British.De Jonge, pp. 474‚Äì476. The council of war therefore unanimously decided to lower the flag of the Batavian Republic and declare themselves prisoners of war. They refused, however, to hoist the Orange flag. This may seem a minor point, but it signified that the officers did not defect. When Mitchell accepted the surrender, he did this in the name of the Prince of Orange. He therefore ordered the flag of the Prince to be hoisted, with which order some of the officers complied. This act was to cost them dearly later on, as it was interpreted as an act of treason.De Jonge, p. 477. Meanwhile, in the absence of the captains, further acts of mutiny had taken place on the other ships. One officer was drowned; others were beaten up. The Batavian flag was torn up by the mutineers. British officers restored order with some difficulty. After their surrender, the Prince visited several of the ships to the encouragement of the mutineers.De Jonge, p. 478.; remarkably, lots of Scandinavian crew members and German mercenaries felt little allegiance to the House of Orange; Fehrman, pp. 60ff. He had hoped to now take command of the surrendered fleet himself, yet his request was denied by the British. The crews were disembarked and British prize crews sailed the ships to England. Only five derelict frigates lying off Den Helder were handed to William. These were manned with old-regime volunteer crews living in the vicinity. They sailed to England under jury rig in November. One of these frigates foundered with loss of life.Roodhuyzen, p. 169. Aftermath After this initial success, the Anglo-Russian expedition soon ran into difficulties. The civilian population of North Holland did not display the fervour for the cause of Orange that the Prince had expected. The Batavian army proved remarkably resilient and managed in cooperation with the French army of occupation to deal the Allies defeats at the Battle of Bergen and Battle of Castricum. The Allies therefore evacuated North Holland at the end of October. As this was the second surrender of a Batavian fleet in short order (after the capitulation of Saldanha Bay in 1796), the authorities of the Batavian Republic decided to convene a court-martial on 8 October, to exact exemplary punishment of the officers responsible for the surrender, and of the mutineers. As these were away in England the trial had to wait until the first returned to the Netherlands on parole. Those were arrested. Only Story himself, Van Braam and Van Capellen remained outside the reach of the court. They were eventually tried in absentia.Roodhuyzen, p. 167. One captain, N. Connio, of the brig Gier was condemned to death, and executed on board the guard ship Rozenburg on 27 December, to the consternation of the detained officers. Captain Dirk Hendrik Kolff of Utrecht was also condemned to death, but he managed to escape before his execution. Captain De Jong was acquitted of the charge of treason, for lack of evidence, but he was convicted of dereliction of duty. He was cashiered; had to undergo a symbolic simulated execution (whereby a sword was swung over his head), and was banished for life. The trials were then suspended in hope that the absent officers would become available. In July 1801 the trial was resumed with new indictments against officers who had surrendered ships on earlier occasions or been otherwise derelict. Several other officers were punished in an attempt to make clear to the officer corps that surrender without a fight was unacceptable. In June 1802 the Hoge Zeekrijgsraad was replaced by a permanent court, the Hoge Militaire Vierschaar (High Military Court). This court eventually conducted the trials of Story, Van Capellen, Van Braam, and Kolff in absentia, after it had become clear that these officers would not return to the Netherlands after the Peace of Amiens in 1802, when they were released as POWs. They were convicted of dereliction of duty, cowardice, and disloyalty. The court declared them perjurious (because they had broken their oath of loyalty), without honour and \\"infamous\\", and they were cashiered, and banished for life, on penalty of execution (by beheading in the case of Story; by death by firing squad in the case of the other three).Archives Hoge Militaire Rechtspraak 1795‚Äì1813, Dutch National Archives, inventory No. 95; 101 Sententi√´n Story moved to Germany. He protested his innocence to the very end, publishing a public defence in the form of a book.Story, passim He died in Cleves in 1811, before he could ask the new King of the Netherlands for rehabilitation. The others were more fortunate in this respect. They were fully rehabilitated after the Orangist party was restored to power in 1814. Van Capellen became a vice-admiral in the new Royal Netherlands Navy, and commanded a squadron at the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816.  Dutch ships surrendered  The squadron of Admiral Story comprised only part of the Batavian fleet. In Amsterdam lay four 74-gun and two 64-gun ships; at Hellevoetsluis one 74-gun ship and seven 64-guns, besides several frigates and brigs.James, p. 306. * Washington, a ship of the line captained by Van Capellen * Cerberus, a ship of the line captained by De Jong * Admiral De Ruyter, a ship of the line captained by Huijs * Gelderland, a ship of the line captained by Waldeck * Leyden, a ship of the line captained by Van Braam * Utrecht, a ship of the line captained by Kolff * , a ship of the line captained by Van Senden * , a ship of the line captained by Eilbracht * Mars, a frigate captained by De Bock * Amphitrite, a frigate captained by Schutter * Ambuscade, a frigate captained by Riverij * Galathes, a brig captained by Droop  References   Bibliography      External links  * Trial and escape of one of the \\"mutineers,\\" Lt.

It is approximately in length and can be traced topographically from the Bay of Bengal southward towards the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR), though the feature continues to the north where it is hidden beneath the sediments of the Bengal Fan. The ridge extends between latitudes 33¬∞S and 17¬∞N and has an average width of 200 km. The ridge divides the Indian Ocean into the West and East Indian Ocean. The northeastern side is named the Wharton Basin and ceases at the western end of the Diamantina Fracture Zone which passes to the east and almost to the Australian continent.Stow, D. A. V. (2006) Oceans : an illustrated reference Chicago : University of Chicago Press, - page 127 for map of Indian Ocean and ridges The ridge is primarily composed of Ocean Island Tholeiites (OIT), a subset of basalt which increase in age from approximately 43.2 ¬± 0.5 Ma in the south to 81.8 ¬± 2.6 Ma in the north though a more recent analysis using modern Ar‚ÄìAr techniques is currently pending publication. This age progression has led geologists to theorize that a hotspot in the mantle beneath the Indo- Australian Plate created the ridge as the plate has moved northward in the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. This theory is supported by a detailed analysis of the chemistry of the Kerguelen Plateau and Rajmahal Traps, which together, geologists believe, represent the flood basalts erupted at the initiation of volcanism at the Kerguelen hotspot which was then sheared in two as the Indian subcontinent moved northward. However, the existence of so-called deep mantle hotspots is currently a topic of debate in the geologic community, with a few geochemists favoring an alternative hypothesis which postulates a much shallower origin for hotspot volcanism. The ridge has been surveyed several times in the past, including several times by the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP). In 2007, the RV Roger Revelle collected bathymetric, magnetic and seismic data together with dredge samples from nine sites along the ridge as part of an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) site survey intended to examine the hotspot hypothesis for the ridge. It had been assumed that the India and Australia are on a single tectonic plate for at least the last 32 million years. However, considering the high level of large earthquakes in the Ninety East Ridge area and the evidence of deformation in the central Indian Ocean, it is more appropriate to consider the deformed region in the central Indian Ocean as a broad plate boundary zone separating the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate.

They constitute one of New Zealand's most sizeable ethnic minorities. In the 2013 census, 144,138 New Zealanders identified themselves as being of Samoan ethnicity with 50,658 stating that they were born in Samoa, and 636 stating that they were born in American Samoa. History =Overview= The country of Samoa (distinct from American Samoa) has a unique historical relationship with New Zealand, having been administered by New Zealand from 1914 to 1962. Notable levels of Samoan migration to New Zealand began in the 1950s. In the 1970s, Samoan illegal immigrants were the targets of notorious \\"dawn raids\\" by the police, which led to accusations of ethnic bias in tackling illicit immigration. That same decade, some Samoan New Zealanders joined the newborn Polynesian Panthers, an organisation dedicated to supporting Pacific Islander New Zealanders, for example by providing information on their legal rights. The number of Samoan- born residents in New Zealand doubled to over 24,000 during the 1970s. In 1982, a number of Samoan-born residents were granted citizenship with the Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act. Samoan immigration in New Zealand has subsequently been regulated by quotas. Since 2002, 1,100 Samoans are granted entry each year. =Demographics= The 1874 census recorded 6 Samoans in New Zealand. Numbers have increased steadily ever since, to 279 in 1936, 1,336 in 1951, 19,711 in 1976, 24,141 in 1981, and 47,118 in 2001. There were 182,721 people identifying as being part of the Samoan ethnic group at the 2018 New Zealand census, making up 3.9% of New Zealand's population. This is an increase of 38,583 people (26.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 51,618 people (39.4%) since the 2006 census. Some of the increase between the 2013 and 2018 census was due to Statistics New Zealand adding ethnicity data from other sources (previous censuses, administrative data, and imputation) to the 2018 census data to reduce the number of non-responses. There were 91,443 males and 91,275 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.002 males per female. Of the population, 62,688 people (34.3%) were aged under 15 years, 50,229 (27.5%) were 15 to 29, 59,859 (32.8%) were 30 to 64, and 9,942 (5.4%) were 65 or older. In terms of population distribution, 64.9% of Samoan New Zealanders live in the Auckland region, 27.0% live in the North Island outside the Auckland region, and 8.1% live in the South Island. The MƒÅngere-≈åtƒÅhuhu local board area of Auckland has the highest concentration of Samoan people at 26.8%, followed by the ≈åtara-Papatoetoe local board area (24.2%) and the Manurewa local board area (19.7%). The Kaik≈çura District had the lowest concentration of Samoan people at 0.2%, followed by the Gore, Queenstown- Lakes, Southland and Waimate districts, all at 0.3%. A majority of New Zealanders of Samoan ethnicity today are New Zealand-born. At the 2013 census, 62.7 percent of Samoan New Zealanders were born in New Zealand. Of the overseas-born population, 84 percent had been living in New Zealand for at least five years, and 48 percent had been living in New Zealand for at least 20 years. At the 2013 census, 63.8 percent of Samoan New Zealanders were in the labour force, of which 15.3 percent were unemployed. The large employment industries of Samoans were manufacturing (17.3 percent), health care and social assistance (9.1 percent), and retail trade (8.7 percent). Culture In 2001, 64% of ethnic Samoan New Zealanders were able to speak the Samoan language. Samoan is the third most-spoken language in New Zealand, behind English and Maori. Samoan cultural values, the \\"Samoan way of life\\" (fa‚Äòasamoa), are reportedly retained particularly by elderly members of the community, and include respect and mutual help within the extended family (‚Äòaiga), as well as fa‚Äòalavelave (ceremonial and family obligations), and attendance at a Christian church. In 2013, 83.4 percent of Samoans affiliated with at least one religion, compared with 55.0 percent for all New Zealanders. Traditional tattooing (tatau) is embraced by some Samoan New Zealanders, both men and women, as an expression of cultural identity. Samoans have contributed significantly to New Zealand culture in the fields of art, music, literature and sport.

It was discovered in 2008, by the WASP survey, by astronomical transit across its parent star WASP-6. This planet orbits only 4% that of Earth-Sun distance. The planet has mass half that of Jupiter, but its insolation has forced a thermal expansion of its radius over that of Jupiter. The planet is an inflated Hot Jupiter. Starspots on the host star WASP-6 helped to refine the measurements of the mass and the radius of the planet. Comparison of \\"hot Jupiter\\" exoplanets (artist concept).

Naming In 2019 the IAU announced that WASP-6 and its planet WASP-6b would be given official names chosen by school children from The Dominican Republic. The planet WASP-6b is named Boinayel. Boinayel the god of rain that fertilizes the soil. Orbit The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter‚ÄìMcLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to -11¬∞. Atmosphere Observations with the Magellan Telescope in 2013 studied the transits in different wavelengths. The study observed a decrease in transit depth as a function of wavelength, characteristic of a scattering haze. No spectral features were detected. A study in 2015 using Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope data also found evidence of a scattering haze, but it found tentative evidence for sodium and potassium. A study in 2015, using the Spitzer Space Telescope detected the eclipse of the planet behind the host star. The study found a dayside temperature of K ( ¬∞C) and K ( ¬∞C) for the 3.6 and 4.5 Œºm channels respectively. A study from 2019 using data from ground based observatories, such as the Very Large Telescope and space telescopes, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite analysed the atmosphere of WASP-6b. This study confirmed the presence of sodium and potassium in the atmosphere. The study also found water vapour in the atmosphere of the planet. The study came to the conclusion that despite the presence of a haze in the atmosphere of WASP-6b, the planet remains a favourable object for future atmospheric characterisation with missions such as JWST.

City of Ottumwa. Accessed 14 October 2009. , formerly Ottumwa Industrial Airport, is six miles northwest of Ottumwa, in Wapello County, Iowa. The airport is owned by the City of Ottumwa and is operated by the Airport Advisory Board. It is listed as a general aviation airport in the National Plan of Integrated Airport System (NPIAS) and as an Enhanced Service Airport in the Iowa Aviation System Plan. History =Naval base= Trainer aircraft overfly Administration Building NAS Ottumwa (a.k.a. Ottumwa Naval Air Station) was constructed as a Naval Training Center shortly after America's entry into World War II. The Navy, faced with providing aviators and support personnel for a two-front war, began a massive campaign of rapid expansion. On April 15, 1942 the U.S. Navy Site Selection Board met with Ottumwa city officials and determined a 1,400 acre tract of land a few miles north of the city would be a suitable location for a primary flight training facility. Based on their recommendation, Navy Secretary Frank Knox approved the location on July 9, 1942, and on August 6, 1942 groundbreaking for the base was held. The first group of Naval Aviation Cadets arrived at the base on March 10, 1943 and flight training officially began four days later. Another first for NAS Ottumwa occurred on May 30, 1943 when the first group of U.S. Navy WAVES arrived. At its peak, NAS Ottumwa was averaging one thousand flight hours per day, and over 600,000 flight hours logged by the time the base was closed. Aircraft used in flight training were mostly the SNJ, the N3N Canary, and the N2S Kaydet. Around sixty buildings‚Äîhangars, control tower, barracks, classrooms and sundry others‚Äîwere built for the Navy's use. The base avenues were named for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers that served early in World War II: Enterprise, Hornet, Langley, Lexington, Wasp and Yorktown. Streets were named for U.S. Navy Admirals Dewey, Farragut, Moffett, and Sims along with Marine Corps General Smedley Butler and American Revolutionary War naval hero John Paul Jones. One thing that set NAS Ottumwa apart from most other temporary Naval air training facilities around the nation was the quality of materiels used in construction. Wood-frame, clapboard-sided buildings were the norm at most bases, However concerned about the poor quality of wood available for base construction due to a nationwide shortage and the delays that might ensue at NAS Ottumwa, the base commander instead sought out other construction materiels. Ottumwa Brick and Tile, a factory located not far from the NAS Ottumwa site, provided high-quality, durable brick for the base construction. Because of that, several of the buildings, approximately fourteen in various states of disrepair, remain. A series of 19 auxiliary landing strips, mostly unpaved, were also established within a 25-mile radius of Ottumwa. Flightline at NAS Ottumwa, mid-1940s Among the thousands of Navy personnel who served at the base was Richard M. Nixon, later U.S. Vice-President and President. Nixon was stationed at NAS Ottumwa from October 1942 until May 1943.Commander Richard M. Nixon, USNR. U.S. Navy Naval Historical Center. Several other notables also served at NAS Ottumwa, including Scott Carpenter, one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts and the second American to orbit the Earth. College Football Hall of Famer Bob Steuber, and Jesse L. Brown, the U.S. Navy's first African-American pilot. In all, over 4,600 naval aviators earned their \\"wings of gold\\" at NAS Ottumwa. With the end of World War II, NAS Ottumwa changed from a flight training role to classroom-based pre-flight training on December 7, 1945. On May 20, 1947 the U.S Secretary of the Navy ordered that the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight school at NAS Ottumwa be moved to NAS Pensacola. This was completed by October 1947, with the last Navy plane leaving Ottumwa on October 2. The City of Ottumwa acquired the base by lease on October 20, 1947. Outright ownership would be granted to the city on September 16, 1957. Efforts to save part of the airport's naval aviation past are currently underway. The Administration Building from NAS Ottumwa is being restored by the non-profit group Friends of the Naval Air Station Ottumwa. The building, which had been unused since 1984, was in a state of considerable disrepair when the group took over its care. Once renovations are done it will repurposed as a Naval air and space museum. In June, 2013 the administration building was approved for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of only fourteen buildings built for and used by NAS Ottumwa still existing. NAS Ottumwa, mid-1940s =Civil use= In 1947 Mid-Continent Airlines began flying to Ottumwa; in 1956 successor Braniff Airlines was replaced by Ozark Air Lines.Ozark Airlines: 1950 - 1986 Ozark Air Lines ended service to Ottumwa in 1979, replaced by Mississippi Valley Airlines until 1983. In 1985 Ottumwa Industrial Airport was served by Great Lakes Aviation, that service ending in 2001. Ottumwa has had no airline since then. In 2002 the City of Ottumwa, in conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration built a new terminal at the airport, replacing the World War II-era operations building that had served as the terminal. The new facility cost nearly $1 million. The airport was renamed in 2008 from Ottumwa Industrial Airport to Ottumwa Regional Airport. Ottumwa Regional Airport received a $3.9 million renovation in 2009. Most of the work centered on repaving and extending runway 4/22 with an asphalt surface, as well as adding a new parallel taxiway and upgrading lighting. Other uses Since being taken over by the city of Ottumwa, the facility has seen many non-aviation uses, many related to education. Ottumwa Industrial Park, next to the airport on land originally part of NAS Ottumwa, has attracted manufacturing and office buildings to the area. A Job Corps training facility opened in the park in 2012. The largest educational presence though is Indian Hills Community College. Their \\"North Campus\\", one of two in Ottumwa, offers education programs in aviation maintenance technology, pilot training, avionics technology, as well as automotive collision repair, commercial driver training and welding.  Facilities The airport covers at an elevation of 845 feet (258 m). It has two runways: 13/31 is 5,885 by 150 feet (1,794 x 46 m) asphalt/concrete and 4/22 is 4,600 by 100 feet (1,402 x 30 m) asphalt. Runway 13/31 is the primary runway; Runway 31 has an ILS (Instrument Landing System). In the year ending June 23, 2015 the airport had 16,450 general aviation aircraft operations, average 45 per day. In January 2017, 25 aircraft were based at this airport: 17 single-engine, 3 multi-engine and 5 jet.

Route  Oxfordshire Way route map From Bourton-on-the- Water the path passes through the villages of Wyck Rissington and Bledington, then follows the valley of the River Evenlode to Shipton-under-Wychwood, Ascott-under-Wychwood and the small town of Charlbury. It then passes through Stonesfield and follows Akeman Street for 6 miles, including a crossing of Blenheim Park. After crossing the Oxford Canal the path passes through Kirtlington and Weston-on-the-Green to Islip, the halfway point. From Islip the path runs by Noke, Beckley and the southern edge of Bernwood Forest to Waterperry. It then passes through Waterstock, Tiddington and Tetsworth. Across the M40 motorway it passes the small settlements of Adwell and Wheatfield, then after a glimpse of Shirburn Castle it reaches Pyrton. From Pyrton the path crosses the Ridgeway National Trail, and climbs the Chiltern escarpment to Christmas Common. The remainder of the route is through the Chiltern beechwoods, passing Pishill, Maidensgrove, Bix Bottom and Middle Assendon to arrive at Henley.  Transport  Railway stations at Shipton- under-Wychwood, Ascott-under-Wychwood (limited service), and Charlbury (on the Cotswold Line), Islip and Henley-on-Thames are on the path, and Tackley and Kingham are near to it.

Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553 (1903), was a United States Supreme Court case brought against the US government by the Kiowa chief Lone Wolf, who charged that Native American tribes under the Medicine Lodge Treaty had been defrauded of land by Congressional actions in violation of the treaty. The Court declared that the \\"plenary power\\" of the United States Congress gave it authority to abrogate treaty obligations between the United States and Native American tribes unilaterally. The decision marked a departure from the holdings of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, , and Worcester v. Georgia, , which had shown greater respect for the autonomy of Native American tribes. Background =Tribes= The Kiowa tribe is a Native American tribe that has historically inhabited the southern Great Plains what is now Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico., 132-34 (2009). Originally from the northern great plains along the Platte River, and under pressure from other tribes,Angela R. Riley, The Apex of Congress' no power over Indian Affairs: The Story of Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, in 193 (Carole Goldberg, Kevin K. Washburn, & Philip P. Frickey eds., 2011); , 153 (Kessinger Publishing 2006) (1901). they eventually moved and settled south of the Arkansas River primarily in present-day Oklahoma. The Kiowa had a long history of close association and alliance with the Kiowa-Apache or Plains Apache., at 156; , at 433. Around 1790, the Kiowa also formed an alliance with the Comanche and formed a barrier to European-American incursions into their territories., 147 (2003); , at 133; John R. Wunder, Why Native Americans Can No Longer Count on Treaties with the U.S. Government in 2 700, 701 (John W. Johnson ed. 2001). The alliance made travel on the Santa Fe Trail hazardous, with attacks on wagon trains beginning in 1828 and continuing thereafter., at 194; , at 75. =Treaties= In 1837 at Fort Gibson, leaders of the Kiowa tribe signed their first treatyTreaty with the Kiowa, etc. of 1837, May 26, 1837, ; , at 169-71; Wunder, at 701. with the United States. By 1854, the need for another treaty became apparent, and the United States entered into a treatyTreaty with the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache of 1853, July 27, 1853, . with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa-Apache (KCA) at Fort Ackinson, Indian Territory.Kappler, at 600. The treaty did not specifically designate a reservation but was, for the most part, an extension of the 1837 treaty. There was an attempt to place some of the tribes on a reservation on the Brazos River in Texas near Fort Belknap, under Indian Agent Robert S. Neighbors., at 197; , at 76. By 1858, Neighbors resolved to move the reservation into Indian Territory. By August 1859, Neighbors had moved the Indians from the Brazos Reservation to Indian Territory, south of the Washita River near Fort Cobb., at 76. In 1865, near present-day Wichita, Kansas, the three tribes signed another treatyTreaty with the Comanche and Kiowa of 1865, Oct. 18, 1865, . that provided for the reservation in present-day Oklahoma and Texas., at 179-80. Finally, in 1867, the tribes agreed to the Medicine Lodge Treaty.Treaty with the Kiowa and Comanche of 1867, ; Riley, at 194; Kappler, at 977; , at 181-86; Wunder, at 701. The treaty provided for a much smaller reservation and stipulated that whites were not allowed to encroach on the reservation. Also, to reduce the reserve's land further would require the approval of three fourths of the tribal members., at 185; Wunder, at 701; Riley, at 194-96. =Assimilation period= Lone Wolf (the elder) in 1872 Within one year, the United States breached the treaty when General William T. Sherman ordered all the tribes to Fort Cobb, withheld the treaty payments to them, and requested an order declaring that all hunting rights be forfeited. At the same time, Indian agents were trying to undermine tribal authority as the buffalo herds were being eliminated by white hunting.Riley, at 197. Two new leaders emerged meanwhile: Quanah Parker and Lone Wolf (the younger) Following his defeat at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon, Parker settled down and began to adopt white ways., at 76-77. Lone Wolf and his followers continued to resist assimilation policies., at 133; Riley, at 199-202. Many of the old tribal leaders had been arrested and imprisoned when they left the reservation to hunt, and war leaders such as Lone Wolf (the elder) started to pass away from old age and disease. During this same period, as the tribes had been unsuccessful at farming it, the KCA found a way to make the land pay by leasing it to cattlemen for grazing., at 217. By 1885, about were being used to graze about 75,000 cattle, with an annual payment to the tribes of $55,000. At the same time, whites living just outside the reservation boundary were coming onto it to take timber and other goods, resulting in the tribes forming a police force to protect their property from white theft., at 217; , 91-95 (2007). =The Jerome Commission= Lone Wolf (the younger) in 1902, plaintiff In 1892, the United States sent the Jerome Commission, consisting of David H. Jerome, Alfred M. Wilson, and Warren G. Sayre, to meet with the Kiowa to convince them to turn over most of their reserve for white settlement in return for $2 million.Riley, at 202-05.Raymond Cross, Sovereign Bargains, Indian Takings, and the Preservation of Indian Country in the Twenty-First Century: Lift Your Weapons. Here is the One that Resists Intentions, 40 425, 462 (1998); Riley, at 202-05. Lone Wolf spoke out in opposition to the allotment, saying: After over a week of negotiations, terms were set so that each member would receive 160 acres. The tribes would receive $2 million of which $250,000 would be paid to members, with the remaining money to be held in trust for the tribes at 5% interest.; Cross, at 463; , at 219-20; Wunder, at 701; Riley, at 202-05. The commission immediately began to collect signatures and, just as quickly, allegations of fraud arose. Joshua Givens, an interpreter, was widely suspected of being dishonest. He was accused of forcing some members to sign and tricking others into thinking they were signing a document opposing the agreement.Wunder, at 701; Riley, at 202-05. By now, the tribes were almost unanimous in their opposition to the agreement, asked to see the document, and requested that their signatures be removed. Lone Wolf later stated that was refused and that they were threatened with violence.Riley, at 202-05. Jerome left the reservation with what the government claimed was the approval of three quarters of the tribe.Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. at 554; , at 220; Wunder, at 701; Riley, at 202-05. Ethan Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, defendant =Congress= With the validity of the agreement in question, the tribes, joined by the Indian Rights Association (IRA) and local ranchers, lobbied against its ratification by Congress., at 220; , at 108-09; Wunder, at 701-02; Riley, at 205-07. The IRA wrote letters to Senators, stating that the agreement was: \\"utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people, and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to our sense of justice.\\"Riley, at 205 (internal citations omitted). The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment would be devastating to the tribes, as the land was not suited to farming, and the amount of land allotted would not allow them sufficient land to graze cattle. A bill was introduced in 1892 to ratify the agreement, but failed to receive the necessary votes. It was reintroduced every year until it passed in 1900, eight years later.Cross, at 464; , at 108-09; Wunder, at 701-02; Riley, at 205-07. The agreement finally passed when the Rock Island Railroad agree to set aside an additional 480,000 acres of pastureland for the tribes to hold in common.Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. at 559-60; , at 116; Riley, at 205-07. =Lower courts= At the ratification of the agreement, a delegation of tribal leaders traveled to Washington, D.C. and requested a meeting with President William McKinley.Wunder, at 701-02; Riley, at 207-08. McKinley's position was that the tribes must conform to the decision of Congress.Riley, at 207-08. Parker and the other principal chiefs accepted that the fight against allotment was over, but Lone Wolf continued to argue against accepting allotment.Wunder, at 701-02; Riley, at 207. In 1901, Lone Wolf and others hired William M. Springer, a former federal judge and US representative., at 117-18; Wunder, at 701-02; Riley, at 208. Supreme Court of the District of Columbia On June 6, 1901, Springer filed suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, which is a different court than the United States Supreme Court., at 118. The plaintiffs asked for an injunction to stop the opening of KCA lands to settlement and the allotment of the land.Cross, at 443, 464. Springer argued that the Jerome agreement deprived the tribes of their lands without due process and in violation of the Constitution by breaking the treaty with the tribes.Riley, at 208-09. Springer alleged that the KCA were duped into signing the agreement and that it was not signed by three quarters of the members, as required by the treaty, that the KCA had protested the agreement from the beginning, and that the version which Congress ratified was different from the version signed by the KCA.Riley, at 209. While the suit was being heard, on August 6, 1901, the government began to sell off the tribes' surplus land., at 220; , at 118. Judge A.C. Bradley ruled against Lone Wolf, holding that Congress had the authority to allot the land, citing United States v. Kagama..Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. at 563; Wunder, at 702. Circuit Court of Appeals Springer then appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.Wunder, at 702; Reilly, at 216-17. By the time that court heard the appeal, the reservation land had been allotted and excess land sold. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the question was not justiciable, rather it was a political question which had to be decided by Congress. The Court held that an act of Congress must prevail over any specific article in a treaty with an Indian tribe.Reilly, at 216-17. The court further held that, in any event, the land did not belong to the tribe. It was controlled by the United States, with Indians as mere occupants. The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. at 564. Supreme Court Justice Edward White, author of the majority opinion =Arguments= At this point, the IRA hired another attorney, Hampton L. Carson, to take the lead from Springer.Wunder, at 703. The arguments remained the same as they had in the lower courts: that the tribes were being deprived of their land without due process. The attorneys noted that the United States had never deprived a tribe of its land without some form of consent by the tribe.Reilly, at 217-19. Carson and Springer highlighted Worcester v. Georgia . and the Indian canon of construction in their arguments. Willis Van Devanter argued the case for the United States, taking the position that Congress had the power to abrogate the treaty at will. Devanter cited Kagama as authority for Congress having plenary power over Indian matters. =Opinion of the court= Justice Edward White delivered the opinion of the unanimous court. The Court held that Congress had the authority to void treaty obligations with Native American tribes because it had an inherent plenary power,Cross, at 464-65. noting: The decision was based, among other things, on a paternalistic view of the United States' relationship with the tribes: The decision presented American Indians as inferior in race, culture, and religion: White held that requiring tribal consent would actually hurt the tribes and that the tribes should presume that Congress would act in good faith to protect tribal needs.Cross, at 464-65. Justice John Marshall Harlan concurred in the judgment but did not author a separate opinion. Subsequent developments Reports show that ninety percent of the land allotted to tribal members was lost by them to settlers.Judith V. Royster, The Legacy of Allotment, 27 1, 11-12 (1995). By the 1920s, the KCA tribes were impoverished, with an unemployment rate of sixty percent.Natsu Taylor Saito, The Plenary Power Doctrine: Subverting Human Rights in the Name of Sovereignty, 51 1115, 1133-34 (2002); Reilly, at 224. By 1934, approximately , or two thirds of Indian lands, had been transferred to settlers.Royster, at 13; Saito, at 1133; Cross, at 446 n.108. Until the Meriam Report was published, showing the destructive effects of the policy, the allotment process continued unchecked.Royster, at 16. By the time, Congress ended allotment, the KCA land went from to about .Reilly, at 224. Also, the Court's ruling meant that the only recourse left for Indian tribes to use to resolve land disputes was Congress.Shelby D. Green, Specific Relief for Ancient Deprivations of Property, 36 245, 272-73 (2003). Indians were not eligible to bring a case in the United States Court of Claims under the Tucker Act,Green, at 273-74. and were limited to actions in often hostile state courts. Legally, scholars have compared Lone Wolf to the infamous Dred Scott case,.Angela R. Riley, The Apex of Congress' no power over Indian Affairs: The Story of Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, in 193, 226 (Carole Goldberg, Kevin K. Washburn, & Philip P. Frickey eds., 2011) and universally condemned the decision.Reilly, at 226.

Located in Lincoln, the Library Commission provides reference, resources, training, and consulting for all types of library in the state. The various collections housed at the Library Commission are used to serve librarians, state employees, seekers of government information, and visually handicapped Nebraskans. The Library Commission is a clearinghouse for state government publications and makes many documents accessible online. The Commission is governed by a board of six members who are appointed by the Governor for three-year terms. Members are not able to serve more than two consecutive terms. The Commission director is appointed by the board. The responsibilities of the director include agency administration and working with the Commission staff to execute services and programs. Nebraska residents are provided access to current magazines, journals, newspapers, genealogical records, and business information through NebraskAccess. Nebraska Memories makes Nebraska-related historical and cultural heritage materials accessible worldwide. The Talking Book & Braille Service provides free books and magazines on cassette and in Braille to individuals with a visual or physical condition or a reading disability which limits use of regular print. (Their transition to digital books and digital players is currently in progress.) This service is part of a nationwide network of cooperating libraries headed by the National Library Service (NLS), a division of the Library of Congress. The Library Commission also provides training, both live and online, to librarians throughout the state of Nebraska. History The Nebraska Public Library Commission was established by a legislative act in March of 1901. The office of the Commission was opened in the State Capitol in November 1901. One of the main goals of the Commission was to foster the growth of public libraries in Nebraska. Traveling libraries were the first way that the Commission spread libraries across the state. Later on, the goal became founding permanent libraries so that patrons who had used traveling libraries could have a long- lasting way of borrowing books. Due to financial struggles, a bill was passed in 1933 abolishing the Library Commission to cut expenses. The bill created the Nebraska Public Library in place of the Commission. In 1935 a new bill was passed that re-established the Nebraska Public Library Commission. The Nebraska Library Association and the Nebraska Federated Women's Clubs were influential in assisting with the movement that led to the return of the Commission. In 1952, the Library of Congress made the Commission the official distribution center for the Books for the Blind program in Nebraska. The Commission was responsible for buying the equipment necessary to run the program. The Nebraska Public Library Commission changed its name to the Nebraska Library Commission in 1972.  Statutory authority  The Nebraska Library Commission's statutory authority is set forth under Article 4, Chapter 51 of Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska. In addition to the powers granted in Chapter 51, state statutes provide that the Commission is the state agency designated to receive federal library program funds appropriated for the Library Services and Technology Act. Mission The mission of the Nebraska Library Commission is statewide promotion, development, and coordination of library and information services. As the state library agency, the Commission is an advocate for the library and information service needs of all Nebraskans. Goals *All Nebraskans will have improved access to enhanced library and information services, provided and facilitated by qualified library personnel, boards, and supporters with the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes necessary to provide excellent library and information services. *Nebraska libraries will have appropriate technology to access and deliver online library and information services.

This electrical rhythm is spread through gap junctions in the smooth muscle of the GI tract. These pacemaker cells, also called the interstitial cells of Cajal, control the frequency of contractions in the gastrointestinal tract. The cells can be located in either the circular or longitudinal layer of the smooth muscle in the GI tract; circular for the small and large intestine, longitudinal for the stomach.Widmaier, Eric P., Hershel Raff, and Kevin T. Strang. Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education, 2016. The frequency of contraction differs at each location in the GI tract beginning with 3 per minute in the stomach, then 12 per minute in the duodenum, 9 per minute in the ileum, and a normally low one contraction per 30 minutes in the large intestines that increases 3 to 4 times a day due to a phenomenon called mass movement. The basal electrical rhythm controls the frequency of contraction but additional neuronal and hormonal controls regulate the strength of each contraction. Physiology Smooth muscle within the GI tract causes the involuntary peristaltic motion that moves consumed food down the esophagus and towards the rectum. The smooth muscle throughout most of the GI tract is divided into two layers: an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer. Both layers of muscle are located within the muscularis externa. The stomach has a third layer: an innermost oblique layer. The physical contractions of the smooth muscle cells can be caused by action potentials in efferent motor neurons of the enteric nervous system, or by receptor mediated calcium influx. These efferent motor neurons of the enteric nervous system are cholinergic and adrenergic neurons. The inner circular layer is innervated by both excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons, while the outer longitudinal layer is innervated by mainly excitatory neurons. These action potentials cause the smooth muscle cells to contract or relax, depending on the particular stimulation the cells receive. Longitudinal muscle fibers depend on calcium influx into the cell for excitation- contraction coupling, while circular muscle fibers rely on intracellular calcium release. Contraction of the smooth muscle can occur when the BER reaches its plateau (an absolute value less than -45mV) while a simultaneous stimulatory action potential occurs. A contraction will not occur unless an action potential occurs. Generally, BER waves stimulate action potentials and action potentials stimulate contractions. The interstitial cells of Cajal are specialized pacemaker cells located in the wall of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. These cells are connected to the smooth muscle via gap junctions and the myenteric plexus. The cell membranes of the pacemaker cells undergo a rhythmic depolarization and repolarization from -65mV to -45mV. This rhythm of depolarization-repolarization of the cell membrane creates a slow wave known as a BER, and it is transmitted to the smooth muscle cells. The frequency of these depolarizations in a region of the GI tract determines the possible frequency of contractions. In order for a contraction to occur, a hormone or neurocrine signal must induce the smooth muscle cell to have an action potential. The basal electrical rhythm allows the smooth muscle cell to depolarize and contract rhythmically when exposed to hormonal signals. This action potential is transmitted to other smooth muscle cells via gap junctions, creating a peristaltic wave. The specific mechanism for the contraction of smooth muscle in the GI tract depends upon IP3R calcium release channels in the muscle.Ju, Yue-Kun, Elizabeth A. Woodcock, David G. Allen, and Mark B. Cannell. \\"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate Receptors and Pacemaker Rhythms.\\" Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 53.3 (2012): 375-81. Calcium release from IP3 sensitive calcium stores activates calcium dependent chloride channels. These chloride channels trigger spontaneous transient inward current which couples the calcium oscillations to electrical activity. Frequency The number of action potentials during the plateau of a particular BER slow wave can vary. This variation in action potential generation does not impact the frequency of waves through the GI tract, only the strength of those contractile waves. = Factors that impact gastric motility = * Gastrin - Stimulates increased contraction force and motility in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. * CCK - Suppresses motility in the stomach and duodenumWu T, Rayner C, Young R, Horowitz M. Gut motility and enteroendocrine secretion. Current Opinion In Pharmacology [serial online]. December 1, 2013;13(Gastrointestinal * Endocrine and metabolic diseases):928-934. Available from: ScienceDirect, Ipswich, MA. Additionally, CCK stimulates secretion of PPY and inhibits the secretion of ghrelin. * PPY - inhibition of upper GI tract motility * GLP-1 - Functions as an \\"Ileal Brake\\" to inhibit upper GI tract motility when the distal gut is exposed to unabsorbed nutrients. Slows gastric emptying to promote nutrient absorption. * Distension of the stomach increases motility of the stomach. * Distension of the duodenum inhibits stomach motility in order to prevent the over filling of the duodenum. * Presence of fat, low pH, and hypertonic solutions cause a decrease in motility of the stomach. * Sympathetic nervous system innervation inhibits gastric motility. * Parasympathetic nervous system innervation stimulates gastric motility. * Rate and motility are also dependent upon the meal composition. Meals that are solid and contain a greater macronutrient composition require slower and more forceful contraction in order to extract the maximum amount of nutrients throughout the GI tract. The cells that respond to and secrete these substances include I cells and K cells in the proximal small intestine, whose stimulation is dependent on nutrient exposure and entry into the duodenum, and L cells in the distal small intestine and colon which are stimulated by unabsorbed nutrients and gastric emptying. The frequency of the BER, and thus the contractions, changes throughout the GI tract. The frequency in the stomach is 3 per minute, while the duodenum is 11 to 12 per minute and the ileum is 9 per minute. The colon can have a BER frequency between 2 and 13 per minute. The electrical activity is oscillatory, so that the BER has peaks and valleys when graphed over time.

Its greatest impact, however, was financial, with the U.S. branch of the state- owned, largest bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Italy providing several billion dollars in funding for Iraqi military procurement. Italy also was a primary supplier to the Iraqi nuclear program, although that was not of direct effect on the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. With respect to conventional military supplies, Italy provided land and sea mines to both Iraq and Iran. Iraq had ordered naval vessels and helicopters from Italy, although the ships were seized under the embargo. Financial Iraq, operating with an Italian-owned bank in the United States, obtained billions in credit from the state-owned, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the largest in Italy, funneled US$5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. The U.S. branch of BNL made considerable use of U.S. loan guarantees. On 4 August 1989, the FBI raided the Atlanta office of BNL, the Italian Government-owned bank agency in Atlanta, were transactions relating to Matrix Churchill and its takeover by Iraq, as well as several other firms, including TDG, TEG, and Euromac, that the CIA linked to Iraq's clandestine military procurement network. The branch manager, Christopher Drogoul, was charged with making unauthorized, clandestine, and illegal loans to Iraqsome of which, according to his indictment, were used to purchase arms and weapons technology. He was subsequently sentenced to 37 months in prison. Iraq subsequently defaulted on foreign debt just before the 1991 war, and the United States Department of Justice announced, on 16 February 1995, the CCC would pay BNL $400 million, in settlement of the bank's claims filed against the U.S. These guarantees were for reducing the risk of agricultural producers and other American exporters in doing business with developing countries. Ten banks including BNL filed claims under the program, and the CCC paid out $1.6 billion to banks other than BNL. In 1992, it was determined that the 1989 investigation was flawed, principally in assuming that the Italian government was unaware that a state-owned bank, BNL, had secretly lent billions of dollars to the Iraqi regime. According to the New York Times, the investigation was marred by bitter feuding among Atlanta prosecutors, their superiors in the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. The 1989 decision, according to the Times, was that the case would have been much weaker if the Rome headquarters of the bank was aware of the loans, it could not have been a victim. Since the bank was state-owned, the scandal could have damaged the entire Italian banking system and caused the fall of the government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. The United States Department of Justice prosecutors said that without the assumption the bank was a victim, the U.S. prosecution would change from a multibillion-dollar matter into a \\"minor prosecution of technicalities\\". The CIA observed that the BNL and other scandals have caused difficulty for Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti's government, three months old when the BNL matter surfaced. While other scandals are receiving publicity, the Italian political consensus seemed to be that BNL could not strengthen its position vis-a-vis Christian Democrat Andreotti. This did call attention to the \\"spoils system\\" in state-owned enterprises such as BNL. BNL's president and several directors traditionally came from the Italian Socialist Party, with a Christian Democratic Party executive director. It was deemed unlikely that this system would change. \\"We believe the revelations of BNL's dealings with Iraqalong with other recent scandalsstand in counterpoint to growing Italian self-confidence on the international stage in recent years. After more than three decades of international diffidence, we believe Italian leaders have been pursuing a diplomatic profile more commensurate with their country's international economic role. Italians have felt particular pride because: *Italian troops in the Beirut peacekeeping forces had fulfilled their mission as defined by Rome. *The Italian decision to accept U.S. cruise missiles played a decisive role in swinging West Germany behind deployment. *Their country's GDP had surpassed that of the United Kingdom and possibly France. In the opinion of almost all Italian press commentators, the BNL affair had a negative impact on Italy's credibility throughout the West. We believe, however, that the setback to Rome's international standing has been substantially less than that portrayed in the Italian press, and we expect the scandal will gradually fade from public view within Italy and will have little lasting impact on the country's perception of its international role.\\" Land warfare =Mines= Italy exported land mines both to Iraq and Iran before and during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Its mine industry revolved around three small companies: Valsella, Misar, and Tecnovar. The latter two were formed by former Valsella employees. All three specialized in landmines and mine-related products and were involved in direct exports and licensed overseas production. Given the limited national market, the bulk of their revenues came from the permissive Italian export rules of the time, approving banks, and government funding of weapons development, these companies were quite successful until export rules changed in the 1980s. \\"With the outbreak of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in September 1980, Valsella began receiving government authorizations for exports to Iraq. A total of seven were granted, the last one issued in 1982 and expiring in January 1984. The overall value of the exports amounted to more than US$110 million. But political pressures resulted in increasing restrictions on exports to Iraq. To skirt these restrictions, the company set up a new branch abroad in Singapore, where assembled mines with Vasella components and explosive from Bofors in Sweden, for shipment to Iraq in 1982. A new partnership exported mines to Iraq until 1986. In 1984, Fiat gradually gained control over Valsella and Misar. By this time Valsella mainly focused on the R&D; of increasingly sophisticated landmines (like electronic mines and mines with remote control activation, with radio crypto-coded signals), while Misar carried out considerable research and development of naval mines, though not to the exclusion of land systems. Also, while Valsella only seemed peripherally interested in selling its know-how abroad, Misar was especially active in foreign licensing and coproduction, becoming an influential player in global production of small, detection-resistant antipersonnel mines. *Expal, Explosivos Alaveses, belonging to the Spanish group Explosivos Rio Tinto, probably controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. *Spel, Sociedade Portuguesa Explosivos, Portugal. *Elviemek, Hellenic Explosives and Ammunition Industry, Greece. License n. 9328 dated 17 May 1982. In the early '80s, Elviemek agreed on a production contract in South Africa with the local Armscor Holding, a company having close connections with the Israeli state- owned weapons manufacturer Israel Military Industries (IMI), based in Tel Aviv The years immediately following Fiat's take over of the Italian landmine industry did not prove uniformly successful. While Misar's growth continued, Valsella's sales shrank, showing a negative balance by 1986. ... Valsella's managers were arrested on a charge of illegal trading with Iraq. Plea- bargaining in their 1991 trial, they acknowledged having committed irregularities; in December 1991 the Supreme Court acquitted the managers of the serious crimes of illegal arms trade and violation of the currency regulations. Helicopters  Naval warfare Iraq ordered four Lupo class frigates, and six Wadi Assad class corvettes equipped with Otomat-2 anti- shipping missiles. Due to restrictions on arm sales to Iraq because of the Iran-Iraq War placed by the Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi, these ships remained interned in Italy until the end of that war in 1988. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein then tried to renegotiate the price of these ships, claiming he should receive a discount due to the delay in delivery of the ships. Negotiations and court proceedings were still ongoing when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and a new arms embargo against Iraq was placed by the United Nations, again blocking the sale. Although these four frigates and the six corvettes were ultimately seized by Italy under the United Nations embargo during the 1991 Gulf War, these purchases signaled Iraq's intention to upgrade its naval power. In February 1984, the Italian subsidiary of Bell Textron, Agusta Bell, agreed to sell Iraq eight AB 212 military helicopters equipped for anti- submarine warfare, worth a $164 million. They were intended equip the Lupo class frigates Iraq had purchased from Italy four years earlier. This sale also required U.S. approval, which may not have been obtained. WMD In 1983, following the setback of the Israeli Operation Opera attack on the reactor at Osirak, the Iraqis continued to work on building a full processing cycle for uranium and plutonium, primarily using Italian equipment. On 5 April 1976, Iraq signed a contract for a radiochemistry laboratory with Italy, to be done by four Italian firms. Work was completed in 1978. A second contract, signed in 1978, covered a fuel fabrication laboratory, a radioisotope production laboratory, a materials testing laboratory, and a chemical engineering laboratory. While the CIA report was partially redacted, Iraq had some contact with Italy regarding laser enrichment of uranium. While the CIA did not assess that Iraq had an actual nuclear weapons program at the time of the report, suggesting the activities were more to develop Iraq's general level of nuclear technology. Unless Iraq obtained significant foreign help with the high explosive implosion systems for nuclear weapons using fission; the overall design, fabrication and testing of nuclear weapons; and the acquisition of a nuclear reactor, they could not create weapons until the 1990s. That date assumed no further interference in their programs. CIA assessed that neither Italy was likely to stop work on nuclear-related contracts, as Italy saw Iraq as a source of oil and a strong market for both military and civilian goods. Stronger nonproliferation requirements, however, were likely. The CIA report said \\"...Italy will remain the major supplier of the Iraqi nuclear program. Despite the proliferation risks, Italy will probably continue helping Iraq in numerous areas of nuclear technology, possibly even including reprocessing and plutonium chemistry. Because Italy is a major Iraqi arms supplier, it probably could impose additional safeguards without endangering relations with Iraq.

The craft featured an elongated hydrogen-filled envelope that tapered to a point at each end. From this was suspended a long beam with a triangular, sail-like rudder at its aft end, and beneath the beam a platform for the pilot and steam engine. Due to the highly flammable nature of the lift gas, special precautions were taken to minimise the potential for the envelope to be ignited by the engine beneath it. The engine's exhaust was diverted downwards to a long pipe projecting below the platform, and the area surrounding the boiler's stoke hole was surrounded by wire gauze. On 24 September 1852, Giffard flew the airship from the hippodrome at Place de l'Etoile to √âlancourt, covering the in around 3 hours, demonstrating maneuvering along the way. The engine, however, was not sufficiently powerful to allow Giffard to fly against the wind to make a return journey.

Early life and education Duflo was born in 1972 in Paris, the daughter of pediatrician Violaine Duflo and mathematics professor Michel Duflo. During Duflo's childhood, her mother often participated in medical humanitarian projects. After studying in the B/L program of Lyc√©e Henri-IV's Classes pr√©paratoires, Duflo began her undergraduate studies at √âcole normale sup√©rieure in Paris, planning to study history, her interest since childhood. In her second year, she began considering a career in the civil service or politics. She spent ten months in Moscow starting in 1993. She taught French and worked on a history thesis that described how the Soviet Union \\"had used the big construction sites, like the Stalingrad tractor factory, for propaganda, and how propaganda requirements changed the actual shape of the projects.\\" In Moscow, she also worked as a research assistant for a French economist connected to the Central Bank of Russia and, separately, for Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist, who was advising the Russian Minister of Finance. The experiences at these research posts led her to conclude that \\"economics had potential as a lever of action in the world\\" and she could satisfy academic ambitions while doing \\"things that mattered\\". She finished her degree in history and economics at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1994 and received a master's degree from DELTA, now the Paris School of Economics, jointly with the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) of the Universit√© Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) and the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, in 1995. Subsequently, she completed a PhD in economics at MIT in 1999, under the joint supervision of Abhijit Banerjee and Joshua Angrist. Her PhD dissertation focused on effects of a natural experiment involving an Indonesian school-expansion program in the 1970s, and it provided conclusive evidence that in a developing country, more education resulted in higher wages. Upon completing her PhD, she was appointed assistant professor of economics at MIT and has been at MIT ever since, aside from a leave at Princeton University in 2001‚Äì2002, and at the Paris School of Economics in 2007 and 2017. Career After earning her PhD in 1999, Duflo became an assistant professor at MIT. She was promoted to associate professor (with tenure) in 2002, at 29, making her among the youngest faculty members to be awarded tenure, and to full professor in 2003. Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee have taken a special interest in India since 1997. In 2003, she conducted a trial experiment on teacher absenteeism in 120 schools run by a non-profit group. By encouraging the teachers to photograph themselves with their students each day, she was able to reduce their absenteeism. In 2003, she co-founded Poverty Action Lab at MIT, which has since conducted over 200 empirical development experiments and trained development practitioners to run randomized controlled trials. The lab has branches in Chennai, India and at the Paris School of Economics. In 2006, together with several colleagues, Duflo conducted another experiment in India. It showed that taped speeches by women were more readily accepted in villages that had experienced women leaders. Duflo became increasingly convinced that communities supporting women candidates could expect economic benefits, but she experienced difficulty in convincing her peers. Focused on assessing developments addressing social welfare, in 2008, she received the Frontier of Knowledge award for development cooperation. Duflo entered the public sphere in 2013, when she sat on the new Global Development Committee, which advised former US President Barack Obama on issues regarding development aid in poor countries. Duflo is an NBER research associate, a board member of the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), and director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research's development economics program, where she serves as both a board member and a director. She was the founding editor of the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, editor of The American Economic Review, and a co-editor of The Review of Economics and Statistics and the Journal of Development Economics. Also, she is a member of the editorial committee of the Annual Review of Economics and a member of the Human Capital Research Programme within the International Growth Centre. She writes a monthly column for Lib√©ration, a French daily newspaper. She was the main speaker at the first Bocconi Lecture of Bocconi University in 2010, followed in 2011 by Caroline Hoxby. Personal life Duflo is married to MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee; the couple have two children. Banerjee was a joint supervisor of Duflo's PhD in economics at MIT in 1999. Selected works =Books= In April 2011, Duflo released her book Poor Economics, co-authored with Banerjee. It documents their 15 years of experience in conducting randomized control trials to alleviate poverty. The book has received critical acclaim. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen called it \\"a marvelously insightful book by the two outstanding researchers on the real nature of poverty.\\"    * =Papers= Duflo has published numerous papers, receiving 6,200 citations in 2017. Most of them have appeared in the top five economic journals. Awards =Nobel prize in economic sciences= Esther Duflo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019 along with her two co-researchers Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer \\"for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty\\". Duflo is the youngest person (at age 46) and the second woman to win this award (after Elinor Ostrom in 2009). The press release from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted: \\"Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate development economics.\\" The Nobel committee commented: ::\\"Banerjee, Duflo and their co-authors concluded that students appeared to learn nothing from additional days at school. Neither did spending on textbooks seem to boost learning, even though the schools in Kenya lacked many essential inputs. Moreover, in the Indian context Banerjee and Duflo intended to study, many children appeared to learn little: in results from field tests in the city of Vadodara fewer than one in five third-grade students could correctly answer first-grade curriculum math test questions. ::\\"In response to such findings, Banerjee, Duflo and co-authors argued that efforts to get more children into school must be complemented by reforms to improve school quality.\\" Responding by telephone to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Duflo explained that she received the prize \\"at an extremely opportune and important time\\" and hoped that it would \\"inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve, like every single human being.\\" She also revealed that she wanted to use the award as a \\"megaphone\\" in her fighting efforts to tackle poverty and to improve children's education. French President Emmanuel Macron offered his congratulations: \\"Esther Duflo's magnificent Nobel Prize is a reminder that French economists are currently among the best in the world and shows that research in that field can have concrete impact on human welfare.\\" Much of the discussion related to the prize shared by Duflo and her co-laureates focused on their influential use of randomized controlled trials in designing their experiments. Summarizing the research approach which she had utilized along with Banerjee and Kremer, Duflo said simply, \\"Our goal is to make sure that the fight against poverty is based on scientific evidence.\\" =Other awards= * Duflo was awarded the Elaine Bennett Research Prize by the American Economic Association in 2002, which honours a female economist under 40 who has made outstanding contributions in any field of economic research. * In 2005, the think tank Cercle des √©conomistes awarded her the Best Young French Economist prize. * In May 2008, the American magazine Foreign Policy named her as one of the top 100 public intellectuals in the world. * In 2009, she was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow, otherwise known as a \\"genius\\" grant.

Professional analog sound recording Most sound recordings for records before the 1950s were made by cutting directly to a master disc. Recording via magnetic tape became the industry standard around the time of the creation of the LP format in 1948, and these two technological advances are often seen as being joined, although 78 rpm records cut from tape masters continued to be manufactured for another decade. In the late 1970s, a small number of albums recorded direct-to-disc began to appear again on the market and were marketed as \\"audiophile\\" editions, promising superior sound quality compared with recordings made using the more common multi-track tape recording methods. To make a direct-to-disc recording, musicians would typically play one 15-minute \\"live\\" set in a recording studio per LP side using professional audio equipment. The recording was made without multitrack recording and without overdubs. The performance was carefully engineered and mixed live in stereophonic sound. During the performance, the analog disc cutting head engages the master lacquer from which sides of an LP record are ultimately derived and is not stopped until the entire side is complete. Such a direct- to-disc recording was often simultaneously recorded onto a two-track master tape for subsequent pressing in the traditional manner. Although such tapes were often made to preserve the recordings in case the direct-to-disc process failed or the master disc became damaged before the final product could be produced, direct-to-disc albums were almost never re-issued as standard albums made from tape masters. One exception to this was Sheffield Lab's 1976 direct- to-disc LP release of Dave Grusin's Discovered Again! which was re-released a few years later as a conventional LP mastered from the tapes recorded as a backup during the recording sessions for the album. Advantages Technically, direct-to-disc recording is believed to result in a more accurate, less noisy recording through the elimination of up to four generations of master tapes, overdubs, and mix downs from multi-tracked masters. The method bypasses problems inherent in analog recording tape such as tape hiss. Disadvantages Although the spontaneity of performance is preserved, no overdubbing or editing is possible. It becomes more challenging for the musicians, engineers and producers, whose performances will be captured \\"warts and all.\\" In the event of aborted sides, expensive lacquers are wasted and cannot be used again. According to Robert Auld of the Audio Engineering Society: \\"It was a notoriously difficult way to record; the musicians and all concerned had to record a complete LP side without any serious musical or technical mistakes.\\"Robert Auld. Direct-to-Disc at AES Some artists maintain that musical instruments may drift out of tune: It is not possible to keep instruments in tune for the length of the LP side.

A recreation of Dutrou-Bornier's flag. Jean-Baptiste On√©sime Dutrou-Bornier (19 November 1834 ‚Äì 6 August 1876) was a French mariner who settled on Easter Island in 1868, purchased much of the island, removed many of the Rapa Nui people and turned the island into a sheep ranch.  Early life  Dutrou- Bornier served as an artillery officer in the Crimean War, and by 1860 had become a master mariner. He abandoned his wife and young son in France, and in 1865 bought a one-third share in the schooner Tampico. He sailed to Peru, where he was arrested, accused of arms-dealing and sentenced to death. Released on the intervention of the French consul, he sailed to Tahiti, where he began recruiting labour from the islands of East Polynesia for coconut plantations.Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world. Reaktion Books 2005 p. 100  Arrival on Easter Island  In November 1866 Dutrou- Bornier transported two missionaries, Kaspar Zumbohm and Theodore Escolan, to Easter Island. He visited the island again in March 1867 to recruit labourers, but he then amassed huge gambling debts and, as a result of some fraudulent deals, forfeited his share of the Tampico. He acquired the yacht Aora'i, and arrived on Easter Island in April 1868, where the yacht was burnt. He set up residence at Mataveri, began buying up land from the Rapanui. In 1869 he seized Pua ‚ÄòAku Renga, Koreto, the wife of a Rapanui, and married her. He tried to persuade France to make the island a protectorate, and recruited a faction of Rapanui whom he allowed to abandon their Christianity and revert to their previous faith. With rifles, a cannon, and hut burning, he and his supporters ran the island for several years as \\"governor\\", appointing Koreto Queen.Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world. Reaktion Books 2005 pages 106-122 The title had no legitimacy behind it and is not recognized by the Rapanui or modern historians. Dutrou-Bornier aimed to cleanse the island of most of the Rapanui and turn the island into a sheep ranch. He bought up all of the island apart from the missionaries' area around Hanga Roa and moved a couple hundred Rapanui to Tahiti to work for his backers. In 1871 the missionaries, having fallen out with Dutrou-Bornier, evacuated all but 171 Rapanui to the Gambier islands.Katherine Routledge The mystery of Easter island page 208 Those who remained were mostly older men.

Reaktion Books 2005 page 120  Legacy  From that point on and into the present day, the island's population slowly recovered. But with over 97% of the population dead or left in less than a decade, much of the island's cultural knowledge had been lost. Neither his first wife back in France, who was heir under French law, nor his second wife on the island, who briefly installed their daughter Caroline as Queen, were to keep much from his estate. But to this day much of the island is a ranch controlled from off-island, and for more than a century real power on the island was usually exercised by resident non-Rapanui living at Mataveri. An unusual number of shipwrecks had left the island better supplied with wood than for many generations, whilst legal wrangles over his land deals were to complicate the island's history for decades to come.Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world.

The rich ornament, and the form, which is echoed in sixteenth-century Mannerist vases, combined to give the Warwick Vase great appeal to the nineteenth-century eye: numerous examples in silverPaul Storr continued to specialise in these: Storr's silver-gilt Warwick Vase, hallmarked 1821-22, is in the National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh (illustrated in The Burlington Magazine (August 1996:574). and bronze were made, and porcelain versions by Rockingham and Worcester. Theed's moulds were sent to Paris, where two full-size bronze replicas were cast, one now Windsor Castle, the other in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

The tale explores questions of identity, integration with society, and virtue through the adventures of Agilulf, a medieval knight who exemplifies chivalry, piety, and faithfulness but exists only as an empty suit of armour. Plot The protagonists of this novel are two paladins of Charlemagne: the non-existent knight, named Agilulf (he is in fact a lucid empty armor) and an inexperienced and passionate young man, Rambaldo. The latter, having arrived at the camp of paladins at the beginning of the novel, wants to avenge his father's death, caused by the Argalif Isoarre; Agilulf instead fights for duty, presumably convinced of his faith even if this point is never clear in the novel, with a value that is admired by all the paladins, but also with a remarkable sense of duty, of precision in controlling the progress of the duties of others and their duties, for which the fellow soldiers find it as capable as it is unpleasant. During the move that Charlemagne made with his paladins to clash with the enemies, they met Gurdul√π, a vagabond who let himself be guided by instinct without thinking, and who will be assigned as a squire to Agilulf by order of Charlemagne. When the battle begins, Rambaldo tries in every way to clash with the murderer of his father, who finally dies because, deprived of his glasses by the boy himself, he is no longer able to defend himself (the Argalif Isoarre is very short-sighted, therefore without glasses he cannot see and direct the course of the battle). Later the young man falls into an ambush, but is saved by the intervention of another knight with a periwinkle armor that, after fighting, moves away without saying a word. Returning to the camp on foot (during the battle his horse died), Rambaldo accidentally discovers that the valiant knight is actually a very charming woman, Bradamante, whom he immediately falls in love with. But the young woman is not interested in him but in Agilulf, the non-existent knight. During a banquet, the young Torrismondo reveals unexpected facts about the Agilulf knight. In fact he affirms that Sophronia, daughter of the king of Scotland, the woman who Agilulf had saved from the abuse of two brigands fifteen years before, was already then mother of Torrismondo, and therefore was certainly not a virgin; consequently the assignment of the title of knight to Agilulf for having saved a virgin from violence is not valid. The revelation throws the knight into a panic, who, by honor, decides to go and find the girl to prove that she was still pure at the time. Agilulf leaves, followed by Bradamante infatuated with him, who in turn is pursued by Rambaldo, in love with her. On the same evening Torrismondo also left to find his father, or one of the knights of the \\"Sacred Order of the Knights of the Grail\\", and to be recognized as a son by this order (given that his mother had revealed that he had conceived it by one of the many knights with whom she had joined, but to consider the whole order father of the child). Torrismondo finds the knights of the Grail, but loses his last hopes when they reveal themselves as a mystical sect, estranged from reality and moreover devoid of ethical conscience and tolerance towards those who do not belong to their order (the first evening after their meeting with Torrismondo, the young man sees them with dismay as they raid a village). are described briefly, and which lead him to Scotland and then to Morocco, Agilulf finds the woman he was looking for, Sophronia, in the harem of an Arab nobleman, still unharmed, and brings her back to the battlefield of the Franks, to finally prove to the Emperor that the woman was a virgin when he had saved her, and indeed is still a virgin. Torrismondo, however, arrives near the cave where his alleged mother had hidden, and they both surrender to the passion of love, and that is enough to frustrate Agilulf's effort. Eventually it will be discovered that Torrismondo is not the son of Sofronia, but her brother. The two siblings then discover themselves to be half- siblings, and in the end it will be known that Torrismondo is the son of the Queen of Scotland and of the Holy Order, while Sophronia was born years before by the king of Scotland and a peasant woman, and therefore the two, not being relatives, are free to love each other. Agilulf, therefore, has every right to be a knight, but unfortunately, before he can know the truth, he has already taken his own life: before dissolving he bequeaths his white armor to Rambaldo. Right then a Moorish army makes landing, led by the Muslim nobleman from whose harem Sophronia was freed, a battle is joined between christians and saracens, during which Rambaldo dons Agilulf's armor...the pristine, shining coat of armor gets pierced, dented and splattered in blood during the fight (while it always remained spotless while the Nonexistant Knight \\"inhabited\\" it...and, after the battle is won by the christian side, Bradamante throws herself at Rambaldo, believing him to be Agilulf. The two consummate their love, with Bradamante so entraptured that she fails to recognize Rambaldo save at the end. She gets enraged and flees the premises when she realizes that her 'beloved' Agilulf has ceased to exist for good. Some time later, Sofronia and Torrismondo, now married, and Gurdul√π, who seems to be in possession of reasoning skills, settle in a village that the Templars had raided, and they are amazed that the inhabitants had the opportunity to hunt the Templars alone, without the help of any knight. To tell the whole story is a nun, Sister Teodora, who only at the end reveals that she is nothing but Bradamante, still sought after by Rambaldo. Finally, Rambaldo arrives at the monastery and escapes with Bradamante, who leaves his narrative unfinished. Themes Agilulf exists only as the fulfilment of the rules and protocols of knighthood. This theme is strongly connected to modern conditions: Agilulf has been described as \\"the symbol of the 'robotized' man, who performs bureaucratic acts with near-absolute unconsciousness.\\" The romance satirises Agilulf as the ideal man yet nonexistent along with many suggestions that Sister Theodora is making up most of the story. In the end, she understands that such a perfect knight could live only in one's imagination. The idea of confusion of one's own identity with others and the outside world continued to be developed in Calvino's later works. Reception The Nonexistent Knight was collected together with The Cloven Viscount and The Baron in the Trees in a single volume, Our Ancestors, for which Calvino was awarded the Salento Prize in 1960. The book was adapted into an animated film by Italian director Pino Zac in 1970.

Gameplay Example of the art style in a level of Big Bang Mini (as of March, 2008) The primary gameplay mechanic of Big Bang Mini involves the player using the stylus to shoot fireworks from the bottom screen to enemies in the top screen.

Enemies include superheroes, clowns, pixelated birds, Chinese dragons, and sharks that shoot lasers.

Although Swailes subsequently found it hard to maintain a run of appearances in the first team under Ternent, his fortunes looked up a little after Neil Warnock took over as manager in 1998, and he missed only three games through suspension during the 1998‚Äì99 season. Despite this, Bury were relegated at the end of that term.

Airing in 1988, the show was the first big American game show to be imported to Denmark and it was one of the first successes for Danish broadcaster TV2 when it became Denmark's second TV channel in 1988. The show originally used the \\"shopping\\" format of the American program in which winnings were used to buy studios prizes, such as furniture, appliances, and trips. In later years the format was changed to reflect the American version of all-cash winnings. The host during the first season was Michael Meyerheim with Pia Dresner as the letter-turning co-host. Thereafter, the show was hosted by Bengt Burg from 1989 to 2000, with a short stint by Keld Heick during the 1996-1997 season. The final season in 2001 season was hosted by Lars Herlow. The letter-turning co-hosts were Carina Jensen (1989-1994) and Maria Hirse (1995-2001). The show's announcers during the run of the program were Ole Jacobsen, then Henrik Hannibal and later, Dennis Johannesson. The show ran for 3,599 episodes until it was cancelled in 2001 due to declining viewership and a failed attempt at modernizing the format in the final year. (For details about how the game was played, see Wheel of Fortune.) Unique to the Danish version A recreation of the round one wheel from when Lykkehjulet premiered in 1988. Note instead of 24 wedges like many other versions of Wheel of Fortune, Lykkehjulet used only 22. There were several details which were unique to the Danish version of Wheel of Fortune. *Theme song The opening theme to the program was an original composition composed by Jesper Ranum. *The wheel and podiums The multi-colored wheel had 22 wedges (each with 4 pegs) instead of the 24 wedges of the American show, and value amounts originally ranged from 100 to 1,500 kroner (2,500 starting in round 2 in 1989) to be used for shopping purposes. The podiums followed a blue-red-yellow pattern, as it did for several other foreign adaptions. Beginning in 1990, the top value was 3,000 kr. in Round 1 then 5,000 kr. from Round 2 onwards. By 1999, the top value was 5,000 kr. in every round. In 1999, the Fallit/10,000/Fallit wedge would be placed on the wheel in the third round with the 10,000 section being treated as a regular space. In 2001, the top values were 2,500 points in round one, 7,500 in rounds two and three and 10,000 between two \\"garbage cans\\" in round four. The winner of each round kept their points and chose one of two prizes. *Vowels Vowels cost 500 kr. and were to be purchased prior to spinning the wheel. *The Free Spin Known as an \\"Ekstra Tur,\\" (\\"Joker\\" in 1988) it was originally conceived like the US Free Spin, where it was an entire wedge on the wheel, and multiple Free Spins could be won. It eventually became a single token placed on the wheel. After landing on the space with the token, the player automatically picked it up and called for a letter to win the hidden amount beneath the token (usually 600 kroner). *Bonus round In the bonus round, the player must choose five consonants and a vowel and solve the puzzle within 15 seconds. At first, the player chose which prize to play for. By 1996, the player chose one of three round envelopes, each concealing one of three bonus prizes. *Puzzleboard and sound effects The letters on the puzzleboard were the traditional trilon shape for the first twelve years of the program. In 2001, the puzzleboard was changed to an electronic form. The bell indicating a correct letter had a high D-note pitch to it (similar to the sound effect used on the American version when a bonus envelope is taken), while the horn for a wrong guess or a Tabt Tur (Lose A Turn) was borrowed from the US version of The Price is Right, and a downward whistle for \\"Fallit\\" (bankrupt) making a player lose all of their money and losing their turn. 2001 was also the first and only year the show introduced a video wall behind the contestants, but at that point, the puzzleboard still used trilons. 2018 revival In October 2018, the series returned on TV2. The set, though modernized and simplified, has a look that is somewhat reminiscent of the original 1988 set. The original theme and several of the original sound effects are also used, some of them with a few touch-ups. Interestingly, the puzzle board uses the same dimensions as the original puzzle board rather than the current American dimension, although it is now electronic. It was hosted by Mikkel Kryger and co-hosted by Stephania Potalivo. The format is also similar to the original version. Vowels still cost KR500 and the shopping format has also returned. KR1,500 is the top value in Round 1, KR2,500 in Round 2, and Kr5,000 in Round 3. Another KR5,000 space is added in Round 4. A Gevinst token (represented by a picture of a star) is added in Round 2. The biggest difference from the original version, however, is that every round starts with the winner of the previous round, exactly like on all three of the American pilots.

() is a non-governmental organization that is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was founded in 1991. It describes itself as a nonprofit educational and advocacy organization dedicated to supporting the rights and responsibilities of Canadian children and providing critical analysis of governments' policies at all levels of government in Canada. Despite portraying itself as an organization that works for children's rights, scholars and the media described it as more concerned with men's and father's rights. Activities The organization researches, educates and advocates in the area of the rights and responsibilities of Canadian children. It lobbies the government, intergovernmental and NGOs about the issues related to their mandate, and have testified at Canadian provincial and federal committees and ministerial consultations. Site Their website hosts a virtual library of books, position statements, historical and other documents, on subjects such as implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, parental alienation and parental alienation syndrome, infanticide, joint custody following divorce, paternity fraud, corporal punishment, and female sex offenders. The organization states that their website is the most visited website in Canada on the issues of children's rights and responsibilities. Positions The organization supports the existence of a national and provincial commissioners on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The group opposes corporal punishment including spanking, and promotes the idea of parent training in alternatives. The group's president, Grant Wilson, has stated \\"he believes women who abandon their babies should be charged with attempted murder...\\",The Current; CBC: Feb 8, 2007. Retrieved 4/2/08 and that Canada's infanticide law should be repealed, as it devalues the lives of children, violates their rights, and is \\"a licence for women to kill babies.\\" In both cases he argues that a defense of diminished capacity could be still used in cases involving post partum depression. Wilson has stated that women frequently make false allegations of abuse during divorce, and that men are equally likely to be the victim of domestic violence. He has also called for tougher penalties, including for jail time, for mothers who deny fathers visitation rights with their children, and for mandatory paternity testing of all children at birth in order to prevent paternal discrepancy issues. While the organization positions itself as a children's rights group, scholars and the media view the group and its president as men's and fathers' rights advocates. Psychologist and academic Erica Burman comments that the group \\"has appropriated a discourse of children's rights as an anti-feminist strategy\\" and has adopted the acronym of the Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children.

At least 85 people were killed by the tornado, with others killed by tornadoes that struck the northern and eastern half of the state. It is the deadliest single tornado and tornado outbreak ever recorded in Ohio history, killing more people than the more famous 1974 Xenia Tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak and the 1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak respectively. Event summary On that day, a low pressure system moved from Iowa towards Michigan and Ontario. Temperatures were in the lower 80s across most of northern Ohio, which is typical for late-June across that area. The tornado formed over the Sandusky Bay during the late afternoon hours and hit the city of Sandusky where it killed eight and destroyed 100 homes and 25 businesses. After moving east over Lake Erie for several miles, the tornado then struck the town of Lorain just west of Cleveland, killing 72. Among the dead were 15 people inside a collapsed theater, which makes it the worst tornado-related death toll from a single building in Ohio. Eight people were also killed inside the Bath House near the location where the tornado came onshore. Over 500 homes were destroyed and 1000 others were damaged in the Lorain area as well as every business in the downtown area. Damage amounts were estimated at the time to be approximately $12 million. When adjusted for wealth the figure jumps to $1 billion (1997 dollars), which ranks it 10th costliest tornado, ahead of the Oklahoma City area tornado in 1999. A total of 85 were killed with additional deaths outside the two cities and 300 others were injured. While the Fujita scale was not existent at the time, the damage was estimated to be at around F4.US F4 , F5 TORNADOES Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1896-19991924: Lorain Tornado There are still some uncertainties on whether the Sandusky-Lorain tornado was a single tornado event due to the 25-mile path of the storm across Lake Erie between Sandusky and Lorain, however many eyewitnesses showed a single severe storm crossing the Lake before coming on-shore again just after 5:00 PM.NOTES on the Lorain Tornado of 6-28-24, Avon, Ohio At the time, it was the second deadliest tornado ever in the northern United States behind the New Richmond Tornado in northern Wisconsin in 1899 and 13th overall. Today, it is still ranked as the fourth deadliest tornado in the northern States and 24th overall. Other tornadoes hit the Castalia (Sandusky County), Huron Township (Erie County) and Geauga Lake (Portage County); additional tornadoes struck northwestern Pennsylvania, producing damage near Erie and Meadville. At least five other people were killed by tornadoes other than the Sandusky-Lorain storm including three others in Ohio. = Reporting on the 1924 Tornado = The New York Times published the following article on June 29, 1924: \\"CLEVELAND, June 28 (Associated Press) - Three hundred are dead and at least 1,500 are injured in Lorain alone as a result of a tornado today, according to reports reaching Colonel D. H. Pond, Director of Red Cross civilian relief, here early tonight. Colonel Pond announced that he had arranged for tents for 1,000 persons to be shipped directly to Lorain from Camp Perry. Eighty dead have been taken from the State Theatre (sic) in Lorain, the chief of police of Elyria reported at 9:30 to-night. Estimates of 300 dead and 1,500 injured are not exaggerated. The storm carried telegraph and telephone wires down with it, isolating Sandusky, Lorain and other points in the norther part of the State, making confirmation of reports impossible. A motorist who drove from Loraine (sic) notified the Cleveland Plain Dealer that not only was East Lorain demolished, but the city of Lorain itself was swept away. Reports received over crippled railroad wires from Sandusky late tonight state that between fifty and seventy-five persons were killed or drowned there today when the tornado struck that city. The Sandusky water works and several large buildings along the lake front were blown down. Considerable damage along the shore line east of Cedar Point is reported. Some Summer homes are said to have been blown down and several persons killed. Martial Law Declared in Lorain An automobile ferry plying between Sandusky and Marblehead broke loose from its moorings at Sandusky and struck a pier. Fifteen passengers on the ferry are reported to have been drowned. Martial law has been declared in Lorain by Mayor George Hoffman. Police deputized American Legion members to cooperate with them and the National Guard. Looting is said to be going on freely. Lorain is without water, light, telephones, and food, and has little gas. First reports received here from a staff correspondent of The Plain Dealer, who motored back to the first available telephone east of Lorain, were to the effect that 200 were killed in the collapse of the State Theatre at Lorain, and that forty other were dead in other parts of the city. Reports from various other sources place the number of the dead as high as 500. Rain continued to fall in Lorain for several hours. Confirmation of the collapse of the theatre and washout of the Black River bridge at Lorain was brought to Cleveland by A. Downer, conductor on the Lake Shore Electric Railway, the first eyewitness of the disaster to reach this city. Many women and children were killed, motorists told him. Practically every house on Broadway, the main street of the city east and west, was blown down, Downer reported, and automobiles were picked up and overturned on the sidewalks. Eyewitness Describes Scene The American Shipyards at Lorain are reported to have been razed. Two boats belonging to Henry Ford were reported to have broken loose. Reports here that small passenger steamers plying between Sandusky and Lake Erie Island resorts have been lost, but could not be confirmed late tonight. One of the first eyewitness stories of the cyclone to reach Cleveland was brought back by L.F. Forster of Bay Village. He was in Lorain within a few minutes after the cyclone struk and he walked over several blocks of the devastated area, saw unroofed buildings, fallen trees, and telephone poles, heard screams of some of the injured and afterward saw refugees fleeing the city. \\"My wife and I and a party of friends were driving toward Lorain,\\" he said. \\"It must have been 5:30 when the storm struck. We were about three or four miles east of the city and a heavy rain was falling.\\" Saw Fires in Wrecked Town. \\"At a gasoline station we met another automobile that had stopped there. It had just come from Lorain and from the man and woman in it we learned there had been a cyclone. They said they had seen houses toppling over, roofs flying through the air, and trees and telephone poles mowed down as a by a huge scythe. \\"Their car was a sedan. They said the wind blew so hard that they had to sit on the floor to keep it from shattering their ear drums. \\"We drove on toward Lorain until a tangle of fallen trees made further progress impossible. Then we got out and walked into the town. \\"The town was a wreck. I had an uncanny feeling as I looked at houses without roofs or without walls, as I picked my way through the wreckage in the streets. \\"I recall looking into one house from which the front wall had been blown out. I could see into the bedrooms and noticed the beds stood there neatly made. In the distance we could see some houses in flames, although there appeared to be no general conflagration. \\"The river bridge was demolished except for the footpath, which was still standing. People were running about excitedly in the streets, some of them with injured hands and legs. Many had been pinned under falling buildings and trees. \\"One wall of a grocery had been demolished, and the merchandise was scattered over the street. We saw a moving picture theatre which had collapsed. The balcony had fallen across the doorway. Whether anybody was in the theatre or not I do not know. Some men were trying to reach any injured who might be inside. \\"We left this scene of desolation and retracted our steps to the car. Driving back to Bay Village, we overtook a number of refugees who came pouring out of the city a few minutes after the storm struck. \\"One of these was a man who said he owned a four-family apartment house which had been wrecked. Two people were found buried in the debris, he said. \\"We met a man hurrying toward Lorain, who besought us for news. He said his wife and family were in the wrecked area. Ambulances and automobiles were rushing storm victims to the Elyria Hospital.\\" First Relief Train is Blocked. Nickel Plate trainmen reported that all the Government houses north of the railroad tracks in South Lorain had been blown down. Two men were killed there and thousands of dollars worth of property damaged.'' Property damage at Akron, Ohio, was estimated at more than $1,000,000. FCleveland companies of the Ohio National Guard were being assembled in anticipation of orders to proceed to Lorain after messengers brought word that troops were wanted to aid in the relief work and preserve order. About fifty members of the 112th Engineers Corps were rushed to Lorain in taxicabs upon receipt of Governor Donahey's orders. They were in charge of Colonel Ralph R. White. A Nickel Plate train is ready to take the rest of the troops as soon as they can be mobilized. The first relief train sent from here by the Nickel Plate Railroad reached East Lorain late tonight, but could not proceed to Lorain because of the bad condition of the tracks, the Nickel Plate dispatched announced. A second Nickel Plate train is due at Lorain at 11 P.M. The first relief train made no report of the conditions found at Lorain. A relief train was sent to the scene by the Nickel Plate Railroad, while all police emergency cars and other available automobiles left here with nurses and physicians. Rescuers Send Call for Help.\\" The Elyria fire department, which succeeded in reaching Lorain, sent out a frantic appeal for help, reporting that several hundreds were injured when the theatre collapsed. A street in South Lorain also is reported to have been undermined. From Sandusky came reports that a car ferry blew over. Interurban service between here and Lorain, Sandusky, and intermediate points is at a standstill. The entire Elyria Fire and Police Departments and ambulance equipment have been sent to Lorain. The only way to reach Lorain from Cleveland is through Elyria, and roads are jammed with refugees headed away from Lorain and relief parties on the way there.\\" See also * List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks References External links * Lorain-Sandusky tornado damage gallery Category:F4 tornadoes by date Lorain-Sandusky, Ohio,1924-06-28 Lorain- Sandusky tornado, 1924 Category:Tornadoes in Ohio Lorain-sandusky Tornado, 1924 Tornado, 1924 Lorain-Sandusky Tornado, 1924 Lorain-Sandusky Category:Lorain, Ohio Category:1924 in Ohio Lorain-Sandusky tornado ","title":"1924 Lorain‚ÄìSandusky tornado"},{"id":"16736869","title":"List of masses by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"},{"id":"16736879","text":"Stopping the clock is a controversial practice in American and Canadian legislative procedure in which a legislature literally or notionally stops the clock (or moves the hands backwards), usually for the purpose of meeting a constitutional or statutory deadline.

The New York Legislature used to literally stop the clock at midnight on April 1 in order to pass the budget by the constitutional deadline, but eventually ended the practice and began simply disregarding the requirement. In 2004, it finally moved the deadline back to May 1. In a debate of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, it was noted that stopping the clock is done by tradition and with unanimous consent, when the Opposition agrees with the Government that valuable business can be done by extending the hours.April 15, 1993 Hansard Evening In contrast, the speaker of the Illinois Legislature unilaterally stopped the clock at midnight on the last day of its session on June 30, 1988, to allow further debate before approving money to replace Comiskey Park, a decision that ultimately passed by one vote.

Stadium consultant Marc Ganis noted, \\"As the clock struck down in St. Petersburg, they started popping champagne corks and didn't realize that the speaker of the house can literally stop the clock in Illinois. At the stroke of midnight, we got to 60 votes.\\" Stopping the clock is also practised in the European Union.

Governor-General :Under the Spanish Colonial Government (1571‚Äì1764) :Status: Defunct :Inaugural holder: Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi The Royal Governor-General of the Philippines ruled the Spanish colony that is today the Republic of the Philippines except a two- year British occupation of Manila. This territory was also called the Captaincy-General of the Philippines and thus the governor also held the title of Captain General, a military rank conferred by the Spanish Cortes Generales. The men that held this position governed the Philippines and the rest of the Spanish East Indies from 1565 to 1821, on behalf of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish Monarchy was the head of state of the Philippines at this time, as it was also the monarch of New Spain.

It was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America on March 3, 2009, for Windows on March 17, for iOS on December 9, for BlackBerry on January 8, 2010, for Palm Pre on April 2, for Android on September 13, and for Symbian on January 16, 2011. A Wii version was announced, but was ultimately canceled. In September 2010, a sequel titled Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2 was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Microsoft Windows and Wii versions were released in November 2010. In November 2018, Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X was added to the Xbox One's Backwards Compatibility list although only through physical media as it's not available on the Xbox Marketplace. The story of the game takes place during the time of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. H.A.W.X is set in the near future where private military companies have essentially replaced government-run military in many countries. The player is placed in the shoes of David Crenshaw; an elite ex-United States Air Force pilot who was recruited by one of these corporations, fighting whomever and whenever he is told to. Crenshaw later returns to the Air Force together with his team, trying to prevent the PMC from initiating a full-scale attack on the United States. Gameplay The ERS in H.A.W.X: The player's plane, shown from the third person view, is escaping an incoming missile. ERS has rendered an escape path (red triangles) which the player should follow. The basic gameplay mechanics of H.A.W.X are similar to those of other console-based flight arcade, such as Ace Combat. Players take on enemies with over fifty aircraft available to them. Each mission is set amidst real world locations in environments created with commercial satellite data. A cockpit, first-person, and third-person view are selectable, with third-person view giving the player an external view of both their plane and the target. All aircraft in the game are equipped with guns, a large supply of the Joint Strike Missile (JSM) heat-seekersUnrelated to the real-world Joint Strike Missile and a handful of flares. Most enemy aircraft that appear in the single-player campaign are downed when they are hit by two JSMs. Heavier aircraft such as strategic bombers are downed with four JSMs. Guns inflict little damage but their supply of bullets is infinite. Each aircraft may also carry one or two additional weapons. For instance, the A-10 attack aircraft may carry cluster bombs that are effective against a column of tanks but cannot be fired against airborne targets. The player may not customize the weapons, but may choose between predefined configurations. The game features an \\"Enhanced Reality System\\" (ERS). The ERS includes radars, incoming missile detection, an anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map, information relay, aircraft interception trajectories and weapons trajectory control. The ERS also allows players to issue orders to their squadron and other units. When fully activated, the ERS provides a great deal of assistance to the player, but the system features can be turned off selectively to make the game more difficult and give the player more maneuverability. The Ace Edge flight stick and throttle control, designed for the limited edition Ace Combat 6 package, is fully compatible with the game on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. = Multiplayer = Players are able to complete campaign missions in co-op mode. There is also a deathmatch mode where players can challenge each other. Winning players are rewarded with experience points to unlock more weapons. The planes that are available in multiplayer mode are determined by the current level of the player.  Synopsis  =Background= The game is set above the skies of a near-future world, which is increasingly dependent on private military companies with elite mercenaries, who have a relaxed view of the law. As these non-governmental organizations gain power, global conflict erupts with one powerful PMC attacking the United States. The game is set in the same universe as Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, and Captain Scott Mitchell, the Ghost leader, is featured in several of the missions. Plot elements are also carried over from other Tom Clancy games, such as the missile defense system found in Tom Clancy's EndWar. During an interview with G4, H.A.W.Xs lead designer Thomas Simon revealed that the game takes place between Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 and Tom Clancy's EndWar. = Plot = The player assumes the role of Major David Crenshaw, a U.S. Air Force pilot and squadron leader of an elite unit called H.A.W.X (\\"High Altitude Warfare eXperimental squadron\\"). The game begins in 2014 with Crenshaw providing air support for the Ghost Recon team carrying out covert operations in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. After the mission, the Air Force deactivates the H.A.W.X program and Crenshaw is recruited into Artemis Global Security, a private military corporation. Over the next six years, Crenshaw and his squadron fly missions for Artemis and its clients, such as defending valuable facilities and attacking insurgent bases. In 2021, Artemis signs a lucrative defense contract with Brazil that makes it one of the most powerful PMCs in the world. As expected, Las Trinidad, an anti-U.S. alliance PMC, launches an invasion on Rio de Janeiro. But with the help of Crenshaw and his squadron, Artemis and the Brazilian forces are able to repel the invasion. In the wake of the conflict, the United States sends its forces to intervene, thereby subverting Artemis' role and causing its stock to drop. In response, Artemis takes up a profitable contract with Las Trinidad and launches a surprise attack on the United States Navy carrier strike group in the Strait of Magellan. Unwilling to turn against their own country, Crenshaw and his squadron destroy the Artemis fleet and their fighter escort. After the battle, the U.S. sends Crenshaw and an Air Force bomber squadron on a retaliatory mission to bomb the Artemis Operations Center in the Caribbean Sea. However, Artemis knocks out the U.S. communications and intelligence satellites and launches a massive preemptive invasion of the United States, capturing numerous major U.S. cities and military bases. H.A.W.X and the U.S. forces defend Washington, D.C. and the President of the United States. Crenshaw and his squadron then assist the American counterattack against Artemis in Chicago and Naval Station Norfolk. As the U.S. gains the upper hand with the help of Japan and NATO, Artemis, which had acquired several tactical nuclear weapons, issues an ultimatum to the President: surrender in 24 hours or watch the U.S. be destroyed. H.A.W.X. squadron, a Ghost Recon team and NASA manage to restore the Space, Land, Air Missile Shield (see: Tom Clancy's EndWar) and helps the Army Ranger battalion to capture a decommissioned U.S. Army base in the Nevada Desert and recover the warheads. However, in a last-ditch effort, Artemis smuggles one warhead into Los Angeles and prepares to detonate it. With only one minute left before detonation, Crenshaw destroys the nuke and concludes the war. The three days of conflict between the U.S. and Artemis has caused over 40,000 casualties. In response, the United Nations forces all PMCs to disarm and either take on small scale support and logistical roles or be terminated. Several weeks later, Artemis is completely wiped out. Crenshaw kills the Artemis' CEO by destroying his hideout in a black operation.  Development  H.A.W.X was announced on July 15, 2008 at the annual E3 2008 developers conference. Prior to this, Ubisoft issued a press release about the game under its working title Tom Clancy's Air Combat. A demo of the game for the Xbox 360 was released on February 11, 2009; for the PlayStation 3 on February 27, 2009; and for Microsoft Windows on March 2, 2009. Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X uses a new high resolution image program and GeoEye's commercial Earth-imaging Ikonos satellite system. The H.A.W.X development team worked closely with GeoEye so that satellite images could be used in the game's nineteen-level environment; \\"High-resolution satellite imaging is moving from the black world of intelligence to the white world of commerce, and Tom Clancy's HAWX will bring that reality to gamers\\", said GeoEye VP, Mark Brender.  Reception  H.A.W.X has received mixed to positive reviews. The satellite mapping has been largely praised due to its increased authenticity, although it has also been criticized as pixelation becomes very obvious during low-level flying. Game Informers Matt Miller praised the game for its \\"big thrills\\". Other reviewers criticized the game as \\"stale\\". IGN's Nate Ahearn wrote \\"The co-op is fun, but the lacking multiplayer is a bummer,\\" and X-Plays Jake Gaskill stated \\"Versus multiplayer is confusingly shallow\\". Zero Punctuation, known for its harsh review style, gave it a rare positive review, with reviewer Ben Croshaw criticising the story but complimenting the gameplay.  Sequel  On May 5, 2010, Ubisoft announced that a sequel, Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2, was being developed for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii and PC. The game was released on September 3, 2010 for Xbox 360, on September 10 for PlayStation 3, and on November 12 for Wii and PC.

History James Irvine's father was an Irish immigrant who arrived in San Francisco in 1849 during the California Gold Rush and established himself as a successful businessman. Later, he branched out geographically and acquired some of land in what is now Orange County. Upon his father‚Äôs death, James Irvine inherited the land, which at the time was used as a stock ranch, and turned it into one of the largest, most productive agricultural enterprises in the state.For the People of California: A History of the James Irvine Foundation, Heather G. Graham, 1991. In response to the Great Depression, James Irvine decided to establish a foundation in 1937 that would promote the \\"general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California.\\"For the People of California: A History of the James Irvine Foundation, Heather G. Graham, 1991. The foundation became the primary stockholder of The Irvine Company, which owned the Irvine Ranch. With the rapid growth of Southern California during the 1940s and 50s, The Irvine Company was under pressure to develop its property. But in contrast to the unplanned sprawl nearby, the company worked to ensure that development was well planned and included a range of uses on its property such as higher education and agriculture.For the People of California: A History of the James Irvine Foundation, Heather G. Graham, 1991. Eventually, in the 1970s, the Irvine Foundation was forced to sell its shares in the company and diversify its holdings. When James Irvine died in 1947, his gift to the foundation was valued at $5.6 million. By 2007, these assets had grown to more than $1.8 billion.Assets and Financial Information The James Irvine Foundation Notes and references External links * The James Irvine Foundation (www.irvine.org) * Arts program publications The James Irvine Foundation commissioned-publications * Youth program publications The James Irvine Foundation commissioned-publications * California Democracy program publications The James Irvine Foundation commissioned-publications * The Foundation Center: Top 100 U.S. Foundations by Asset Size The James Irvine Foundation is ranked number 32. * Leadership Awards The James Irvine Foundation Leadership Awards Category:Non-profit organizations based in California Category:Organizations based in San Francisco Category:Organizations established in 1937 Category:1937 establishments in California ","title":"James Irvine Foundation"},{"id":"16737019","text":"The Harley-Davidson VRSC (V-twin racing street custom), or V-Rod, was a line of V-twin muscle bikes, produced by Harley-Davidson from 2001 until 2017. It is notable as the first Harley-Davidson street motorcycle to feature a modern engine with DOHC and liquid cooling. The VRSC models were absent in Harley- Davidson's 2018 model line announcements. Overview The VRSC was introduced in 2001 in a single model called the V-Rod. The V-Rod was developed to compete against Japanese and American muscle bikes. The \\"V-Rod\\" made use of the Revolution engine, that, for the first time used overhead cams and liquid cooling. Unlike other Harley production motorcycles, a 60-degree V-twin engine, the radiator and the hydroformed frame members support the round- topped air cleaner cover. The fuel tank on the V-Rod is located underneath the seat, placing the rider on top of it, rather than the usual frontal placement. The \\"tank\\" in this case is actually the cover for the air box and coolant fill port. Loosely based on the VR-1000 Superbike, Harley-Davidson builds it as a platform for drag-racing competition machines. All VRSC models are produced at Harley-Davidson's Vehicle and Powertrain Operations facility in Kansas City, Missouri. The V-Rod's engine, called Revolution, while based on the VR-1000 Superbike engine.The VRSC marks Harley's first collaboration with Porsche since the Nova project, which, like the V-Rod, was a radical departure from Harley's traditional lineup until it was cancelled by AMF in 1981 in favor of the Evolution engine. A derivative of the Revolution called the Revolution X was later used on the entry-level Harley-Davidson Street, first released in 2014. Public reception Customised Vrod publicised photo in news Car & Driver said Harley-Davidson's branding was \\"culturally rather than technologically driven; so imagine our surprise at seeing the company's newest ride, the V-Rod, complete with a liquid-cooled DOHC four-valve V-twin developed in partnership with Porsche Engineering.\\" They added, \\"we think the V-Rod is a serious threat to its own stablemates as well as to cruisers from other manufacturers. It's that good\\". Motorcycle Cruiser wrote \\"The V-Rod was intended to bring in more than the usual suspects, and it did. It became the company's best-selling bike in other countries. In America, V-Rod buyers often came from other brands, attracted by its modern engine, excellent performance and not-the-usual-cruiser style\\". Models 2001 VRSCA V-Rod at Porsche Museum =VRSCA V-Rod= Model years: 2002‚Äì2006. The original V-Rod had a Revolution Engine, producing a claimed at the crank. The V-Rod had 49 mm forks and a 180 mm rear tire, with solid disc wheels. The VRSCAs were all factory equipped with fuel tanks. In 2006 the VRSCA was equipped with Brembo brakes. The VRSCA was only offered with forward controls. 2003 models were included in the 100th anniversary edition. =VRSCAW V-Rod= Model years: 2007‚Äì2010. The VRSCAW V-Rod is the successor to the VRSCA. First Produced in 2007, it is essentially a VRSCA with a new frame to accommodate the 240 mm rear tire and five gallon gas tank that came standard. The aluminum bodywork of the VRSCA was used in a few early-production VRSCAW models, but was later dropped. With these changes the VRSCAW is a claimed heavier than its predecessor. For the first production year the power-plant remained an unchanged Revolution engine. The VRSCAW was only offered with forward controls. The combination of increased weight, and a 240 mm rear tire with no power increase made the 2007 VRSCAW the slowest production VRSC produced In 2008 the VRSCAW V-Rod's Revolution was increased from 1,131 cc to , producing a claimed @ 7,000 rpm, and peak power of at the crankshaft, a slipper clutch was also added, as was an anti-lock braking system option. For the 2009 model year the VRSCAW replaced the VRSCD, which was dropped from the line, as the \\"base model\\" for the VRSC family, and the suggested retail price was reduced. thumbVRSCB V-Rod =VRSCB V-Rod= Model years: 2004‚Äì2005. The VRSCB V-Rod had a two-year run. It was mechanically identical to the VRSCA, with cosmetic differences included a black frame, polished aluminum and black powder-coated engine, and a slightly different clamshell, instrument housing and handlebars. The VRSCB was only offered with forward controls. =VRSCD Night Rod= Model years: 2006‚Äì2008. The Night Rod was introduced in 2006 as the ‚Äúnew hot rod-inspired motorcycle‚Äù built around the Revolution engine. The Night Rod has mid controls similar to the 2006 Street Rod. These are the only two V-Rod models with mid controls (Rear sets). Straight-shot mufflers helped the Revolution Engine to produce a claimed at the crank. The Night Rod had a black frame, black and chrome engine, Brembo brakes, slotted aluminum disk wheels, and a color- matched fairing. In 2008 the VRSCD Night Rod's Revolution was increased from , producing a claimed @ 7,000 rpm, and peak power of at the crank, a slipper clutch was also added, as was an ABS option. For the 2008 model year, the VRSCD was the only remaining VRSC model to still have a 180 mm rear tire or mid-pegs. 2008 was also the final year of production for the VRSCD Night Rod. =VRSCDX Night Rod Special= Model years: 2007‚Äì2017. VRSCDX Night Rod Special The VRSCDX is marketed as the factory made custom version of the standard Night Rod and is also part of Harley-Davidson's \\"Dark Custom\\" series. In addition to a 240 mm wide rear tire, most of the chrome components of the VRSCD were replaced with black. The wheels were replaced by black slotted disk wheels, with dark orange pin striping. The Straight shot dual exhaust produced a claimed at the crank. A 5-gallon tank was standard. The DX also include racing stripes. In 2008 the VRSCDX Night Rod Special's Revolution was increased from , producing claimed torque of @ 7,000 rpm, and peak power of at the crank, a slipper-clutch was also added, as was an ABS option. For the 2012 model year, Harley-Davidson launched a tenth anniversary version of the Night Rod Special. This model had a straight-shot exhaust with dual, chrome slash- cut mufflers and chrome exhaust shield; split five-spoke cast aluminum wheels with diamond cut highlights; pullback handlebar with polished finish; inverted front forks in silver and polished finishes; stylized, chrome speed screen visor; graphics, including V-Rod 10th anniversary emblem; and chrome powertrain with platinum crankcase and heads. =VRSCF V-Rod Muscle= VRSCF V-Rod Muscle Model years: 2009‚Äì2017. The V-Rod Muscle was introduced in the summer of 2008 at the Harley-Davidson dealer show in Las Vegas for the 2009 production model year. In promoting the Muscle, American fashion model Marisa Miller was hired for an advertising campaign aimed at younger, urban riders. It would be one of only three VRSC models for 2009. Like the other two models, the Muscle used the Revolution Engine, a 240 mm wide rear tire, fuel tank, slipper clutch and forward controls. Unlike the other models in the VRSC lineup, the Muscle had straight shot dual exhausts, with a crossover, one on each side of the bike, unlike the 2>1>2 exhaust found on all other VRSC models. Additionally, the Muscle used an air-box with mock-up air-rams like those found on many American pony and muscle cars. In the production version of the bike the air-rams are cosmetic. The VRSCF also had a chopped rear fender with integrated turn signals, and a side-mounted license plate. Turn signals were integrated into the rear view mirrors for the first time as a stock feature on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The VRSCF provided at the crank a claimed of torque at 6,500 rpm,which was slightly more torque than the other VRSC models, at a slightly lower engine speeds. Claimed peak crank horsepower was slightly lower than the Night Rod Special, at at 500 rpm lower engine speed. =VRSCSE Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod= Model years: 2005. In 2005 Harley-Davidson's Custom Vehicle Operations produced their first V-Rod. The dimensions were identical to the VRSCA at the time, but the VRSCSE had extra chrome, custom paint, and not the typical \\"clamshell\\" found on other VRSC models. The VRSCSE had a 1,247 cc Revolution Engine, with CNC ported heads. =VRSCSE2 Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod= Model years: 2006. The VRSCSE2 was the first V-Rod or VRSC model with a 240 mm rear tire. It also used the Screamin' Eagle 1,247 cc Revolution Engine. =VRSCR Street Rod= VRSCR Street Rod Model years: 2006‚Äì2007. The Street Rod was marketed as the ‚Äúroadster-inspired‚Äù member of the VRSC line. The Street Rod was the first VRSC to use inverted forks (made by Showa Corporation) with a steep rake and also was the first to use Brembo brakes. It had the highest seat height at of any VRSC model, and claimed the greatest lean angle at 40¬∞, over the 32¬∞ lean of the other VRSC models. The Street Rod came equipped solely with mid-mounted controls. The Street Rod was the first with a 5-gallon tank in the 2006 year model, that would become standard for the line in 2007.Of the various versions of the V-Rod, the VRSCR Street Rod roadster was aimed primarily at the European market and was best able to handle the engine's 120 bhp output. MCN wrote: \\"The Harley-Davidson Street Rod has sharper steering, four-piston brakes made for Harley by Brembo, new upswept exhausts for extra ground clearance, and a revised riding position makes this a Harley like no other ‚Äì one that attacks corners with glee\\". =VRSCX V-Rod= Model years: 2007. Harley-Davidson put out the VRSCX as a Screamin' Eagle Tribute bike during the Harley V-Rod's second consecutive NHRA Championship. The VRSCX had the same dimensions as the 2007 VRSCAW, featuring the 240 mm rear tire, 5 gallon gas tank, and forward controls. However, the VRSCX also had paintwork similar to the pro stock V-Rod, a smoked drag-visor windshield, as well as the 1,247 cc Screamin' Eagle Revolution Engine. 1400 were built. =VRXSE V-Rod \\"Destroyer\\"= VRXSE V-Rod \\"Destroyer\\" In 2006 Harley-Davidson introduced a non-street legal eight-second drag bike nicknamed \\"the Destroyer\\". Its Revolution engine featured a longer- stroke crankshaft and increased bore, high compression forged pistons, larger valves, larger throttle bodies, dyno tuned velocity stacks, and high lift cams. Race-only drivetrain changes included a lightened flywheel, multi-stage lock-up clutch, pneumatic shifter, and programmable shift light. A total of 646 vehicles were produced with 625 released to dealer showrooms. The Destroyer inspired the four-time world champion NHRA Pro Stock motorcycle Harley-Davidson Screamin' Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod. The Screamin' Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod ran 6.815 seconds and went nearly 200 mph in the quarter-mile. The Revolution engine VR-1000 racing superbike The Revolution engine is based on the VR-1000 Superbike race program, developed by Harley-Davidson's Powertrain Engineering team. It is a liquid-cooled, dual-overhead-cam, internally counterbalanced 60 degree V-twin engine with a displacement of , producing at 8,250 rpm at the crank, with a redline of 9,000 rpm. It was introduced for the new V-Rod line in 2001 for the 2002 model year, starting with the single VRSCA (V-Twin Racing Street Custom) model. A 1,247 cc Screamin' Eagle version of the Revolution engine was made available for 2005, and was present thereafter in a single production model from 2005 to 2007. In 2008, the 1,247 cc Revolution Engine became standard for the entire VRSC line. Harley-Davidson claims at the crank for the 2008 VRSCAW model. The VRXSE Destroyer is equipped with a stroker (75 mm crank) Screamin‚Äô Eagle Revolution Engine, producing over . The V-Rod engine was used in the Campagna V13R, and Campagna T-Rex from around 2008 to 2013. There is an agreement to sell the engines to the company for use in the motorized trike. Then in 2013 the company changed the engine in the T-Rex to BMW's K1600 but still uses the V-Rod engine in the V13R.

It was built in memory of Lieutenant Robin Tudsbery, who was killed in the closing days of World War II. The chapel sits within the grounds of the Thistle Foundation, a housing complex originally built for disabled armed forces personnel.  History  The Thistle Foundation was established as a charity in 1944 by Sir Francis and Lady Isabella Tudsbery to provide housing and care for disabled war veterans and their families. Nowadays, the charity offers a variety of services to people with disabilities and health conditions, and has an additional base in Renfrew. In 1950 the foundation stone for a chapel was laid in the grounds of the Thistle Foundation. The chapel was conceived and built by the TudsberysEdinburgh Doors Open Day pamphlet as a memorial to their only son, Robin, who, as a 25-year-old lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues), was killed in the last days of World War II. It was completed in 1953, and was dedicated in the presence of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. The chapel holds historical importance as a war memorial and as a pioneering home of ecumenical worship, devoted to \\"furthering the spirit of unity and concord among Christian people\\". This spirit is further repeated in the short statement which can be found at the opening of the service sheet: > 'The Robin Chapel is dedicated to the glory of God, and to His service, by > all Christians and by all denominations of Christ's Church. Every Service > held within the Robin Chapel shall be open accordingly to all Christians of > any denomination.'  Design and construction  Christian battles Apollyon in one of the stained glass windows by Sadie McLellan The chapel was designed by John F Matthew, of the architectural firm Lorimer & Matthew, in the Scottish Arts and Crafts style. Many craftspeople were involved in the finish of the interior, including Sadie McLellan, who created the stained glass windows which feature scenes from The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan.Newsletter of the Diocese of Edinburgh The inscription over the entrance to the chapel is also taken from The Pilgrim's Progress: \\"Come In, Come In, Eternal Glory Thou Shalt Win\\". The oak panelling and choir stalls show carvings of animals and birds, a reminder of Robin Tudsbury's love of animals and the countryside surrounding the family home of Champfleurie in West Lothian. Many of the carvings were worked by Thomas Good (who also did much of the carving in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall).  Worship  The chapel holds weekly services of Choral Evensong, as well as special services to commemorate key events in Robin Tudsbery's life, at 4pm. The chapel is open to all, and all have place here, where the love of God dwells.Robin Chapel The Chapel Choir (a group of adult mixed voices) sings at the weekly services, led by the director of music and accompanied on the organ. The ecumenical nature of the chapel is reflected in the invitation to clergy of many denominations being regularly invited to preach. Her Majesty The Queen attended the sixtieth anniversary service of the dedication of the chapel in July 2013, accompanied by Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex. The Sovereign's Standard of The Blues and Royals was laid up in The Robin Chapel on 4 October 2015, at a special service to mark the occasion.Order of Service booklet,on the occasion of The Laying Up of The Sovereign's Standard at The Robin Chapel, 04/10/2015,The Robin Chapel \\"Laying Up\\" service See also *List of Category A listed buildings in Edinburgh *List of post-war Category A listed buildings in Scotland  References  External links * Robin Chapel * Thistle Foundation * A history of the Tudsbury's country estate, Champfleurie * Robin Tudsbery's grave in Becklingen War Cemetery Category:Churches in Edinburgh Category:Christianity in Edinburgh Category:Monuments and memorials in Scotland Category:Category A listed buildings in Edinburgh Category:Listed churches in Scotland Category:Household Cavalry Category:Chapels in Scotland ","title":"Robin Chapel"},{"id":"16737036","text":"A Feud There Was is a 1938 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on September 24, 1938 and features Egghead, an early version of Elmer Fudd. Plot The short begins with an establishing shot of a family stereotypical hillbillies, the Weavers, whose members are all lazy to the point of absurdity. The only thing that awakens the Weavers from their perpetual sloth is the opportunity to feud with their neighbors, the McCoys. After a musical number (then a staple of Merrie Melodies shorts) accompanied by a radio commercial (ostensibly over KFWB), the two families begin feuding, firing at each other with various semi-automatic weapons. At one point, a McCoy asks if there are any Weavers in the movie audience. One man, shown as a silhouette against the screen, answers in the affirmative and fires a shot at the McCoy. In the midst of the fray, a yodeling, bulbous- nosed, domestic peace activist who is accompanied by church organ music each time he speaks, enters the feud zone on a motorscooter bearing the words \\"Elmer Fudd, Peace Maker\\", and goes to each side preaching peace and an end to the bloodshed, only to get shot in the back (non-fatally) by each family as he departs. When Fudd attempts once more to preach peace to both families from the boundary line, both sides get furious at him and open fire on the would-be peace maker together. When the smoke clears, only Elmer is left standing. He gives a final yodel and says \\"Good night, all!\\", and the Weaver in the movie audience yells \\"Good night!,\\" taking one more shot at the star as the film closes out.

They were known for their confident and remarkable live shows. History Christ Analogue was devised in 1995 by programmer/vocalist Wade Alin. After Markus Von Prause joined on guitar, the duo debuted with the single \\"This Shall Not Breathe\\" in 1994 and was compared favorably to Sister Machine Gun. The 1996 release of their debut album, The Texture ov Despise, earned Christ Analogue instant respect in the electronic/industrial music scene. For an electronic-based act, they approached their live performances with an unusually aggressive, and often destructive punk ethic. This exciting live act helped them develop a strong following in the Seattle, WA, and Vancouver, BC, areas. In an effort to gain national recognition, the band booked and headlined their own tours of the United States. Christ Analogue did five national tours within two years, including shows with Sheep on Drugs, 16 Volt, Electric Hellfire Club, Stabbing Westward, Insight 23, and two appearances at the CMJ Musicfest. After signing to MCA/Cargo/Re-Constriction, Christ Analogue self-produced their second album, In Radiant Decay. Critically acclaimed by both the commercial and underground press, In Radiant Decay made an impact both in clubs and on college radio throughout the US. Despite these successes, Wade Alin's relocation to New York coupled with the collapse of Re- Constriction Records caused the band's dissolution. However, Alin continued to apply the Christ Analogue name to various remixes, and remains a sought-after producer. Five years after their apparent departure, Christ Analogue reemerged with the album Everyday Is Distortion in 2003. In April 2012 Wade Alin created and had successfully funded a Kickstarter project to re-create In Radiant Decay from a combination of the original recordings and new material.

Such an airline focuses on operating a network of air services, and outsourcing non-core activities to other organizations. Contracting out services within the aviation industry has reportedly become so common that many carriers could be classed as having features of a virtual airline, although it is arguable whether any current carriers meet a strict definition of the term. The term is often used to describe travel companies and ticket agencies that market themselves as airlines, but do not possess an air operator's certificate and contract with one or more certificated operators to fly and maintain aircraft, often under an air charter arrangement. Although operated by others from a regulatory standpoint, the aircraft may display the virtual airline's livery, and may be owned or leased by that company. Origins Virtual airlines originated in the United States of America following the drastic changes brought about by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. During the hyper-competitive years immediately following deregulation, major airlines found it increasingly unprofitable to compete against start-up carriers on many routes they currently served. Instead of forfeiting the routes entirely, the larger carriers often made marketing arrangements with smaller airlines to fly under the \\"banner\\", or livery, of the larger airline. These regional airlines, mimicking the well known major airlines in adverts and purporting to make connections as seamless as possible, soon abandoned their own local service routes. In most cases, the regional airlines found it more profitable to serve the mainline hubs as a feeder operation rather than operate on their own.

In 1962, Brown founded Crown Point Press, a fine art print shop specializing in etching, and has owned and directed the shop since then. Crown Point Press is widely credited with sparking the revival of etching as a viable art medium.Tallman, Susan. 1996. The Contemporary Print from Pre-Pop to Postmodern. New York, NY: Thames and Hudson. Some of the most important artists of our time, including John Cage, Chuck Close, Anish Kapoor, Ed Ruscha, Kiki Smith and Pat Steir, have worked there. Early life and education Brown was born in New York City and grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida. She received a B.A. from Antioch College and an M.F.A. from the California College of Arts and Crafts. In addition, she holds Honorary Doctorate degrees from California College of the Arts (CCA) and the San Francisco Art Institute. Career In 1956, Brown left Antioch College in Ohio for one year to attend the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. There, she began to study etching. After graduating from Antioch College in 1958, Brown returned to the Central School for another year to fine-tune her technique. In addition, she participated in The Print Workshop at 28 Charlotte Street, run by Birgit Skiold. In the summer of 1959, while on a holiday trip to Edinburgh, Brown noticed an old etching press in the backyard of her rooming house. The landlady offered the press to Brown, saying it had been there since World War II. With the etching press in tow, Brown booked passage on a freighter going to San Francisco from Glasgow via the Panama Canal. In 1962, Brown started Crown Point Press in a storefront space in Richmond, California. The following year she bought a house in Berkeley and ran the printmaking workshop out of her basement. In 1965, Brown began publishing the etching portfolios of Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud. The Press moved into a vacant hat factory on San Pablo Avenue in Oakland in 1971 and then to Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1986. Unfortunately, the Folsom Street space was lost in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. In 1990, Crown Point moved to 20 Hawthorne Street in San Francisco where it resides today. In recent years, Brown has shifted much of her focus to writing and left the day-to-day operations of the press to director Valerie Wade who is a partner in the business. In 2006, Crown Point began publishing a series of books about printmaking, the Magical Secrets series. Brown wrote the first book in the series, Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively: The Art of Etching and the Truth of Life, which highlights various creative processes artists have embraced while working in the Crown Point studio. Art on Paper magazine reviewed Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively saying, ‚ÄúBrown combines printmaking, art history, memoir and how-to inspirational literature to address the creative process.

Brown is also the author of a monthly video segment, The Three Minute Egg, where she discusses the creative process. Over the years, Crown Point‚Äôs roster has grown to include over 100 artists from all around the world. Crown Point‚Äôs archives have been held at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco since 1991. A smaller archive is owned by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Crown Point Press celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary with an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and its thirty-fifth with a retrospective jointly organized by and shown at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. Today, Crown Point Press publishes the work of five artists a year, hosts printmaking workshops and publishes a series of books about printmaking. The Press will be fifty years old in 2012. Personal life Brown married Jeryl Parker in 1960 and had a son, Kevin Powis Parker, in 1961. Parker and Brown amicably separated in 1963 and later divorced. In 1983, she married conceptual artist Tom Marioni. They make their home in San Francisco. Published work = Books by Brown =  * Why Draw a Live Model?

Trained as a legal historian, his early work focused on the historical relationship between law, technology and the senses. In the mid-1990s he wrote a series of controversial articles on the future of law reviews and scholarly publishing in the then-just-emerging age of the Internet. He is best known today as the founder, publisher & Editor-in-Chief of JURIST, the Webby award-winning online legal news service he created in 1996 that is now powered by a volunteer team of over 80 students from 29 law schools in the US, the UK, continental Europe, Kenya, Mauritius, Australia and New Zealand. He is Chairman of the Board of Directors of JURIST Legal News and Research Services, Inc., the 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation he organized to operate JURIST in 2008. Hibbitts is a Rhodes Scholar (Maritimes, 1981) and a former law clerk at the Supreme Court of Canada for the late Justice Gerald Le Dain, whom he served from 1984-85 after his original employer, Chief Justice Bora Laskin, died in office. He is a graduate in law of University College, Oxford (B.A. Jurisprudence 1983), Dalhousie University (LL.B. 1984), the University of Toronto (LL.M. 1986), and the Harvard Law School (LL.M. 1988), where he was an Associate Editor of the Harvard International Law Journal.

Location Habla is located just east of the Green Line, about southeast of the Palestinian town of Qalqilya as the crow flies, in the West Bank.Masalha, 2003, p. 199. It is bordered by Al Mudawwar to the east and south; Ras ‚ÄòAtiya and ‚ÄòIzbat Jalud to the south, the Green Line to the west, and Qalqiliya, Wadi ar Rasha and Ras at Tira to the north. History About a dozen tombs, with loculi have been found, together with cisterns. The type of tombs indicate that they are Christian.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 321 Ancient remains of a mosque and houses have been found in the village.Dauphin, 1998, p. 803. In 1265, Hableh was among the villages and estates sultan Baibars allocated to his amirs after he had expelled the Crusaders. Hableh was divided equally between three of his amirs: Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Zahiri, the na'ib of Al- Karak, Jamal al-Din Aqush, and Shams al-Din Sunqur Jah al-Zahiri.Ibn al-Furat, 1971, pp. 82, 209, 249 (map) =Ottoman era= During the period of Ottoman rule over Palestine, Hableh appeared in Ottoman tax registers in 1596, where it is listed as forming part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jabal Qubal in the liwa (district) of Nablus. It had a population of 41 Muslim households. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on various products, such as wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\" and a press for olive oil or grape syrup; a total of 3,800 ak√ße, of which two-thirds went to a waqf (charitable endowment).H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 134 Pierre Jacotin listed the village on his map in 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 170 In 1838 Hableh was noted as a Muslim village, in the Jurat Merda district, south of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 126 Edward Robinson and Eli Smith visited Hableh in the mid-19th century and describe it as being situated along the southern side of a low rocky ridge overlooking a plain on which could be seen the villages of Qalqilya, Kafr Saba, Jaljulia, and Ras al-Ain.Robinson and Smith, 1857, p. 136. Camping on the ground to the south of the village and north of a maqam on a low rocky hill, Robinson and Smith found themselves surrounded by cisterns dug into the rock.Robinson, 1858, p. 528. Most of these had round openings, some with one or two steps by which one could descend into them to draw water. All appeared to be ancient, and only one was still in use. There was also a sepulcher with an arched vault and an ancient wine press made up of two vats, one shallower and smaller than the other in which grapes would have been trodden with the juice going down through a hole to the larger, deeper vat directly adjacent and slightly below. Victor Gu√©rin, who visited Hableh in 1870, said it contained 800 inhabitants. A few of the houses and the village mosque were built using large stones of apparent antiquity. He too noted the presence of ancient rock-cut formations around the village.Gu√©rin, 1875, pp. 367-368 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Hableh as a \\"village of moderate size, evidently an ancient site, surrounded with cisterns and tombs. The houses are principally of stone.

According to a report in The Jerusalem Times on January 24, 1996, Israeli bulldozers began levelling land in Hiblah belonging to its Palestinian residents in order to build an electronic wall that would separate the towns of Tulkarm and Kalkiliya from the Green Line. That same day, a resident of Hiblah was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers who fired at Palestinians trying to stop the bulldozers. In February of the same year, it was reported that the security fence being built on Hibla's land would be long and would separate the village from the Israeli village of Matti. The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier to the north of the village in the first decade of the 21st century changed the life of Habla's inhabitants.

They wait approximately two hours so as to enter the seam zone, a closed military zone, where they seek to tend to land that they own there or in nearby Qalqilya or to work in these areas as manual labourers. All those entering the seam zone must have a valid \\"pass- permit\\" that allows them to leave and enter for work which is issued by the Israeli military authorities. Those with the proper pass permits who wish to access Qalqilya can drive around the barrier, through multiple checkpoints. Alternatively, they may use a tunnel that was built in 2004 to connect Habla to Qalqilya.

The school roll in September 2019 was 816. The headteacher since October 2013 is Mr Billy Burke. History The headteacher when the school opened in 1908 was John Irving. Formerly, the school was based in the building that now houses Trinity High School, and when it was opened in 1908 it was known as Glebe High Public School , but, due to expansion, a purpose-built premises was designed close to the initial building, and the original building became a Catholic school. The School became known as Renfrew High School from August 1927. A fire broke out at the school in October 2016 causing significant damage to the school grounds. Description In an inspection report of May 2018, Education Scotland described the school. They found the school was good; the headteachers gave strong leadership of school improvement, and his work with staff to embed a positive culture which benefits all young people. There was very effective use of information about young people‚Äôs wellbeing which ensured that their needs were well met, and that they make good progress. There was a very positive environment for pupil support especially those with additional needs. This and the commitment of all the staff to promoting 'nurturing and inclusive relationships' across the school, led to improved outcomes for all young people. The inspectors noticed improvement in the proportion of young people achieving a range of Higher passes in S5 and S6. Education Scotland website is ¬© Crown copyright 2020.

She is most noted in her career as the founding principal of Solway College, Masterton, from 1916 through to her retirement in 1942. Marion Thompson, MA, 1929Marion Thompson completed her teacher training in 1898 at the Dunedin Teachers' College and received her MA with first class honours in 1899. For the next decade she taught in a number of schools around New Zealand, six years of it at Prince Albert College, Auckland. In 1909 she married Reverend Laurence Thompson, turning her attention to raising a family in Carterton, where her husband was minister of the Presbyterian church. Her thoughts returned to teaching in late 1914 after Rev Thompson fell seriously ill. She rejected several positions offered at established girls' schools to pursue an idea suggested by her brother-in-law Rev A. T. Thompson. He had for some time been considering establishment of a boys' school in the Wairarapa, believing that \\"the activities of the Church could profitably be extended into the educational world.\\".Thompson, M.B. (1956), p2 As Mrs Thompson's teaching experience to date had been mainly in girls' schools, Rev. Thompson agreed to enlist community support for a girls' school instead. The school opened in 1916 in Solway House, the old homestead of a large Wairarapa estate, with a roll of 21. The following year it grew to 61. The Rev. Thompson's return to health enabled both to play an active role in creating a solid foundation of community support for the school and life-education for its students. Marion Thompson's approach to operation of a girls' boarding school was outlined in a speech to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church in Auckland in 1915, expressing her hope that \\"with our family life at its centre, Solway College would have the atmosphere of a home rather than an institution.\\"Thompson, op cit, foreword The school functioned with a disciplinary system absent of fines or detentions, and Mrs Thompson's teaching approach was to establish \\"activities that rounded off the angularity of the class-room, and made for fullness of living to counteract the popular opinion that young people should be educated to earn a living.\\"Thompson, p77 The concept of holistic education endures as a pillar of Solway College's teaching philosophy to this day. Ironically, the pursuit of a school as a family took its toll on Marion Thompson's personal life. In her later years, she admitted that the school had absorbed her life to the exclusion of family, church and her own social and cultural interests. She was a tireless worker in all areas of the school, often out of necessity due to frequent staff turnover or lack of availability through the war years. She also battled throughout her career to earn the respect of the guarantors and board of governors, who she believed at the outset were 'parsimonious and patronising', treating her as 'a penniless woman with a very sick husband and two small sons' whom they were benevolently providing with a means of livelihood.Thompson, p9; Page, D. In 1942, resignation was forced upon her by failing eyesight, a condition evident since the mid-1930s but which had not improved despite a major operation. She published her memoirs in 1956, living out her final years with her daughter until her death in 1964. She described her time at Solway College as 'an experiment on a small scale',Thompson, p173 but one which she herself, ex- pupils, boards of governors and educators have acknowledged as successful and enduring.

On February 18, 2014 the tower opened the newly relocated downtown Post Office on the lobby floor. In January 2017, CBRE Global Investors purchased the Federated Tower for an estimated $98 million. The purchase did not include the adjacent Westin Convention Center Hotel, which was part of the 2013 by Starwood Capital Group.

Uses of the term It is not always clear what critics mean by \\"overproduction\\", but there are a minimum of a few common uses of the term: *Heavy use of audio processing effects such as reverb, delay, or dynamic range compression. *Heavy layering or multitracking; in the context of pop and rock music, this may refer to the addition of elements such as chorused vocals or backing strings. *Radio versions of songs pushed to be more \\"pop\\" through the use of loud drum beats or other instrumentation changes. *Heavy use of pitch correction, time correction, or quantization. *A recording overseen by a producer who \\"imposes\\" their own distinctive \\"sound\\" or techniques on a band or artist; Producers frequently accused of this kind of \\"overproduction\\" include Phil Spector and Mutt Lange. All five of these meanings share the idea that a record producer or mastering engineer has made \\"unnecessary\\" additions or changes to a record in the production process and, in doing so, has decreased the quality or enjoyability of the music. There is little consensus among music critics or producers about when the use of an effect or production technique becomes excessive. For this reason, some producers consider the term unhelpful, confusing, and subjective. Current trends The excessive use of dynamic range compression has been bemoaned by critics as part of the \\"loudness war\\". In August 2006, Bob Dylan criticized modern recording techniques, saying that modern records \\"have sound all over them\\" and that they sound like \\"static\\". Those responding to Dylan's comments seemed to assume that he was referring to the trend of increasingly compressed music. The use of the Auto-Tune audio processor for pitch correction has become pervasive in pop music since late 1998, and has elicited criticism. In spite of the decreasing cost and increasing availability of professional or near-professional recording software and techniques, musicians and producers in some genres consciously set themselves against the idea of \\"overproduction\\" and attempt to make music with a rough or \\"lo-fi\\" sound.

The name is derived from the practice of issuing cards to a consumer.https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/glossary/term-card- issuer.phptitle=Credit Card Glossary: Terms and Definitions Details An issuing bank (also called an issuer) is part of the 4 party model of payments.https://gendal.me/2014/08/09/a-simple-explanation-of-fees-in-the- payment-card-industry It is the bank of the consumer (also called a cardholder) and is responsible for paying the merchant's bank (called an Acquiring Bank or Acquirer) for the goods and services the consumer purchases. It issues the payment card and holds the account with the consumer (such as a credit card account or checking account for a debit card). Other parties in the 4 party model include: # Consumer (also called a cardholder): Makes purchases and promises to pay the Issuing Bank for them. # Issuing Bank (also called an Issuer): The consumer's bank. Transfers money for purchases to the Acquiring Bank. Is liable for purchases made by the consumer if the consumer does not pay. # Acquiring Bank (also called an Acquirer): The merchant's bank. Accepts money for purchases. Is liable for charges made by the merchant if it does not provide goods or services purchased. # Merchant: Sells goods and services and accepts credit, debit or prepaid cards as promise for payment. The issuing bank assumes the primary liability for the consumer's capacity to pay off debts they incur with their card. In the case of credit cards, this includes extending credit to make these purchases. In the case of debit cards, this includes debiting funds from bank accounts, such as checking accounts. In the case of credit cards, the issuing bank extends a line of credit to the consumer. Liability for non-payment is then shared by the issuing bank and the acquiring bank, according to rules established by the card association brand. Key Types of Risk for Issuing Banks There are a few main types of risk for issuing banks, primarily regarding whether approved transaction(s) will be paid for by a legitimate cardholder. # Account Fraud: This is when an account is opened by a fictional person or with a stolen identity. The cardholder makes many purchases, but then disappears without paying. # Transaction Fraudhttps://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/glossary/term-fraudulent- transaction.phptitle=Credit Card Glossary: Terms and Definitions: This is when a fraudulent charge is made to a legitimate account, such as with Credit Card Fraud via a stolen card number. With the rollout of EMV chip cards in the USA, much of this fraud has moved to online transactions. Since the cardholder is not responsible for fraudulent charges, the issuer is responsible to pay for the charges. # Credit Risk: when extending credit (or in the case of debit cards, overdraft privileges), an issuer must be able to assess the likelihood of being repaid the amount of credit extended. As such, credit limit assignment and payment delinquency forecasts are critical to their profitability.

It was a speech that was expected to be addressing some pricing concerns, based on the recent economic issues facing the country. Surprisingly, she revealed that it would be her final Parliament and turned the mode of the speech to addressing the love and respect she had for the country, her position, and the Members themselves. It is the second such speech for which Queen Elizabeth I was noted, the first, the Speech to the Troops at Tilbury, having been given to English forces in preparation for the Spanish Armada's expected invasion. The Golden Speech has been taken to mark a symbolic end of Elizabeth's reign, one which is widely considered one of the Golden Eras of England's history. Elizabeth died 16 months later in March 1603 and was succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, James I. Origin of the name The 'Golden' label was first coined in \\"a version of the speech printed near the end of the Puritan interregnum\\"Greenblatt, Stephen, and M. H. Abrams, eds.

It was to be reprinted time and time again up to the eighteenth century, whenever England was in danger, as the Golden Speech of Queen Elizabeth. Several versions survive, including a printed pamphlet which is thought to have been checked and corrected by Elizabeth herself.  The speech  A different account by the diarist, Hayward Townshend, who was among those kneeling before her that November afternoon in the Presence Chamber, is used in the text below. Mr Speaker... We have heard your declaration and perceive your care of our estate. I do assure you there is no prince that loves his subjects better, or whose love can countervail our love. There is no jewel, be it of never so rich a price, which I set before this jewel: I mean your love. For I do esteem it more than any treasure or riches; for that we know how to prize, but love and thanks I count invaluable. And, though God hath raised me high, yet this I count the glory of my Crown, that I have reigned with your loves. This makes me that I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over so thankful a people. Therefore, I have cause to wish nothing more than to content the subject and that is a duty which I owe. Neither do I desire to live longer days than I may see your prosperity and that is my only desire. And as I am that person still yet, under God, hath delivered you and so I trust by the almighty power of God that I shall be His instrument to preserve you from every peril, dishonour, shame, tyranny and oppression, partly by means of your intended helps which we take very acceptably because it manifesteth the largeness of your good loves and loyalties unto your sovereign. Of myself I must say this: I never was any greedy, scraping grasper, nor a strait fast- holding Prince, nor yet a waster. My heart was never set on any worldly goods. What you bestow on me, I will not hoard it up, but receive it to bestow on you again. Therefore, render unto them I beseech you Mr Speaker, such thanks as you imagine my heart yieldeth, but my tongue cannot express. Mr Speaker, I would wish you and the rest to stand up for I shall yet trouble you with longer speech. Mr Speaker, you give me thanks but I doubt me I have greater cause to give you thanks, than you me, and I charge you to thank them of the Lower House from me. For had I not received a knowledge from you, I might have fallen into the lapse of an error, only for lack of true information. Since I was Queen, yet did I never put my pen to any grant, but that upon pretext and semblance made unto me, it was both good and beneficial to the subject in general though a private profit to some of my ancient servants, who had deserved well at my hands. But the contrary being found by experience, I am exceedingly beholden to such subjects as would move the same at first. And I am not so simple to suppose but that there be some of the Lower House whom these grievances never touched. I think they spake out of zeal to their countries and not out of spleen or malevolent affection as being parties grieved. That my grants should be grievous to my people and oppressions to be privileged under colour of our patents, our kingly dignity shall not suffer it. Yea, when I heard it, I could give no rest unto my thoughts until I had reformed it. Shall they, think you, escape unpunished that have oppressed you, and have been respectless of their duty and regardless our honour? No, I assure you, Mr Speaker, were it not more for conscience' sake than for any glory or increase of love that I desire, these errors, troubles, vexations and oppressions done by these varlets and lewd persons not worthy of the name of subjects should not escape without condign punishment. But I perceive they dealt with me like physicians who, ministering a drug, make it more acceptable by giving it a good aromatical savour, or when they give pills do gild them all over. I have ever used to set the Last Judgement Day before mine eyes and so to rule as I shall be judged to answer before a higher judge, and now if my kingly bounties have been abused and my grants turned to the hurt of my people contrary to my will and meaning, and if any in authority under me have neglected or perverted what I have committed to them, I hope God will not lay their culps and offenses in my charge. I know the title of a King is a glorious title, but assure yourself that the shining glory of princely authority hath not so dazzled the eyes of our understanding, but that we well know and remember that we also are to yield an account of our actions before the great judge. To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it. For myself I was never so much enticed with the glorious name of a King or royal authority of a Queen as delighted that God hath made me his instrument to maintain his truth and glory and to defend his kingdom as I said from peril, dishonour, tyranny and oppression. There will never Queen sit in my seat with more zeal to my country, care to my subjects and that will sooner with willingness venture her life for your good and safety than myself. For it is my desire to live nor reign no longer than my life and reign shall be for your good. And though you have had, and may have, many princes more mighty and wise sitting in this seat, yet you never had nor shall have, any that will be more careful and loving. For I, oh Lord, what am I, whom practices and perils past should not fear? Or what can I do? That I should speak for any glory, God forbid.' And turning to the Speaker and her councilors she said, 'And I pray to you Mr Comptroller, Mr Secretary and you of my Council, that before these gentlemen go into their countries, you bring them all to kiss my hand.

Acrylics differ from oil paints in that they have shorter drying times (as little as 10 minutes) and are soluble in water. These types of paint eliminate the need for turpentine and gesso, and can be applied directly onto canvas. Aside from painting with concentrated color paints, acrylics can also be watered down to a consistency that can be poured or used for glazes. Preventing paint from drying out Acrylics are often preferred because they dry faster on canvas than oil paints due to their polymer base. However, in some circumstances, the artist may want the paint to stay moist longer. A trick to keep paints from drying out is to spray a light mist of water over them occasionally. Moisture-retaining palettes also increase acrylic paint drying time, and can be substituted with a shallow container, a sheet of grease proof paper, or piece of wet watercolor paper. Creating fluid paints Fluid paints can be used like watercolors, or for glazing and washes. To create a more fluid texture, water is added to the paint. The ratio of paint to water depends on how thick the glaze is expected to be. An opaque glaze or paint consists of more paint than water, and will give a more solid color. A translucent glaze or paint will be the opposite, consisting of slightly more water than the opaque version, and will have a smoother texture. Translucent glazes show more of the colors underneath the paint compared to opaque glazes. Artist Keri Ippolito advises that the paint should be watered no more than 50 percent or the paint will not stick to the canvas. After mixing the paints, allow time for the air bubbles to rise to the surface. This will be crucial in many techniques, especially in pouring paints. Fluid paint, in general, is a moveable form of acrylic paint. There are many different techniques one can use when creating a fluid painting. However, the pouring technique discussed below is a good one for beginners and experienced painters. To start, elevate the canvas to where it's flat and easy to pick up and move around, I typically place 4 cups in each corner of the canvas. Once the canvas is set up, grab a cup, and choose as many or as few colors as desired. Start by filling the cup up with about one inch of a base color, such as white. Once the base color is at the bottom of the cup, then begin layering the other chosen colors. Once you are satisfied with the colorful cup of paint, swiftly overturn the cup onto the top of the canvas, without releasing any paint from the cup. Then, when ready, lift the cup and release the paint and once the cup is empty and there is a puddle of paint on the canvas, carefully lift the canvas and move it around until you reach the desired look. Warning, this pouring technique is extremely messy so make sure you are in a well-covered area. Painting glazes Acrylic paint glazes are often used to create more depth in an image. When glaze medium is applied to acrylic paint, the paint becomes more transparent and will reveal the layer of paint used beneath it, which modifies the color. This technique is commonly used to create more realistic images. Light colored glazes also have softening effects when painted over dark or bright images. Artists can mix glazes themselves, or can buy pre-mixed acrylic glazes. It is best to wait for each layer to dry thoroughly before applying another coat. This will prevent the paint from smearing or leaving unwanted smudge marks. After the application of several layers, rubbing alcohol can be brushed or sprayed on to reveal colors from earlier layers. Pouring paints This painting was made by combining poured acrylic paint with impasto painting. Pour painting is an innovative way to use acrylic paints to create an art piece. Instead of using tools like brushes or knives to create a piece of art, fluid paints can be poured directly onto the surface and the canvas tilted to move the paint around. Pouring paints allows for the colors to blend naturally as they come in contact with each other. This technique can be done either one color at a time, or with multiple paints to maximize color blending. Pour painting can also be done with oil paints, but because those paints take a longer time to dry, the piece would have to be done over an extended period of time, or with wet paints. However, the subtle effects of the interaction of different liquid colors on drying can be partially lost during the drying process.

It travels north‚Äìsouth along the Columbia River for , connecting SR 24 at the Vernita Bridge to SR 26 near Vantage. The highway travels through a predominantly rural and desert area, serving two hydroelectric dams and the communities of Desert Aire, Mattawa, and Beverly. The highway was established as a branch of Secondary State Highway 7C (SSH 7C) in 1957, to be built uphill from the reservoir of the new Priest Rapids Dam. Construction was completed in the early 1960s and it was re-designated as SR 243 during the 1964 state highway renumbering. Route description SR 243 begins at a junction with SR 24 at the north end of the Vernita Bridge, located in the Hanford Reach National Monument. Traffic continuing on SR 24 towards Othello is forced to turn east, while the highway continues northwest as SR 243\\\\. The highway turns west and follows the Columbia River upstream, passing a public boat launch and a campground within the Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge. As the terrain transitions from brushland and sand dunes to irrigated farmland, SR 243 turns northwest and passes the Priest Rapids Dam and Wanapum Heritage Center at the south end of Desert Aire, a resort town with its own golf course and public airport. The highway continues north through the vineyards of the western Wahluke Slope and passes a roundabout at the west end of Mattawa. North of Mattawa, the bluffs of the Saddle Mountains cause the river and its valley to narrow, leaving SR 243 to run directly on the eastern bank as it traverses the Sentinel Gap. Near Beverly, the highway passes under the Beverly Railroad Bridge, which carries the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail, and moves away from the river bank to serve Wanapum Village near the Wanapum Dam. SR 243 continues north across the hills overlooking the dam's reservoir, passing through several rock cuts near the Sand Hollow Recreation Area, and descends to an intersection with SR 26, where the highway terminates. The junction is located south of an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90) at the east end of the Vantage Bridge, where SR 26 itself terminates. The highway is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of traffic volume on state routes, expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average vehicle counts on SR 243 measured in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 2,800 vehicles near Beverly to a maximum of 4,600 vehicles between Desert Aire and Mattawa. History A road following the un-dammed Columbia River from the Priest Rapids to Vantage was built by the early 1910s, roughly along the path of modern SR 243. The state legislature authorized construction of a new state highway between Vantage and the Vernita ferry in 1957 and designated it as a branch of Secondary State Highway 7C (SSH 7C). The highway was created to serve the under-construction Priest Rapids and Wanapum dams, the former of which would inundate a section of the old road with its new reservoir. Construction on the highway began later in the year and was completed in the early 1960s, shortly before the opening of the Vernita Bridge at its southern terminus with SSH 11A. During 1964 state highway renumbering, the Priest Rapids branch of SSH 7C was re- designated as SR 243, while the main route became SR 26. The intersection with Road 24, a county road that serves as the main entry to Mattawa, had been the site of several major and fatal collisions in the late 2000s, prompting WSDOT to propose construction of a roundabout. The $1.25 million roundabout was the first to be built in a rural area and was subject to opposition from local residents. After it was completed in 2014, the opposing residents apologized for their stance on the project, having adjusted to the change.

He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 279 matches and 97 goals during ten seasons, mainly with Benfica (five years, three major titles won). Football career Born in Linhares, Esp√≠rito Santo, Isa√≠as started his career with Fluminense FC, where he had an unassuming spell. He then represented Friburguense Atl√©tico Clube and Associa√ß√£o Desportiva Cabofriense, and moved to Portugal in 1987, gradually moving up the ranks: first with Rio Ave F.C. then Boavista FC, arriving at S.L. Benfica in 1990. With Benfica, he quickly became a fan favourite at the Est√°dio da Luz, being also referred to as a \\"force of nature\\" due to his stamina and combativeness ‚Äì he also scored regularly, being the owner of a powerful long-range shot. Arguably his greatest moment with the Lisbon side came on 6 November 1991, in the last round prior to the group stage of the season's European Cup: against Arsenal, at Highbury Park, he assisted once and netted twice in a 3‚Äì1 win (4‚Äì2 aggregate success). Sporting coach Bobby Robson found him to be the most impressive player in the Portuguese league. However, Isa√≠as would be left out of the Benfica squad in 1995 by coach Artur Jorge, who was proceeding to a team reshuffle that would result in the darkest period in the club's history ‚Äì at that time, the veteran was still one of the squad's most influential players and top scorers. Subsequently, Isa√≠as moved to England with Coventry City for ¬£500.000, signing a two-year contract and becoming the first Brazilian to ever play in the Premier League. He featured in just 14 competitive matches for the Sky Blues over a period of two seasons, due to differences with manager Gordon Strachan and his refusal to cancel his contract after no compensation would be paid. Isa√≠as scored twice during his time for Coventry in games against Chelsea and Middlesbrough. In 1997, aged nearly 34, Isa√≠as returned to Portugal with S.C. Campomaiorense, reaching the final of the Ta√ßa de Portugal in 1999. He retired in his country at almost 40 with Cabofriense, then appeared in a few games with the Portuguese beach soccer team courtesy of his previously obtained citizenship.

The battle began when an American squadron under Stephen Decatur attacked and captured an Algerine brig. Background After capturing the Algerine flagship Meshuda and sending her to Cartagena under the escort of USS Macedonian, Stephen Decatur and his squadron continued on their way towards Algiers. On June 19, 1815, they sighted the 22-gun Algerine brig Estedio.  Battle  Decatur began pursuit of Estedio and chased her into shoal waters near the coast of Spain off Cape Palos. Fearing that his larger vessels might get beached, he sent the smaller vessels in his squadron the USS Epervier, USS Spark, USS Torch, and USS Spitfire to deal with the brig. Here the vessels fought a short engagement lasting a half an hour before the Algerines began to abandon their vessel and surrender. As Estedios crew members began to flee towards the cape in her boats, the American vessels began firing upon the boats, sinking one. The surviving 80 crew of Estedio surrendered. Besides the 80 captured, Estedio lost at least 23 men killed. Aftermath After the battle a prize crew took Estedio to Cartagena, where Spanish authorities interned her. They returned her to Algiers at the end of the war, but then on 18 July 1815 the Algerines declared war on Spain so the Spanish government seized both her and the frigate Mashouda, which Decatur had also captured, at Cartagena.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4997.

C. Beaton (Marion Chesney), first published in 1985. It is set in the fictional town of Lochdubh, Scotland and is the first novel of a series featuring the local constable Hamish Macbeth.  Plot  Eight people of varied background meet in the fictional village of Lochdubh in Northern Scotland. They attend the Lochdubh School of Casting : Salmon and Trout Fishing, owned and operated by John Cartwright and his wife Heather. What should be a relaxing holiday amid glorious Highland lochs and mountains becomes a misery. One of the party, Lady Jane Withers, a society widow and notorious gossip columnist, upsets everyone with her snobbishness, sharp tongue and rudeness. Lady Jane soon learns that each of her fellow guests has a secret in their past that they would prefer to remain unknown. When her Ladyship is found dead in Keeper's Pool, no-one is surprised and everyone is relieved. Hamish Macbeth, Lochdubh's local policeman, has to search for a murderer amongst the many suspects. No-one is willing to talk. With the assistance of Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, the love of his life, Hamish solves the mystery in his usual unorthodox style. Hamish's success does not endear him to Chief Inspector Blair, a senior detective from the nearby fictional town of Strathbane.

A squadron of vessels, under the command of Stephen Decatur, Jr., met and engaged the flagship of the Algerine Navy, the frigate Meshuda under Admiral Hamidou. After a sharp action, Decatur's squadron was able to capture the Algerine frigate and win a decisive victory over the Algerines.Panzac, 2005 pp.270-271 Background Stephen Decatur's squadron had left New York on May 20, 1815, with orders to destroy Algerine vessels and bring the Dey of Algiers to terms for attacking American shipping. He reached the Strait of Gibraltar on June 15, 1815 and began his mission. After learning that several Algerine cruisers had crossed the Strait of Gibraltar shortly before he did, Commodore Stephen Decatur, Jr. decided to give them chase and cut them off before they could reach Algiers. Battle Commanding a fleet of nine vessels, he encountered the Algerine flagship Mashouda (also spelled 'Mashuda' or 'Meshuda') of forty- six guns off Cape Gata, Spain. Being heavily outnumbered the admiral, Rais Hamidou, decided to try to flee to the port of Algiers, but was overtaken by the American squadron. After receiving damage from the and the admiral himself being wounded, the Algerines instead decided to change course and try for the safety of a neutral port along the Spanish coast. The Constellation and the sloop were able to close in and hammer the Algerine frigate. The Algerines resorted to replying with musket fire at close range, but Decatur was able to get his flagship, the , alongside the Algerine frigate. Firing a devastating broadside, the Guerriere crippled the enemy and killed the Algerine admiral. Decatur ceased firing, expecting the Algerine ship to surrender. Instead the Algerines continued to fight hopelessly with muskets as long as they were able. As a result, Decatur had the sloop fire nine broadsides into the Meshuda with disastrous effect. The bloodied Algerines then struck their colors and ended the battle.London, 2005, Chapter XI Aftermath Four hundred and six Algerines were captured, with most being wounded as well as thirty killed. The American losses were remarkably light, with only four dead and ten wounded (all on the Guerriere). Most of the American casualties were due to a gun explosion, but a few were due to enemy action. After sending the captured frigate off to Cartagena, Decatur continued to cruise towards Algiers. However, his squadron encountered another Algerine cruiser off Cape Palos. After engaging and capturing the cruiser Decatur was finally able to make it to Algiers. The loss of the Meshuda and Admiral Hamidou greatly weakened Algerine morale as well as their naval capabilities. Once the American squadron reached Algiers they met no further opposition and by a mere show of force were able to bring the Dey to terms, thus ending the war.

As of 2014, RUSVM began offering Master of Science and PhD degrees in public health, global animal health, conservation medicine, and other research areas supported by the school. The school is located in St. Kitts. Administrative offices are located in Downers Grove, IL. RUSVM is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education. RUSVM students come from all over the world, with most being citizens or permanent residents of the United States, who are eligible to apply for financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. As of 2019, RUSVM has graduated more than 5,500 veterinarians. RUSVM enrolls students three times per year: September, January and May. History RUSVM was founded in 1982 by entrepreneur Robert Ross, who also founded a separate institution, Ross University School of Medicine, in 1978. Ross had a friend whose son was unable to secure admission to medical schools in the United States, and founded Ross University to give him and others an opportunity to become doctors. In 2003, RUSVM was purchased by DeVry Education Group, which has since been renamed Adtalem Global Education. In 2014, RUSVM launched four research centers, to give students a research- informed learning experience and to expand RUSVM‚Äôs scientific research focus. Accreditation In 2011, RUSVM was accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (AVMA-COE)‚Äîthe Department of Education's accrediting body for veterinary education‚Äîeffectively validating the quality and breadth of the school‚Äôs program. RUSVM is also accredited by the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board Ministry of Education to confer the DVM to students who successfully complete the course of the program. The Ross University Veterinary Teaching Hospital has also received accreditation by the American Animal Hospital Association ‚Äì the first teaching hospital to achieve this status outside the U.S. and Canada. In July 2014, RUSVM received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board, effective for five years. The Postgraduate Studies program offers Master of Science (MSc) and Doctoral (PhD) degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM's themed Research Centers. Faculty RUSVM faculty have been recognized with awards for teaching and research In February 2013, the Association of American Veterinary Colleges (AAVMC) awarded the Distinguished Teacher Award‚Äîthe most prestigious national teaching award in veterinary medicine‚Äîto Mary Anna Thrall, DVM, a professor at RUSVM. In addition, many faculty are top researchers in their specific fields and disciplines. Academics The university‚Äôs DVM curriculum follows models used in U.S. veterinary schools. It covers seven semesters in St. Kitts, followed by a year of clinical education at one of the more than 20 AVMA-accredited veterinary schools in the United States or at the AVMA-accredited Atlantic Veterinary College in Canada. The preclinical program includes a series of \\"introduction to clinics\\" courses that provide small-group instruction and hands-on animal experience through community practice, ambulatory practice, or working with university-owned-and-maintained herds of cattle, horses, donkeys, and sheep. Research The school has established four Research Centers, each relevant to the concept of One Health in developing or tropical countries. The centers are: * The One Health Center for Zoonoses and Tropical Veterinary Medicine * The Center for Integrative Mammalian Research * The Center for Conservation Medicine and Ecosystem Health * The Center for Research and Innovation in Veterinary and Medical Education The faculty engage in research projects totaling $21 million from grant-awarding bodies, corporations, and governmental agencies. Faculty authored nearly 100 scientific papers in 2014. Approximately 400 RUSVM students participate in research projects annually, and a course on the principles of veterinary research has been added to the school‚Äôs curriculum. Internationalization In February 2012, RUSVM partnered with Moredun Research Institute to help generate collaborative scientific research opportunities, as well as training opportunities for research scientists and veterinary students. RUSVM has begun recruiting students in Singapore for international research internship programs.

Historic Illinois 28-2, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. During his term as governor, Altgeld expressed certain opinions on how buildings should be erected in the state of Illinois. In his second biennial message to the state legislature, he discussed how buildings were being constructed without consideration for their outward appearance. He stated that it was time for buildings to become more aesthetically pleasing in addition to being functional, and he suggested the \\"Tudor-Gothic style\\" as the most inexpensive way to do this. Consequently, several of the state universities in Illinois erected buildings which resembled castles in his honor. College folklore states that these buildings have aligned corridors and rooms so that they could all be ‚Äúput together‚Äù to create one large building, but there is no evidence to support this rumor. Southern Illinois University Carbondale Altgeld Hall, SIUC Altgeld Hall, built in 1896 at the cost of $40,000, is the oldest surviving building on the SIU campus. It originally housed the library and laboratories for the departments of physics, chemistry and biological science, and a gymnasium. Following a major remodeling project in 1958, Altgeld became the home to the School of Music, like at ISU. From 2002 until 2004, the building underwent a massive renovation, to preserve the building from the weather damage it had received. University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign The University of Illinois is home to Altgeld Hall, a castle-style building constructed under the order of Governor John Peter Altgeld. It was completed in 1897 by the architects Nathan Clifford Ricker and James White. Like the building on Illinois State University's campus, the Governor wished it to be built in a Tudor-Gothic style, but due to outside pressure it was given a more Richardsonian Romanesque style. The Board of Trustees initially adopted the classical design by prominent Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. Altgeld's opposition to the classical design ultimately caused Burnham's withdrawal from the project. Since its construction, Altgeld's building has undergone many names and purposes. Governor Altgeld had a huge interest in education and believed that the campus should have a library, so the building was originally used for this purpose. At the time of its construction the building became known as simply the University Library. In 1927, though, the Law Department decided it needed a new place on campus and it moved into University Library, renaming the building ‚ÄúLaw Building.‚Äù In 1940, the Law Building was renamed in honor of its creator, and was thereafter called Altgeld Hall. Eventually the Law Building was yet again converted into a new purpose, housing the Mathematics Department while the Law Department received a new building. Though the Mathematics Department and the Mathematics Library reside in this building, one can still see the title ‚ÄúLaw Building‚Äù engraved on the North entrance. Illinois State University Cook Hall, ISU On the campus of Illinois State University, Governor John Peter Altgeld ordered the construction of a castle-like building. This building, now known as John W. Cook Hall, was once known as ‚ÄúAltgeld‚Äôs Folly.‚Äù This is because when the original plans were drawn up for the construction of the building, Governor Altgeld rejected them because he wanted a building that looked more like German castles along the Rhine river. In 1898 the building was completed by local architects, Miller & Fisher, who took some creative liberties in the castle's construction. Though the building contains turret styles with towers and battlement like Governor Altgeld wanted, the architects also added their own flair by using Bedford limestone. In the design for the building, it was made to be fireproof, which is why the University decided to move the library into it. The building was also originally used as a gymnasium and it was stocked with all the newest exercise equipment. It had rope ladders, rings, slippery poles, parallel bars, and weights. There were also plans to add a bowling alley and swimming pool, but these plans were eventually abandoned. After being a gymnasium for so long, the building eventually came to also house the University radio station, WGLT. More recently, though, Cook Hall has been remodeled to become the School of Music building. The building holds practice rooms, rehearsal halls, and many classrooms. Cook Hall is the only building on the Illinois State University campus that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Northern Illinois University Altgeld Hall, NIU Built between 1895 and 1899, Altgeld Hall was originally called the \\"Castle on the Hill.\\" Northern began as a teachers' college and originally was named Dekalb, and then the Northern Illinois State Normal School. The building architect was Charles E. Brush of Chicago. The general contractor was William J. McAlpine. Construction started on September 17, 1895, and was completed on September 22, 1899, at a cost of $230,000. On October 21, 1963, the Administrative Building as it was known, was changed to Altgeld Hall in honor of the late Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld, who backed and signed the legislation creating NIU. It was built in Tudor Gothic or English-castle architecture because Governor Altgeld had an eye for architecture and wanted a stately building to unify the state normal schools. The building is among the most recognizable on the respective campus. This is a building that was meant to stand alone, which was a contrast to most college buildings of the time. When Altgeld Hall first opened, it housed the entire university. It was classroom, boardroom, library, gymnasium, administrative office building, and lecture hall. It housed chemical and physical laboratories, executive offices, a 1,200 seat auditorium, biology labs, a study hall, a museum, classrooms, a manual training shop, an independent water system, and finally a \\"dynamo\\" for light and power. The building also housed NIU's original library . With NIU's second library almost complete in Swen Parson Hall in 1952, ideas were being passed around among the administrators on how to move all of the books because there was no money left in the budget to pay to have them moved. President Leslie A. Holmes, the President's Panel, the Student Affairs Committee, and the Administrative Council made the final decision to have \\"Library Move Day\\" be a campus event. Holmes sent a memo out to faculty indicating they were to take roll in their classes and then lead the class over to old library in Altgeld and devote all class period to moving books to the new library in Swen Parson. The members of the Dames‚Äô Club (now the University Women's Club) served refreshments for the book movers. Altgeld Hall underwent a $24 million renovation project which began in 1999 and ended with the rededication on October 7, 2004. The Altgeld restoration was undertaken to rescue the university's landmark structure, which was badly deteriorated. The interior of the building was remodeled several times over the years, but major structural problems went largely unaddressed. By the 1980s, the building suffered from water seepage, cracked plaster and badly outdated electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems. The newly restored building is a point of pride on campus, both for its beauty and the sense of history it affords, according to NIU President John Peters. ‚ÄúThe restoration of Altgeld Hall was an important step for NIU. It is a physical connection with our very roots as a university and we are proud to see the project recognized by the construction industry.‚Äù said Peters. ‚ÄúAltgeld Hall is not a museum, but a living, working public space where the roots of American higher education are still very much in view.‚Äù Currently, Altgeld Hall houses the Office of the President, Academic and Student Affairs, Finance and Facilities, University Advancement & NIU Foundation, University Legal Services, University Council, Community and External Affairs, the NIU Art Museum, the Instructional Technology Teaching Laboratory, conference rooms, and an auditorium with seating capacity for 500. A time capsule was buried under the front arches on NIU's 75th Anniversary in 1974. It will be opened on the 150th anniversary in 2049. Eastern Illinois University Old Main, EIU Old Main, formally named the Livingston C. Lord Administration Building, was completed in 1899. It was the first building constructed for the university, which was founded in 1895. Old Main was built with Indiana limestone with a Gothic revival style with turrets, towers, and battlements.

It is an active aid to navigation.Interactive map on Michigan lighthouses, Detroit News. History To help navigation towards ore docks, Congress approved funds to build the Marquette Harbor Light in 1850.Roach, Jerry, Lighthouse Central, Marquette Harbor light The Ultimate Guide to Upper Michigan Lighthouses (Publisher: Bugs Publishing LLC - 2007). . Construction took place in 1852, and first lit in June 1853. However, the initial structure deteriorated rapidly, and funds were approved in 1865 for a replacement tower. In 1875, the Army Corps of Engineers built a breakwater to reduce the force of wind and waves in Marquette Harbor. A strong storm destroyed the original light in 1889. The new light sits on a concrete crib at the southernmost end of the breakwater wall. The original lighthouse included seven Lewis lamps, and a small detached dwelling constructed of similar materials to that of the tower. In 1853, the United States Lighthouse Board was created and a major system upgrade brought on an installation of a Sixth Order French Fresnel lens in 1856. The new lens was visible up to . Because of weather conditions, installation, maintenance and operation of a foghorn was integral to the operation. In July, 1899 the lighthouse was electrified under direction of Thomas Miller. The current lens is a DCB-36 Aerobeacon. Putting aside questions of nostalgia, aesthetics, or appreciation for the engineering of a bygone era (as exemplified by the Fresnel lens), this iteration of lighthouse illumination is itself incredibly effective, and an endangered remnant of another bygone era. Marquette Harbor Light Construction of the current structure began in 1865. The 1-story dwelling shares its design with the lighthouses on Granite Island, Gull Rock and Huron Island. It includes a set of cast-iron spiral stairs winding from the first floor to the lantern centered on the square gallery atop the tower, a decagonal cast-iron lantern was installed, and a new fixed white Fourth Order Fresnel lens with a 190¬∞ arc of visibility was assembled atop its cast-iron pedestal. The focal plane is at above the lake, and was visible for a distance of 10 nautical miles in clear weather.National Park Service Inventory of Historic Light Stations: Michigan Lighthouses, Maritime Heritage Program. Pictures before and after the dwelling modifications are available. A second story was added in 1910. The tower is attached to a schoolhouse style lighthouse keeper's residence. The area had three fog signals, the louder being in the fog signal building and one in each breakwater. Each had its own distinct tone.Lighthouse Memories: Marquette Harbor Light (December, 1999) Lighthouse Digest. The site was considered to be difficult and staffing was a problem. By 1882, after 29 years in operation, ten keepers had either been removed or resigned from service at Marquette. In 1891, a station of the U.S. Life-Saving Service began operations on the lighthouse grounds, with the station located to the west of the lighthouse, which in 1915 became part of the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1939 the U.S. Lighthouse Service also merged under the control of the U.S. Coast Guard, placing all facilities on the grounds under the same government control. As part of the U.S. Coast Guard, the site became a training station during World War II with up to 300 recruits living in the various buildings on the facility grounds. The adjacent Coast Guard station is still active. The original 4¬∞ Fresnel lens was transferred to Marquette Breakwater Outer Light in 1908 and is now also on display at the museum. Current status thumb In April 1983, the Coast Guard demolished the fog signal building, leaving only the foundation. This light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was also included on the state inventory in 1969. In 2002, a 30-year lease was signed by the Marquette Maritime Museum, which is responsible for maintenance and control of the facility. As part of their operations, they made the lighthouse available for scheduled tours.

The highway begins at a y-intersection with SR 27 in the northern outskirts of Oakesdale north to an interchange with U.S. Route 195 (US 195) southeast of Rosalia. The highway listed as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway. Route description SR 271 begins at a y-interchange with SR 27 in north Oakesdale, traveling northwest past the Oakesdale Cemetery. The highway traverses rolling wheat fields through rural Whitman County, crossing over McCoy and Pine Creeks. The highway parallels a single track, to the west of the highway, belonging to the Washington and Idaho Railway, crossing over the line roughly half way to Rosalia. The rail line continues to parallel the highway after crossing it, just on the opposite side of the highway. SR 271 terminates at an interchange with US 195 southeast of Rosalia, however the roadway continues into the town as a county-maintained road. The entirety of the route has been named as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that between 650 and 740 cars travel along the highway on an average day. History The rail line, originally belonging to the Northern Pacific Railway predates the road, and was in place since at least 1903.

The station's studio and transmitter is located at the fourth floor of Perpetual Succor Bldg.(Encanto Bldg.), Jalandoni Street in Iloilo City. It broadcasts daily from 5:00 AM to 12:00 MN. History The station was put-up by Amcara Broadcasting Network after Iloilo's Alternative Radio DYMC Magic 91.1 FM (now MOR 91.1) in 1992. After Amcara Broadcasting Network was bought by ABS-CBN in 1995, the station ceased its broadcast. UMBN acquired the station frequency 92.7 in 1997 and changed its call sign to DYWT. In April 2011, it was approved by NTC to move to Iloilo City as UMBN initially applied. In May 2011, it was formally launched in Iloilo City with a power of 3,000 watts and license to broadcast up to 10,000 watts. The transmitter is poor in grounding and had a lot of scattered frequency around the said frequency broadcast band within 300‚Äì500 meters away from the transmitter site in Jalandoni Street (near San Agustin Gym where Z100 and DYSA-AM was located before), Iloilo City. In September 2016, Wild FM moved its frequency to 105.9 for better signal reception. On April 8, 2017 at 12:55 am the station was damaged by a fire started beside the station studio in the 4th floor of Perpetual Succor Bldg.(Encanto Bldg.), Jalandoni Street, Iloilo City Proper. The station's transmitter was believed to have been damaged by heat from the fire and water damage due to fire fighters' work to save the building at the 5th floor above the station's studio. It was declared by BFP (Bureau of Fire Prevention) fire out around an hour past 2am. A few days later after the fire incident, the station resumed its broadcast.

This standard is intended to supplement JIS X 0208 (Code page 952). It is numbered 953 or 5049 as an IBM code page (see below). It is one of the source standards for Unicode's CJK Unified Ideographs. History In 1990 the Japanese Standards Association (JSA) released a supplementary character set standard: . This standard was intended to build upon the range of characters available in the main JIS X 0208 character set, and to address shortcomings in the coverage of that set. Features Euler diagram comparing repertoires of JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212, JIS X 0213, Windows-31J, the Microsoft standard repertoire and Unicode. The standard specified 6,067 characters, comprising: * 21 Greek characters with diacritics * 26 Eastern European characters with diacritics (mostly Cyrillic) * 198 alphabetic characters with diacritics * 5,801 kanji Encodings The following encodings or encapsulations are used to enable JIS X 0212 characters to be used in files, etc. * in EUC-JP characters are represented by three bytes, the first being 0x8F, the following two in the range 0xA1 ‚Äì 0xFE. * in ISO 2022 the sequence \\"ESC $ ( D\\" is used to indicate JIS X 0212 characters. No encapsulation of JIS X 0212 characters in the popular Shift JIS encoding is possible, as Shift JIS does not have sufficient unallocated code space for the characters. Implementations JIS X 0212 is called Code page 953 by IBM, which includes vendor extensions. The alternative CCSID 5049 excludes these extensions. As JIS X 0212 characters cannot be encoded in Shift JIS, the coding system which has traditionally dominated Japanese information processing, few practical implementations of the character set have taken place. As mentioned above, it can be encoded in EUC- JP, which is commonly used in Unix/Linux systems, and it is here that most implementations have occurred: * in the early 1990s basic \\"BDF\\" fonts were compiled for use in the Unix X Window System; * an IME conversion file was compiled for the WNN system; * the kterm console window application was extended to support it; * the Emacs and jstevie editors were extended to support it. Many WWW browsers such as the Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox family, Opera, etc. and related applications such as Mozilla Thunderbird support the display of JIS X 0212 characters in EUC-JP encoding, however Internet Explorer has no support for JIS X 0212 characters. Modern terminal emulation packages, such as the GNOME Terminal also support JIS X 0212 characters. Applications which support JIS X 0212 in the EUC coding include: * the xjdic dictionary program for Unix/Linux; * the WWWJDIC Japanese dictionary server (however as Internet Explorer does not support the JIS X 0212 extensions in EUC, this server sends bit-mapped graphics for these characters when set in EUC-JP mode.) JIS X 0212 and Unicode The kanji in JIS X 0212 were taken as one of the sources for the Han unification which led to the unified set of CJK characters in the initial ISO 10646/Unicode standard. All the 5,801 kanji were incorporated. The future Apart from the applications mentioned above, the JIS X 0212 standard is effectively dead. 2,743 kanji from it were included in the later JIS X 0213 standard. In the longer term, its contribution will probably be seen to be the 5,801 kanji which were incorporated in Unicode.

Education Carroll earned his BS (1985) in physics from NC State University (Raleigh, NC) and his PhD (1993) in physics from Wesleyan University in (Middletown, CT) with Dr. Dale Doering (thesis advisor). Carroll's thesis examined the thermodynamics of charged defects in complex oxide materials. As a postdoctoral associate for Professor Dawn Bonnell at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), Carroll worked on the application of scanning probes to size and dimension related phenomena in oxide supported metal nanoclusters. From there Carroll became a research associate at the Max- Planck-Insitut f√ºr Metallforschung (MPI) in Stuttgart, Germany under the direction of Professor Manfred R√ºhle. His primary research was on nanoscale phenomena at metal-ceramic interfaces using a combination of microscopy techniques. At the MPI Carroll first began working with carbon nanotubes and their variants. Specifically, Carroll was the first to identify the signature for one-dimensional behavior in multiwalled nanotubes (the so-called van Hove Singularities) as well as the signatures for defect states for those systems. This work helped to open the door to the use of scanning probe spectroscopies in understanding the electronics of low-dimensional systems.D.L. Carroll, P. Kinlen, S. Raman, P. Redlich, M. R√ºhle, X.

In 1997, Carroll moved to Clemson University (SC) as an assistant professor where he received early promotion and tenure in the department of physics. While at Clemson he established a program in organic devices based upon carbon nanotube nanocomposites demonstrating enhanced lifetime and performance in organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) for the first time. This work was among the first to establish that nanotube-based nanocomposite systems could be used to enhance a variety of organic device performance metrics. In 2003, Carroll's group moved to Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC to establish the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials. With this move the research team expanded its work into biomedical nanotechnologies and continued to push the state-of-the-art in performance of organic electronics, announcing the development of highly efficient lighting devices based on field activation of polymers (FIPELs) and fabrics that generate power from body heat in recent years. Carroll's team at the NanoCenter at Wake Forest University was among the first to realize morphology control in organics through the use of heating or multiple solvents setting the world record for the highest efficiency organic solar cells at the time. Since becoming faculty, Carroll has published over 240 articles in scholarly journals (h-index = 40). He has published 1 textbook: \\"One Dimensional Metals\\" and edited two books on nanoelectronics. He holds 44 patents with numerous patent filings. Carroll is a frequent speaker at international conferences with more than 150 invited talks in the past few years.

After developing the additional capacity to offer welding services, it pursued research and technology specifically related to the welding of stainless steel. In 1929, the company reorganized as Fleetwings, Inc., in Garden City, NY, to develop stainless-steel aircraft structures. The company progressed to manufacturing components for other aircraft manufacturers, including ribs and control surfaces for the Ireland \\"Privateer\\" amphibian, and ribs, flaps and tail surfaces for Grover Loening Aircraft Company, and moved to a larger location in a hangar on lower Roosevelt Field, Long Island. In 1934, it purchased the former Keystone Aircraft facility on the Delaware River in Bristol, PA, and moved its operations there. The corporate structure of Fleetwings, Inc., was dominated by the de Ganahl family. In the mid-1930s, its board of directors included Carl de Ganahl, Charles F. de Ganahl, Chloe de Ganahl, Joe de Ganahl and Frank de Ganahl.

The lake is hypertrophic, leading to eutrophication with corresponding poor water quality. This decline in water quality has been known since the early 1900s. So far, attempts of opening up the lake to the ocean to rectify the problem have had limited success. In 2016, after a spell of dry weather, the water quality deteriorated and recurring algal blooms made the water toxic. Animals, including pets and sheep, died after drinking the water.

He is best known for giving up Derek Jeter's final hit at Yankees Stadium. He has played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles in Major League Baseball (MLB) and was selected to one All-Star Game. Meek has also played for the Kia Tigers of the KBO League. Amateur career Meek attended Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington. Afterwards, he played for Midland College in Midland, Texas. Then he transferred at semester to play at Bellevue Community College also in Washington. Thebaseballcube.com Pro career =Minnesota Twins= After being selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 2002 Major League Baseball draft, Meek began playing for the Twins affiliate in the Appalachian League, the Elizabethton Twins. In 2004, Meek played for Elizabethton and the Quad Cities River Bandits. Meek started the 2005 season with the Beloit Snappers. Meek was released by the Twins in June 2005. =San Diego Padres= Meek signed with the San Diego Padres in September 2005. He started the 2006 season with the Lake Elsinore Storm. In August 2006, Meek and a player to be named later, (Dale Thayer), were traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Russell Branyan. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Meek finished the 2006 season with the Visalia Oaks. He pitched the 2007 season for the Montgomery Biscuits. =Pittsburgh Pirates= In the 2007 Rule 5 draft, Meek was selected from the Devil Rays by the Pittsburgh Pirates. This required that Meek remain on the active roster of the Pirates for the entire 2008 season or else the Pirates would have to offer him back to the Devil Rays for half the amount they paid to acquire him.Pirates Make Room For Rule 5 Draft Pick Meek By Releasing Castillo. Meek made his major league debut on April 2, 2008 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He would record his first career loss in extra innings against the Chicago Cubs on April 7, 2008. Meek made nine relief appearances, going 0‚Äì1 with a 6.92 ERA, before being designated for assignment on May 4, 2008. He was offered back per Rule 5 guidelines on May 14. The Pirates paid cash to keep him and sent him down to their minor league teams. After pitching 9 games with the Double-A Altoona Curve, Meek was promoted to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Pittsburgh Pirates in 2009 Meek spent the 2009 season in the bullpen with the Pirates. He finished the season with a 1‚Äì1 record in 41 appearances, had a 3.45 ERA, gave up 2 home runs, 0 hit batsmen, 29 walks, 42 strikeouts, a .209 average against, and a 1.34 WHIP, in 47.0 innings pitched. The 2010 season was Meek's first full season in the Majors. He was often asked by manager John Russell to pitch multiple innings in relief. Meek's performance rivaled other excellent closers like Joakim Soria and Brian Wilson despite not being one himself. Early in the season when Dotel had given up runs in six straight games as the closer, Meek had an opportunity in the role and earned his first Major League save on April 29, 2010 to close out a 2‚Äì0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On May 14, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Meek entered the game in the 6th inning with the score tied 6‚Äì6, and he pitched two scoreless innings of relief, striking out four of the seven Cubs hitters he faced including Derrek Lee, Xavier Nady and Alfonso Soriano in the bottom of the 7th. The Pirates rallied behind his strong pitching to win the game 10‚Äì6. Meek delivered one of his finest performances of the season against the Washington Nationals on June 10, 2010, coming in to relieve Pirates starter Zach Duke with the bases loaded and no outs. He quickly forced Willie Harris to line into a double play before retiring Cristian Guzm√°n, needing only six pitches to get out of the inning with no runs in. Due to his excellent work, he was named to the 2010 MLB All Star Game. At the time of his selection on July 4, 2010, Meek carried a 4‚Äì2 record with a 0.96 ERA, a mark that lead all National League relievers. \\"It's surprising\\", Meek said. \\"A lot of starters and closers go to the game. I've always said there are a lot of great middle relievers out there who deserve to go to the game. I think they're overlooked a little bit. It's amazing to be selected, an overwhelming feeling.\\" Meek was the first Pirate reliever selected who was not a closer since Mace Brown in 1938 ‚Äì before the closer position emerged. The Pirates celebrated his nomination at PNC Park with an 8‚Äì5 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies, a game where Meek was the winning pitcher. On August 3, 2010, Meek recorded his first career base hit, off fellow reliever Jordan Smith of the Cincinnati Reds. Meek finished the 2010 season with a 2.14 ERA, 70 strikeouts, 4 saves, 15 holds, and a 5‚Äì4 record, all career-highs. After several injuries in 2011, Meek saw a decrease in fastball velocity. Meek started the 2012 season with Pittsburgh, but on May 1, Meek was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis. Meek was 0-0 with a 5.59 ERA in 9 games with a .293 opposing batting average. He was recalled to the Pirates on July 21, 2012, after an injury to reliever Juan Cruz. But was sent back down on July 26, to make room for highly anticipated prospect Starling Mart√©. Meek was designated for assignment by the Pirates on September 10, 2012. In October 2012, Meek elected minor league free agency. =Texas Rangers= Meek spent the 2013 season in the Texas Rangers organization with the Triple-A Round Rock Express. =Baltimore Orioles= Meek signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles in February 2014.

Instead, the next day Meek was optioned back to Norfolk. On May 28, he was assigned outright to Norfolk. On September 25, 2014, Meek gave up a walk-off single to New York Yankees all-star Derek Jeter in Jeter's final game at Yankee Stadium.https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/09/25/derek-jeter-walk-single- final-home-bat-winner =Washington Nationals= Meek signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on January 21, 2015.Nationals, Evan Meek Agree To Minor League Deal =Kia Tigers= On July 20, 2015, the Kia Tigers of the Korea Baseball Organization announced that they had signed Meek to a one-year deal worth $150,000. Meek filled a roster vacancy created by the club's release of former MLB pitcher Philip Humber on the same day. =Somerset Patriots= On May 5, 2016, Meek signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was released on July 20, 2016. =Lancaster Barnstormers= On July 26, 2016, Meek signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent after the 2016 season. Scouting report Meek's four- seam fastball normally sits around 95 mph, although he is capable of reaching 97‚Äì98 mph on occasion. It is his primary pitch, throwing it slightly over half the time. Despite missing the final two months of the 2009 Major League Baseball season, he added 8 pounds of muscle during the off-season and promised that he would be able to hit 100 mph in 2010. Since his command has improved throughout his career ‚Äì 5.55 walks per 9 innings in 2009 to around 2.10 in 2010 ‚Äì opposing batters have shown more willingness to chase the pitch, even out of the strike zone to due his ability throw his other pitches for strikes. However, after several injuries in 2011, Meek saw his fastball velocity decrease into the low to mid 90s, ranging from 90-95 mph. Meek's curveball is his primary off-speed pitch, with the velocity sitting around 79‚Äì82 mph. Meek throws a cutter that was rated in August 2009 as the 3rd most effective cutter in Major League Baseball because of its runs above the MLB average. The pitch has \\"unfair biting\\" movement, even against left-handed batters, according to Dejan Kovacevic of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Average velocity is 92‚Äì93 mph and he normally likes to use it when he gets ahead in a count as a strikeout pitch. It is normally a very difficult pitch to hit well, helping him limit the number of extra base hits he allows. Meek also throws a fourth pitch, an off-speed slider that is seldom used in pressure situations. The pitch normally sits around 80‚Äì82 mph, mainly incorporated to keep hitters out of a rhythm. His ability to throw four pitches well however, makes him rare as a relief pitcher as the normal reliever only possesses a three-pitch arsenal.

Like much of Mirpur, Chatroh has deep connections with the UK. Many people originally from Chhatroh have settled in urban centres of the UK such as Birmingham, Manchester and also Rotherham. The Cheetham Hill district of Manchester is often referred to as 'New Chhatroh' (by Mirpuris), reflecting the fact that a large number of people from Chhatroh live there. The town of Rochdale in Greater Manchester also has a large number of people from Chhatroh residing in it. The link with the UK is immediately obvious upon entering Chhatroh, where one is greeted by palatial, hacienda-style residences, eerily empty, which have been built with remitted UK incomes. In this regard, Chhatroh is no different from the rest of the Mirpur District, where links with the UK have precipitated various property booms since the 1960s. There are four major castes living in Chattroh ‚Äì [Jatt's], [Mughals], [Chaudhary], and [Raja's]. Chattroh meets the Jhelum River at its west end. There are fields of ankar at the north end of its geographical boundary. Chattroh is covered with hills covered with trees from east to southwest until Jhelum. River meets.  Demography  According to the 1998 census of Pakistan, the population of Chhatroh was 3,191.https://www.scribd.com/doc/2510797/Village-List-Mirpur-AJK  History  When the Mangla Dam was created in the 1960s, Chhatroh escaped relatively unscathed, with only land on the periphery affected. However, plans to raise the Mangla reservoir further, if implemented, are certain to affect properties in Chhatroh. These plans, as well as the general property boom, have contributed to demand for habitable land (as in much of the Mirpur District) This, in turn, has encouraged many unscrupulous people to take advantage of the archaic land laws and registers to make unmeritorious claims to premium land.  Politics  Chhatroh also has a long history of involvement in politics. Ch Abbas Ali, Mirpur's representative to the assembly of Maharaja Hari Singh, the last Dogra ruler of Kashmir, was from Chhatroh. In recent years, two MPs for the Dadyal constituency of the state government have hailed from Chhatroh, both of whom also served as State Ministers. Choudhry Ali Mohammad Chacha, the ex-Minister of Law of Azad Kashmir who was assassinated in Mirpur in March 2008 was from Chhatroh. Now the agriculture minister of Azad Kashmir is Chaudhary Masood Khalid. In office from 2016. He is a native of Chattroh.

Between 1885 and 1902 it developed into a series of sporting books which aimed to cover comprehensively all major sports and pastimes. The books were published in London by Longmans, Green & Co.Badminton Library at wychwoodbooks.com (accessed 3 April 2008) and in Boston by Little, Brown & Co.

T. Watson, and chose authors who were authorities in their fields. Explaining his purpose, the Duke said: Description The Badminton Library was originally published in twenty-eight volumes between 1885 and 1896. To these was later added Rowing & Punting (1898), superseding Boating (1888). New volumes for Athletics (1898) and Football (1899) supplemented the original Athletics and Football (1887). In 1902, the final entirely new volume, Motors and Motor-Driving, covered a new sport, and lastly there was a new edition of Cricket in 1920. On the combining of athletics and football in a single volume, Mike Huggins says in The Victorians and Sport (2004) that it suggests \\"...that football's leading place was not yet assured amongst the more literate reading public.\\"Huggins, Mike, The Victorians and Sport (London, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004, ) p. 11 The original volume on Cricket (1888) has sixteen chapters on topics such as 'Batting', 'Bowling', 'Fielding', and 'Umpires'. It defines the Marylebone Cricket Club as \\"The Parliament of Cricket\\" and describes the sport as \\"Our National Game\\". Allan Gibson Steel wrote the chapter on bowling. Cycling (1887), by Viscount Bury, notes that riding the tricycle and bicycle, whether by women or by men, \\"is by far the most recent of all sports in the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes. There is none which has developed more rapidly in the last few years.\\" It considers that \\"England may be looked upon as the Home of Cycling\\" and quotes Thomas Huxley's words to the Royal Society: \\"Since the time of Achilles, no improvement had added anything to the speed or strength attainable by the unassisted powers of man\\", commenting that a bicyclist had recently raced 146 miles in only ten hours. Skating (1892) deals first with 'Origins and Development', 'Figure skating', and 'Recreation and Racing', noting that Holland was \\"the Skater's Paradise\\" and giving a list of racing records since the 1820s, then continues with chapters on Curling, Tobogganing, Ice-Sailing and Bandy.

He is the Vice Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Ogilvy Worldwide. Hayden is one of the most important figures of the late twentieth century advertising, leading creative teams at both Chiat/Day and BBDO on the Apple Computer account. Early life (1947‚Äì1968) Stephen Edward Hayden was born on May 21, 1947 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was an internist and his mother was an opera singer. He was the youngest of four sons. In 1949, when Steve was two years old, his family relocated to San Jose, California where his father was the first internist in the area and eventually ran the O'Connor Hospital there. At 14, Steve was sent to boarding school at the Interlochen Center for the Arts where he studied cello (and where he now serves as chairman of the board of trustees).Interlochen Board of Trustees After graduating from high school at Interlochen, he moved to Los Angeles to go to school at University of Southern California. He graduated in 1968 with a degree in English. From first jobs to Steve Jobs (1969‚Äì1994) Hayden launched his career in Detroit as a copywriter on the General Motors corporate account. When he returned to California, he divided his attention between advertising and television scriptwriting (for Welcome Back, Kotter), eventually focusing on advertising. After honing his craft at a number of agencies on a variety of accounts, Steve was recruited to Chiat-Day where he and Lee Clow made advertising history as co-creators of the breakthrough 1984 Orwellian take-off campaign for Apple Inc.. In the late 1970s, when Chiat picked up the Apple account through the acquisition of Regis McKenna's advertising practice, computers were widely considered to be obscure and expensive machines for use by technical professionals and large organizations. Under Hayden's leadership, Apple hired New York talk show personality Dick Cavett as a spokesman and put Apple commercials on mass-audience television programming. In 1986, Hayden moved to BBDO to become the Chairman and CEO of West Coast operations. Apple had fired Chiat/Day not long after Steve Jobs was tossed out after an attempt boardroom coup. Hayden said that the management team led by John Sculley \\"loved the advertising but hated the agency\\" and Sculley encouraged BBDO head Phil Dusenberry to hire Hayden away ‚Äì which he did. The Hayden-led BBDO managed to hold on to the tempestuous Apple account for more than a decade, winning hundreds of awards for creative excellence and dozens more for effectiveness (including the Grand Effie for the launch of the Apple Powerbook). BBDO helped Apple become the #1 manufacturer of personal computers in the world, reclaiming the lead from IBM and Compaq in late 1992. The agency tripled in size during Hayden's tenure. In 1994, Hayden moved to Ogilvy to head the IBM account ‚Äì which had moved to Ogilvy in the single largest account consolidation in advertising history. Many pundits believed IBM was doomed and should be broken up and sold off ‚Äì but then-CEO Lou Gerstner believed that IBM's greatest strength was as a whole. It was Ogilvy's job to give voice to a future-facing IBM and change the perception of a brand that was widely seen to be a dinosaur. Eventually, the success on IBM propelled Ogilvy to a decade of growth and prosperity. And Hayden contributed to award-winning work for such diverse clients as American Express, Kodak, Motorola, Dove, Cisco and SAP. Creative contributions He was the co-creator ‚Äì along with Lee Clow ‚Äì of Apple Inc.'s 1984 commercial that launched the Macintosh. He also led the team that created and launched IBM's award-winning e-business campaign.1999 Gold Effie He is the voice of \\"Hello Moto\\", a ringtone and a campaign he and his team at Ogilvy created for Motorola.

History After photos were published of the carcass of an unidentified animal discovered near a lake on the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug reserve by two hikers in May 2010, they \\"spread around the Internet, sparking intense speculation about the creature's origins, ranging from the conceivable to the far-fetched\\".

A fierce opponent, Tzachas constructed the first Turkish navy and captured a few Aegean islands, supplemented by the conquest of Smyrna and Abydos. In the aftermath of the First Crusade Alexios I launched a counter-attack which regained the territories lost. Alexios was also able to rapidly quell the threat of Abu'l Qasim, the Seljuk governor of Nicaea, who attempted to create a fleet of his own at Abydos in ca. 1090. Tzachas recovered from his first defeat and retook several islands, but was definitively defeated at Lesbos by Constantine Dalassenos and John Doukas in 1092. His capital, Smyrna, and most of the Aegean coastline were recovered by Doukas in 1097, ending the Turks' direct access to the Aegean. Alexios I Komnenos' son, John II Komnenos inherited a sizable amount of land in Western Asia Minor, although the port city of Antalya was under Seljuq siege. Nonetheless, John's tireless campaigns drove the Turks deep into Anatolia and by 1143 the Seljuk Turks had lost all control of the coastal regions of Asia Minor. The Byzantines under Manuel I Komnenos could muster some 200 ships. Not until the demise of the Comnenian dynasty would the Turks capture a port and it was Umur of Aydƒ±n in c. 14th century that constituted the first Turkish threat to Christian shipping in the Aegean since the 11th century.

Transmission  In North America the disease is transmitted from infected to healthy trees by the whitebanded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus luteolus Van Duzee), the meadow spittlebug (Philaenus spurarius) and by another leafhopper (Allygus atomarius), although other insects are also suspected of being vectors. Transportation of nursery trees is another way for elm yellows to be spread over long distances. As leafhoppers move very slowly so movement of elm yellows has been slow.  Symptoms  When an elm is infected with elm yellows, the root hairs die. The phytoplasma infection then moves up the bark and infects the phloem, depriving the tree of nutrients. Death of the phloem essentially strangles the tree. As the phloem is infected, it will change color and take on a wintergreen smell, similar to that of black birch or birch beer. The crown, top of the tree turns yellow all at once, it can occur from July till September, when the leafhoppers are active. \\"How to Differentiate Dutch Elm Disease From Elm Phloem Necrosis\\" US Forest Service. 1981. Accessed: May 29th 2016 . It turns yellow from a lack of nutrients to the top of the tree.  Control  Aggressive control is needed if trees show symptoms of being infected. Time is of the essence since nearby trees may already be infected. Removal and destruction of the infected tree is the first step, followed by trenching around the next two rows of trees near it to isolate infection. Spraying trees with insecticide will also help reduce the chances of transmission by leafhopper. Injecting trees with tetracycline antibiotics has been shown to slow the progress of elm yellows. Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by preventing tRNA from attaching to the Ribosome. \\"Antibiotics.\\" Elmhurst.edu. 30 May 2016. . Phytoplasma bacteria do not have a Cell wall Jacqueline Fletcher and Astri Wayadande. \\"Fastidious Vascular- Colonizing Bacteria.\\" apsnet.org. 2002. Accessed: 30 May 2016. . Since Elm yellows and other phytoplasma do not have cell walls, most antibiotics will not be effective, this is why tetracycline and antibiotics that target internal functions of the cell are needed.

Born in Melbourne, he obtained a PhD from the University of Queensland. Since 2013, he has been the Tom Austen Brown Professor of Australian Archaeology at the University of Sydney,The University of Sydney \\"Major gifts lead to exciting new professorial appointments\\" having previously held a position in the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University. Hiscock specialises in ancient technology and has worked in France and Southern Africa on hominid artefacts. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Museum. His research includes work in lithic technology, archaeology of Indigenous Australia, global dispersion of modern humans and the study of the hominin species Homo neanderthalensis.Books by Peter Hiscock on Amazon Archaeological work = Australian prehistory= In addition to his work on lithic technology in Australia, Hiscock has contributed to a reinterpretation of the prehistory of Australia. His work on colonization and settlement, with Lynley Wallis, created the 'Desert Transformation' model,Hiscock, Peter and Wallis, Lynley (2005). \\"Pleistocene settlement of deserts from an Australian perspective\\". In P. Veth, M. Smith and P. Hiscock (eds) Desert Peoples: archaeological perspectives. Blackwell. Pp. 34-57. which proposed that about 50,000 years ago human colonists dispersed across much of the Australian continent at a time when the deserts were less harsh than today. These early settlers then gradually adapted to the onset of harsher environments that occurred after approximately 35,000 years ago. His work with Patrick FaulknerHiscock, P. and Faulkner, P. (2006) \\"Dating the dreaming? Creation of myths and rituals for mounds along the northern Australian coastline\\". Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:209-22. also led to a reconsideration of the large Anadara granosa shell mounds of northern Australia. Hiscock was funded with Dr Alex Mackay for an Australian Research Council post-doctoral fellowship project titled ‚ÄòTechnology and behavioural evolution in late Pleistocene Africa, Europe and Australia‚Äô (DP1092445) worth more than A$400,000 in 2010. The aim of this project was to focus on excavations in Africa, making comparisons with other areas of the world including Australia.\\"Peter Hiscock awarded new ARC funding Australian National University\\" His major contribution to Australian prehistory has been a new synthesis of the subject, in a book titled Archaeology of Ancient Australia.Hiscock, Peter. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia. Routledge: London. In that volume he advanced the view that there was little evidence for directional change in the prehistory of Australia and that the archaeological evidence was better seen as documenting a long series of adaptive changes, perhaps operating in multiple directions, rather than progress towards 'intensification' in the recent past (as espoused by archaeologists such as Harry Lourandos). This view was founded on a strong negative critique of the value of ethnography in the construction of narratives about the deep prehistoric past, arguing that ethnographic analogy had often imposed images of the lifestyle of recent Australian Aborigines on the different lives of their distant ancestors. Brian M. FaganFagan, Brian (2008) \\"Book review: Archaeology of Ancient Australia by Peter Hiscock\\". Australian Archaeology 66: 69-70 has suggested that in doing so Hiscock has attacked the tyranny of the ethnographic record that has dogged Australian archaeology for generations. In this he has disputed the views of archaeologists such as Josephine Flood, who considers ethnographic information can help understand prehistoric behavior.Fran Molloy, \\"Ancient Australia not written in stone\\", ABC News in Science Hiscock's argument also emphasized the likely failure of much of the Pleistocene archaeological record to preserve, arguing that the apparent simplicity of early eras resulted partly from the poverty of the archaeological evidence. Interpreting the available archaeological and genetic evidence from these view points, Hiscock presented a novel narrative of Australian prehistory, in which population sizes fluctuated through time in response to environmental productivity, the physical characteristics of people varied as climate and gene flows altered, and the economic, social, and ideological systems adjusted to accommodate and incorporate the circumstances of each time period.\\"Review of Archaeology of Ancient Australia\\", Antiquity Volume 82 Issue 317. September 2008 Awards Hiscock received the John Mulvaney Book Award in 2008 from the Australian Archaeological Association for his publication The Archaeology of Ancient Australia, which was acclaimed for its way of dealing \\"with the archaeological data as free-standing, and the long duree as the basic structure, suitable for the dating methods and accumulative and taphonomic process of most of the Australian record\\".Australian Archaeological Association, Awards He also was awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) honorary degree at the Australian National University.

Continuously flowing glacial meltwater gouged a line of smooth tubs in gritty sandstone over 12,000 years ago. The tubs are potholes formed by the flowing water. The site is part of a recreation area in the Pennsylvania mountains about south of downtown Wilkes- Barre.Litchman , Lori. \\"Seven Tubs Natural Area, Luzerne County.\\" Greentreks Network. 2006. 19 Mar 2008 . The site is popular among hikers for its easy accessibility and beginner-level hiking environment. Geology The glaciers of the Ice Age were instrumental in shaping the physical features of the natural world that we see today. They too are responsible for the formations of the tubs. As ice melts over long periods of time, its eroding capabilities become much more substantial. Glacial melting produced large volumes of flowing water for many years, contributing to formations in the different types of rock common to the area. Common geological rock classifications in the area are limestone, shale, and coal, but the tubs are formed mainly out of gritty sandstone.\\"Archbald Pothole State Park.\\" DCNR. 2008. 18 Mar 2008 . Wheelbarrow Run is a stream that runs through the tubs and eventually meets up with the larger Laurel Run. Both flows have cut gorges and canyons out of the surrounding landscapes that have created an opportunity for hikers to explore. This area is known as Whirlpool Valley. Wildlife =Flora= Wildflowers are a common site among the foliage around the tubs and the surrounding forests. The northeast is home to many different types of wildflower and the tubs is no exception. > \\"About 60 kinds of wildflowers have been observed, including pearly > everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea), wild lettuce (Prenanthes alba), jack- > in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum), closed gentian (Gentiana andrewsii), > pink lady's slipper (Cypripedium acaule), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris), > small round-leaved orchis (Orchis rotundifolia), and harebell (Campanula > rotundifolia). Tailing arbutus (Epigaea repens), mountain laurel (Kalmia > latifolia), sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia), and blueberry also thrive > here.\\" There is a multitude of categories of foliage in the area. The trees in the area vary greatly and are fairly dense in vegetation. The vegetation surrounding the tubs includes hemlock and yellow, grey, and black birch trees, as well as white and red chestnuts. Bear oaks are a common sight among the foliage as well as the tulip tree, red and striped maples, big-tooth and quaking aspens, American sycamore, American beech, white ash, slippery elm, sassafras, white gum, witch-hazel, flowering dogwood, staghorn sumac, as well as white, red, and pitch pines. =Fauna= Bird-watchers can gain a glimpse of many species of birds through a visitation of the tubs. The tubs offer a possibility to view some of the birds that are becoming a rarity in the northeast region of the state. Depending on the seasonality of the birds in the area and the time at which hikers and visitors experience the tubs, different bird types can be viewed and observed. Common to the area are the whippoorwill and saw-whet owl, both of which are becoming scarce across much of their normal habitat. Also, the barred owl, eastern towhee, yellow-shafted flicker, brown thrasher, and eastern wood pewee can be seen here. Game birds are frequent to the area as well and include wild turkey and ruffed grouse. =Animal life= Not only does the tubs provide a wide array of foliage and flora, many mammalian species can be observed in their natural habitats. A diverse spectrum of animal size can be observed, some to be taken more seriously than others. Deer, long-tailed weasel, red and gray foxes, opossum, and brown bat are all creatures that may be encountered through a visit to the tubs. Perhaps of most concern is the possible encounter of a black bear. Black bears can seem like docile creatures and are the smallest of the three types of bears in the northeast section of the country; however they should be heeded with great caution. Bear sightings are not extremely frequent, but they do reside in the area. If confronted by a black bear, it is highly recommended to ‚Äúspeak calmly and back away slowly‚Äù.\\"What if I see a Black Bear?.\\" The North American Bear Center. 2008. 16 Mar 2008 <>. Activities A path follows the tubs up the mountain. Certain elements of the path are wheelchair accessible and stairs are used in a few select locations to aid in descending the terrain. Also, the shade brought about by the foliage as well as the coolness of the water and its flow, all contribute to a drop in temperature in close proximity to the tubs. Be wary of loose rocks and slippery moss, for they have a tendency to cause loose footing. There are not many signs that warn of these dangers, so be cautious in hiking the intricacies of the tubs. When construction is completed, Seven Tubs will be the northern terminus of the D&L; Trail‚Äîa , multi-use rail trail. Nearby attractions There are many state parks around the northeast part of Pennsylvania. Closest in proximity to the tubs are Archbald Pothole, Ricketts Glenn, Frances Slocum, Nay Aug Park, Tobyhanna, McDade Park and Gouldsboro parks. Although many of the parks of the northeast Pennsylvania region have similar overall characteristics, each also has individual features that can provide a different nature experience.

Initially sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for his membership in the Iron Guard (to which he had in fact belonged, though he seems to have had a less important role than claimed), »öurcanu became the leader of a group of detainees whose role was to mistreat and torture other inmates, in order to \\"re-educate\\" them in the spirit of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and obtain information that could be used by the Communist organs of repression. Although initially, his activities were accepted, encouraged and directed by the communist regime, once information about what was happening inside Romanian prisons reached the West, he was investigated, tried and sentenced to death for his deeds. Early life and first trial »öurcanu was born either in PƒÉltini»ô,Final Report, p. 599 D√¢rmoxa (today part of Bro»ôteni), or, according to his own assertion, C√¢mpulung Moldovenesc;Mure≈üan, p. 200 in any case, all three are in Suceava County. »öurcanu had five brothers; his father was a forester. He studied at the Drago»ô VodƒÉ High School in C√¢mpulung Moldovenesc, where he joined in December 1940 the FrƒÉ»õia de Cruce organization, part of the Iron Guard. He was active in that organization for about a year, and participated in the January 1941 Legionnaires' rebellion in C√¢mpulung. His links to the Legionnaires were in fact rather vague, but exploited to the hilt when he was used as the chief scapegoat for the actions at Pite»ôti and Gherla prisons. After 1941, when »öurcanu was 16 and the Iron Guard was suppressed, there is no further record of his participation in activities of the Guard or its youth wing.Mure≈üan, p. 200-1 While still in high school, he fell in love with Oltea Saghin, the daughter of LazƒÉr Saghin, a lawyer and a Guard commander from C√¢mpulung. The two got married and had a daughter, Elena, named after »öurcanu's mother.. After the King Michael Coup of 23 August 1944 he began to flirt with Communism; in 1945 he joined the Union of Communist Youth, and two years later the Romanian Communist Party.Mure≈üan, p. 201 One of his victims later remembered him as \\"a handsome man, out of the ordinary...with brown hair tending toward blond...when he frowned, you were terrified...his well- proportioned body seemed that of a performance athlete. When he punched or slapped you, he knocked you to the ground. When he got mad he was so crude that he destroyed everything in his path, like a ferocious killer. Moreover, he was unusually intelligent and had an extraordinary memory... But he was so Satanized you didn't know what to think of him...\\"Bordeianu, p. 94 For almost three years he took courses at the University of Ia»ôi Faculty of Law, becoming a member of the local Communist organization's politburo and being sent to Bucharest to pursue a career in diplomacy. However, his past was uncovered and he was arrested on 25 June 1948. Through sentence nr. 137, handed down on 5 February 1949 by the Ia»ôi Military Tribunal, he was sentenced to seven years' correctional imprisonment for Legionary activity. In prison Cross at the memorial to the Pite»ôti Experiment »öurcanu was first imprisoned at Suceava. There, a group of prisoners detained for their past Iron Guard sympathies, led by Alexandru Bogdanovici, started various initiatives meant to win the favour of the Communist authorities. Among these was the preparation of a memorial addressed to the party leadership promising a full cessation of political activity in exchange for their release, and the founding (with »öurcanu's involvement) at the beginning of 1949 of Organiza»õia De»õinu»õilor cu Convingeri Comuniste (ODCC, \\"Organization of Convinced Communist Detainees\\"). He was transferred to Pite»ôti prison on 22 April 1949 and, once there, tried to attract the notice of prison director Alexandru Dumitrescu, with whom he only managed to speak at the beginning of June, when the latter was inspecting cells.Mure≈üan, p. 203 After discussions with him, »öurcanu was recruited as an informer to the prison management, in the process benefiting from a much more favourable treatment than that accorded to ordinary prisoners: extra food, freedom of movement inside the prison, etc. He coordinated with the local Securitate officer, Ion Marina; in turn, Marina was in constant communication with Iosif Neme»ô, the chief of the Operations Service, and with Colonel Tudor Sepeanu, the head of Inspection Services at the Securitate's Directorate for Penitentiaries. During the summer of 1949 »öurcanu identified, with the help of his collaborators, those detainees who served as leaders or role models for the others; the prison administration isolated these men in a separate section. The idea of applying violent treatments on prisoners appeared after discussions with director Dumitrescu in November 1949. Subsequently, »öurcanu directly participated in the beatings of several hundred detainees. Many of these were nearly killed as a result of the beatings administered by »öurcanu and his acolytes. One of his victims was Constantin Opri»ôan, who was cruelly beaten dozens of times by »öurcanu. On 18 August 1951 he was transferred to Gherla Prison, where he continued his activity as torturer on a reduced scale until that December. On 19 December he was transferred to Jilava Prison. Second trial »öurcanu and the group of torturers he led were tried in September‚ÄìNovember 1954; the head judge was Alexandru Petrescu, who had also presided at the trials of Iuliu Maniu and of the Danube-Black Sea Canal saboteurs.Mure≈üan, p. 83 The indictment, drawn up by a military prosecutor, claimed that the activities of the accused came about following an initiative by Horia Sima, whose alleged intention was to demonstrate to the West that detainees were mistreated and killed in Communist prisons, in order to compromise the regime and the Romanian government. »öurcanu was accused of having become head of the C√¢mpulung FrƒÉ»õia de Cruce in 1945, then of having founded the \\"National Liberal Christian Youth\\" (Tineretul Na»õional Liberal Cre»ôtin), later joining the Union of Communist Youth. The indictment recognized that some prisoners died, including Corneliu Ni»õƒÉ, Eugen Gavrilescu, Gheorghe »òerban and Gheorghe VƒÉtƒÉ»ôoiu, but also Bogdanovici, \\"who had been subjected to one of the most horrible extermination regimes\\".Mure≈üan, p. 86 On 10 November 1954, »öurcanu, together with a majority of his fellow defendants, was sentenced to death. He and sixteen accomplices were shot on 17 December, and his death was recorded at Jilava town hall on 5 October 1962. In 1957, the regime partially admitted its own involvement in the Pite»ôti Experiment by imprisoning lower-level officials and employees of the prison, including its director, Dumitrescu. Securitate Colonel Sepeanu was arrested in March 1953 and sentenced to 8 years in April 1957, but was pardoned and set free several months later.

The engagement ended with the death of the SAS patrol commander, Captain Gavin Hamilton. The action was the only land engagement of the British and Argentine forces on West Falkland during the conflict. Background Whilst the Argentine 35 mm radar-guided and 20 mm anti-aircraft guns at Port Stanley and Goose Green on East Falkland island forced the British Sea Harriers and Harrier GR.3's to carry out air strikes from high altitude,Woodward, page 36 their garrison on West Falkland island was equipped only with 12.7 mm heavy machine guns, which left it vulnerable to strafing and low-level bombing attacks from the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. In a reinforcement of the garrison on West Falkland the Argentine Command dispatched 601 Commando Company to the Headquarters post of its 5th Regiment of Infantry sited at Port Howard, the commandos bringing with them as a part of their fire-power the British-made shoulder-fired Blowpipe missile system to augment the position's air defences.Ruiz Moreno, page 141 and page 146 After a 24-hour trip from Port Stanley the company reached its destination.Ruiz Moreno, pp. 144-145 A few days later, in the morning of 21 May 1982, with the British landing at San Carlos bay on East Falkland underway, 601 Commando Company shot the wing off of a GR3 Harrier from No.1 Squadron, R.A.F. on a reconnaissance mission over Port Howard, the pilot (Flt. Lt. Jeffrey Glover) ejecting into the sea badly injured from exiting the aircraft at high speed, and being taken prisoner by the garrison.British aircraft losses, 21 May entry The Argentine garrison on West Falkland had by this time become practically cut-off due to the developing adverse strategic situation for the Argentine Forces, and 601 Commando Company was issued with an order to try to gather intelligence information about British activity that could be seen on the opposite shore of East Falkland across the Falkland Sound, where the main campaign was taking place. In the meantime detachments from the British Army's Special Air Service Regiment had also been active around the Argentine advanced posts on West Falkland. On 5 June 1982 a four- men patrol led by Captain Hamilton moved into an observation position on a ridge overlooking Port Howard from the North upon a piece of ground known as Many Branch Point, with the aim of gathering intelligence on the Argentine forces located there.Strawson, page 239 On the morning of 9 June 1982 a routine reconnaissance patrol by 601 Commando Company, led by First Lieutenant Jos√© Martiniano Duarte, also moved on to Many Branch Point to establish an ad hoc observation post on the high vantage point that it offered across the Falkland Sound. Previously, an Argentine observation post had been sited upon Mount Rosalie, but it had been compromised due to a British presence and the Commandos had withdrawn from it without detection, and they now sought an alternative position.Ruiz Moreno, pp 338-339 The Argentine patrol was originally composed of nine men, but by the afternoon with no enemy thought to be in the direct vicinity, five men returned into Port Howard whilst Lt. Duarte with three non-commissioned officers, viz. Sergeants Eusebio Moreno, Francisco Altamirano and Corporal Roberto R√≠os,Se enfrentaron en Malvinas y se reencontraron 35 a√±os despu√©s remained up on the ridge. From this position they were able to observe that a British airfield had been constructed near San Carlos.Ruiz Moreno, page 304 (British sources state that Capt. Hamilton was 'heavily outnumbered' in the engagement that followed,London Gazette, 8 October 1982 but this would appear to be contradicted by the small numbers of Argentinians given as being in the vicinity in their own accounts). Contact at the observation post Late in the morning of 10 June 1982, whilst still in position observing across the Falkland Sound, Duarte thought that he could hear distant voices being carried upon the wind, emanating from some way further along the ridge. Summoning his patrol together he moved along the ridge-line, continuing to hear snatches of voices apparently in conversation with one another, until he came to a cluster of cave-shaped rocks, wherein he suspected that either a British military presence was hidden in situ, or possibly that it might be a weather-shelter for some Falklander shepherds. As they approached the rock formation a man with a dark skin complexion and a large moustache (Cpl. Roy Fonseka, Royal Signals attached to the Special Air Service, who was of Goan origin),Bicheno, Hugh (2006) Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War. London. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. wearing a camouflage uniform and a green balaclava suddenly walked out from amidst it into the open ground, unaware of the commandos' presence and looking away in another direction. Initially the Argentinians hesitated as the balaclava resembled the ones issued to their own forces, and Duarte shouted a challenge: \\"Argentinos o Ingleses?\\" (Argentine or English?), at which Fonseka turned towards him and stopped dead, staring at him as if stunned and failed to respond. After a short silence, Lt. Duarte yelled in English: \\"Hands up, hands up!\\".En ese instante sali√≥ un hombre de entre las piedras: era un mulato con grandes bigotazos, con un pasamonta√±as verde de la Marina Argentina en su cabeza, vistiendo uniforme camuflado. Todav√≠a dudando, el oficial se asom√≥ y le grit√≥: -Argentinos o Ingleses? Sorprendido, el hombre se le qued√≥ mirando. Y Duarte volvi√≥ a gritarle: -Hands up, hands up! (Manos arriba). En tal momento el individuo peg√≥ un salto al costado y abri√≥ fuego sobre los Comandos. Una r√°faga de 5,56 rebot√≥ en la piedra delante de Duarte y le llen√≥ los ojos de polvo. (At that moment a man came out of the rocks: he was a mulatto with a large moustache, and an Argentine Navy's green helmet on his head, wearing camouflage fatigues. Still hesitating, the officer came and shouted at him:-Argentine or English? Stunned, the man just kept watching. And Duarte again screaming: \\"Hands up, hands up!\\" At that point the individual hit the deck and opened fire on the Commandos. A burst of 5.56 ricocheted of the rock in front of Duarte and filled his eyes with dust.) Ruiz Moreno, page 341 In response to this Fonseka suddenly dropped to the ground, and producing a weapon opened fire at Duarte, which struck the rocks in front of him as he ducked for cover, briefly blinding him with rock dust. As the commandos scrambled to get into covered firing positions Fonseka leapt up and ran back into the rocks from where he had emerged, and a general small-arms fire-fight commenced between the 4 Argentinians and the 2-man British Army forward observation post that they had discovered. During the engagement Sergeant Eusebio Moreno threw two grenades at the British post, and received in reply a British 40 mm grenade, which exploded a few yards to the rear, and Hamilton, firing at the commandos from within the post alongside Fonseka, was struck in the arm by a bullet. Under the weight of fire from Duarte's patrol the British two man team attempted to abandon the position and retire up the short stretch of ridge line to their rear to gain the high ground and access to the ridge's reverse slope beyond the summit, with Capt. Hamilton ordering Fonseka to fall- back as a first move whilst he covered him with automatic fire. However, as it was underway and Fonseka was heading up the slope Hamilton was struck again by rifle fire from Lt. Duarte and killed whilst himself exiting the post, and Fonseka surrendered shortly afterwards and was taken prisoner of war.Ruiz Moreno, page 342 Although Hamilton wore no rank or insignia (as is SAS practice), he was identified by his dog tag. Also found in the captured observation post was a radio, an M16 and an AR-15 rifle, a beacon, maps and a communications code book.Ruiz Moreno, pp 340-343 Another two men who were a part of Hamilton's patrol, but weren't in the attacked post at the time, withdrew from the area and were later rescued by British Forces.British Small Wars Subsequent events The night after the engagement saw inaccurate shelling by Royal Navy frigates of Port Howard,Apenas hab√≠a conclu√≠do esta tarea cuando se escuch√≥ una explosi√≥n, que en un primer momento fue atribu√≠da al estallido de una mina. Pero al rato se percibieron claramente tres ca√±onazos navales y todos buscaron cubiertas: los observadores ubicados en Monte Mar√≠a, atr√°s y arriba de Howard, indicaron posteriormente que se trataba de tres fragatas desde la distancia habitual de diez a doce kil√≥metros. El bombardeo dur√≥ hasta las tres de la ma√±ana y fue muy impreciso: le faltaba observaci√≥n. El teniente primero Fern√°ndez supuso que el primer disparo, aislado, fue un llamado al observador, al no recibir su comunicaci√≥n: y los posteriores se limitaron a dirigirlos hacia las posiciones previamente marcadas -la ubicaci√≥n de la Compa√±√≠a B, sobre un cerro-, pero sin causar efectos. (They had barely completed this task when an explosion was heard, which initially was attributed to the blast of a mine. But realising it was naval gunfire from 3 vessels and they sought cover: the observers located in Mount Mary, and in Port Howard, later indicated that it was three frigates bombarding from the usual distance of ten to twelve miles. The bombardment lasted until three o'clock and, missing observation, it was very inaccurate. Lt. Fernandez first assumed that the first isolated shot was a call to the observer, to start wireless contact and the later rounds were aimed to positions previously marked as the location of Company B, on a hill, but to no avail.) Ruiz Moreno, pp. 345-346 leading to speculation amongst Argentinians that the purpose of Hamilton's post had been to act as a Naval Gunfire Support Forward Observer (NGSFO). A subsequent later medical examination revealed that Hamilton had been killed by a 7.62 mm shot in the back. Another bullet had struck his arm. His body was buried at Port Howard. Hamilton's grave today can be seen from Many Branch Point ridge at Port Howard.Wheeler, Tony: 'The Falklands & South Georgia Islands'. (Pub. Lonely Planet, 2004), P.115. When the Commanding Officer of Port Howard, Col. Juan Ramon Mabragana, was interrogated by the British after the surrender of the Argentinian Forces on the Falklands four days after Hamilton's death, he recommended that Hamilton receive a decoration for the heroism he displayed during the engagement at the observation post.'SAS Heroes' by Pete Scholey. (Pub. Osprey Publishing), p.260 Hamilton was subsequently posthumously awarded the Military Cross.London Gazette citation In 2002, Duarte met Hamilton's widow Vicky at the Argentine Embassy in London. He expressed personal regret for the events that had occurred and praised Hamilton's bravery.https://www.clarin.com/politica/combate-empezo-malvinas-termino- londres_0_rJ_bphNgRFx.html Notes References *Ruiz Moreno, Isidoro:Comandos en acci√≥n.

The name Q-machine stems from the original intention of creating a quiescent plasma that is free from the fluctuations that are present in plasmas created in electric discharges. The Q-machine was first described in a publication by Rynn and D'Angelo . The Q-machine plasma is created at a plate that has been heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the hot plate. Electrons are emitted by the hot plate through thermionic emission, and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven that is designed to direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the hot plate. A high value of the hot plate work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation. The temperature of the Q-machine plasma is close to the temperature of the hot plate, and the ion and electron temperatures are similar. Although this temperature (about 2000 K) is high compared to room temperature, it is much lower than electron temperatures that are usually found in discharge plasma. The low temperature makes it possible to create a plasma column that is several ion gyro radii across. Since the alkaline metals are solids at room temperature they will stick to the walls of the machine on impact, and therefore the neutral pressure can be kept so low that for all practical purposes the plasma is fully ionised. Plasma research that has been performed using Q-machines includes current driven ion cyclotron waves , Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, and electron phase space holes. Today, Q-machines can be found at West Virginia University and at the University of Iowa in the USA, at Tohoku University in Sendai in Japan, and at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.

HISTORY: Long before Utica was incorporated as a city in 1832, it was a small village known as Fort Schuyler. Having been carved from unbroken wilderness fifteen years before, it was there that First Presbyterian Church was organized, the oldest church in what was to become Utica. First Church was a sister to Whitesboro Presbyterian Church, being one and the same at the beginning of 1793 and known as \\"The United Society of Whitestown.\\" On February 18, 1794, this society was received into the Presbytery of Albany, being then farther west than any other Presbyterian church. The Rev. Bethuel Dodd was appointed and installed as the Society's first pastor on August 21, 1794. Officiating in both congregations, Dodd spent two thirds of his time in Whitestown and one third in Fort Schuyler, his support shared by both churches. The Fort Schuyler congregation, legally incorporated as a church in 1804, assembled first in the village schoolhouse on Main Street and was later granted the use of Trinity Episcopal Church on Broad Street until a worship place could be constructed. In 1807 a church was built on lower Washington Street. Used for twenty years, it was divided and moved to make way for a building of a larger structure. Dedicated in 1827, the new church was constructed of brick and included a spire 215 feet high. In 1813, the Utica congregation called the Rev. Henry Dwight as its first full time pastor. The corporation then took the name of \\"The First Utica Presbyterian Society\\", which remains the church's legal name to this day. Following a disastrous fire in 1851, the imposing structure of Old First Church was built in the Romanesque Revival style on the northeast corner of Washington and Columbia Streets. This building served as a worship place for nearly 70 years. In 1919 it was decided to break with tradition and move \\"uptown\\" to what was then considered suburban Utica. In May 1921, the Society purchased the MacKinnon-Borst estate, its present property, as the site for a new sanctuary. While the committee took stock of the possibilities of the MacKinnon house (currently used as the Church House, and is also referred to as \\"Molly's House\\" as a venue for coffeehouses and other events), worship was held in temporary quarters on Oneida Square. Ralph Adams Cram, architect for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, was chosen to design the new church. A major requirement of the plans was to reuse the walnut pews from the Washington Street church, a factor which would determine many of the dimensions of the new church. Some of the decorative woodwork in Brewer Chapel came from the old building and temporarily graced the Oneida Square storefront which was used as a transitional sanctuary. Ground breaking for the new building occurred in July 1922, followed by the laying of the cornerstone in December. Occupancy and dedication took place Sunday, May 11, 1924, followed by four weeks of special events. The total cost of the building of the church was somewhat over $275,000, most of which was raised at two worship services in May 1922. The structure we now call the Church House was built in 1899 as a lavish private residence by Robert MacKinnon. It cost MacKinnon $150,000 to build and $50,000 - $75,000 to operate. A few years later, MacKinnon was forced into bankruptcy and in 1911 the home was purchased for $40,000 by Charles A. Borst and his wife Grace Olmstead Borst. After his unexpected death in 1918, Mrs. Borst was forced to sell he house for $50,000 to a group of entrepreneurs who planned to turn it into an apartment house. Before the new owners had occupied the building, the church became interested in the property and the resale price climbed overnight to $65,000. The year 1961 saw the joining of the Church and the Church House with the construction of a number of classrooms, Fellowship Hall, a modernized kitchen and the installation of the magnificent Casavant Freres organ. Throughout its history, First Presbyterian Church has had a strong mission emphasis. It has produced at least 17 missionaries and 24 ministers. The first Home Missionary Society was established in 1843 and in 1877 the women's Missionary Society was organized. References 3\\\\.

She was a central figure in the history of the Maronite Church in the 18th century. Hindiyya founded in 1750 the controversial religious order of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was dissolved by order of pope Pius VI in 1779.  Life  Hindiyya was born on August 6, 1720 in Aleppo to Shukrallah Ujaimi and mother Helene Hawwa, both devout Maronite Christians. Similar to other Maronite Christians of the time, the Ujaimis were merchants who were getting increasingly wealthy due to commercial treaties signed between European powers and the Ottoman's during 1675. Hindiyya had a brother named Nicholas and sisters, although the exact number of siblings is unclear. Hindiyya studied under the Jesuits, which encouraged her in developing her spirituality and exposed her to the stories of other young women who had chosen a religious life over the secular path. Hindiyya in turn embraced many Roman Catholic devotions, as the frequent auricular Confession. The support from the Jesuits lasted until 1748. She moved from Aleppo to Berke, Lebanon, where on March 25, 1750 she founded her own religious order called the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a Western devotion she imported among the Maronites and that made forthwith success. She claimed to have visions of Christ, to make miracles, to speak with Christ in mystical unions and to be united with the Trinity in a unique way. She soon became considered as a living saint and almost an object of veneration. The majority of the Maronite clergy, as well as the Patriarchs Simon Awad, Tobias El Khazen, and Joseph Estephan firmly supported Hindiyya, while on the contrary the Jesuits, as well as some Maronites, became more and more mistrustful of her doctrine and personal cult. In 1752 Pope Benedict XIV ordered the first investigation of her practices. It was carried out by the Franciscan Desiderio da Casabasciana, who, initially hostile, became himself a supporter of Hindiyya. The case of Hindiyya made a comeback under the patriarchate of Joseph Estephan, also because the Patriarch was so fond of the devotion imported by Hindiyya that he made the Sacred Heart a holy day of obligation for the Maronites. New inspections were carried out by Valeriano di Prato, Custodian of the Holy Land, in 1773 and finally by Pietro Craveri of Moretta, who took a stand against the doctrines of Hindiyya in 1775. The affair of Hindiyya combined with the opposition to Joseph Estephan by the Khazen Sheikhes and by the bishops Michael El Khazen and Michael Fadel. Finally in 1779 Pope Pius VI issued a decree stating that Hindiyya was delusional and her revelations and doctrines false. Moreover, the Pope abolished her Order of Sacred Heart and he suspended the Patriarch Joseph Estephan from all functions of office, appointing Michael El Khazen as Vicar. Patriarch Joseph Estephan was restored to power only in 1784, while Hindiyya lived the rest of her life confined to various convents and her works were proscribed. She died on February 13, 1798 in the convent of Our Lady of the Fields. Personality Hindiyya was different from young women her age and was often ridiculed for her decision to abstain from acts she deemed ‚Äúmaterialistic‚Äù but were considered social norms. She believed she was created to dedicate her life to Christ and spoke to religious figures of visions she had of Christ in which he instructed her to establish a confraternity: ‚Äúat the age of four or five I would feel in the heart a clear voice telling me that I will establish a confraternity of men and women and that I will be its president, that is its founder‚Ä¶‚Äù. As a young woman Hindiyya was sought out by young men and women who admired her devotion, this turned into ridicule once she became of marriageable age and refused to marry. Her decision to remain single and devote her life to Christ was an explicit rejection of social boundaries adhered to by young women her age and displayed how dedicated she was to her goals. =Role of Women= The measures she took in an effort to worship Christ and strengthen her relationship were often ridiculed by her mother, siblings, and neighbors who felt she was depriving herself. Her behavior was antisocial and viewed as extreme; she refrained from speaking to her father on a particular instance claiming, ‚ÄúOur Lord Jesus Christ said that whosoever does not leave his father and mother‚Ä¶will not deserve my love.‚Äù Her decision to avoid socializing and participating in social rituals expected of young women her age was seen as rebellious and she was the victim of tremendous ridicule. Determined to act on the visions she had as a young girl, she sought to establish a confraternity and was determined to surpass the gender roles assigned to women by religious figures. =Doctrine= During the inspections to her Congregation held in the 1770s, Hindiyya was charged with many heterodox doctrines in comparison with the Maronite historical doctrine, for example her claims that she was united with Christ in a hypostatic, real and not accidental union, that her knowledge was more perfect than that of the angels, that it was by her that Jesus would judge souls in death, that she was infallible, that many verses of the Bible referred to her, that she was greater than Mary, and that because of her union with Christ she was to be worshipped. Hindiyya was also charged with many illicit liturgical behaviors, such as taking the Communion whenever she wanted, refusing to fast, claiming spiritual jurisdiction, and even administering confession. Influence Hindiyya's figure and spirituality had a significant influence on a similar Aleppo-based sect, the Worshippers of the Sacred Heart, which was founded a few years later by Margaret Baptist and supported by the French priest, Nicholas Gaudez. This sect was opposed by the Melkite Patriarch Maximos III Mazloum, was censored by Propaganda Fide in 1838, and suppressed in 1849. Bernard Heyberger, author of a major biographical study of Hindiyya and her place in Maronite history, argued that her career exemplified the \\"feminization\\" of Middle Eastern Christianity under the influence of Catholic missionaries, who encouraged new cultures of female devotion.

He earned a PhD in Near Eastern Languages from Harvard University in 1970. He also earned an MDiv from Weston Jesuit School of Theology.Tribute Pauline Theology Among his many writings, Harrington wrote and taught on the Apostle Paul. He has written two books including: Paul and Virtue Ethics and Meeting St. Paul Today. Meeting St. Paul Today was written during the Pauline Year proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI in 2008. Harrington‚Äôs hope was to write a short book on Paul that might help introduce him and his writings to the general public.Harrington, Daniel J. Meeting St. Paul Today: Understanding the Man, his Mission, and his Message. Chicago: Loyola Press, 2008. p. vii. This book is not intended to be a heavy historical or theological analysis of Paul, but rather serves to introduce the readers to Paul. Fr. Harrington is a very accessible writer and opens the door to show how Paul‚Äôs practical and pastoral advice to the early Christian community is applicable and useful to us today. He teaches ways to understand Paul, how to interpret his letters, and how to take away practical implications after reading the book. Fr. Harrington uncovers who Paul was and what we can learn from him today. He discusses Paul as a pastoral theologian and one who collaborated with others to succeed in his ministry.Harrington, Daniel J. Meeting St. Paul Today. p. 1. Harrington considers how Scripture can impact contemporary readers, particularly the letters of Paul. He discusses the authorship of Paul and ascribes to the traditional account that there are six letters that are disputed (meaning many scholars believe that Paul did not write them) and there are seven that are undisputed. He argues 2 Thessalonians, Colossians, Ephesians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus are the six disputed letters while 1 Thessalonians, Galatians, Philippians, Philemon, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Romans are the seven undisputed letters. While he does note that it is important to recognize that there are six letters that were most likely not written by Paul, he argues they should not be disregarded because ‚Äúof course, both groups of letters are part of Sacred Scripture for Christians.‚Äù Harrington, Daniel J. Meeting St. Paul Today. p. 25. Harrington discusses each letter in detail providing insights into how Paul is applicable to contemporary lives. He presents some helpful tools through literary, historical, and theological approaches and discusses the differences in translations and how it can be helpful to examine multiple translations to understand more fully the complexity of translations and the differences in meaning. Harrington also discusses the importance of the ‚Äúactualization‚Äù of the Pauline letters. He says this term ‚Äúdescribes the process of reading ancient texts in new circumstances and applying them to the current situation of the people of God.‚Äù Harrington, Daniel J. Meeting St. Paul Today. p. 136. He describes that this was an ancient practice that many Jewish communities participated in. He discusses the importance of the prayer practice, lectio divina, when reading Paul. Actualization and lectio divina can foster the growth of the Pauline texts and can allow God to work through the texts and bring out contemporary insights in ways that historical criticism or literary criticism cannot. Harrington argues that there are many specific elements that we can learn from Paul and use to assist us as Christians today. He says, ‚ÄúWe can learn to recognize the prominence of women in Paul‚Äôs mission and ministry, and the high value that Paul placed on collaborative ministry.‚Äù Harrington, Daniel J.

The group's original line-up included Dawn Crosby on vocals, Steve Hochheiser on bass, Dennis Butler on drums and Ross Robinson and Caleb Quinn on guitars,. In 2012, the band was the subject of controversy over their 2010 song \\"Kill Rush\\", which referred to Rush Limbaugh with the conservative talk show host Sean Hannity discussing the band as part of a left-wing hate conspiracy with then US House Member Michele Bachmann. History Detente's first album, Recognize No Authority, was released on Roadrunner Records and also licensed to Metal Blade Records in 1986. Within days of the debut album's release, the supporting tour had to be canceled when drummer and co-founder Dennis was severely burned in an industrial accident, resulting in more than three months of hospitalization. Despite the lack of touring the debut sold strongly in Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands. The band split, but their singer Dawn Crosby continued with the Detente brand. Due to a legal dispute, the name Detente had to be dropped and was changed to Fear of God, who were eventually signed to Warner Bros. Records. Ross Robinson later became a producer whose credits include Korn, Sepultura, Limp Bizkit, and many other top acts. In 1987, Hochheiser and Robinson formed Catalepsy with the Canadian vocalist Veronica Ross. With Ross, singing and recording the lyrics and vocal melodies for the songs \\"Evil Within\\", \\"An Offering\\", and \\"Obituary Fear\\". The demo, recorded at Baby O' Studios in Hollywood, California, climbed to the number one spot on the WVVX- FM Underground Radio. Catalepsy continued in the studios to record three more songs with Ross singing and writing \\"Under the Influence\\", \\"Who Can You Trust\\" and \\"Law and Disorder\\". The band was set to release a new album titled Beyond the Threshold after leaving member options were exercised on Steve Hochheiser and Ross Robinson by Roadrunner Records, however, Robinson refused to record for Roadrunner due to what he thought was a lack of support for Detente. After some wrangling the band convinced Roadrunner to release them and then pursued a deal with CBS Records that ultimately fell through. Catalepsy had already self-funded recording an additional seven songs but, the time had passed, and the band members each went in new directions before the album could be released. Dawn Crosby died in 1996 of liver failure associated with a history of alcohol and drug abuse. In 2007 Recognize No Authority was re-released on Steve Hochheiser's own label Cognitive Records. and with new fans discovering Detente has since been repackaged into multiple editions. The group reunited in 2008 for a series of appearances with singer Ann Boleyn of Hellion filling in for Crosby. In July, they performed at the Headbanger's Open Air Festival in Germany.

This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 6¬∞‚Äì25¬∞ between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 38¬∞‚Äì56¬∞, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 2‚Äì8 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 10‚Äì20. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome. SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion. It is distinct from nutcracker syndrome, which is the entrapment of the left renal vein between the AA and the SMA, although it is possible to be diagnosed with both conditions.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, extreme \\"stabbing\\" postprandial abdominal pain (due to both the duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis), abdominal distention/distortion, burping, external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area, reflux, and heartburn. In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms. In some cases of SMA syndrome, severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur.Free full text with registration at Medscape This, in turn, increases the duodenal compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating a cycle of worsening symptoms. Fear of eating is commonly seen among those with the chronic form of SMA syndrome. For many, symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee-to- chest position, or in the prone (face down) position. A Hayes maneuver, which corresponds to applying pressure below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction, elevates the root of the SMA, also slightly easing the constriction. Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a face up position.  Causes  Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue normally serve as a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow mesenteric angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced. Patients with the chronic, congenital form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations depending on the degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or \\"lanky\\") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA.http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/35163/la_id/1.htm Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury. The acute form of SMA syndrome develops rapidly after traumatic incidents that forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged supine bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left nephrectomy, ileo-anal pouch surgery. It is important to note, however, that while SMA syndrome can mimic an eating disorder, distinguishing the two conditions is extremely important, as misdiagnosis in this situation can be dangerous.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is very difficult, and usually one of exclusion. SMA syndrome is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions with a higher diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow X-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, as well as a delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region. Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography. In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle. Despite multiple case reports, there has been controversy surrounding the diagnosis and even the existence of SMA syndrome since symptoms do not always correlate well with radiologic findings, and may not always improve following surgical correction.http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?print=true&topicKey;=gi_dis/31570&view;=print However, the reason for the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms even after surgical correction in some cases has been traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis.Yang, Wei-Liang and Xin-Chen Zhang. World Journal of Gastroenterology 2008 January 14; 14(2): 303-306 http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/303.pdf Since females between the ages of 10 and 30 are most frequently afflicted, it is not uncommon for physicians to initially and incorrectly assume that emaciation is a choice of the patient instead of a consequence of SMA syndrome. Patients in the earlier stages of SMA syndrome often remain unaware that they are ill until substantial damage to their health is done, since they may attempt to adapt to the condition by gradually decreasing their food intake or naturally gravitating toward a lighter and more digestible diet.

Image:Cartoon-WilkieSyndrome.JPG  A diagram of a compressed duodenum due to a reduced mesenteric angle.  Treatment  Upper gastrointestinal series showing duodenojejuonostomy (white arrow). SMA syndrome can present in acute, acquired form (e.g. abruptly emerging within an inpatient stay following scoliosis surgery) as well as chronic form (i.e. developing throughout the course of a lifetime and advancing due to environmental triggers, life changes, or other illnesses). According to a number of recent sources, at least 70% of cases can typically be treated with medical treatment, while the rest require surgical treatment. Medical treatment is attempted first in many cases. In some cases, emergency surgery is necessary upon presentation. A six-week trial of medical treatment is recommended in pediatric cases. The goal of medical treatment for SMA syndrome is resolution of underlying conditions and weight gain. Medical treatment may involve nasogastric tube placement for duodenal and gastric decompression, mobilization into the prone or left lateral decubitus position,Dietz UA, Debus ES, Heuko-Valiati L, Valiati W, Friesen A, Fuchs KH, Malafaia O, Thiede A: Aorto-mesenteric artery compression syndrome. Chirurg 2000;71:1345‚Äì51 the reversal or removal of the precipitating factor with proper nutrition and replacement of fluid and electrolytes, either by surgically inserted jejunal feeding tube, nasogastric intubation, or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pro-motility agents such as metoclopramide may also be beneficial. Symptoms may improve after restoration of weight, except when reversed peristalsis persists, or if regained fat refuses to accumulate within the mesenteric angle. Most patients seem to benefit from nutritional support with hyperalimentation irrespective of disease history. If medical treatment fails, or is not feasible due to severe illness, surgical intervention is required. The most common operation for SMA syndrome, duodenojejunostomy, was first proposed in 1907 by Bloodgood. Performed as either an open surgery or laparoscopically, duodenojejunostomy involves the creation of an anastomosis between the duodenum and the jejunum, bypassing the compression caused by the AA and the SMA. Less common surgical treatments for SMA syndrome include Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy, anterior transposition of the third portion of the duodenum, intestinal derotation, division of the ligament of Treitz (Strong's operation), and transposition of the SMA. Both transposition of the SMA and lysis of the duodenal suspensory muscle have the advantage that they do not involve the creation of an intestinal anastomosis. The possible persistence of symptoms after surgical bypass can be traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis, although the precipitating factor (the duodenal compression) has been bypassed or relieved. Reversed peristalsis has been shown to respond to duodenal circular drainage‚Äîa complex and invasive open surgical procedure originally implemented and performed in China. In some cases, SMA syndrome may occur alongside a serious, life-threatening condition such as cancer or AIDS. Even in these cases, though, treatment of the SMA syndrome can lead to a reduction in symptoms and an increased quality of life. Prognosis Delay in the diagnosis of SMA syndrome can result in fatal catabolysis (advanced malnutrition), dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, hypokalemia, acute gastric rupture or intestinal perforation (from prolonged mesenteric ischemia), gastric distention, spontaneous upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and aspiration pneumonia. Errico, Thomas J. \\"Surgical Management of Spinal Deformities\\", 458Kai-Hsiung Ko; Shih-Hung Tsai; Chih-Yung Yu; Guo-Shu Huang; Chang-Hsien Liu; Wei-Chou Chang. http://www.biomedsearch.com/nih/Unusual-complication-superior-mesenteric- artery/19181598.html\\" A 1-in-3 mortality rate for Superior Mesenteric Artery syndrome has been quoted by a small number of sources. However, after extensive research, original data establishing this mortality rate has not been found, indicating that the number is likely to be unreliable. While research establishing an official mortality rate may not exist, two recent studies of SMA syndrome patients, one published in 2006 looking at 22 cases and one in 2012 looking at 80 cases, show mortality rates of 0% and 6.3%, respectively. According to the doctors in one of these studies, the expected outcome for SMA syndrome treatment is generally considered to be excellent. Epidemiology According to a 1956 study, only 0.3% of patients referred for an upper-gastrointestinal-tract barium studies fit this diagnosis, and is thus a rare disease. Recognition of SMA syndrome as a distinct clinical entity is controversial, due in part to its possible confusion with a number of other conditions, though it is now widely acknowledged. However, unfamiliarity with this condition in the medical community coupled with its intermittent and nonspecific symptomatology probably results in its underdiagnosis.Hoffman, Robert J. and Stephen M. Arpadi. \\"Case Report: A Pediatric AIDS Patient with Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome.\\" http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/108729100318073 As the syndrome involves a lack of essential fat, more than half of those diagnosed are underweight, sometimes to the point of sickliness and emaciation. Females are impacted more often than males, and while the syndrome can occur at any age, it is most frequently diagnosed in early adulthood. The most common co-morbid conditions include mental and behavioral disorders including eating disorders and depression, infectious diseases including tuberculosis and acute gastroenteritis, and nervous system diseases including muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy. History SMA syndrome was first described in 1861 by Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky in victims at autopsy, but remained pathologically undefined until 1927 when Wilkie published the first comprehensive series of 75 patients. Society and culture SMA syndrome was first described in 1861 by Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky. American actor, director, producer, and writer Christopher Reeve had the acute form of SMA syndrome as a result of spinal cord injury. = Non-profit = In 2017 the only US non-profit began distributing grants to those suffering from SMAS.

It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, Isochanvre and IsoHemp. Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.  Applications and specifications  Hempcrete has been used in France since the early 1990s to construct non-weight bearing insulating infill walls, as hempcrete does not have the requisite strength for constructing foundation and is instead supported by the frame. Hempcrete was also used to renovate old buildings made of stone or lime. France continues to be an avid user of hempcrete, and it grows in popularity there annually. The typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa, around 5% that of residential grade concrete. It is a low density material and resistant to cracking under movement, thus making it suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's density is 15% that of traditional concrete. Studies in the UK indicate that the performance gain between and walls is insignificant. Hempcrete walls are fireproof, transmit humidity, resist mould, and have excellent acoustic performance. Limecrete, Ltd. (UK) reports a fire resistance rating of 1 hour per British/EU standards. In the United States, a permit is needed for the use of hemp in building. Hempcrete's R-value (its resistance to heat transfer) is , making it an efficient insulating material (the higher the R-value, the better the insulation).

It is named after Bouvet Island, which lies 275 kilometers to the east. The three plates which meet here are the South American Plate, the African Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. The Bouvet Triple Junction is an R-R-R type, that is, the three plate boundaries which meet here are mid-ocean ridges: the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), and the South American-Antarctic Ridge (SAAR). Transform valleys There are two prominent transform valleys in the area: Conrad transform and Bouvet transform. Conrad transform is named after . Bouvet Island is the highest point on the southern wall of the Bouvet transform. Development Up to 10 million years ago the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the two deep transform valleys of Conrad and Bouvet met in one point. Thus the triple junction was of the ridge-fault-fault (RFF) type. Conrad transform, stretching to the west, connected the end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the South American-Antarctic Ridge. Bouvet transform linked it to the Southwest Indian Ridge on the eastern side. Currently Conrad transform and Bouvet transform are no longer connected to each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is retreating northward, at a rate of . New spreading sections of the South American-Antarctic Ridge and the Southwest Indian Ridge are growing northward from the eastern end of Conrad transform and the western end of Bouvet transform respectively, striving for the shifting triple point. Thus the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is opening like a zipper. The new spreading sections are somewhat unusual: * One new spreading section of the South American-Antarctic Ridge is not perpendicular to Conrad fault, violating the perpendicular pattern of alternating spreading ridges and transform faults generally seen on slowly spreading oceanic ridges. * The new part of the Southwest Indian Ridge is masked by the recently formed Spiess Seamount. This volcanic seamount is the highest point in the area after Bouvet Island. Spiess Seamount was named after captain Fritz Spie√ü of the German Meteor expedition of 1926.

A high level of sediment in the Logan River due to thunderstorm activity Stream load is a geologic term referring to the solid matter carried by a stream (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). Erosion and bed shear stress continually remove mineral material from the bed and banks of the stream channel, adding this material to the regular flow of water. The amount of solid load that a stream can carry, or stream capacity, is measured in metric tons per day, passing a given location. Stream capacity is dependent upon the stream's velocity, the amount of water flow, and the gradation (because streams that occur on steeper slopes tend to have greater flow and velocity) (Strahler and Strahler, 2006).  Types of stream erosion  There are two main sources of stream erosion: hydraulic action and abrasion. All of the materials added to normal stream flow through these processes increase the overall stream load (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). = Hydraulic action = Hydraulic action describes the erosion caused by the dragging of water over the stream bed and bank. This dragging, coupled with the impact of small parties, easily loosens and erodes smaller alluvial matter, such as gravel, sand, silt and clay (Mangelsdorf, 1990). One powerful example of hydraulic action is bank caving, which normally occurs when a stream loosens sediment and undercuts a bank. Consequently, large masses of sediment slump and collapse into the stream, adding significantly to the stream's load (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). The severity of hydraulic action increases with stream velocity and current stream load. = Abrasion = Abrasion occurs when larger rock particles roll and strike against bedrock walls, chipping and splintering particles and pieces of rock (Strahler and Strahler). As these cobbles and boulders roll across the stream bed, they continue to crush and grind the bedrock, producing an assortment of eroded rock sizes (Ritter, 2006). Again, the severity of this type of erosion is dependent upon stream velocity and stream load (i.e. the presence of larger rock particles)..  Types of stream load  Mineral materials of many different shapes and particle sizes erode and contribute to overall stream load. Differences in the size of those materials determine how they will be transported down stream. Stream load is broken into three types: dissolved load, suspended load, and bed load (Ritter, 2006). = Dissolved load = Dissolved matter is invisible, and is transported in the form of chemical ions. All streams carry some type of dissolved load. This type of load can result from mineral alteration from chemical erosion, or may even be the result of groundwater seepage into the stream. Materials comprising the dissolved load have the smallest particle size of the three load types (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). = Suspended load = Suspended load is composed of fine sediment particles suspended and transported through the stream. These materials are too large to be dissolved, but too small to lie on the bed of the stream (Mangelsdorf, 1990). Stream flow keeps these suspended materials, such as clay and silt, from settling on the stream bed. Suspended load is the result of material eroded by hydraulic action at the stream surface bordering the channel as well as erosion of the channel itself. Suspended load accounts for the largest majority of stream load (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). = Bed load = Bed load rolls slowly along the floor of the stream. These include the largest and heaviest materials in the stream, ranging from sand and gravel to cobbles and boulders. There are two main ways to transport bed load: traction and saltation. Traction describes the ‚Äúscooting and rolling‚Äù of particles along the bed (Ritter, 2006). In stream load transport, saltation is a bounce-like movement, occurring when large particles are suspended in the stream for a short distance after which they fall to the bed, dislodging particles from the house. The dislodged particles move downstream a short distance where they fall to the bed, again loosening bed load particles upon impact (Ritter, 2006). Dissolved and suspended load move with the natural stream flow, while the heavier bed load rolls across the floor of the stream. Increased suspended load gives this flooded stream its muddy color.  Flood and stream load  Floods create a scenario in which stream flow and velocity are unusually high due to the drastic addition of water to a stream. These heightened characteristics increase both the potential of stream erosion and heavier stream load (Knighton, 1998). Flooded streams are often responsible for heavy sediment transportation and deposition downstream. Stream capacity is greatly increased during a flood (Knighton, 1998). During a flood, increased suspended load may be visible, giving the stream a muddy color. See also * Rouse number * Sediment * Sediment transport * Wash load  References  *Knighton, David. (1998).

Its name is derived from the MicroDVD Player, a media player application designed to play DVD videos along with subtitles, originally developed by Tiamat Software. The application was first released in 2000 but development ended in 2001. Media players that support the format are able to interpret MicroDVD subtitles and mix their contents with their corresponding video files.  Format  = Specification = MicroDVD subtitle files have the ' filename extension. These files may come along with a video file and/or created/modified by the user. Media player applications that support external subtitle files are usually responsible for locating correct files. MicroDVD subtitle files consist of multiple lines, each defining a portion of the subtitle text that must be displayed between certain given video frames. The line syntax is: \`{start-frame}{stop- frame}Text\` For example, if \\"Hello!\\" is to be displayed during the first 25 frames of a digital video, clip or movie, the corresponding file must contain the line: \`{0}{25}Hello!\` The duration of the text being displayed depends on the frame rate of the corresponding video file. For example, if the frame rate of the corresponding video file is 25 frames per seconds and the subtitle file in last example is accompanied with, \\"Hello!\\" is displayed for one second. The software the MicroDVD Player expects the subtitle file to begin with the tag [BEGIN], and end with the tag [END]. = Control Codes = The font size cannot be configured in .sub files, only in player, but the font style of the subtitle displayed may be changed using control codes. The available control codes and their purposeMicroDVD Player Documentation are given: The control code \`y\` defines font style. \`{0}{25}{y:i}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed in italic. \`{0}{25}{y:b}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed in bold. \`{0}{25}{y:u}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is underlined. \`{0}{25}{y:s}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is stroked. The control code \`f\` defines font name. \`{0}{25}{f:fontname}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed using the defined font, with the string \\"fontname\\" determining the desired font. For example: \`{0}{25}{f:Arial}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed in the Arial typeface. The control code \`s\` defines font size. \`{0}{25}{s:size}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed at the defined font size, with the string \\"size\\" determining the desired size as an integer number. For example: \`{0}{25}{s:10}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed at the font size of 10. The control code \`c\` defines font color. \`{0}{25}{c:$BBGGRR}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed in a defined color. The color format is: $BBGGRR (8 bits blue, 8 bits green and 8 bits red). For example: \`{0}{25}{c:$0000FF}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed in full intensity red. Note that this is not standard RGB color model, instead the color order is reversed. The control code \`P\` defines subtitle position relative to video. \`{0}{25}{P:X,Y}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" is displayed at the coordinates (X,Y). Each line in the subtitle normally displays as a single line. However, the pipe character may be used to break a single line into multiple lines. For example: \`{0}{25}Hello! How are you?\` The above code displays as follows: \`Hello! How are you?\` On the other hand, \`{0}{25}Hello!How are you?\` The above code displays as follows: \`Hello!\` \`How are you?\` In this case, it is possible to define display values of each line or the whole subtitle line . If the control code is in upper case, it affects the whole subtitle line. If the control code is in lower case, it affects only the line it is contained in. For example: \`{0}{25}{Y:i}Hello!How are you?\` The above code will display as two lines of italic text. But, \`{0}{25}{y:i}Hello!{y:b}How are you?\` The above code will display as two lines; the first line in italic, and the second line in bold. Note that if no more code is used after a pipe character, the following lines will retain the same formatting. Note that the subtitle positioning code \`P\` must be logically always used in uppercase. It is also possible to use multiple codes at once. Here is an example: \`{0}{25}{c:$0000ff}{y:b,u}{f:DeJaVuSans}{s:12}Hello!\` \\"Hello!\\" will be displayed underlined and in bold, in red and in the DeJaVuSans font at 12 points. The default display values for a complete subtitle file may be defined using \`{DEFAULT}\`, which will override particular line formattings. For example, the following code may be used to display all subtitle line using DeJaVuSans at 10 points and in blue: \`{DEFAULT}{C:$FF0000}{F:DeJaVuSans}{S:10}\` This line of code may be placed anywhere in the subtitle file. Also note that in this case, all control codes are in uppercase. There is also a code \`H\` to define a particular character set to use: \`{DEFAULT}{H:Greek}\` Defines that the Greek character set should be used. This code can be used only in the {DEFAULT} line.

It runs along the sea-floor from the Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic Ocean south- westward to a major transform fault boundary east of the South Sandwich Islands. Near the Bouvet Triple Junction the spreading half rate is , which is slow, and the SAAR has the rough topography characteristic of slow-spreading ridges. Geologic setting The boundary between the South American and Antarctic plates can be divided into three parts of which the SAAR forms the eastern third: The first stretches from the Chile Triple Junction in the Chile Trench at 46¬∞S to the western Straits of Magellan at 52¬∞S. Since 15 Ma, the oceanic crust of the Antarctic plate is being slowly subducted () under South America along this trench which is currently extending northward. In the central part, between the Straits of Magellan and the South Sandwich Trench, the two large continental plates are separated by the Scotia Plate and a number of smaller plates east of it. During the past 40 Ma (or since the opening of the Drake Passage) the South Sandwich Trench has been migrating eastward due to the evolution of a back-arc basin, effectively consuming the SAAR. The third eastern part, i.e. the 'SAAR proper', has two long and several shorter transform faults separating short north-to-south-directed ridge crests. The motion in the SAAR is currently c. westward but it was originally closer to north-south. It can be inferred, based on fracture zone topography and magnetic anomalies in the Weddell Sea, that this change in direction occurred during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The western part of the SAAR is dominated by the earthquake-intensive South Sandwich island arc, fore-arc, and trench. East of these structures the SAAR is composed of a series of north- south-oriented ridge crests, median valleys, and east-west-oriented transform faults. The major transform faults (from the east to the west) are the Konrad (displacement about 190 km),the Bullard (displacement more than 700 km), the Volcano (displacement about 100 km), and the southernmost South Sandwich (displacement up to 320 km) transform faults. The topography of the SAAR is extreme, with valleys reaching deeper than adjacent ridges in average and maximum depth exceeding 3 km. The SAAR is more shallow near the Bouvet Triple Junction. The Bouvet Triple junction is between the American, African, and Antarctic lithospheric plates which has geographical coordinates of 55¬∞S, 0¬∞E. North of the SAAR the South Sandwich Plate consumes the South American Plate at a rate of 65.8 mm/yr driven by back-arc extension. This fast subduction has broken off the southern part of the South American Plate between the north- eastern end of the South Sandwich Arc and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, leaving a separate microplate called 'Sur' (Spanish for 'South') north of the SAAR. The southern part of this Sur microplate has probably also been broken off and is subducting independently under the South Sandwich Arc. Tectonic evolution The break-up of Gondwana began in the Mid- to Late Jurassic in what is today the Mozambique Basin east of Africa, whereas the South American and African plates started to break apart during the Early Cretaceous. Between these events neither the Mid-Atlantic Ridge nor the Bouvet Triple Junction existed and the SAAR formed a continuous ridge together with the Southwest Indian Ridge. Around 106 Ma the eastern end of the Falkland Plateau separated from the Agulhas Bank, opening the South Atlantic which, however, remained an enclosed basin north of the Falkland Plateau until 85‚Äì83 Ma. Around 97 Ma the Northeast Georgia Rise (today north of the Scotia Plate) and the Maud Rise (off Antarctica) were located next to the Agulhas Plateau (south of South Africa) where the Bouvet hotspot formed the Southern Ocean Large Igneous Province (112‚Äì93 Ma). The Bouvet Triple Junction, today considered an R-F-F (ridge-fault-fault) type triple junction, was an R-R-R type before anomaly 28 (c. 64 Ma), which means that before the Scotia Plate started to develop in the Mid-Tertiary, only ridges and transform faults separated Africa, Antarctica, and South America. The north‚Äìsouth motion of Antarctica relative to Africa and South America before anomaly 28 changed to a slow east‚Äìwest clockwise motion around 60 Ma, an abrupt change coincident with change in triple junction configuration. During the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene Antarctica and South America separated at a rate of only 0.3 cm/yr. The brief opening of small extensional basins south of Tierra del Fuego initiated the opening of the Drake Passage around 49 Ma after which the spreading rate increased eight-fold to 2.4 cm/yr. As the Antarctic‚ÄîSouth American plate motion changed from north to north-west during this period, oceanic crust in the north-west Weddell Sea started to subduct on the eastern side of the Drake land bridge‚Äîthe eastward migration of the South Sandwich Trench had begun.

Grigoris was trampled to death by mounted Maskut soldiers in the Vatnik Valley, near the present-day village of Nughdi 37 south of Derbent.Ren√© Grousset, Histoire de l'Arm√©nie, Payot, Paris, 1973 S. 130 According to the history of Faustus Byuzand, Sanesan was a member of the Arsacid Dynasty and ruled lands bordering the Kura river. During the reign of his kinsman Khosrov III the Small, he invaded Armenia with an army of various peoples including Huns and Alans in 337. After occupying Armenia for most of a year, he was defeated and killed by the Armenian general Vatche Mamikonian. Sanesan's people, the Mazk'kut'k, have variously been identified as the Massagetae or as the Meskheti.Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen, ed.

The classification of a high-yield stock is relative to the criteria of any given analyst. Some analysts may consider a 2% dividend yield to be high, while other may consider 2% to be low. There is no set standard for judging whether a dividend yield is high or low. Many analysts do however use indicators such as the previously mentioned comparison between the stock's dividend yield and the 10-Year US Treasury Note. Indices Several stock indexes are based on high-yield stocks, such as Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index and FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. S&P; High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index contains companies that have raised their dividends. Equity securities of companies in the utilities industry typically pay relatively high dividends.  Concept  A high dividend yield indicates undervaluation of the stock because the stock's dividend is high relative to the stock price. High dividend yields are a particularly sought after by income and value investors. High-yield stocks tend to outperform low yield and no yield stocks during bear markets because many investors consider dividend paying stocks to be less risky. Dividend Aristocrats Dividend aristocrats are known for decades of consecutive years of dividend increases, this does not necessarily mean they have high dividend yields. In fact, the average yield for the dividend aristocrats ETF is between 1.8% and 2.4%. Nonetheless, picking stocks from the top yielding dividend aristocrats is a method for boosting portfolio yields, with the average high yield aristocrat offering investors about a 4% return, with the safety of decades of dividend increases backing up each stock.  Dogs of the Dow  The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a well-known simple strategy which incorporates high dividend yields. The strategy dictates that the investor compile a list of the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and buying an equal position in all 10 at the beginning of each year. At the end of each year, the investor finds the 10 highest dividend yield stocks again, and reallocates their positions so as to have an equal position in all 10 Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of the Dow made a compounded annual return of 18% from 1975 to 1999 outperforming the market by 3%. This would make $10,000 turn into $625,000 in 25 years.  The Dow 5  The Dow 5 strategy is a variation of the Dogs of the Dow strategy. This strategy dictates the investor compile a list of the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and buy the 5 lowest priced of those 10 stocks at the beginning of each year. At the end of every year, the investor remakes the list, and reallocates their positions so as to have an equal position in all 5 stocks. This strategy has made an annual return of 19.4% from 1975 to 1999. This would make $10,000 turn into $840,000 in 25 years.  Foolish Four  The Foolish Four strategy was a strategy popularized on the investing website The Motley Fool. The Foolish Four was almost certainly a result of data dredging. From the time of its discovery onward, it has been famously unreliable in its returns, and even its original creators have since disowned it.

The original shot tower was completed in 1832 and manufactured lead shot until 1860. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The park abuts the Wisconsin River and is bordered by state-owned land comprising the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway. Natural history The bluffs along the Wisconsin River are formed of Jordan Sandstone. The park lies within the Driftless Area, a region of the American Midwest that remained ice-free through three successive ice ages. In the 19th century the Wisconsin River flowed directly past the base of the bluffs. The river has since shifted slightly, and a stream known as Mill Creek marks the northern boundary of the park. History of the shot tower Shot towers harness the effects of surface tension on liquids in free-fall, a technique developed in 1782. Molten lead can be poured through a strainer at the top of a tower or shaft. The droplets become spherical as they fall and cool in this shape during their descent. The pellets are caught in a water basin to break their fall and finish cooling. In 1830 a businessman from Green Bay, Wisconsin, named Daniel Whitney was traveling along the Wisconsin River and recognized a sharp bluff near the town of Helena as a promising location for a shot tower. Lead deposits had recently been discovered in several locations around Iowa County. From the top of the bluff there was a sheer drop, below which the sandstone cliff sloped down to the riverbank, below the clifftop. Whitney formed the Wisconsin Shot Company with some other investors, and set his employee John Metcalf to oversee construction. The cliff was a convenient headstart, but Metcalf needed someone to continue a shaft for the remaining to ground level. Access to the bottom of the shaft, where the lead shot would be collected, necessitated a horizontal tunnel. In 1831 Thomas B. Shaunce, a 22-year-old lead miner in Galena, Illinois, was hired for the task. Shaunce worked mostly alone but received some assistance from a friend named Malcom Smith. They dug with pickaxes and a gad, using gunpowder to loosen the harder rock of the lower layers. Shaunce used a plumb-bob to ensure that he was keeping the shaft perfectly straight, and a windlass to haul out the broken rock. Shaunce calculated where to begin digging the horizontal tunnel by standing across the water and sighting with his rifle directly below the top of the shaft. He dug in from the riverbank, using a line of stakes to maintain his alignment. When he first broke through from the horizontal tunnel to the bottom of the shaft, a blast of air knocked Shaunce unconscious and collapsed one of his lungs. The project took 187 working days, interrupted in the spring of 1832 when Shaunce and Smith both returned to Galena and enlisted in the Illinois Militia to fight in the Black Hawk War. Shaunce had been contracted to be paid $1000 for his work, but was ultimately offered land instead. A smelting house was built at the top of the cliff, and the drop from there to the opening of Shaunce's tunnel was enclosed with a wooden shaft. A finishing house was built on the riverbank, where the shot was dried, graded, and sorted. This was joined by a warehouse and docks. In 1836 Whitney sold the property to a group of businessmen from New York for $10,000. Later Cadwallader C. Washburn and a business partner purchased the site. In 1852 they replaced the finishing house and installed steam-operated equipment, nearly doubling the operation's productivity. The shot tower was operated by a crew of six, producing between 600 and 800 pounds of quality shot per day. Miscast pieces were melted and reused. The finished shot, graded by size, was transported to Milwaukee and then shipped east. Operations ceased in 1860 during an economic downturn, and the buildings and equipment were sold away. The village of Helena was abandoned soon after. Thomas Shaunce died around 1860 as well. Throughout his life he experienced respiratory trouble from the air blast in the tunnel, and felt he had been cheated of his proper payment. Historians have noted that the Helena Shot Tower, which allowed a frontier resource to be shipped in a finished form, was significant in the settlement and prosperity of southwestern Wisconsin. The overland teamster route developed to transport the operation's output to the east evolved into a road and then a rail line. Returning wagon teams brought supplies and immigrants. Southwestern Wisconsin, once more closely tied to the Southern United States via the Mississippi River, built a population and culture closer to the northeast. Later history Log gazebo remaining from the Tower Hill Pleasure Company In 1889 the site was purchased for $60 by the prominent Unitarian minister Jenkin Lloyd Jones, a member of a well-known Welsh-American family in the region. He created a recreational and educational retreat called the Tower Hill Pleasure Company, which provided outdoor recreation, visiting lecturers, books, and music. The retreat grew to include 25 cottages, as well as a dining pavilion, tennis courts, and other structures. One 1894 lecturer, a history professor, spent his free time excavating the shot tower's shaft and recovered several pieces of equipment which Lloyd Jones donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society. In 1911 Jones' nephew Frank Lloyd Wright began building his studio Taliesin on a neighboring hill. After Lloyd Jones died in 1918 his wife Edith donated the site to the state, and Tower Hill State Park was officially created in 1922. The smelting house and wooden shaft were rebuilt between 1970 and 1971 by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Wisconsin Historical Society. In 2006 parts of a horror film called Witches' Night were filmed within the state park. Recreation Tower Hill State Park is open from May to October. Visitors can enter several historical structures. The smelting house contains exhibits about the construction and use of the shot tower. Structures remaining from the Tower Hill Pleasure Company include the pavilion (now the park's picnic shelter), a gazebo, and the foundation of a barn. There are two miles (3 km) of trails leading up to the tower and down to the riverbank, where visitors can enter the horizontal tunnel to the bottom of the shaft. There is a small campground with 15 campsites, drinking water, and pit toilets. Nearby attractions include Taliesin, the American Players Theatre, the House on the Rock, and Governor Dodge State Park.

During the early modern period, the Ottoman Empire called it an Ahidname-i-Humayun or an imperial pledge and the Ahdname functioned as an official agreement between the Empire and various European states.Goffman, Daniel. ‚ÄúNegotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.‚Äù in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge (Page 63). .(Page 64). Historical background The Ahdname still requires much detailed study regarding its historical background and about what type of document it was. What is known however is that the Ahdname was an important part of Ottoman diplomacy in that it set forth a contractual agreement between two states, usually between the Ottoman Empire and European nations, like Venice.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002 (Page 187). It was influential in the way it helped to structure society and maintained the agreements made between nation states.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.(Page 187). In Venice, Adhnames were also used to maintain political and commercial links with the Ottoman Empire. This agreement between Venice and the Ottoman Empire ensured that Italian merchants were protected during their commerce trips into the Empire. These Ahdnames also provided a certain level of physical protection as they helped provide Italian merchants with hospice.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.(Page 193). After all, Venice was very aware that in order to protect the strength of their commerce, it was imperative to remain to in good standing with the Ottoman Empire.Goffman, Daniel. ‚ÄúNegotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.‚Äù in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge (Page 63). By the 16th Century, Venice aimed its policy towards the preservation of peaceful relations with the Ottomans. After the 1453 Conquest of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire had become Europe's most powerful force. As a result, Venice had to tread carefully in order not to instigate any conflicts. Ahdnames became a useful tool in communication between the two competing forces.Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 1-3). The majority of the Ahdnames that the Ottoman Empire and Venice drafted always occurred after a war between the two, such as the two wars they were embroiled in during 1503 and 1540. The remaining treaties were simply edited for better quality and protection willingly by both the Empire and Venice.Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 249). Structure of the Ahdname The Ottoman Ahdname was typically broken down into several sections. Every Ahdname usually had several parts called the erkan (sing. rukn), which were deemed to be the internal structuring of the document.Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 188). Not every Ahdname had similar erkan however. Instead the text was found between two protocols calls the introductory protocol and the final protocol or eschatocol. The introductory protocol, main text, and eschatocol consisted of the several erkan: *The invocation, where the name of God appeared *The intitulatio, where the name and rank of the person to whom the document was meant for appeared. His official title and rank also appeared. *The inscriptio, where addresses of the person to whom the document was issued for appeared. *The salutatio, where the formal greeting appeared. Then, the Ahdname would continue on with the main text of the document and would include the following erkan: *The expositio- narratio, where an explanation for the document is issued and any other events are described in detail. *The dispositio, where a decision that has been made is detailed. *The sanctio, which is both a confirming of the dispositio as well as a warning. At times it also functioned as an oath. *The corroboratio, which was an authentication of the document in question. It was an examination of the validity of the Ahdname. *The datatio, which was the date of which the document was issued to its receiver. *The locatio, which was the place in which the document was issued. *The legitimatio, which was again another form of authentication of the document. Often, the authenticator was the Sultan or the Grand Vizier or simply a seal. This is the final part of the Ahdname to be written, so it is part of the eschatocol.Theunissen, Hans. Ottoman-Venetian Diplomatics: The Ahd-names. 1998. (Page 188-189). It is important to note, that while this was the general makeup of the Ahdnames, it was not always stringently followed as such. Historian, Daniel Goffman, writes that those that composed Ahdnames seemed to have, \\"drawn upon Islamic, sultanic, and even local legal codes as the situations warranted.\\"Goffman, Daniel. ‚ÄúNegotiating with the Renaissance State: the Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.‚Äù in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire.

His army, with local support, was able to defeat the Legitimist party (Aristocratic) and conclude the Nicaraguan civil war. Background A civil war was then raging in the Central American republic of Nicaragua. The Liberal party (Democratic) and the Legitimist party (Aristocratic), were constantly warring with one another as they tried to gain political control through violent means. \\"During a period of six years Nicaragua had had no fewer than fifteen presidents.\\" When Walker first arrived with The Falange (Filibuster mercenary/adventurer army), he proposed this venture as a show of strength. The battle \\"Colonel\\" Walker had under his command a force of about 45 filibusters armed entirely with rifles and revolvers, and a native contingent of about 100 men. The two groups were arrayed in a column marching formation with the filibusters in front, ammo and supply pack-horses in the middle, and the natives bringing up the rear. About a half of a mile from the town, he met with his senior officers and notified them of his plan. Walker's two \\"captains\\" were to advance into the city and drive the Legitimists from the streets, while the natives were to follow closely behind to provide protection for their rear and flanks. The Americans advanced into the city at about 12 pm, absorbing most of their casualties in this first clash.With Walker in Nicaragua: Or, Reminiscences of an Officer of the American Falange By James Carson Jamison They halted some of the way into the city, to reload and for some respite, expecting further action. But the natives, still some distance from the fighting were interdicted by a large body of Legitimists troops, and believing Walker's contingent to be destroyed the Democratic leader retreated from Rivas. Walker and his men, still held up in a small patch of houses, all the while reaping a heavy toll upon the Legitimist forces with their rifles noticed that they were alone. Legitimist forces attempted to bring up a small cannon to shell the filibusters out of the homes, but it was disabled in a sally by the mercenaries. The Legitmists then attempted to burn the filibusters out of the homes, succeeding in setting one alight. At this point, after four hours of combat, the order to retreat was called by Walker. The first men out of the houses surprised the Nicaraguans closest to them, and the remainder of the Legitimist forces were momentarily stunned by the American advance. As a result of the confusion, the filibusters were able to withdraw with only one more fatality.  Aftermath  Walker withdrew to friendlier territory, and his forces were augmented by hundreds of filibusters and natives. According to various sources, Walker and his men inflicted such heavy casualties upon the nationals, that they were forced to withdraw from the city in the aftermath of the battle. Although by all measures, (including his own) his forces were defeated, Walker conquered the city.

By age 15, she had already received offers to tour in several bands, one of which was Zephyr which featured her childhood friend, future Deep Purple guitarist Tommy Bolin, but was forbidden to do so by her parents. There is a controversy about the year when Boleyn was born, partly because Bolin formed Zephyr in 1969, when Boleyn was nine years old. Kim Fowley brings Ann Boleyn to Hollywood In 1976, while still a teenager in high school, producer Kim Fowley recruited her to join The Runaways as the bass player. According to the liner-notes of the \\"Queen of Hell\\" anthology album, after she threatened to run away, Boleyn's parents finally allowed her to leave her home in Washington State and move to Hollywood. Ann Boleyn acknowledges that, from the moment she met Fowley, she did not see eye-to-eye with him. Other accounts relate that guitarist Tommy Bolin convinced her not to join the band and that the verse \\"Just keep me out of L.A., things are crazy out there\\" from his song Post Toastee referred to Fowley's management of the all-female band. Ann Boleyn has stated in interviews that she was never a member of The Runaways, even though Fowley brought her to Hollywood. Ann has never been officially acknowledged as having ever been a member of The Runaways. Movies Ann was spotted by Hal Guthu, a modeling agent who had been the still photographer and cinematographer for Edward D. Wood, Jr. Although Hal Guthu rarely accepted brunettes, he made an exception with Boleyn, who he said reminded him of Vampira when interviewed in the August 1984 edition of CineBeat. Through Hal Guthu, Ann Boleyn became featured in a number of B-rate horror movies for which she used other names, allegedly to avoid embarrassment to her family. Some, have speculated that Boleyn was under-age at the time many of her movies were filmed. Ann Boleyn's music, singing, and screams also can be heard on various sound tracks, including The Return of the Living Dead, Part II. Radio host on KROQ in Los Angeles By 1977, Ann Boleyn emerged as the midnight-to-six DJ at Los Angeles Radio Station KROQ-FM, where she hosted a show that specialized in fast-paced metal and punk. By the time the station decided to alter its format to \\"the rock of the 80's\\", Boleyn's show had become known as \\"Speed Metal Hell\\", a term Boleyn later used for the heavy metal compilations albums she would later produce. Keyboard work in Los Angeles From the mid-1970s, until about 1981, Ann Boleyn only played keyboards. Both Ann Boleyn and Yngwie Malmsteen are featured on the debut release by Third Stage Alert, which was signed to Metal Blade Records. Boleyn also was a member of Beowulf, a band originally from Minneapolis which included future Accept and Bangalore Choir lead singer, David Reece, future Hellion guitarist Ray Schenck and British guitarist, Chris Voysey. Reece left the band and replaced Udo Dirkschneider in Accept. Hellion In 1981 or 1982, Ann Boleyn together with guitarist Ray Schenck, bassist Peyton Tuthill, and drummer Sean Kelley formed Hellion. Unable to find a singer, Ann Boleyn and Ray Schenck handled vocals. This is also when Boleyn adopted her stage name. The group released a series of albums which were met with varying success. They were signed to Music For Nations in England, Roadrunner Records in Europe, Pony Canyon in Japan, and New Renaissance Records in the USA. In 1984, Hellion's Mini album was voted #4 record of the year in Kerrang and Sounds Magazine. Hellion played multiple nights to capacity crowds at London's Marquee Club. In 1984, famed metal vocalist, Ronnie James Dio offered to produce Hellion.Artist Direct. \\"Hellion Biography\\" Artist Direct Around the same time, Wendy Dio, the wife of Ronnie James Dio, began managing Hellion through her company, Niji Productions. A song that was produced by Ronnie James Dio and engineered by Angelo Arcuri was released on Roadrunner Records. Hellion was set to be the co-headliner with Hanoi Rocks, but the tour was cancelled after the death of Hanoi Rocks's drummer Razzle. In addition to headlining a variety of clubs and small theaters, Hellion also served as a support act for artists including Dio, Whitesnake, W.A.S.P., and others. In 1986, Ann Boleyn was fired from Hellion and replaced with a male singer, Richard Parico. After a legal dispute about the ownership of the name Hellion, Boleyn's former members and Parico changed the band name to Burn. Ann Boleyn retained the name Hellion and invited drummer Greg Pecka (formerly of Dokken), bassist Alex Campbell (formerly of Lion, and guitarist Chet Thompson to join the band. Niji Productions continued to represent Burn, but fired Hellion in 1986. Next, Boleyn formed New Renaissance Records, which put out the first commercial recordings and helped develop the careers of then unknown bands such as Sepultura, Bathory, Flotsam & Jetsam, At War, Morbid Angel and Wehrmacht. Other label acts included Deadly Blessing, Amulance, Blood Feast, Necrophagia, Dream Death, Ill will, Indestroy, Sarcastic, Artillery, Mayhem, and more. Actor, Johnny Depp's band, Rock City Angels was also signed to New Renaissance Records before landing a deal with Geffen Records. In 2004, Ann Boleyn graduated from UCLA, with a Bachelor's degree in Germanic languages, where she specialized in the study of the Old Norse language. She obtained her law degree in 2007 from the University of La Verne. In 2008, Boleyn appeared at a number of music festivals, singing with Detente where she was filling in for the late Dawn Crosby who died in 1996. Boleyn has since been replaced by Tiina Teal.D√âTENTE Parts Ways With Singer, Announces Replacement Nov. 22, 2009 In June 2013, Boleyn announced that she was forming a new incarnation of Hellion.Official Web Page for Hellion June 22, 2013 In late 2013, Boleyn entered Total Access Studios in Redondo Beach, California, along with Simon Wright, Bjorn Englen, and Maxxxwell Carlisle, and began recording the first new Hellion songs in over a decade. In December 2013, Hellion announced that it had signed a record deal with Cherry Red Records for the release of an anthology CD and for the eventual release of Hellion's extensive back catalogue in Europe and the United Kingdom. On April 1, 2014, Hellion released a 2-disc CD anthology . On October 2, 2014, Hellion embarked on a tour of North America in support of their Karma's A Bitch mini-album. The touring line-up of Hellion includes Greg Smith on bass, Simon Wright on drums, Scott Warren on keyboards, Maxxxwell Carlisle on lead guitar, Georg Dolivo as special guest rhythm guitarist, and founding member Ann Boleyn on vocals. Hellion's latest album, Karma's A Bitch, was released on New Renaissance Records in North America and on Cherry Red Records in Europe and Great Britain on October 7, 2014. In the fall of 2014, Ann Boleyn toured with Hellion on a North American tour.Official Web Page for Hellion November 18, 2014 Vocal Range Ann Boleyn's voice is classified as dramatic contralto.

Casato focuses on the vertical lineage passed on from fathers to sons. It is also known as the agnatic perspective. This is different from the opposing term parentado which stresses kinship formation that included the role of women and men. Both casato and parentado coexisted in early modern Italy.  History  In 1684, a prominent Roman jurist by the name of Cardinal Giovanni Battista de Luca published a comment regarding a law previously passed by Pope Innocent XI in 1680. This law sought to exclude women from interstate succession, by upholding municipal law. This was authorized in 187 communities of the Papal state, along with key cities including Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Turin, Pisa, Siena, Lucia, and Mantua. De Luca's comment brings to light the patrilineal and bilineal view of kinship in early modern Italy. While Roman and municipal law co-existed in Italy's legal pluralism, they differed regarding women and their place regarding inheritance rules. \\"Although Roman law excluded women from all legal and political positions on the grounds of their inability to act on behalf of others, it did acknowledge their right to own and dispose of property, and gave daughters and sons equal inheritance rights to their father's estate\\". The legal condition of women stemmed from late medieval city statutes. Municipal statutes limited women's right to inherit as they receive a dowry at the time of marriage. This sought to set forth a form of male guardianship over all women, particularly their property. Jurists justified their decision to exclude daughters from inheritance by \\"the preservation of the family, as defined by agnation or the male line\\". Agnation and cognation differ in that the former refers to a relation through someone male and the latter to a relation through either gender. Agnation under Roman law never implied women's exclusion from inheritance, but rather specified that a daughter's inheritance rights cam through her father. Once the corpus juris civilis was rediscovered in the 12th century, most cities in Italy passed \\"laws of their own that excluded women from succession\\".  Casato vs. Parentado (agnatic vs. cognatic)  The agnatic and cognatic kinship lines are at odds with each other. The agnatic/casato view is the vertical chain of fathers to sons, while parentado/cognatic view is based on relationships which include matrilineal kinship. Thus, the agnatic perspective removed women from the family map, whereas with the cognatic view, women were involved and seen as agents in kinship tie construction (through marital alliances and the exchange of dowries). It is also imperative to stress that both the agnatic and cognatic views existed simultaneously in Italy from antiquity up to the end of the ancient regime. \\"The two principles did not represent successive stages in the evolution of kinship but two coexisting ways to think about the family which would be complementary but also in conflict with each other\\". Casa/casato refers to the agnatic perspective, and parentado refers to the cognatic perspective.  Women and agnatic lineage  Restrictions placed on women were strongest in regards to property. The favored primogeniture and lineage based on agnatic lines (or patrilineage) restricted a woman's right to inherit, and in specific parts of Europe, of dower. Lineage based on the male line, under which the eldest son inherited the majority of the estate, became standard from the 11th and 12th centuries onward. \\"It was accepted that daughters had a right to a share in the family property, and in many areas the dowry came to be regarded as the daughter's share\\". In the 15th centuries, Castilian brides were at times asked to forfeit their rights to the remainder of the family estate once they married and received their dowry. As the provision of a dowry became essential for marriage, patrilineage increased in importance. By the 13th century, the dowry had largely taken the place of brideprice or bridewealth, given by the husband or his family on his marriage. Dower, the money/property given by the husband to his wife so that she might support herself should she become widowed, became less important and women's right to dispose of property became more limited. Such changes were correlated with a woman's influence and standing in the family, and in society. There were great regional differentiations in the laws on women's inheritance and dower. In southern Europe, male inheritance was the norm, as it was perpetuated through the influence of the lineage. It was commonplace for the oldest son to inherit the house and other real property, along with the bulk of the estate. A smaller portion was divided among the younger sons, while the daughters received their dowry. By the early 13th century, similar circumstances were occurring in Spain. At Barcelona, a single male heir who inherited the majority of the family's property was becoming the norm. Nonetheless, daughters still received inheritance from their parents alongside their dowries. The dowry was considered as the \\"wife's property, although usually administered by the husband\\". In England, Scotland, and Wales, women were seen as the weaker sex, both physically and emotionally. These references of women strengthened a patriarchal society. \\"Being less rational than men, women should submit to the authority of their husbands and masters\\". During early modern times, the family was seen as a miniature version of the state. The authority of the king was dependent upon an equivalent recognition of the authority of the husband in the household. It was assumed that patriarchy, hierarchy, and monarchy would both stand together and fall together.  The Entail  During the 14th and 15th centuries, there were attempts to strengthen male inheritance in both southern and northern Europe. Such moves were witnessed among the nobility and strengthened the idea of a family as an empire built on lineage that was centred on a male head of household and embedded \\"in chivalry and the heroism of its ancestors\\". The entail established itself to be a successful means of reinforcing the patrilineage. \\"By this means, the succession to the estate was legally settled during the father's lifetime, usually on the eldest son, and could not be overturned after his death\\". In England, members of the higher nobility created entails to guarantee male succession, such as John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Further, male heirs were also favoured in Ireland and Scotland.

Its secretariat is in Nairobi. Trade association for flower industry The Council is involved in issues of industry lobbying, worker safety, environmental protection, industrial regulation, industrial development and flower farming company accreditation, as well as more weighty issues of global carbon dioxide emissions and international industrial diplomacy. KFC Code of Practice (CoP) is assigned to the whole flower industry in Kenya, promoting good agricultural practice, sustainability and social accountability, while hygiene health and safety is highly respected along with capacity building, environmental protection and conservation to adhere to. In 1970, Kenya did not export floriculture crops, and it is currently the major exporter to the European Union, as an exporter of 38% of cut flower into the EU. The main European Union markets are Holland, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland. Kenya‚Äôs export of cut flowers for international flower market started to expand in 1990, both in volume and value year by year. It was 10,946 tons in 1988, 86,480 tons (2006) and reached 122,825 tons in 2015. According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2014, the flower farming industry earned Kshs 54.6 billion. The Kenya Flower Council was formed in 1996 to represent those independent Kenyan cut flower and ornamental plant growers with exporters, and its membership counts approximately 100 enlisted as of August 2016Major players in the industry includes but not limited to Finlay Flowers Ltd, Flamingo HorOculture Kenya Ltd, Kariki Group, Mzurri Farms, P. J. Dave Farms, Sian Agriflora Farms, and Vegpro Group. with 3,000 small scale out growers. That membership provides over 65% of the flowers exported. The increasing demand in the UK market especially on mixed bouquets encouraged more direct sales from Kenya, in contrast to the conventional auction system. However, as Kenyan flower industry has grown to dominate the UK market, social and environmental strains was caused rooted in the rose farms surrounding Lake Naivasha which was brought to the attention of EU media. Lobbying in the EU In 2015, Kenya Flower Council announced to the flower industry to put up programs and implement compliance regulation nationwide in response to the importing nations and their move for stringent regulations; the import taxes EU imposed on Kenyan cut flowers in October 2014 was seen slowing down the industry. However, the planning and advice the Council provided for the reform failed to meet the timetable set by the EU to result in penalty money on the industry. With a financial aid of 400,000 US dollars provided by the Dutch government for the program implementation, the KFC anticipated to involve all sectors in the Kenyan flower industry by the end of 2015. Kenya provides 40 percent of all European Union imports with its floricultural produces, and the risk to lose competition against other developing cut flower exporters in the world put the industry in Kenya to meet the EU regulation in the form of tariff, which was lifted in December 2015. Industrial development schemes Rwanda is negotiated for ODA partnership with Kenyan government to gain support on cut flower industry. A development of flower park is initiated by KFC, expanding over 35 hectare is discussed located in 30 kilometers' radius from Kigali, Rwanda's capital. By 2017, estimated income to Rwandan government from the local flower farming industry will be in excess of $200 million, or annual yield of three million cut flowers Auditing and accreditation activities Domestically, the Kenya Flower Council (KFC) is affiliated with the Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA), the Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya (FPEAK) and with the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS). It publishes a detailed Code of Practice (CoP) and employs a rating system for its member companies, involving Gold Standard ranking, Silver Standard ranking and Associate rankings. Globally, the board subscribes to the Good Agricultural Practices guideline system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and to GLOBALG.A.P. A yearly growth of 5 percent is anticipated for the flower industry in Kenya between 2016 and 2020, and the government is going to continue investments as well as to accumulate and expand growth rate each year. According to KEBS in 2014, the floriculture industry earned Kshs (Kenya Shillings) 54.6 billion. HCDA reported provisional statistics in 2015 that Kshs 62.9 billion was earned by the Kenyan cut flower industry.

He was born in Marseille as a son of Russian parents. He is known mainly as an early pioneer in enzyme kinetics. He published over 500 papers in a variety of disciplines including biochemistry, physical chemistry, psychology and physiology. Life Victor Henri's parents were Aleksandra Viktorovna Lyapunova and Nikolay Alexandrovich Krylov. They were not married. Instead, Krylov was married to the mother's sister, Sofiya Viktorovna. At that time, an illegitimate child had no rights if born in Russia, but if born in France would be a French citizen. Thus, his parents decided to travel to Marseilles. After Victor Henri was born there, Krylov and his legitimate wife adopted him, and took him back to Saint Petersburg. There he attended a German secondary school. The two mothers were first cousins of Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov, a notable mathematician who did pioneering work in stability theory, Sergei Mikhailovich Lyapunov, a composer, and Boris Mikhailovich Lyapunov, who is well known in Russia as an expert in Slavic languages. In 1891, Henri entered the Sorbonne University in Paris, where he received an education in mathematics and, later, in Natural Sciences. After finishing university, he got intrigued by philosophy and psychology. Henri graduated with two PhD theses: in 1897 in psychology at the University of G√∂ttingen and 1903 in Paris in physical chemistry. In 1930, he was appointed full professor in physical chemistry at the University of Li√®ge (Belgium). Work As several other researchers around 1900, Henri studied the invertase enzyme, which hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, in order to derive a general rate law (kinetics) for enzymes.V. Henri: √úber das Gesetz der Wirkung des Invertins. Z. Phys. Chem. 39 (1901) 194‚Äì216 After the British scientist Adrian John Brown found that enzyme reactions were initiated by a bond between the enzyme and the substrate, and inspired by discussions with German physical chemist Max Bodenstein, he published, in 1902, for the first time the fundamental equation of enzyme kinetics.V. Henri: Th√©orie g√©n√©rale de l‚Äôaction de quelques diastases. C. R. Hebd. S√©ances Acad. Sci. 135 (1902) 916‚Äì919 He wrote it as follows: : \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot \\\\Phi \\\\cdot (a-x)}{1+m\\\\cdot (a-x)+n \\\\cdot x} where a and x denote the initial concentration of substrate and the concentration of product formed, respectively. The other symbols stand for constants. In modern notation, it can be written as : v = \\\\frac{\\\\text{const.} \\\\cdot S}{1 + \\\\frac{S}{K_1} + \\\\frac{P}{K_2}}\\\\ (\\\\ast) where v, S and P denote the reaction velocity and the substrate and product concentrations, respectively. K1 and K2 stand for the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate-complex and enzyme‚Äìproduct complex, respectively. It took about 10 years until the international community of biochemists realized the full significance of this equation. Notably, his work was taken up by German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten. They investigated invertase (saccharase) as well. In a seminal paper in 1913, Michaelis and Menten derived the equation in more detail and interpreted it more profoundly.L. Michaelis & M.L. Menten: Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung. Biochem. Z. 49 (1913) 333‚Äì369 In particular, they interpreted the constants in the equation correctly and comprehensively. In particular, they recognized that considering the behaviour in the steady state at zero time with P = 0 would lead to simpler and more easily interpretable results, and thus paved the way for general applications. In most cases, the equation is used for the special case P = 0 and is usually called Michaelis- Menten kinetics, sometimes Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Z. Bajzer, E.E.

It is an adobe dwelling built in 1835, located in San Miguel, California, in San Luis Obispo County. History Petronilo Rios, corporal commanding the Mission San Miguel guard and later owner of Rancho Paso de Robles, supervised the building of the two- story adobe home using Native American labor on property belonging to Mission San Miguel (which is now across the street). In 1846, when the mission property was sold by Governor Pio Pico, Rios and William Reed purchased the mission and adobe. The original building was made of adobe, had a roof of hand-made tiles, and used strips of rawhide to tie the pine rafters in place. The Rios family used the home as a residence until Warran C. Rickard purchased it from the state on a possessory claim. East side From 1868 until 1886, George Butchart operated the building as the Caledonia Inn, a stagecoach stop, hotel, and tavern on El Camino Real. The arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in San Miguel put an end to the Inn. In 1887, it served briefly as an elementary school. After that, it was used for various businesses (including a mattress factory and tailor shop from 1889 to 1895) and again as a home from 1895 to 1910 for various families. Charles Dorries purchased the property with of land in 1923 and restored it to use as a tourist attraction. Dorries also built the gift shop in a similar style in 1938 specifically to serve visitors. By 1964 the adobe had fallen into disrepair. That year, the County of San Luis Obispo purchased it. In 1968, the Friends of the Adobes formed to preserve and restore the adobe. Current Landmark plaque Major restoration work completed in 1972, and the building was then formally dedicated. A museum and gift shop opened in June 1978, also opening the adobe for tours. The site is now operated as a county park.

The first is Emerald Fracture Zone, a leaky transform fault, which is the region between A and A‚Äô. The second is the Southeast Indian Ridge, located just west of the MTJ and is split by the Balleny Fault Zone, identified by the letter B. And lastly the Hjort Trench which is represented by C. The Macquarie Triple Junction is a geologically active tectonic boundary located at at which the Indo-Australian Plate, Pacific Plate, and Antarctic Plate collide and interact. The term Triple Junction is given to particular tectonic boundaries at which three separate tectonic plates meet at a specific, singular location. The Macquarie Triple Junction is located on the seafloor of the southern region of the Pacific Ocean, just south of New Zealand. This tectonic boundary was named in respect to the nearby Macquarie Island, which is located southeast of New Zealand.  Evolution, stability, and migration  Our understanding of the evolution of the Macquarie Triple Junction was made possible due to extensive research of the regions tectonic magnetic anomalies as well as local fractures reconstruction. The origin of the Macquarie Triple Junction has been interpreted to have occurred 47.91 Mya (million years ago), based on Anomaly 21. Thorough reconstruction of the Macquarie Triple Junction begins at 33.3 Mya, in respect to Anomaly 13o, and can be simply described as a southeastward migration of approximately 1100 km in respect to the Australian Plate. The total migration was largely driven by the Australian‚ÄìPacific transform boundary. At 33.3 Mya, the Macquarie Triple Junction was a stable ridge‚Äìtransform fault‚Äìtransform fault triple junction. In reference to the Australian Plate, the triple junction moved southeast at an angle of 120¬∞ at an approximate rate of 40 km/million years. This trajectory remain relatively constant throughout the Oligocene from 33.3 to 20.1 Mya. During this period of time the Australian-Pacific boundary underwent a transformation from mid-ocean ridge to a strike-slip fault and lastly at 20.1 Mya to a transpression convergent boundary. Then 10.9 Mya, the Macquarie Triple Junction evolved into a ridge-trench-fault triple junction due to the alteration of the Australian‚ÄìPacific Boundary motion. This oblique convergent boundary instigated a clockwise rotation of the Macquarie Ridge Complex forming the Hjort Trench and numerous fracture zones around the Macquarie Ridge Complex.Lodolo, E. and F. Coren (1994). \\"The Westernmost Pacific Antarctic plate boundary in the vicinity of the Macquarie triple junction.\\" (In C.A. Ricci, ed. Terra Antarctica, vol.1). pp. 158‚Äì161 This rotation also transpired into the Macquarie Triple Junction changing its migration path to an angle of 150¬∞ and rate of 34 km/million years in reference to the Australian Plate, making the migration direction southward. Between 5.9 and 2.6 Mya, the Macquarie Triple Junction evolved back into a Ridge‚ÄìTransform Fault‚ÄìTransform Fault triple junction as the convergence at the Hjort Trench diminished and Antarctic‚ÄìPacific spreading boundary changed back into a transform fault. This is the current state of the Macquarie Triple Junction and is interpreted as a stable ridge‚Äìfault‚Äìfault triple junction. Figure 2: The evolution of the Macquarie Triple Junction has been well studied dating back to 33.3 Mya and has been reconstructed in at 20.1 Mya and 10.9 Mya. The green line shows the migration distance between intervals.  Local tectonics  Figure 3: Leaky Transform Faults, such as the Emerald Fracture Zone, form at bends in transform boundaries. Figure 4: New crust forms at ridges, such as Mid-Ocean- Ridges, while older crust is destroyed at subduction zones, where trenches form. = Emerald Fracture Zone = The Emerald Fracture Zone is the westernmost portion of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and is a young leaky transform fault zone no older than 2.197-2.229 Ma. This zone was formed during a change in the Pacific-Antarctic Plate Boundary between 3.4 and 3.86 Ma during a transformation of the Pacific-Antarctic Plate Boundary. This transformation was due to the change in the absolute motion of the Pacific Plate in response to Louisville hotspot activity. The alteration of the Pacific Plate ‚Äòs motion caused a left-lateral strike-slip fault to form at the Pacific-Antarctic Boundary. This strike-slip fault is located near the triple junction along a sharp bend in the westernmost region of the Pacific-Antarctic Boundary. This sharp bend is now the locality of the Emerald Fracture Zone formed from a release bend configuration as seen in transtension. = Southeast Indian Ridge = The Southeast Indian Ridge is the divergent boundary that separates the Indo-Australian and Antarctic Plates. This boundary has experienced a vast right-lateral transform fault called the Balleny Fault Zone, which is also thought to be caused in response to the formation of the Emerald Fracture Zone. This large offset in the Southeast Indian Ridge is thought to have produced a significant difference in crustal thickness within the Australian Plate influencing the Hjort Trench formation. = Hjort Trench = The Hjort Trench is the southernmost portion of the Macquarie Ridge Complex and has been identified as an oceanic-oceanic subduction zone. This trench is found in a region of diagonal convergence produced by the transform fault evolution of the Emerald Fracture Zone. Due to these transpressive plate movements this trench has frequent seismicity events generally less than 20 km depth, which suggest underthrusting of the Indo- Australian Plate underneath the Pacific Plate. This region of underthrusting may eventually evolve into a self-sustaining subduction zone, though the Hjort Trench is thought to be an example of an oceanic subduction zone initiated in response to transform fault development.  Studies of the Macquarie Triple Junction  The understanding of the Macquarie Triple Junction is primarily known due to the study of the seismicity, gravitational, magnetic and bathymetric data of the region. Initial studies took place during the early 1970s by the Eltanin Cruises, which took bathymetric and magnetic tracks in order to interpret the general sea floor topography and sea-floor spreading rates. Additional surveys have been taken during 1988‚Äì1991 by multiple cruises of the OGS-Explora. These surveys consist of approximately 6300 km the regions seismicity, gravitational signatures, and additional magnetic and bathymetric surveys, significantly contributing to the understanding of the Macquarie Triple Junction. From analysis of the data obtained from the OGS-Explora, a major change in the Pacific-Antarctic plate motion has been interpreted, instigating the compressional region of the Macquarie Ridge.  Overview of relevant plate boundaries  = Indo-Australian Plate and Antarctic Plate boundary = The Indo-Australian Plate and Antarctic Plate Boundary is an active divergent boundary known as the Southeast Indian Ridge. The Southeast Indian Ridge ranges approximately 2000 kilometers across the southern region of the Indian Ocean. The Southeast Indian Ridge has a complex driving force which is due to the interaction of the Amsterdamn-St. Paul Plateau, a developed hot spot in the western portion of the Southeast Indian Ridge, and the mid-oceanic ridge (MOR). The Amsterdamn-St. Paul Plateau along with the Southeast Indian Ridge produce new oceanic crust further separating the Indo- Australian and Antarctic plates at an intermediate tectonic rate of 65 mm/yr. = Pacific Plate and Antarctic Plate boundary = The Pacific-Antarctic Plate Boundary is another active divergent boundary known as the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge(PAR). The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge is the southwest region of the East Pacific Rise, the mid-oceanic ridge located at the base of the Pacific Ocean. The PAR is divergent boundary driven by the interaction of a MOR and deep mantle plumes located in the eastern portion of the East Pacific Rise. These deep mantle plumes however, have given the Pacific Plate a left lateral force vector creating a transform boundary in the western Pacific-Antarctic Plate Boundary in the vicinity of the Macquarie Triple Junction, forming the Emerald Fracture Zone. = Indo-Australian Plate and Pacific Plate boundary = The Indo-Australian Plate and Pacific Plate boundary is the most complex boundary of the Macquarie Triple Junction region, due to the unique collision of the two plates creating two convergent boundaries separated by a transform boundary. The Puysequr Trench, which includes the Fjord Trench, is the southern region of the boundary closest to the Macquarie Triple Junction. The Puysequr Trench formed as the Indo-Australian Plate subducted beneath the Pacific plate. The Puysequr Trench ranges approximately 800 kilometers in length, from the most southern tip of the New Zealand Islands to the Macquarie Triple Junction. The Puysequre Trench makes contact with the Macquarie Fault Zone, which is associated with the Alpine Fault. The Alpine Fault is the right-lateral transform fault boundary separating the Puysequr Trench and the northern Kermadec Trench. The Alpine Fault runs through the majority of the southern island of New Zealand and is associated with New Zealand's frequent and intense earthquake history. The last major region of the Indo-Australian Plate and Pacific Plate Boundary is the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone at which the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the Indo-Australian Plate, in opposition of the Puysequr Trench. This convergent boundary has a rate of subduction of approximately 5.5-7.4 cm/yr.

Safavid period, early 17th century. Isfahan School. Ink and color wash on paper. Freer Sackler Gallery F1928.10 Freer Sackler Gallery F1928.10 some verses in Persian nasta'liq script, probably always a single page meant for a muraqqa; 16-17th century A Muraqqa (, , ) is an album in book form containing Islamic miniature paintings and specimens of Islamic calligraphy, normally from several different sources, and perhaps other matter. The album was popular among collectors in the Islamic world, and by the later 16th century became the predominant format for miniature painting in the Persian Safavid, Mughal and Ottoman empires, greatly affecting the direction taken by the painting traditions of the Persian miniature, Ottoman miniature and Mughal miniature.Froom. (2001), 1.; Rizvi, 800 The album largely replaced the full-scale illustrated manuscript of classics of Persian poetry, which had been the typical vehicle for the finest miniature painters up to that time. The great cost and delay of commissioning a top-quality example of such a work essentially restricted them to the ruler and a handful of other great figures, who usually had to maintain a whole workshop of calligraphers, artists and other craftsmen, with a librarian to manage the whole process. An album could be compiled over time, page by page, and often included miniatures and pages of calligraphy from older books that were broken up for this purpose, and allowed a wider circle of collectors access to the best painters and calligraphers, although they were also compiled by, or presented to, shahs and emperors. The earliest muraqqa were of pages of calligraphy only; it was at the court in Herat of the Timurid prince Baysunghur in the early 15th century that the form became important for miniature painting. The word muraqqa means \\"that which has been patched together\\" in Persian.Froom, 1-2; Thackston, vii The works in an album, typically of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an Islamic book-cover that might be highly decorated with lacquered paint, gold stamping on leather, or other techniques. Other muraqqa might be bound in a special concertina-like form. Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler.A regular theme of prefaces - see Roxburgh, 111-112 Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show the development of a style. The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced.Froom, 5-6 The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers. For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the \\"bread and butter\\" source of income,Canby, quote on 47 using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or ghazal lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the Qur'an, perhaps given the place of honour at the start of the album. Album pages often have areas of decorated illumination (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.Canby, 42-49, 45 on Qur'an, 83 on carpets. While the classic Islamic illuminated manuscript tradition had concentrated on rather crowded scenes with strong narrative content as illustrations in full texts of classic and lengthy works like the Shahnameh and the Khamsa of Nizami, the single miniature intended from the start for a muraqqa soon developed as a simpler scene with fewer, larger, figures, often showing idealized beauties of either sex in a garden setting, or genre figures from nomadic life, usually with no real or fictional identities attached to them. In Mughal India realistic portraiture, nearly always of rulers or courtiers, became a very common feature, and in Ottoman Turkey portraits of the Sultans, often very stylised, were a particular speciality. Fully coloured scenes tended to give way to part-drawn and part-painted ones, or to figures with little or no background. The album to some extent overlaps with the anthology, a collection of different pieces where the main emphasis is on the texts, but which can also include paintings and drawings inserted from different sources. Shift to the album A Young Lady Reclining After a Bath, Herat 1590s, a single miniature for the muraqqa market =Persia= The dominant tradition of miniature painting in the late Middle Ages was that of Persia, which had a number of centres, but all usually dependent on one key patron, whether the shah himself, or a figure either governing a part of the country from a centre such as Herat, where Baysunghur was an important patron in the early 15th century, or the ruler of a further part of the Persianate world in a centre like Bukhara. As the Safavid dynasty centralized Persian rule in the 16th century the number of potential patrons of a full-size atelier declined, but the atelier of the shah expanded and produced a number of superb illustrated books, using a variety of very talented artists on each. However, in the 1540s Shah Tahmasp I, previously a keen patron, lost interest in commissioning books, and thereafter the Persian miniature painting tradition lacked a steady source of commissions for books in the old style. After a gap of some years, Tahmasp's nephew Ibrahim Mirza established an atelier at Mashad, which produced the Freer Jami in the 1560s, and which Shah Ismail II took over after having its former patron killed in 1577. But Ismail's reign was very brief, and thereafter consistent large-scale patronage was lacking. It was in this period that the single miniature designed for inserting in an album came to be dominant; such works had long been produced, but now they became the main source of income for many artists, who probably often produced them speculatively with no commission, and then looked to sell them (little is known about the market for album miniatures).Titley, 113-114; Riza; Brend, 165-166 The artist who epitomises the Persian album miniature is Riza Abbasi, active from the 1580s until his death in 1635, whose early single miniatures of groups are somewhat like those in narrative scenes, but lacking any actual narrative attached to them. He soon turned to, and developed, subjects mostly of one or two figures, often portrait-like, although very few identities are given or were probably ever intended to be recognised. There are a large number of beautiful youths, to whose clothes great attention is paid.Riza =Turkey= 15th century portrait of Mehmet II (1432-1481), showing Italian influence The best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital, which from 1453 was Istanbul, and the most important patron was always the Sultan. The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey, mostly at Topkapi Palace, and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts, initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia, and later, after a treaty in 1555, often received as diplomatic gifts. Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums.Titley, 133-135 Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition, but especially in the 16th century; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of Tabriz in 1514, though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds, against twenty-six Turks. But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century, with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds, more sea and ships, neatly tented army camps, distant cityscapes, more individual characterization of faces, but also a less refined technique. There was strong European influence, mostly from Venice, but this was restricted to portraiture.Titley, 136-142 Turkish albums include mixtures of collected miniatures similar to those in Persia, and often including Persian pieces, with the addition of rather more greatly elaborated pen drawings of an essentially decorative nature, of a foliage motif, or a bird or animal treated largely as such. Albums dedicated to the sultans, with portraits and laudatory pieces of text, are a distinctive Turkish type, and there were also albums of scenes of Turkish life, showing the relatively uniform costume of different ranks in society, methods of torture and execution, and other scenes of interest to the mostly Western foreigners they were produced for, matching similar prints made in contemporary Europe.Titley, 151, 157-158 One very distinctive type of miniature is found only in Ottoman albums, though they may have been brought from Persia as booty, and perhaps were not intended for albums originally. These are eighty or so the mysterious and powerful images grouped under the name of Siyah Qalam, meaning \\"Black Pen\\" (or drunk or evil pen), full of demons and scenes which suggest nomadic life in Central Asia, though it has also been suggested that they come from a single Persian court artist letting himself go. They are perhaps from the early 15th century, reaching Turkey in the 16th.Robinson, 37; Walther & Wolf, 254-255 Another distinctive type of Ottoman work is the d√©coupage or cut paper miniature, where different colours of paper, cut with minute detail then pasted together, are used to create the image. This technique was used for book-covers in Timurid Persia, which were then varnished over for protection, but in Turkey the images were treated as miniatures and went inside albums; the technique was also much used for page border decoration.A lion attacking a deer, stencilled scene of d√©coupage paper shapes British Museum; Titley, 158, 229, 242 =Indian subcontinent= Company style miniature of Five Recruits to a British Indian military unit, c. 1815 The Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent was rather later in establishing a large court atelier, which did not begin until after the exile in Persia of the second emperor, Humayun, who on his return was joined from about 1549 by Persian artists including Abd as- Samad. The Mughal style developed under the next emperor, Akbar, who commissioned some very large illustrated books, but his artists produced single miniatures for albums as well. In the case of the Jahangirnama, the emperor Jahangir kept a diary and commissioned paintings separately, which were most likely held in the Kitabkhana (‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ), until his official contribution to the court chronicle genre could be assembled. From fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, usually in profile, and perhaps influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or concubines; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like Jahanara Begum and Mumtaz Mahal, and others attribute miniatures, for example from the Dara Shikoh album or the Freer Gallery of Art mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.Crill and Jariwala, 23-30Abid. Reign of Shah Jahan, portrait by Abid dated 1628; assembled late 17th century. Mirror Case With Portrait of Mumtaz Mahal. Freer Gallery of Art. F2005.4 Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; from the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.Crill and Jariwala, 68 The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later. Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular. Akbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.Crill and Jariwala, 66 There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors Jahangir and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries In the 18th and 19th centuries Indian artists working in the hybrid Indo- European Company style produced albums of miniatures for Europeans living in India as part of the British Raj and its French and Portuguese equivalents. Some Europeans collected or were given earlier Indian miniatures; the Large and Small Clive albums were presented to Lord Clive, and are now in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.Small Clive album Victoria & Albert Museum. Others created albums of new work, tending to concentrate on animal portraits and the houses, horses and other possessions of this wealthy group. In the 19th century images of Indians and their costumes, often categorized by regional and ethnic type, or occupation, became very popular. Large-scale patrons included Colonel James Skinner of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a Rajput mother, and for natural history paintings, Mary Impey, wife of Elijah Impey, who commissioned over three hundred, and the Marquess Wellesley, brother of the first Duke of Wellington, who had over 2,500 miniatures.

Chroniclers record that when the Persian Prince Ibrahim Mirza was killed in 1577, on the orders of Shah Tahmasp I, his wife, Tahmasp's sister, destroyed artworks including an album containing miniatures by Behzad among others, which her husband had compiled and given her for their wedding, washing the miniatures in water.Titley, 105 Perhaps she did not want anything to fall into the hands of her brother, who had ordered his death, and who did take over the prince's atelier.Aga Khan Museum Albums were often presented to rulers on their accession, or in Turkey at New Year. They could also be given as diplomatic gifts between rulers.Tanidi, 1 A muraqqa was created for Sultan Murad III in 1572 when he ascended to the throne, which is unusual because the dedication is very detailed, including the date and place of creation, namely Istanbul, 980 AH/1572-73 AD.A. E.Froom, (2001). \\"Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa‚Äô for Sultan Murad III\\". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, pp. 1. The dedication is to Murad III, also naming his compiler Mehmed Cenderecizade. The Murad III muraqqa was designed much more extravagantly than other Islamic muraqqa and with original nakkashane (Ottoman painting studio) border paintings.Emine F. Fetvaci, (2005). \\"Viziers to Eunuchs: Transitions in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage, 15661617.\\" Unpublished PhD Dissertation, Harvard University. pp. 28. This muraqqa contained miniature paintings, ink drawings, and calligraphy, including ghazals. The Murad III muraqqa has twenty-four miniatures created in the cities of Bukhara to the east of Persia, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Qazvin in Persia, and Istanbul between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.A. E.Froom, (2001). \\"Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa‚Äô for Sultan Murad III\\". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 2, 7. It has a two-page introduction written in Persian, which is similar in structure to Timurid and Safavid album prefaces, and indicates that this muraqqa was compiled in Istanbul less than two years before Murad III became Sultan.E.Froom, (2001). \\"Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa‚Äô for Sultan Murad III\\".

Another album in the Ottoman royal collection contains only Western images, mostly prints but including a drawing in pen of an Ornamental Scroll with Putti and Penises, \\"for the merriment of adult guests at a dinner in Pera\\". The collection was probably assembled for a Florentine in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners). The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine engravings, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of Mehmet II, who apparently acquired the album. It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably common among collectors in Europe at the time.Landau & Parshall, 91-95; one might query the title, as the \\"putti\\" are rather rough-looking adults. = Examples from the Mughal Court = * The Salim album, produced in the reign of Akbar the Great, contains both Christian images and portraits of Hindu courtiers. * The Minto Albums, from the reign of Shah Jahan, contains miniatures depicting royal courtiers, gardens, and images of wildlife, surrounded by elaborate floral borders. * The Shah Jahan Album, now dispersed, as it was split up by George Joseph Demotte, a Belgian dealer.

In modern times  Abdur Rahman Chughtai was a painter who was responsible for the revival of the muraqqa in the Indian Subcontinent in 1928 after publishing his Muraqqa-I Chughtai. When he started painting in the 1910s his major influence was Hindu mythology, but by the 1920s he was inspired by Islamic artwork including the muraqqa, ghazals, and Ottoman miniatures.Iftikhar Dadi, (2006). \\"Miniature Painting as Muslim Cosmopolitanism\\" ISIM Review: International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World.

He previously served in the Oregon House of Representatives, from 1995 through 2000 and again for the 2003 session. He resigned from the House in December 2003 to accept appointment to the Senate seat that had been vacated by Tony Corcoran. He won election to the seat in November 2004. Career Senate District 4 includes parts of Lane and Douglas Counties, including the communities of Eugene, Roseburg, Cottage Grove, Sutherlin, Oakland, Elkton, and Oakridge. Prozanski serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and as a member of the Senate General Government, Consumer and Small Business Protection Committee as well as the Rural Communities and Economic Development Committee. He co-chairs the Task Force on Public Safety and serves on the Justice Reinvestment Grant Review Committee, the Task Force on Resolution of Adverse Health Care Incidents, the Oregon Law Commission, the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC), the Asset Forfeiture Oversight Advisory Committee of the CJC, and the Oregon State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision. The Independent Party of Oregon awarded Prozanski a 100% \\"A\\" rating and the Oregon Council of Police Associations honored him as Legislator of the Year in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Prozanski sponsored two bills of particular note during that time: one to crack down on meth-related crime by increasing penalties for metal theft and another to reduce field burning in Oregon. During the 2011 session, he sponsored separate legislation that prohibited the sale of \\"suicide kits\\" and that allowed Oregon home brewers and winemakers to share and transport their products outside their homes. He has also been named \\"Top Dog\\" by the Oregon Humane Society. During the 2013 legislative session, Prozanski served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Public Safety, where he successfully developed legislation to make smarter use of taxpayer dollars by putting an emphasis on crime prevention and rehabilitation, which will result in a lower prison population. He also spearheaded bipartisan legislation to prohibit combustible engines and sea planes on Waldo Lake, the third most pure lake in the world. The Register- Guard called Prozanski a \\"hard-working and responsive'\\" senator who takes a thoughtful approach to public policy. The News-Review says Prozanksi can point to substantial accomplishments as a legislator in economic development, law enforcement, land use and natural resources. When the legislature is not in session, Prozanski works as a prosecutor and serves on various local boards and commissions. He graduated from Texas A&M; University and later earned a law degree from the South Texas College of Law. A cyclist and home-brewer, he has lived in Eugene with his wife for more than 25 years. =Senate recall effort= Sen.

She served in the Senate from 1997 to 2009. Previously, she served for five years in the Oregon House of Representatives. Early years Gordly was one of three children born in Portland, Oregon, to a mother active in local leadership within the Order of the Eastern Star and a father who worked for the railroad. Her father was a strict authoritarian whom she feared. This fear kept them from being close and was also the reason for her brother, nine years her senior, would leave home early to join the Air Force. Her church community was a big influence on her, with many of the women, including her grandmothers, serving as role models. Her grandma Randolph was a founder in both the Oregon's Association of Colored Women's Clubs and Portland's Harriet Tubman Club.She graduated from Girls Polytechnic High School in 1965 (which later became James Monroe High School). She was the first woman in her family to graduate from high school. Prior to her high school graduation, Avel and her boyfriend (at the time) Neshell, became pregnant. The two married and then soon after he was drafted for the war in Vietnam. The marriage did not last after his return, but the two kept a good relationship for their son. After Avel and Neshell's separation she started to become interested in attending college, partly from visits to see her younger sister in Eugene who was attending the University of Oregon. After five years at Pacific Northwest Bell, she enrolled at Portland State University, earning a degree in the administration of justice. Though an avid reader, it was not until her time at Portland State University that she was first exposed to African American literature and noted how she had not been exposed to this during her time in the public school system. During her time at PSU she also applied to participate with Operations Crossroads Africa and was accepted, sending her to West Africa with most of her time spent in a small village in Nigeria, all of which would go on to be a life-changing experience. In 1974, she became the first person in her family to graduate from college. After graduating, Gordly began working with the State of Oregon Corrections Division as a counselor in a work release facility for women where she noticed racial bias that led to work release for black women and education release for white women. Political office Gordly was appointed to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1991, to replace Ron Cease, and later elected to the seat, ultimately serving three terms, representing parts of north and northeast Portland. In 1996, she won election to the Oregon State Senate, the first African-American woman to do so; she served in the Senate from 1997 to 2009. She was a member of the Democratic Party until late 2006, when she dropped her party registration, becoming a nonaffiliated voter. She chose not to run for re-election in 2008. In 2008, while serving as senator, OHSU opened the Avel Gordly Center for Healing, which provides mental health and psychiatric services. Recent work Gordly is an adjunct professor at her alma mater, and with Patricia A. Schecter, is the author of Remembering the Power of Words (2001, ), her memoirs, published by Oregon State University Press.

It was designed to break prisoners who were not destined for immediate death. Some prisoners were held only for a few weeks, others, much longer; both men, and women. During that time they were put to work in slave-labour commandos and broken. Those who survived purposeful starvation were sent on to Nazi concentration camps such as Buchenwald. Approximately 20,000 men and women passed through Neue Bremm, including Jews from occupied Eastern Europe as well as Frenchmen, Belgians, Britons and Italians. However, the total number of casualties remains unknown. Short term torture camps like Neue Bremm were called Straflager.

He made two appearances for England in 1881, when he was under 18. At the time of his England appearances, he was the second-youngest England player ever. Throughout his career he was known as \\"Tot\\" on account of his size, being only 5 ft 6in tall. Career Rostron was born in Darwen, Lancashire and after youth football with Helmshore and Old Wanderers he joined Darwen as a teenager. He was the youngest member of their team which reached the FA Cup Semi-final in 1881 played on 26 March 1881, when Darwen FC were beaten 4‚Äì1 by the eventual winners, the Old Carthusians. Earlier he had become the second youngest player to represent England when he was selected to play against Wales on 26 February 1881, when he was 17 years 311 days old. Only James Prinsep was younger on his debut at that time. Subsequently, Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott have appeared for England at a younger age, and thus Rostron now stands fourth in the list of England's youngest players.England's youngest players For the match against Wales, played at Alexandra Meadows, Blackburn,England 0 Wales 1, 26 February 1881 (Match summary) the English selectors had picked an inexperienced team with seven players making their debuts. Rostron's Darwen teammate, Thomas Marshall played alongside him on the right-wing. England were \\"a little over-confident against the Welsh, who recorded their first victory on English soil with a 1‚Äì0 success\\". Despite this defeat, Rostron was selected for the next international, against Scotland played at the Kennington Oval on 12 March 1881. Rostron played at outside rightEngland 1 Scotland 6, 12 March 1881 (Match summary) but England went down to a \\"humiliating\\" 6‚Äì1 defeat.

Holman was Camborne's, and indeed Cornwall's largest manufacturer of industrial equipment. Holman played a part in World War II making the Polish designed 20mm Polsten gun, similar to the Oerlikon but simpler to build and use. It also produced the Holman Projector for the Royal Navy. At its height Holmans was spread over three sites within Camborne, employing some three and half thousand people. Cornish mining is renowned worldwide. Alongside the mining industry there evolved an industry manufacturing specialised mining equipment. Holman‚Äôs founder, Nicholas Holman started a boiler works in 1801.Carter, Cornish Engineering, p. 6 The company expanded to develop subsidiary companies in centres of mining all over the world and at one stage approximately 80% of products were exported.  Rock drills  1881-The brothers John Henry and James Miners Holman, had taken over running the business from their father John.Carter, Cornish Engineering, p. 16 They were offered the designs of a new rock drill by a James McCulloch. the brothers filed a joint patent with McCulloch, and began to manufacture the new drill.Carter, Cornish Engineering, p. 17 It became known as the \\"Cornish Rock Drill\\", and achieved great commercial success. 1882-The rock drill was at work at Dolcoath, Tincroft, East Pool, South Crofty, at Falmouth Docks and in mines in South Wales. The demand grew rapidly. 1896-More than 1,000 Cornish rock drills were in use on The South African Rand alone. By the turn of the 20th century the number had doubled. Most of these drills came from Holman in Camborne. 1910-The company took first and third prizes in a World Rock Drilling Contest, sponsored by the South African Chamber of Commerce. Later, the Holman Silver 303 Airleg was used all over the world for mine development. As well as the rock drills, the company also produced drill rigs and developed 'down the hole' drill primarily for quarrying. The company developed a hydraulic breaker, known as the Holbuster, but was ahead of its time and it was not a commercial success. Later developed by others, it is now a common sight. The first successful drills were the piston type, or \\"reciprocators.\\" The drill steel piston and chuck moved together and reciprocated. In Leyner's hammer drill the steel was held loosely in a chuck attached to the cylinder itself, while the piston inside the cylinder reciprocated, striking blows on the blunt end of the drill steel. The hammer drill was lighter, speedier, and used less air than the reciprocating drill. Leyners earlier drills used a blast of air blown through a hollowed or channelled drill steel to keep the drill holes clear of rock chippings: these drills, however, raised too much dust. To overcome this Leyner introduced water along the drill together with the blast of air. This machine soon ousted the previous one, and was taken up by the Holman factory on a large scale. Compressors Holman began to manufacture compressors. The first \\"Cornish\\" compressors were built to designs adapted from existing steam engines. 1894-Holman manufactured the largest compressor plant ever used in Cornwall. Installed at Carn Brea Mine.Carter, Cornish Engineering, pp. 23‚Äì24 1945-Holman employed Jim Hodge who had worked with Whittle to develop the first jet engines to design a jet engine driving extra compressor stages to create a very compact high output compressor for portable use. The parts were mostly made in the companies tool room. Like the Rover jet car of the same era, the excessive fuel consumption made the project non-viable. It was largely the investment in this project which forced the company from being a private family owned business into a public limited company with significant outside investors. 1954 or thereabouts Holman Bros took over the Climax Rock Drill and Engineering Works formerly Stephens Iron foundry. 1959-Holman introduced the Rotair, Britain's first single stage oil flooded rotary screw compressor. 1961 Trade names included Holbit rock drill steels, Dustuctor ‚Äì a dust containment system, Goodyear Pumps which used an Archemedies screw principle with a meshing disc which was capable of pumping strawberry jam without crushing the strawberries, Tractair ‚Äì a compressor mounted on the PTO of a tractor, Rotair, Maxam ‚Äì Maxam Power ltd who produced pneumatic control components. 1968-A merger took place with Broomwade to form CompAir Holman.Carter, Cornish Engineering, p. 102 The ownership of the group then passed to Imperial Continental Gas which included Calor Gas. The group rather drifted during this period before being sold to the Siebe Group which proceeded to asset strip the group. By May 2003 \\"Portable Compressor manufacturer CompAir, which employs 184 people in West Cornwall, announced earlier this month that increasing international competition meant it was intending to close its Camborne operation by September. It has begun a 90-day consultation period with staff. \\" The manufacturing operation was transferred to the Simmern works in Germany formerly owned by Mannesman Demag before its purchase by CompAir. The CompAir Group has now (2012) been bought by Gardner Denver along with a number of other British compressor related companies. Compressor manufacture in Germany continues.

It is defined for sailboats as: CSF = Beam / ((Displacement/64.2)1/3) with displacement measured in pounds. It came into being after the 1979 Fastnet race in England where a storm shredded the race fleet. The Cruising Club of America (CCA) put together a technical committee that analyzed race boat data. They came up with this formula to compare boats based on readily available data. The CCA characterizes the formula as \\"rough\\". A lower value is supposed to indicate a sailboat is less likely to capsize. A value of 2 is taken as a cutoff for acceptable to certain race committees. However this is an arbitrary cutoff based on the performance of boats in the 1979 Fastnet race. The CSF does not consider the hull shape or ballast location. Any two sailboats will have the same CSF value if their displacement and beam are the same. As an example, one could have a light hull with 50% ballast in a bulb at the bottom of an eight foot fin keel, the other could have a heavy hull with 20% ballast in a full-length keel. The stability characteristics of the two sailboats will be drastically different despite the identical CSF value.  References  * Davis, Stephen L.

Background Yuan Qianyao was from Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). His family traced its ancestry to the Northern Wei official Yuan He, who was a prince of the Xianbei state Southern Liang. His ancestors later served as officials of Northern Zhou and Sui Dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Yuan Qianyao's grandfather Yuan Shimin () served as deputy minister of justice during Sui, while his father Yuan Zhixin () served as the minister of justice under Emperor Gaozong of Tang, but was, for offenses lost to history, exiled to the Lingnan region and died there.That Yuan Zhixin was minister of justice was per Yuan Qianyao's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang. The table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang indicated that Yuan Zhixin was the secretary general for the ministry of justice. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 98 and New Book of Tang, vol. 127 with New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Also, Yuan Zhixin's title, according to Yuan Qianyao's biography in the Old Book of Tang, was Sixing Taichangbo (Âè∏ÂàëÂ§™Â∏∏‰ºØ)  a title that was only used between 662 and 670 and therefore, it was likely that Yuan Zhixin's exile occurred during that time period. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 201. Yuan Qianyao passed the imperial examinations, although it is not known when that occurred. During Emperor Zhongzong's and Emperor Ruizong's second reigns During the second reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Zhongzong (who reigned twice and whose second reign was from 705 to 710), Yuan Qianyao served as Dianzhong Shi Yushi (), a low-level imperial censor, and his responsibility was to examine the matters of the Jiangdong region (Ê±üÊù±, i.e., modern southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, south of the Yangtze River). He was considered capable in his duties, and was eventually promoted to the higher office of Jianyi Daifu (). After Emperor Zhongzong's brother Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, took the throne again (as Emperor Ruizong) in 710, there was an occasion when it was proposed that the shooting ceremony‚Äîa traditional ceremony in which the emperor led the officials in firing arrows from bows‚Äîbe abolished. Yuan opposed the abolition, arguing that it was a traditional ceremony required by Confucian regulations. It is not known whether his opposition was well received by Emperor Ruizong, although it was said that he was soon made the commandant at Liang Prefecture (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, roughly modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). During Emperor Xuanzong's reign In 712, Emperor Ruizong yielded the throne to his son and crown prince, Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. Early in Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (713-741), a number of staff members of Emperor Xuanzong's cousin Li Shouli the Prince of Bin committed offenses. Emperor Xuanzong wanted a secretary general for Li Shouli who could lead by example, and Emperor Xuanzong's close associate, the minister of ceremonies Jiang Jiao (), recommended Yuan Qianyao. Emperor Xuanzong summoned Yuan for a meeting, and at the meeting, Yuan impressed Emperor Xuanzong with his energy and ability to answer difficult questions. He thus made Yuan secretary general for Li Shouli, as well as the deputy minister of palace supplies (Â∞ëÂ∫úÂ∞ëÁõ£, Shaofu Shaojian). He soon promoted Yuan to be deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and deputy chief censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). Eventually, he was promoted to be Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general for the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In winter 716, Emperor Xuanzong promoted Yuan to be Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈªÉÈñÄÁúÅ, Huangmen Sheng), and gave him the designation Tong Ziwei Huangmen Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto. However, Emperor Xuanzong still entrusted more responsibilities to the more senior chancellor Yao Chong, despite Yao's suffering from malaria at the time. As Yao did not have a mansion in the capital Chang'an, he was staying at Wangji Temple (), and Emperor Xuanzong often had Yuan consult Yao at Wangji Temple. It was said that when Yuan made suggestions to Emperor Xuanzong that satisfied Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong would state, \\"This must be the will of Yao Chong,\\" and that whenever Yuan made suggestions that Emperor Xuanzong was dissatisfied about, Emperor Xuanzong would state, \\"Go consult with Yao Chong first.\\" However, Yao himself would soon draw the displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong due to allegations that his sons and associate Zhao Hui () were corrupt. Yao thus offered to resign and recommended Song Jing to succeed him. Just two months after Yuan was made chancellor, both he and Yao were removed from their chancellor positions, to be replaced by Song and Su Ting. With Emperor Xuanzong then at the eastern capital Luoyang, Emperor Xuanzong made Yuan the mayor of Chang'an, to be in charge of the city in his absence. Yao served as the mayor of Chang'an for three years and governed the capital capably. On one occasion, when Emperor Xuanzong lost his white eagle while hunting, he sent out an order that the eagle be recaptured. When Yuan's subordinates located the eagle, the eagle was dead and stuck to thorns‚Äîleading Yuan's subordinates to be fearful of imperial wrath. However, Yuan explained to them that the emperor would not punish them for fortuity of the eagle's death, and then personally submitted a petition in which he claimed that he erred and should be punished. As he predicted, Emperor Xuanzong did not take offense and did not punish him or his subordinates. In 720, Yuan was again made Huangmen Shilang and chancellor de facto, along with Zhang Jiazhen, replacing Song and Su. He was soon made Shizhong (), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. He submitted a petition pointing out that at that time, the powerful officials' sons and brothers were generally given posts in the capital region, thus forcing junior officials without such connections to take positions far from the capital. He suggested that those powerful officials' sons and brothers be sent out of the capital‚Äîoffering to have two of his three sons, all of whom were serving in the capital region at the time, be sent out. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict praising him and implementing his suggestion‚Äîthat no family of officials is allowed to have three members all serving in the capital region. In 722, under suggestions that the chancellors should be given an adequate supply of revenue so that they could concentrate on state matters, Emperor Xuanzong ordered that each chancellor be given tax revenues from 300 households, and Yuan and Zhang became the first chancellors to benefit from the order. In 725, under the suggestion of Zhang Shuo, who had become chancellor by that point, Emperor Xuanzong prepared to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai‚Äîa suggestion that Yuan disagreed with, and it was said that Yuan and Zhang began to have discord from that point on. After Emperor Xuanzong offered sacrifices at Mount Tai in 726, Yuan was given the additional office of Zuo Chengxiang ()  one of the heads of the executive bureau‚Äîbut also remained Shizhong. Later in 726, after Zhang Shuo was accused of corruption, Yuan was one of the officials that Emperor Xuanzong put in charge of interrogating Zhang, although subsequently Zhang was largely spared, stripped only of his chancellor status. It was said that throughout the time that Yuan served as chancellor with Zhang Jiazhen and Zhang Shuo, he largely acted carefully and simply deferred to them on important matters‚Äîand he was much criticized when, at Zhang Jiazhen's suggestion, Jiang was exiled in 722, and he failed to try to intercede on Jiang's behalf, despite Jiang's having recommended him years before. By 729, when he was serving with Li Yuanhong and Du Xian, Li and Du often disagreed with each other, and Yuan was not doing anything to moderate them. This drew Emperor Xuanzong's displeasure with all three and, in summer 729, he removed all three from chancellor posts, replacing them with Yuwen Rong and Pei Guangting, while retaining fellow chancellor Xiao Song. Yuan kept his position as Zuo Chengxiang and continued to serve in that office briefly. In fall 729, he was made an advisor to Li Hong the Crown Prince, with the title Taizi Shaoshi ()  but declined on the basis that his grandfather Yuan Shimin had the character \\"Shi\\" in his name, and therefore he could not accept the office due to naming taboo. In response, Emperor Xuanzong renamed the office Taizi Shaofu () to allow Yuan to be able to serve. The day that Yuan was to take office, Song and Zhang Shuo were to take new offices as well, Emperor Xuanzong set up a grand ceremony for their inauguration, including an elaborate tent, music, and food from the imperial kitchen. Emperor Xuanzong personally wrote a poem commemorating the contributions of the three.New Book of Tang, vol. 124. He also created Yuan the Duke of Anyang. In 731, Emperor Xuanzong was set to visit Luoyang again. Yuan was said to be old and ill at the time, and was unable to accompany Emperor Xuanzong, and he remained at Chang'an. He died winter that year, and was buried with honor.

The CCA issues the Blue Water Medal. About The CCA was launched in the winter of 1922 at Maskells Harbour on Nova Scotia's Bras d'Or Lake by a handful of experienced offshore cruisers interested in cruising and the development of \\"suitable types of sail, motor and auxiliary craft for cruising purposes and to stimulate an interest in seamanship, and the navigation and handling of small vessels.\\" The founders included Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, F.W. (Casey) Baldwin, William Washburn Nutting, Jim Dorsett, and William A. Wise Wood. The Club's more than 1,300 members personify the interests, achievement, experience, and love and respect for the sea of the Club's founders. Now in its 96th year, the CCA continues to use the collective wisdom and experience of its members to influence the \\"adventurous use of the sea\\" through efforts to elevate good seamanship, the design of seaworthy yachts, safe yachting procedures and environmental awareness. The Cruising Club of America has no clubhouse or shoreside base, and no paid staff. Rather, the Club is structured around national committees that conduct mission-related work and manage the administrative operations of the organization, and around geographical Stations that provide regional focus for the membership. Primary mission- focused committees include Safety at Sea, Offshore Communications, Technical, Environment, Cruising Guides and Charts, Bermuda Race, and Awards. The Club is managed by a Governing Board of Officers and elected members, and operated by standing committees including Finance, Audit, Nominating, and Membership, to name but a few. There are eleven Stations within the Club, each of which has its own Rear Commodore and officers, and which organize annual activities. According to the CCA constitution, \\"A person eligible for membership in the club must be sailor and a person of acceptable character and personality who has demonstrated his or her ability to handle or command and navigate and pilot a small vessel at sea, and who has had sufficient cruising experience.\\" Membership is by invitation.

Its southern terminus is at N-2, east of Ellsworth. N-250 does not intersect any state maintained road, until it reaches its northern terminus at U.S. Highway 20 (US 20) in Rushville. The route was designated in 1960, and was extended south in 1996. Route description All of the route is in Sheridan County. N-250 starts at N-2, south of Lakeside. The road shortly crosses a railroad owned by BNSF Railway and enters Lakeside. N-250 shifts west slightly, and bends around a lake. The route travels north, through sand hills, and passing by small lakes and ponds. East of Thompson Lake, N-250 intersects the 304th Trail, a road that connects to other lakes. later, the road 298th Trail, which connects the Twin Lakes to the highway. A few miles later, the highway passes the Smith Lake State Wildlife Management Area, and crosses over the Niobrara River later. N-250 soon straightens out, and travels north for . The road enters Rushville as Chamberlain Street. It enters downtown, and ends at US 20. In 2012, the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) calculated as many as 305 vehicles traveling on N-250 near Rushville, and as few as 90 vehicles traveling north of Lakeside. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. History A metal-surfaced road from US 20 in Rushville to north of the Niobrara River was constructed between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road was removed from the highway system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981‚Äì82, but it was not part of N-250 until 1996.

Plot The underground temple was filmed in the Wieliczka salt mine. A group of astronauts leaves Earth to find freedom, and their spaceship crashes on an unnamed Earth-like planet. The astronauts, equipped with video-recorders, reach a seashore, where they build a village. After many years, only one member of the crew, Jerzy, is still alive, watching the growth of a new society, whose religion is based on mythical tales of an expedition from the Earth. The first off-Earth generation calls him \\"The Old Man,\\" treating him as a demi-God. The Old Man leaves them and before his death sends his video diary back to Earth in a rocket. A space researcher named Marek receives the video diary and travels to the planet. When he arrives, he is welcomed by the cast of priests as the Messiah, who can release them from the captivity of the Szerns, the indigenous occupants of the planet. Shortly afterwards, Marek organizes an army and enters the city of the Szerns. Meanwhile, the priests start to believe that Marek was an outcast from the Earth, rather than a messiah who came to fulfill the religious prophecy.

Andrzej ≈ªu≈Çawski left his native Poland for France in 1972 to avoid Polish government censorship. After ≈ªu≈Çawski's critical success with the 1975 film L'important c'est d'aimer, the Polish authorities in charge of cultural affairs reevaluated their assessment of him. They invited him to return to Poland and produce a project of his own choice. ≈ªu≈Çawski, who had always wanted to make a film of his grand uncle's novel, saw the offer as a unique opportunity to achieve this aim. Between 1975 and 1977, ≈ªu≈Çawski adapted the novel into a screenplay. He shot the film at various locations, including the Baltic seashore at Lisi Jar near Rozewie, Lower Silesia, the Wieliczka Salt Mine, the Tatra Mountains, the Caucasus mountains in Georgia, the Crimea in USSR, and the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. In the fall of 1977, the project came to a sudden halt when Janusz Wilhelmi was appointed vice-minister of cultural affairs. He interpreted the film's battle between the Selenites and the Szerns as a thinly veiled allegory of the Polish people's struggle with totalitarianism. Wilhelmi shut down the film project, which was eighty percent complete, and ordered all materials destroyed. ≈ªu≈Çawski went back to France, saying that he was in despair over the loss and waste of so much artistic effort. The reels of the unfinished film were ultimately not destroyed, but preserved, along with costumes and props, by the film studio and by members of the cast and crew. Although Wilhelmi died a few months later in a plane crash, the film was only released after the end of communist rule. In May 1988, a version of the film, consisting of the preserved footage plus a commentary to fill in the narrative gaps, premiered at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival.

Notable guest comedians include Corinne Grant, Tom Gleeson, Natalie Garonzi, Matt Tilley and Julia Zemiro. The premise of the show can be compared to the popular improvisational comedy program 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?' with various improvisational comedy games played as the teams compete against each other.

One person is given something to make a speech about, and at random times, the other player will say a word and the player giving the speech must incorporate that word into their speech. *Don't Diss Me! ‚Äì This game also involves one member of each team.

There are two topics for the players to make statements on. The second topic usually relates to the occupation of the guest judge (E.g.; At a singing competition for Anthony Callea, at a Brownlow medal dinner for Jason Akermanis) *Break Into Song ‚Äì For one of the 2 teams.

Background Phoenician trade routes The Phoenicians were a people from the eastern Mediterranean who were mainly traders from the cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. They colonised much of the Mediterranean and in the year 814 BC, they founded the city of Carthage. After the fall of Phoenicia to the Babylonians and Persians, Carthage became the most powerful Phoenician colony in the Mediterranean and the Carthaginians annexed many of the other Phoenician colonies around the coast of the western Mediterranean, such as Hadrumetum and Thapsus. They also annexed territory in Sicily, Africa, Sardinia and in 575 BC, they created colonies on the Iberian peninsula. Expansion into Iberia After the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War, the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca crushed a mercenary revolt in Africa and trained a new army consisting of Numidians along with mercenaries and other infantry. In 236 BC, he led an expedition to Iberia where he hoped to gain a new empire for Carthage to compensate for the territories that had been lost in the recent conflicts with Rome and to serve as a base for vengeance against the Romans. In eight years, by force of arms and diplomacy, he secured an extensive territory in Hispania, but his premature death in battle (228 BC) prevented him from completing the conquest. Fall of the Empire The fall of Carthage's Iberian territories came in the Second Punic War. In the year 209 BC, after the Romans had landed on Iberia under the command of Scipio Africanus, they captured the centre of Punic power in Iberia, Nova Carthago (modern day Cartagena). They then moved south and faced the Punic army of Hasdrubal Barca in the Battle of Baecula but were not able to prevent him from continuing his march to Italy in order to reinforce his brother Hannibal. The catastrophic defeat of Carthaginian forces at Ilipa in 206 BC sealed the fate of the Carthaginian presence in Iberia. It was followed by the Roman capture of Gades after the city had already rebelled against Carthaginian rule. A last attempt was made by Mago in 205 BC to recapture Cartago Nova while the Roman presence was shaken by a mutiny and an Iberian uprising against their new overlords. But the attack was repulsed. So in the same year he left Iberia, setting sail from the Balearic islands to Italy with his remaining forces. Art and artefacts of Phoenician influence in Iberia Four Iberian \\"Ladies\\": Lady of Cerro de los Santos, Lady of Baza, Lady of Guardamar, and Lady of Elche, are dated around 4th century BC. The Lady of Guardamar, found in 1987, is in the Museum of Alicante. When the Lady of Elche was found, it was thought to be of Hellenic influence, but since the discovery of the Lady of Guardamar in 1987, in the Phoenician (Carthaginian) site of Guardamar near Alicante (Lucentum), Phoenician would seem to be the appropriate designation.

The character made his first appearance in El Gato Negro #1 (October 1993). Grandson of the original El Gato Negro, a former luchador-turned-adventurer, Francisco works as a social worker in Edinburg, Texas and devotes most of his free time to community service. Driven by the gruesome murder of his best friend at the hands of drug-smugglers, Francisco becomes the new El Gato Negro in order to wage war on crime. Unlike most superheroes, he possesses no superpowers and instead makes use of his own athletic abilities, accumulative knowledge, detective skills to fight crime. Operating throughout Lower Rio Grande Valley, he is assisted by several supporting characters including his grandfather Agustin Guerrero and weapons- mechanic expert Antonio Trujillo, and fights an assortment of villains ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Despite being popular with the citizens of his community, El Gato Negro is constantly being hunted by local law enforcement and sensationalized as a menace to society by the media. El Gato Negro is known to perform his vigilante activities under the cover of darkness, earning him the nickname The Nocturnal Warrior, a term which first appeared in within the comics in El Gato Negro #3 (Nov. 1995).EGN Fanclub: Gato-grams part II The character's debut series was met with critical success but lasted only four issues.

Dominguez is currently in-talks for a possible live-action film adaption based on the character.PCBR: Interview with Richard Dominguez Part 4 Publication history =Creation and conception= El Gato Negro was conceived by Richard Dominguez sometime in the mid-to-late '80s and was originally intended to debut in a largely Mexican-American or Latino superhero group called Team Tejas. Dominguez later placed Team Tejas on hold to focus on the development of the El Gato Negro character, as he recalls: The name \\"El Gato Negro\\" originated from an abandoned settlement by the name of \\"El Gato\\", which was located south of Pharr, Texas.The Paper of South Texas - Richard Dominguez's \\"El Gato Negro\\" (part 1 of 2) Dominguez would later devise the character's secret identity, Francisco Guerrero, to have direct ties to the Mexican Revolution. The character's given name came from Mexican revolutionary Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, while the surname Guerrero was mainly chosen for its English-translation \\"warrior\\", although Dominguez has hinted at a more historical significance: El Gato Negro would become grounded in Mexican and Tejano folklore and popular culture, including a large influence from the Lucha Libre traditions. Various aspects of the character's personality and visual design were directly inspired by some of Dominguez's favorite comic book superheroes including The Spirit, The Crimson Avenger, Daredevil, Nightwing and most noticeably Batman.EGN Fanclub: Gato-grams, Richard answers your questionsEl Gato Negro \\"The Hispanic Answer to Batman\\" He also drew inspiration from Walter B. Gibson's The Shadow and Johnston McCulley's Zorro, as well as Lee Falk's comic strip The Phantom. Elements from Japanese animation, manga, and martial arts films also aided in the development of El Gato Negro's costume design and equipment. The example of Judge Margarito Garza's Relampago character helped Dominguez pursue his creation in a self- published format.Planet Comic Book Radio ‚Äì Radio interview with Richard Dominguez Part 3 =Publication= El Gato Negro made his debut in El Gato Negro #1 (October 1993). Cover art by Dave Kramer. Francisco Guerrero made his first published appearance in El Gato Negro #1 written and illustrated by Dominguez in 1993. The first three-part story-arc \\"Unknown passing, Unforgettable Return\\" introduced El Graduado, a notorious villain intent on making a large drug-trafficking deal in South Texas in order to gain a seat with the criminal organization known as The Annulus. El Graduado's best efforts are consistently thwarted by El Gato Negro until a final confrontation in which the criminal is apprehended and last seen awaiting trial. The debut series proved popular, and a fourth issue soon followed featuring a subplot involving Judge Garza's Relampago character, his first appearance in print after nearly fifteen years. The fourth issue titled \\"Enter: The Dogs of War!\\" occurs just weeks after the events of the first story-arc. The issue involved two hired mercenaries intent on killing El Gato Negro. Francisco, exhausted from his vigilante activities, barely survived his first encounter with the deadly duo, which resulted in near inter-cranial injury. A fifth issue tentatively titled \\"And Now...Relampago\\" was due for release, but the comic was put on hiatus ending the last issue with a cliffhanger. There are currently plans to release a trade-paperback compilation featuring of the original series which will include the unpublished issue, thereby resolving the storyline. El Gato Negro returned in 2004 under the new series \\"El Gato Negro: Nocturnal Warrior\\" after a seven-year hiatus. Dominguez enlisted the aid of Michael S. Moore to serve as writer and co-plotter of the new series (having previously worked together on the first published issue of Team Tejas) and artist Efren Molina. The combination of Moore's writing style and Molina's pencils have given the new series a much darker tone than its predecessor, to which Dominguez explains: The new four-part \\"Legacy\\" storyline will retell the history of El Gato Negro and introduces a new villain in his ever-increasing rogues gallery, a blind assassin, known as El Observador. Fictional character history In El Gato Negro‚Äôs first appearance in El Gato Negro #1, he is already an established crime-fighter. According to his origin story, Francisco was raised by his grandfather, Agustin Guerrero, his parents having died in a traffic collision. Francisco studied diligently in school, eventually graduating from South Texas College with a major in sociology, a minor in psychology and earned a master's degree in political science. After completing his education, Francisco decided to look after his grandfather and became a prominent social worker in Edinburg, Texas. Francisco adopted the moniker of El Gato Negro shortly after the death of his childhood friend Mario Bustamonte, a border patrol officer who was overpowered and murdered by several drug-runners. During the months Francisco operated as El Gato Negro, he instantly became popular with the citizens of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. However, the media began vilifying his vigilante activities and to make matters worse El Gato Negro is constantly pursued by police Captain Miguel Bustamone, Francisco's friend and Mario's older brother. In the first El Gato Negro storyline \\"Unknown Passing, Unforgettable Return\\" #1-3, Francisco encountered Armando Ochoa, better known in the criminal underworld as \\"El Graduado\\". Being the son of the successful businessman and drug lord Ignacio Ochoa, El Graduado planned to take his father's place amongst a criminal organization known as The Annulus, which makes a yearly summit in South America. In order to impress the Annulus, El Graduado was to make a large drug-trafficking deal in Texas. After being consistently thwarted by the hero, El Graduado kidnapped his former girlfriend Narcilina Montoya and Francisco's grandfather. Holding both of them at Guerrero‚Äôs Produce, El Graduado offered Agustin him the position as a silent partner in his drug trade. After refusing to help him, Agustin is taken outside to be executed. Francisco frantically rushes to the Guerrero's Produce building and is surprised to find his grandfather in his old El Gato Negro costume. With their efforts along with the aid of the Texas rangers, they are able to subdue the villain El Graduado. El Gato Negro finally earned the respect of Miguel Bustamonte, but he continues to hunt the hero regardless, believing his purposes to be noble, but his methods dangerous. In 1997‚Äôs \\"Enter: The Dogs of War!\\" storyline from El Gato Negro #4 Francisco suffered his greatest defeat at the hands of the Briones Brothers. As El Gato Negro, Francisco is shown to have become overconfident in his abilities and spending more sleepless nights watching over the valley. In revenge for the incarceration of El Graduado, Boss Ochoa enlisted the aid of his nephews, known as The Dogs of War to assassinate the Nocturnal Warrior. Francisco's overwhelming fatigue slowed him in their battle and he was nearly beaten to death. Despite suffering from near inter-cranial injury, he managed to drag himself home, where he collapsed in the arms of his grandfather. In the ongoing \\"Legacy\\" storyline from \\"El Gato Negro: Nocturnal Warrior\\" #1-4, El Graduado has been released from police custody and is enlisting rival mob bosses and street gangs to join his crime family in order to become the main drug supplier for the Annulus. Those who disagree are slaughtered by the blind mercenary and assassin El Observador, who is currently under the payroll of the Ochoa crime family. Personality and characterization El Gato Negro's personality can be characterized by his prowess in combat, highly skilled deductive abilities, a highly instilled sense of idealism and strict moral code. Adopting the persona of a Black Cat, the hero is loosely associated with superstition, bringing bad luck to those who would do evil. He uses darkness to evoke a strong psychological impact among the guilty, often taunting them while he hides in the shadows unseen. El Gato Negro uses any force necessary to apprehend criminals but never so far as to kill them. =Francisco Guerrero= In his secret identity, El Gato Negro is Francisco Guerrero, known for his generous charity and willingness to go out of his way to help others. He is also Catholic,News Observer - Catholic comic book charactersAdherents.com - The Religion of El Gato Negro who believes in aiding his community. Francisco carries the mantle of El Gato Negro as a heavy burden, one which robs him of his social life. According to El Gato Negro #1, Francisco gets \\"This queasy feeling in my gut when I do these 'deed's...but I get an awfully bad one if I don't do anything about it!\\" He often ponders whether or not his existence as El Gato Negro is a sin of pride or genuine necessity and has, on occasion, snuck into his local church confessional to talk with the padre. Skills, abilities and resources Unlike the average comic book superhero, El Gato Negro has no superpowers or abilities out of the normal human spectrum. Instead he makes use of his extensive training in martial arts, lucha libre, tactical weaponry and is assisted by several supporting characters, including his grandfather. While the original El Gato Negro relied more heavily on his fighting ability, Francisco's incarnation of El Gato Negro has a wide-variety of technology to choose from. =Costume and equipment= Detail of El Gato Negro's mask from El Gato Negro #1. Art by Richard Dominguez. Francisco's suit design differs significantly from that of his grandfather's, which was more typical for the Lucha Libre traditions. His entire suit is made of a breatheable material described as \\"similar to biker's shorts\\", the nose and cat-like ears of his mask being reinforced with synthetic leather. The ears of the headpiece also serve to amplify the slightest sound and are able to retain their cup-shape despite being folded or bent. Inside each one of the ears is a battery compartment that powers the mask's lenses, modified from night vision goggles. The suit was designed by Francisco and his friend Antonio Trujillo. El Gato's weapon of choice is the shuriken or \\"Flying Cat's Claw\\". The shurikens are made of steel and are no bigger than 2¬Ω\\" by 3/32\\", each one having 8 sharp barbs with a chisel-like tip. Francisco's suit can conceal a total of 8 Cat Claws in special compartments in his boots and gloves. El Gato will only use the Flying Cat Claws if he or someone else is in immediate danger. These modified shurikens were designed by both Francisco and James Takayuki. Other weapons in El Gato Negro's arsenal include two stylized batons which secretly adhere to the back of his costume. =The Gatocycle= A heavily modified motorcycle constructed by Antonio Trujillo. The Gatocycle has a four stroke, four cylinder engine with twin over-head camshaft and 4 mikuni 40 SS Carburettors, with a max power of 156 HP at 10,000 RPM and max torque of 12Kgm at 9,000 RPM. The vehicle was wrecked shortly after its introduction while El Gato Negro was in a high-speed pursuit, and later Antonio Trujillo begrudgingly reconstructed it. Supporting characters Much of El Gato Negro's character is defined by the supporting characters that surround him as well as their interactions between each other. The most important supporting role in the El Gato Negro mythos is filled by Agustin Guerrero. The few characters who know of El Gato Negro‚Äôs secret identity include mechanic Antonio Trujillo and martial artist James Takayuki, both of whom supply the hero with equipment. Other supporting characters include Miguel Bustamonte, a recurring character since his first introduction, and pool shark informant Enrique ‚ÄúRata‚Äù Armendariz. Narcilina Montoya is a recurring love interest, although Francisco‚Äôs activities as El Gato Negro often prevent him from pursuing a more meaningful relationship. El Gato Negro is known to join forces with fellow superheroes in order to reach a shared goal. He is close friends with the hero Relampago and an ally of Team Tejas, despite his refusal to join the government-funded group. El Gato Negro has also been known to team-up with the anti-hero known as L-7, despite their differing views on vigilante justice. He has often been paired up with characters outside of the Azteca Productions' universe, such as Hector Cant√∫ and Carlos Castellanos' Baldo as well as guest-starring in David √Ålvarez's Yenny, although these are usually deemed non-continuity storylines. =Enemies= El Gato Negro‚Äôs enemies vary from common thugs to outlandish supervillains, some of which have tragic origin stories leading them to a life of crime, while others are simply fueled by their own greed, lust for power, or desire to cause as much chaos as possible. Recurring antagonists include El Graduado, The Dogs of War, Boss Ochoa, El Observador, Dirge, Spring-Heeled Jack, Graveyard, The Anaconda, and Autoheist.El Gato Negro - villains In other media =Film= As of January 2016,Richard Dominguez is currently working with writer-turned-director, Michael S.

Baker House is a 4,800-square-foot Prairie School style house located at 507 Lake Avenue in Wilmette, Illinois. The house, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was built in 1909, and features five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms, and three fireplaces. At this point in his career, Wright was experimenting two story construction and the T-shaped floor plan. This building was part of a series of T-Shaped floor planned buildings designed by Wright, similar in design to Wright's Isabel Roberts House. This home also perfectly embodies Wright's use of the Prairie Style through the use of strong horizontal orientation, a low hanging roof, and deeply expressed overhangs. The house's two-story living room features a brick fireplace, a sloped ceiling, and stained glass windows along the north wall; it is one of the few remaining two-story interiors with the T-Shaped floor plan designed by Wright. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 8, 1974. A major restoration of the home was begun in 2020 under new ownership.

Early life Manbir Singh was born in 1959 in the village of Chaheru, Kapurthala, Punjab. His father, Mohinder Singh, was a farmer. Manbir Singh completed his primary education from his village school. He then moved to the home of his maternal aunt Niranjan Kaur, in the village of Kala Bakra, for his secondary education. After passing his matriculation exams, he assisted his father in agriculture for six years. He later married Ranjit Kaur. Baptism and religious inclination The Nirankari-Sikh events of 1978 affected Manbir Singh. A retired army officer Giani Joginder Singh who was also son-in-law of Manbir Singh's aunt Niranjan Kaur, encouraged him to get baptised (a Sikh initiation ceremony). In 1979, Manbir Singh along with his wife and his father's younger brother, Karnail Singh, took the baptism from Sant Nihal Singh Harian Wela Wale at the Sodal Gurdwara in district of Jalandhar, Punjab. He came in contact with Bhai Mohkam Singh, Bhai Gurbant Singh, Bhai Prem Singh and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale while attending religious classes of Damdami Taksal at the Gurdwara Gurdarshan Parkash, Mehta Chownk, district Amritsar, Punjab. Association with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale In 1981, Chaheru was arrested temporarily because of his heated arguments with a Senior Superintendent of Police of Jalandhar, Gur Iqbal Singh Bhular, when Bhular questioned Chaheru about his actions. Chaheru's uncle, Karnail Singh, got him released on bail with a personal surety that Manbir Singh would appear at Police station the next day. After this incident, Manbir Singh approached Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and moved to the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) complex where he served food in the Sikh free kitchen (Guru ka Langar). Chaheru became Bhindranwale's personal bodyguard. Police arrested his uncle Karnail Singh for Manbir Singh's failure to appear at the police station per his assurance. In the Golden Temple complex, Manbir Singh stayed in room number 53 of Guru Nanak Niwas along with Giani Joginder Singh, Malagar Singh Babbar, Singh and Gurtej Singh. He came in contact with Major Singh Nagoke who fought against Indian forces during Operation Blue Star, Sukhdev Singh Sukha of village Fatu Dinga, Balwinder Singh Khojkipur, Joginder Singh Rode and Kabal Singh. Giani Joginder Singh, a relative of Manbir Singh Chaheru, died while leading a band of Sikhs in fighting Indian army at the main entrance of Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar. Giani Joginder Singh's daughter later married Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's son Inderjit Singh. Khalistan Commando Force Manbir Singh Chaheru was not inside Sri Harmandir Sahib (The Golden Temple) during Operation Blue Star in 1984. After the attack, he fled to Pakistan, but returned to avenge the attack and to achieve independence for Khalistan. He and others, including Harjinder Singh Jinda, Sukhdev Singh Sukha, Gurdev Singh Debu, Mathra Singh and Tarsem Singh Kuhaar, established the Khalistan Commando Force and Manbir Singh Chaheru was declared its leader. Manbir Singh set up the KCF military hierarchy, but adhoc groups conducted most operations at the local level. Manbir Singh Chaheru the chief of sikh militant group Khalistan Commando Force admitted that he had received more than 60,000$ from Sikh organisations operating in Canada and Britain. He participated in several encounters against Indian security forces. In 1986 Manbir Singh and Balbir Singh Raipur planned to release Sukhdev Singh Sukha and Sawarnjit Singh from Police custody as they were to appear in court on charges of slaying Ramesh Chander, a Hindu newspaper editor. Balbir Singh arranged a car and Jarnail Singh arranged a jeep as a get away vehicle. They planned to free both Sukhdev Singh and Sawarnjit Singh from the district courts in Jalandhar, Punjab, India when the prisoners arrived for their monthly hearings. Manbir Singh, Ajitpal Singh, Balbir Singh Raipur, Rashpal Singh, Jarnail Singh met outside the courts. Manbir Singh was carrying a sten gun and all other Singh's had revolvers. When Sukhdev Singh and Sawarnjit Singh arrived under heavy police protection, Manbir Singh signalled them to go to the washrooms. Once they went, Manbir Singh and his partners opened fire on the policemen, the attackers killed four police officers inside the court complex and two at the courtyard gate. They were able to free Sukhdev Singh Sukha, Sawarnjit Singh and Gurinder Singh Bhola. Arrest and death On 8 August 1986, Manbir Singh Chaheru was arrested along with Major Baldev Singh Ghuman, Charanjit Singh dhami and two other Sikhs when approximately 200 paramilitary troops raided Major Baldev Singh's farm House on bootan village the outskirts of city of Jalandhar, in state of Punjab. Punjab police stated that there were two dozen murder cases registered against Chaheru by that time. It is unclear as to what led to his arrest. It is possible that government infiltrators whose aim was to plot the Gurjit Singh faction against Kahlon faction did this. Subsequently the committee members of Kahlon faction were killed by the Gurjit Singh faction. Manbir Singh Chaheru was kept in various jails in state of Punjab, and later he was moved to another jail in the state of Bihar. In December 1987, police announced that Manbir Singh had escaped from the police custody while officials were returning Chaheru from Bihar to Punjab. There were claims that police had killed him while he was in police custody and disposed his body in the Beas River. In the city of Chandigarh, the Punjab Police Chief Julio Francis Ribeiro told news reporters afterward that \\"...they do not need to worry as Manbir Singh will not come back.\\" See also *Khalistan movement References External links *Damdami Taksaal ‚Äì Bio of Manvir Singh Chaheru Category:1959 births Category:People from Kapurthala Category:Indian Sikhs Category:Khalistan movement people Category:Indian murder victims Category:People murdered in India Category:Deaths in police custody in India Category:Punjabi people Category:Sikh terrorism Category:Insurgency in Punjab Category:1980s murders in India Category:1986 crimes in India Category:1987 crimes in India Category:1987 murders in Asia Category:1987 deaths ","title":"Manbir Singh Chaheru"},{"id":"16742728","text":"Valiente (International title: Brave) is a Philippine television drama series broadcast by ABS-CBN and GMA Network.

Rob is first recorded as a surname in the mid-15th century, with a handful of individuals recorded in the decades either side of 1500. As the 16th century progressed there were early groupings in Aberdeenshire, Lanarkshire and later in Perthshire/Stirlingshire. It is likely that the name originated with the offspring of a Robert or Rob, when surnames began to flourish, but unlike some surnames there is no one source for the name. The surname was originally spelled Rob, sometimes Robe, but by 1800 the vast majority of families had added an extra 'b', an exception being a wealthy farming family of Perthshire origin that settled in Thirsk, Yorkshire. Although the surname originates in Scotland, Protestant branches of the family settled in Ireland during the sixteenth century Plantations, with the earliest record of the name appearing in the 1630s. The Robb of Timpany family originated with one James Robb who in the late seventeenth century was said to have been a chief mason of the King's Works in Ireland and an assistant of Inigo Jones. A descendant Captain James Robb built Timpany House in 1780. Another armorial Robb family used the surname Robe, descending from Reverend James Robe of Kilsyth (1688‚Äì1753), son of Reverend Michael Rob of Cumbernauld (1645‚Äì1721), although their coat of arms recorded with the Lord Lyon descends from the Hamilton family through marriage. The Robb crest shows a bare arm holding a chapeau surrounded with a laurel wreath. It appears that many Robbs emigrated to the New World from Ireland, rather than Scotland. The surname sometimes became Raab, presumably through the pronunciation, although many Robbs in the New World are originally Raubs of German origin. Amongst many Scottish settlers, there were three Jacobite soldiers (from Angus and Midlothian) transported to America following the Jacobite rising of 1715, and the first Free Kirk Minister to settle in Canada was the Rev. Ralph Robb (1800‚Äì1850) a native of Logie parish near Stirling. The name is often recorded as a sept of the Clan MacFarlane who were based historically on the eastern side of Loch Lomond, but this only stems from an early inclusion of the surname MacRobb, (which is a Highland surname), as a MacFarlane sept. It is unlikely there was ever a link between the, largely, lowland surname and the highland clan. It is the 192nd (equal) most popular surname in Scotland, judging by births, marriages and deaths in 2018.National Records of Scotland website People with the surname Robb * Alfred Robb (1873‚Äì1935), English physicist * Andrew Robb (born 1951), Australian politician * AnnaSophia Robb (born 1993), American actress * Bruce Robb (born 1954), American record producer * Candace Robb (born 1959), British author * Chuck Robb (born 1939), American politician * Curtis Robb (born 1972), British middle distance athlete * David Robb (born 1947), British actor * Douglas Robb (schoolmaster) (born 1970), British rugby player and headmaster * Ed Robb (born 1942), American politician * George Douglas Robb (1899‚Äì1974), New Zealand surgeon * Graham Robb (born 1958), British author * Ian Robb, English folk singer * Isabel Hampton Robb (1860‚Äì1910), American nursing theorist * J.

View of St James's Hospital at night The Trust was formed in April 1998 after the merger of two previous smaller NHS trusts to form one citywide organisation. The former trusts were United Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (based at Leeds General Infirmary) and St James's & Seacroft University Hospitals NHS Trust (based at St James's University Hospital). The Trust has an overall income of around ¬£1 billion and provides local and specialist services for the immediate population of 770,000 and regional specialist care for up to 5.4 million people . The Trust is rated as Good by the Care Quality Commission. Services Jubilee wing, Leeds General Infirmary It provides services for the population of Leeds and surrounding areas, and is a regional centre for a range of services including cancer, neurosurgery, heart surgery, liver and kidney transplantation. In 2009 it was the largest NHS trust in England, and now employs over 18,000 staff on seven main sites. It runs seven hospitals: *Chapel Allerton Hospital *Leeds Dental Institute *Leeds General Infirmary *Leeds Children's Hospital *St James's University Hospital (including Leeds Cancer Centre) *Seacroft Hospital *Wharfedale Hospital As part of the national response to COVID-19, Leeds Teaching Hospitals also hosted the NHS Nightingale Hospital for Yorkshire and the Humber, located at the Harrogate Convention Centre . Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust delivered the largest surplus in its 20-year history in 2018/19, of almost ¬£53m, compared to the surplus of ¬£19m in the previous year . The Trust has had difficulty gaining Foundation Trust status because of failures to hit key financial and performance targets which caused the Chief Executive Maggie Boyle to resign in June 2013. It is the biggest provider of specialised services in England, which generated an income of ¬£415.3 million in 2014/5.  Redevelopment  Redevelopment of LGI site The Trust is planning significant development and investment across its hospital sites. This includes the building of two new hospitals on the Leeds General Infirmary site (a hospital for adults and one for children and young people) known as Hospitals of the Future and a new Pathology laboratory at St James‚Äôs Hospital serving hospitals in Leeds, West Yorkshire and Harrogate. The programme will also support the development of an Innovation District for Leeds, bringing together the Trust, the two Leeds Universities and Leeds City Council to drive forward investment in sectors including precision medicine, digital health, data and new business.  Research  A dedicated Research and Innovation Centre opened at St James‚Äôs Hospital in 2017 and a six-bed Children‚Äôs Clinical Research Facility was opened at Leeds Children's Hospital by the Countess of Wessex in 2018 . Throughout 2019/2020, the Trust opened 231 new studies overall with the highest recruiting study being the Yorkshire Cancer Research funded Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial. League table results released in July 2019 by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), showed that Leeds Teaching Hospitals was the 4th highest ranked NHS Trust for health research recruitment, recruiting 20,983 people in 2018/19. In 2020, a Clinical Research Facility (CRF) opened in the Bexley Wing at St James‚Äôs Hospital. It provides dedicated space and facilities for the care of patients participating in leading edge clinical trials and was funded by the Trust with support from the University of Leeds, and additional funding provided by hospital charity Leeds Cares for specialist equipment. The Trust's research teams recruited the first patient globally and the first patient in the UK to two COVID-19 research trials of potential new therapies for the virus . The research teams also developed a way to turn a sleep apnoea machine into a ventilator to treat people with Covid-19. The modification on a device known as a Nippy3 was a collaboration between clinical staff, engineers and physicists at Leeds Teaching Hospitals and academics and technologists at the University of Leeds. The Leeds Cancer Research Centre is a partnership between the University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and launched in July 2020. It brings together outstanding scientists and clinicians across discipline boundaries to deliver world-leading cancer research that ultimately improves patient outcomes. The Trust is also one of seven Centres of Excellence in a UK-wide network, RadNet, that will accelerate advances in radiotherapy research . Leeds Teaching Hospitals is part of the Northern Pathology Imaging Co-operative (NPIC) which embraces a network of nine NHS hospitals, seven universities and ten industry-leading medical technology companies. NPIC aims to deploy digital pathology across hospitals in the North of England and will develop artificial intelligence tools to help diagnose cancer and other disease. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In October 2013 as a result of the Keogh Review the Trust was put into the highest risk category by the Care Quality Commission. In 2016, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was inspected and rated Good by the CQC . The Trust was highlighted by NHS England as having 3 of the 148 reported never events in the period from April to September 2013. The trust was one of five to benefit from a five-year, ¬£12.5m programme announced by Jeremy Hunt in July 2015 to bring in Virginia Mason Medical Center to assist English hospitals using their clinical engagement and culture tools including the Patient Safety Alert System and electronic dashboard. Hunt said ‚ÄúThe achievements at Virginia Mason over the past decade are truly inspirational and I‚Äôm delighted they will now help NHS staff to learn the lessons that made their hospital one of the safest in the world ‚Äì patients will see real benefits as a result.‚Äù In 2016, the Department of Health awarded funds to six healthcare trusts in England - the Scan4Safety demonstrator sites - to investigate how consistent use of point of care scanning might improve efficiency and safety within the NHS. Leeds Teaching Hospitals was one of the original demonstrator sites and has achieved savings of ¬£84,411.07 per year on product recalls, with recall times falling from 8.33 days to less than 35 minutes . In April 2016 it was reported that the trust had been forced to cancel liver transplant operations because of a shortage of critical care nurses. The trust renegotiated the private finance initiative for the Bexley Wing at St James‚Äôs Hospital in May 2017 and expects to save ¬£52 million over the life of the contract.

The band's current membership includes, bassist Dan Quinlan, Drummer Frog and guitarist Ben Thomas. History Stu Marshall formed Paindivision (First known as 20 Grams) as a side-project to Dungeon in 2005, originally with Tim Yatras (also of Dungeon) on drums, Jason Spendir on bass, keyboardist Ray Martens and lead vocalist Mark Probin. Tim Yatras left after a short time and was replaced by Joe Rahme and after a handful of shows around Australia with this line-up they opened for ex-Skid Row lead vocalist Sebastian Bach, Mark Probin was replaced with Jordan Howe, best known from The Harlots, an offshoot of Sydney glam metal act Candy Harlots. With this line-up, the group supported Black Label Society in Sydney before reverting to the Paindivision name in November 2006. A self-funded four track EP titled \\"Four Play\\" was also issued and the band began to develop a profile in Japan, where Marshall was known for his work in Dungeon. Dan Quinlan replaced Spendir in 2007 and Paindivision began work on a full-length album and tied up a record deal with Riot! Entertainment. The Paindivision album came out in the middle of the year and was supported by a Japanese tour and Australian performances with Sebastian Bach. In February 2008, Paindivision opened for Helloween in Sydney and soon began work on a second album. Before it was completed, Ray Martens departed from the band. He was not immediately replaced and One Path was recorded as a four piece with some live tracks included from their Japanese shows. The album was subsequently released in Australia in October and by Soundholic in Japan in February 2009. In the meantime, Mark Hobson from Sydney metal band This World joined Paindivision on guitar and Pete Hunt of Razor of Occam replaced Rahme. Vocalist Jordan Howe then left the band a day before they were due to play in Sydney with Death Angel and Armored Saint; a temporary replacement performed with Paindivision that day. Since then, Quinlan has been the group's singer. Hobson parted ways with Paindivision in August 2009 and was replaced by Ben Thomas of Sydney power metal band Thundasteel, who also played on the self-titled album by Marshall's solo project Empires of Eden.

When he was 14, John joined the East India Company and sailed for seven years. In the 1820s, John was present in England when horses were trapped by fire in a stable. To get through the smoke and fire fumes he put on a medieval knight-in-armour helmet air-pumped by hose from a fire brigade water pump and rescued all the horses.http://scubaeds.com/10.html Scuba Ed's - History of scuba diving In 1823, he patented a \\"Smoke Helmet\\" to be used by firemen in smoke-filled areas; the full title is given as \\"Apparatus or Machines to be worn by Persons entering Rooms or other places filled with Smoke of other Vapour, for the purpose of extinguishing Fire, or extricating Persons or Property therein\\". The apparatus comprised a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps. Later, it was developed into a diving apparatus. In 1829, the Deane brothers sailed from Whitstable for trials of their new underwater apparatus, establishing the diving industry in the town. A cannonball that John Deane recovered from the wreck of the Mary Rose In 1830 John and his diving partner, George Bell, salvaged the cannons from the wreck of the Guernsey Lily. Seven of these cannon are now located at Quex Park, Birchington. On 16 June 1836, the Mary Rose shipwreck was discovered when a fishing net caught on the wreck. John and his partner William Edwards, recovered timbers, guns, longbows, and other items from the shipwreck. The location of the shipwreck was forgotten after Deane stopped work on the site of the shipwreck in 1840. William Edwards was his partner between 1834 and 1855. Edwards died in the Crimean War (1854-1856). George Hall was the bell diver who collaborated with the Deanes in the development of their diving apparatus. He is credited with first teaching the Royal Sappers & Miners and Royal Engineers to dive during the salvage of the Royal George, 1839-40. Deane is known to have given a series of lectures in 1847 on \\"diving and submarine operations\\" at the Assembly Rooms in Whitstable. Charles and John Deane exhibited their invention in the Great Exhibition of 1851. John, working for the Admiralty, cleared the Russian wrecks from Sevastapol harbour during the Crimean War. Sarah Ann Browning managed Deane's business affairs when he was working in Crimea between 1854 and 1856. He married Sarah Ann Browning at St Alphege Church, Whitstable, in October 1856 on his return from the Crimean War. Sarah Deane, John Deane's second wife, is buried at Millstroode Cemetery, Whitstable. He died in 1884 and was buried in Ramsgate.

He is regarded by the vast majority of Carnatic connoisseurs and aficionados as one of the greatest mridangam players ever. Personal life Karaikudi Mani was born on 11 September 1945 at Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu. He is the son of T. Ramanatha Iyer and Pattammal. He became involved with Carnatic music at the age of three and soon abandoned his vocal training in favour of learning the mridangam. Career Mani began performing regularly at a time when another player of the mridangam, his idol Palghat Mani Iyer, was in his prime. He took further lessons under the tutelage of Haihara Sharma, after moving to Chennai and received his first national award at the age of 18 from the then President of India, Radhakrishnan. In a 2015 interview he claimed that receiving awards and titles has never been part of his agenda. In 1999 he accepted the national award from \\"Sangeeth Natak Academy\\". This was presented by the President of India at the time, K. R. Narayanan. =Sruthi Laya= In 1986, he started an ensemble, called Sruthi Laya, that combined melody and percussion. Three years later, he founded the Sruthi Laya Seva School that now has centres at Chennai, Bangalore, Australia, London, US, and Canada. =Thani Avarthanam ‚Äì A Concept= He conducted and orchestrated several such concerts, notably a collaboration with Sri VS Narasimhan in 1990 presented Melodyssey, a project with 40 artistes, including Western and Indian Instruments. This won widespread appreciation and was released on tape. His next endeavour, the concept of \\"Thani Avarthanam\\" concerts. Whilst Thala Vadya (Percussion ensemble) concerts in Carnatic music were not unheard of, the concept of just two percussion instruments performing solos without any other \\"sruthi\\" performers (e.g. vocal, violin) had never been attempted. In 1993, Karaikudi Mani presented his first Thani Avarthanam concert along with the late Kanjira wizard G Harishankar. This spellbinding performance is regarded a landmark moment in the classical percussion field. It has revolutionised the role of the mridangam, proving that as an art form, South Indian percussion instruments can be played as solo instruments in their own right. A concept initiated by Mani has since been undertaken by several leading mridangists who have also performed Thani Avarthanam concerts. Since then, Mani has conducted several \\"Thani Avarthanam\\" duet concerts featuring leading percussionists on Ghatam, Thavil, Chendai, etc. International Collaboration Guru Karaikudi Mani has performed with many international artists like Paul Grabowsky of Australian Art Orchestra, Eero Haemmeneimi of Finland Naada group, Elio Marchesini La Scala percussionist and Livio Magnini of Italy, Paul Simon of USA and with Finland Philharmonic Orchestra. A piece called Layapriya was performed with Finland Philharmonic Orchestra which was later performed by the Battery Dance Company as a dance ballet. The Australian Art Orchestra has adapted his Bahudari and Ranjani compositions into Jazz style and released it as \\"Into The Fire\\". The Naada group of Finland has converted the Behag composition into Jazz orchestrisation and released it as \\"UNMATCHED\\". It is his greatness as a percussion maestro that made Eero Haemmeneimi dedicates 4 compositions in his name. His latest venture titled \\"Amrutham ‚Äì Fusion for Freedom\\" is an effort. Apart from that, he has also collaborated with Japanese musician John Kaizan Neptune to create an album named \\"Steps in Time\\". In this album, Guru Karaikudi Mani has created a unique synthesis of shakuhachi and Indian percussion. In 2008, Mani collaborated with Sarangan Sriranganathan and other Australian musicians in a Classical/ Fusion concert called \\"Unity in Diversity\\". In 2011, he played on Paul Simon's album So Beautiful or So What. He founded a magazine called Layamani Layam.

The orchestra consists of adults who have a keen and serious interest to perform music. Formerly known as the Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra Society (PCOS), the group became The Philharmonic Orchestra (TPO) to better reflect its intention to perform both symphonic and chamber works. The Philharmonic Orchestra seeks to breathe new life into musical works and explore a repertoire that is very much neglected by big orchestras like SSO. The orchestra held its first concert in May 1998, performing Handel's Fireworks Music, Prokofiev's Classical Symphony and Mozart's Jupiter Symphony. For the 2007‚Äì2008 season, TPO has been engaged by Esplanade ‚Äì Theatres on the Bay to undertake a year-long performance of all Jean Sibelius' Symphonies in a series of three concerts entitled Northern Exposure. The Philharmonic Orchestra is also known for its commanding standard as a pit orchestra. It has received good reviews for its work as a pit orchestra when engaged by the Singapore Dance Theatre and Singapore Lyric Opera. Since then, it has stopped collaborating with the Singapore Lyric Opera, and focuses more on presenting its own concerts, the latest of which included two Haydn symphonies. TPO currently does not rehearse at Old School anymore after management disputes between the two parties. In December 2001 and 2003, the orchestra was engaged by the National Arts Council as the accompanying orchestra for the concerto section at the National Music Competition.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Yiftachel studied in Australia and Israel, specializing in urban studies and political geography. In 1990, he received a Doctor of Philosophy from the Department of Geography, the University of Western Australia, Perth, and the Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning, the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.'Prof. Oren Yiftachel: Curriculum vitae (Short Version),' 2014. He returned to Israel, where he did his post-doctoral studies on regional planning at the Technion, Haifa. He has subsequently taught urban planning, geography, political science and Middle East departments, at various institutions, including: Curtin University, Australia; the Technion, Israel; the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and UC Berkeley, in the United States; the University of Cape Town, South Africa and the University of Venice, Italy. Most recently, he was appointed as a visiting professor at RMIT University, Melbourne; and as a Leverhulme professor at University College London (Geography and the Bartlett). He was also a research fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC; and the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute, Jerusalem. Yiftachel is the founding and past editor of the journal, Hagar: Studies in Culture, Politics and Place, and has serves on the editorial board of Planning Theory, IJMES, MERIP, Urban Studies, Journal of Planning Literature, Environment and Planning A, and Territory, Politics, Governance. Yiftachel has worked as an urban and regional planner in a range of institutions, including the Perth City Council in Australia, the Kibbutz Movement and \\"Israel 2020\\" project in Israel. He specialized in advocacy planning and land consultancy. Recently he has worked on an Israeli- Palestinian plan for a bi-national Jerusalem, an alternative plan for the unrecognized Bedouin villages in southern Israel, and a plan for a multicultural Beersheba. Yiftachel has worked as an urban and regional planner in a range of institutions, including the Perth City Council, the Kibbutz Movement, and \\"Israel 2020\\" project in Israel. Yiftachel is also an activist, and has been a member of several notable organizations, including Faculty for Israel-Palestine Peace (FFIPP), PALISAD, The Negev Coexistence Forum, Adva (centre for social equality), and Habitat International Coalition. In recent years Yiftachel served as a board member and chair of B'tselem ‚Äì the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories; and has co- founded a new Israeli-Palestinian peace movement ‚Äì \\"A Land for All - Two States, One Homeland\\". For many years he has worked as planner and advocate with the indigenous Bedouin populations in the Negev/Naqab and other regions. He is an occasional op-ed contributor to leading Israeli newspapers, including Haaretz, Ynet and Ma'ariv. Scholarship Yiftachel has been a leading researcher drawing worldwide attention. During the last decade he has been the most highly cited Israeli scholar in geography and urban studies. A special issue of an international journal was recently devoted to the theory of ethnocratic regimes, two decades after their formulation by Yiftachel.\\"Special Issue on Ethnocracy,\\" Cosmopolitan Civil Societies, Vol. 8, No. 3 (2016), University of Technology Sydney Press. Accessed: 11 January 2019. His works develops critical perspectives of space and power; minorities and public policy; 'ethnocratic' societies and land regimes. In urban and planning studies he's early work focused on Australian metropolitan planning and its impact on 'urban social sustainability'. He later developed a theory of the 'dark side' of urban planning and has contributed to opening up planning theory to critical theory in general, and to issues of identity, colonization and space in particular. In recent years he has developed a theory of gray space and 'displaceability' as underlining condition of new urban regimes and citizenship. In parallel, he developed with colleagues a model of 'doing the just city' as a theoretical and professional alternative. In political geography, his work formulated the concept of 'ethnocratic' regimes, which has generated debates in ethnic and racial studies, regime theories and research in Israel/Palestine. His comparative work has focused on comparatively analyzing spatial policy towards minorities in a range of 'ethnocratic' states and cities, most particularly Australia, Sri Lanka, Estonia, Cyprus, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and South Africa. In recent years Yiftachel has worked on the political and legal geography of indigenous peoples, focusing on Bedouins in Israel/Palestine in a comparative framework, as well as on concepts such as 'gray spacing', 'mtrozenship' and 'urban displaceability' which he developed during the last decade. In a series of books and articles, Yiftachel explores comparatively the types of regimes that typically develop under condition of ethnic conflict. In this framework, He conceptualizes the Israeli regime as an ethnocracy, promoting a dominant project of 'ethnicization' throughout Israel/Palestine, in which ethnicity dominates citizenship.[3] He documents the various practices of this project, and the manner in which it has constructed ethno-class identities and stratified citizenship through the process of expansion, development, projects of Judaisation and politicization in the different regions of Israel/Palestine.[4] His model traces the nature of the Zionist project, taking into account the historical circumstances spawning Jewish 'colonization of refugees'. His early work also focused on the tension between liberal and ethnocratic-religious components of the Israeli regime, and on the privileged status given European over Eastern Jews established during the settlement project, but also the recent closing of the gaps through on-going colonization of Palestinian lands. Palestinians are relegated to the status of 'unwanted' indigenous peoples resisting the ethnocratic project.[3] Yiftachel uses a multidisciplinary approach, inspired by Neo-Gramscian thinking and by a range of Marxian, post- and neo-colonial theorists. In the study of Israel/Palestine he was one of the first to break the traditional scholarly divisions between analysis of Arab-Jewish relations and internal Jewish dynamics, and one of a handful of scholars to question whether Israel acts as a democratic state within the Green Line (Israeli pre-1967 borders). The Israeli regime, according to Yiftachel, has presided over the entire historic Palestine for over five decades, and should be analyzed according to the power structures he claims it imposed over the entire territory. Yiftachel developed the 'settler-ethnocratic' model to highlight the regime's main historical-material logic, and the concept of 'creeping apartheid' to describe its recent manifestation and the development of four different 'separate and unequal' types of citizenship under the Israeli regime.. Yiftachel's work is rich in conceptualization, with development of a conceptual architecture including terms such as 'trapped minorities', 'fractured regions', 'ruptured demos', 'internal frontiers', 'frontiphery', 'gray spacing' and 'displaceability'. His recent work also develops a 'South-Eastern' perspective by providing alternative conceptualizations to the dominant theories and discourses generated by American and European academic centers.

The consumer revolution marked a departure from the traditional mode of life that was dominated by frugality and scarcity to one of increasingly mass consumption in society.Fairchilds, Cissie. ‚ÄúReview: Consumption in Early Modern Europe. A Review Article‚Äù. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 35, No. 4. (Oct., 1993), pp. 851. History Consumerism has weak links with the Western world, but is in fact an international phenomenon. People purchasing goods and consuming materials in excess of their basic needs is as old as the first civilizations (e.g. Ancient Egypt, Babylon and Ancient Rome). Bernard Mandeville's work The Fable of the Bees, which justified conspicuous consumption. The consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century, mainly due to trade deals with their extensive colonies across 4 continents. Change was propelled by the growing middle-class who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity. This revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market. This included sugar, tobacco, tea and coffee; these were increasingly grown on vast slave plantations in Caribbean colonies as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in Britain during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20.http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/handle/2072/41988/1163.pdf?sequence=1 Moreover, the expansion of trade and markets also contributed to the burgeoning consumer revolution, by increasing the variety of goods that could be made available to affluent society. This pattern was particularly visible in London where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and created a culture of luxury and consumption that was slowly extended across the socio-economic divide. Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres, such as the New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield. There was growth in industries like glass making and silk manufacturing, and much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville's influential work The Fable of the Bees in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.Peck, Linda, \\"Consuming Splendor: Society and Culture in Seventeenth-Century England\\", Cambridge Press, 2005 Wedgwood pottery, featuring Horse Frightened by a Lion motif from George Stubbs, 1780. These trends were vastly accelerated in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The pottery inventor and entrepreneur, Josiah Wedgwood, noticed the way aristocratic fashions, themselves subject to periodic changes in direction, slowly filtered down through society. He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes and preferences to cause his goods to be accepted among the aristocracy; it was only a matter of time before his goods were being rapidly bought up by the middle classes as well. His example was followed by other producers of a wide range of products and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important. Semi-luxury and imitation Popular culture drew aesthetic techniques, design, and technology from the goods England gathered from trade in Asia and the Mediterranean. With the increased demand for Asian ceramics, European markets had difficulty supplying buyers so inventors started imitating Chinese porcelain. Porcelain remained popular for tableware and pottery, but the style, shape and decoration of the porcelain changed to fit more Western tastes, painting flowers and English scenes rather than Chinese ones.Berg, Maxine, \\"From imitation to invention: creating commodities in eighteenth-century Britain,\\" Economic History Review, 2002. Imitation goods were also used to disguise social class. Middle-class consumers could not afford the same exotic luxury goods brought back from overseas trade that the elite class used to distinguish their elevated rank. Markets and shops whose target buyers were middle-class consumers began creating \\"semi-luxury\\" goods that imitated actual luxury goods. These goods were part of a movement to create a \\"counterfeit culture\\" that gave middle-class consumers an opportunity to emulate the wealth and luxurious life that the elite class lived without paying as much. Household decorations, kitchenware, clothes, and transportation vehicles were all objects that could be used to crossover into \\"polite society.\\"Wilson, Ross J. \\"'The mystical character of commodities:' Post-Medieval Archaeology Vol. 42, No. 1 (2008) pp. 144-156. England was concerned with the quantity products exported out of England in comparison to the countries they traded with. England did not want to be overcome economically by countries in Asia because they did not export as much so merchants, artisans, and shopkeepers started creating their own goods to compete with the Asian market.McCants, Anne C.\\"Exotic Goods, Popular Consumption, and the Standard of Living: Thinking about Globalization in the Early Modern World,\\" Journal of World History Vol. 18, No. 4 (2007) To avoid entirely copying Asian goods, English inventors imitated goods from other countries that also traded with Asia such as France, Holland, Switzerland, and Spain. The goal was not to mimic the exact product, but instead use the techniques that proved successful in other European imitations to create a superior product.Berg, Maxine, \\"From imitation to invention: creating commodities in eighteenth-century Britain,\\" Economic History Review, 2002. Imitation and semi-luxury goods were also popular because they showed the modernization of English production and manufacturing processes. Large-scale production required standardization, advanced mechanical replication, and an organized system of assembly. Substitutes for the indigenous materials used to create the original products were seen as a show of enlightened and advanced thinking. The imitation and innovation of semi-luxury goods was a testament to the potential the English had to impact the global economy, to be France, China and India in national exports.Berg, Maxine, \\"In Pursuit of Luxury: Global History and British Consumer Goods in the Eighteenth Century,\\" Oxford University Press, 2004.

Founded in 1985 by social and environmental activists, International Rivers works with policy and financial analysts, scientists, journalists, development specialists, with volunteers to combat destructive dams and their legacies in over 60 countries. The organization has staff in South Africa, Thailand, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. The staff has expertise in a range of issues and uses research, education, and advocacy to achieve the organization's mission. About The organization stated aims are to protect rivers and defend the rights of communities that depend on them. It is active against the development model with which dams are associated, which International Rivers holds to be unsustainable. It promotes alternative solutions for meeting water, energy and flood-management needs. The organization is dedicated to giving dam-affected people the tools to participate in the development of local lands in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. By facilitating international grassroots organizing and informed participation, the organization seeks to change the terms of the debate over river development. The group works with its numerous partners to advocate for social reparations, ecological restoration and decommissioning of existing dams. International Rivers states that it works to clarify the traditionally top-down decision-making of large infrastructure projects. It also argues against industry's presentation of hydropower regards climate change, making clear that reservoirs often produce greenhouse gas emissions that further impact on the environment. Programs The organization has undertaken a two- pronged approach to analyzing and promoting viable water and energy solutions. Combining its efforts to change global policy with campaigning on specific key projects, the organization simultaneously addresses the root causes and localized consequences of destructive dam development. Their campaigns throughout Africa, China, Latin America, South Asia and Southeast Asia focus on the intersection of dams and climate change, reforming the policies and practices of international financial institutions, and promoting water and energy solutions that recognize human rights and environmental sustainability. Contributions Among its accomplishments, the organization counts its integral involvement with the formation of the World Commission on Dams as one of its most important contributions. The commission was a global, multi- stakeholder body initiated in 1997 by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union, formed in response to growing opposition to dams. During its two-year lifetime, the WCD conducted the most exhaustive study of dams done to date, ultimately evaluating over 1,000 dams in 79 countries. In its published final report, the WCD concluded that although \\"dams have made an important and significant contribution to human development, and benefits derived from them have been considerable... in too many cases an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid to secure those benefits, especially in social and environmental terms, by people displaced, by communities downstream, by taxpayers and by the natural environment.\\"WCD final report Since the organization's inception, worldwide construction of dams has decreased by half, and universal recognition of the consequences of hydropower continues to increase. The organization publishes a journal, World Rivers Review, focused on addressing the state of various dam projects, ecosystems, and people. It also publishes an annual report on a variety of dam-related subjects.

In 1930, Ardie President Willy Bendit assigned German engineer Josef Ganz to build a prototype of a small Volkswagen according to his design. This Ardie- Ganz prototype was finished in September 1930 and achieved highly successful road-test results. The car featured a tubular chassis, mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. In 1936 the company returned to making motorcycles with two-stroke engines of its own manufacture. During the Second World War the company made a model with Ardie's own design of 350cc twin-cylinder side-valve four-stroke engine.

Like the Bl√©riot (and most other designs of the era), the fuselage was left uncovered as an open framework. Although G≈Çowi≈Ñski managed to make a number of short flights in the machine from May to summer 1911, it was too heavy for the powerplant selected, which itself was worn out, and development was soon abandoned.

He became the first British aristocrat to star in a Hollywood movie, and was later nicknamed the Duke of Hollywood by the local press. Early life Portrait of his mother, Marjorie, Countess of Warwick, by John Singer Sargent. Charles Guy Fulke Greville was born at 13a Lower Grosvenor Place West, London on 4 March 1911. He was the eldest son of Leopold Greville, 6th Earl of Warwick (1882‚Äì1928) and his wife Elfrida Marjorie Eden (1887‚Äì1943), the only daughter of Sir William Eden, 7th Baronet. \\"Fulkie\\", as he was known to intimates, had two younger brothers, Hon. Richard Francis Maynard Greville, a Governor of University College Hospital, and Hon. John Ambrose Henry Greville, who was killed in action in 1942 during World War II. His paternal grandparents were Francis Greville, 5th Earl of Warwick and his wife, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick. His grandmother Daisy inherited the Maynard estates in 1865 from her grandfather, Henry Maynard, 3rd Viscount Maynard, and reportedly was a long- term mistress to the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII. Fulkie was educated at Eton and at Chillon College, Lake Geneva in Switzerland. He succeeded to the earldom at the age of 16 in January 1928, on the death of his father (who had only become the 6th Earl four years earlier in 1924). He joined the Grenadier Guards after completing his education. Career The Earl of Warwick, 1933 = Acting career = In the 1920s and 1930s, many British actors found work in the American film industry; Sheridan Morley called this the \\"Hollywood Raj\\".Sheridan Morley (1983) The Brits in Hollywood: Tales from the Hollywood Raj. UK: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. , also published as Tales From The Hollywood Raj: The British, the Movies, and Tinseltown. New York: Viking, 1983, . In 1936, Charles Greville became the first British aristocrat to be offered a Hollywood contract by MGM. He was to receive ¬£200 a year, and the services of a valet and secretary. Newspaper reports at the time suggested his reasoning for taking a film contract was sex motivated. He referred to his wages as his own \\"pocket money\\" and that he was 'simply seeking a job like everyone else'. He used the stage name Michael Brooke to distance himself from his aristocratic background. After six months he was dropped by MGM resulting in a long court battle thereafter. As the highest- profile Englishman in Hollywood, Charles became a celebrity figure with nicknames like 'The Duke of Hollywood' and 'Warwick the Filmmaker' (a pun on Warwick the Kingmaker). Listed with a string of high-profile affairs including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Paulette Goddard, he was famed for socialising within celebrity circles. In 1938, he was offered another chance at acting through Paramount. He finally got his chance to star in a movie and was given a lead role in The Dawn Patrol alongside David Niven and Errol Flynn. This would be his only mainstream movie however, and he was subsequently dropped thereafter. = The Earl of Warwick = Following his failure in America, and with the start of World War II, Warwick returned to the United Kingdom. Coventry, near his family seat, suffered tremendous aerial bombing, and he opened his home to evacuees from the city, as well as to the Ministry of Supplies. It was rumoured that Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess was held at Warwick Castle for one night while being transported from Scotland to London. He was Mayor of Warwick between 1951 and 1952, organising great celebrations for the success of the boxer Randolph Turpin, and although not then Mayor hosted King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Warwick Castle when they visited Warwick and Leamington in 1951. Warwick was a Conservative member of the House of Lords; his political actions included opposing certain agricultural measures successfully. He supported his uncle Anthony Eden who succeeded Winston Churchill in the 1950s. = Later life = In 1955, Charles Greville bought homes in Switzerland, Italy, and France and begin travelling between all three. In 1957, he funded and established the illustrious Eagle Ski Club in Gstaad, Switzerland, becoming its first honorary President. Throughout the next decade, Charles, widely described as one Britain's richest men, began to sell many of the family possessions, including estates in Warwick, heirlooms, and much of the armour collection at Warwick Castle. In 1969, he left England altogether to avoid British income taxes, moving to Rome. In 1967, he handed over control of his family estate to his son David Greville, Lord Brooke. His son sold Warwick Castle to Madame Tussauds in 1978, causing a public confrontation between father and son.  Personal life Lord Warwick was married three times. He was also engaged to Margaret Whigham, later Duchess of Argyll, but the engagement was broken off in March 1932. His first marriage took place on 11 July 1933 to his second cousin, Rose Bingham, daughter of David Cecil Bingham (a granddaughter of the 5th Earl of Rosslyn and Gen. Sir Cecil Bingham and a descendant of the 4th Earl of Lucan). Before their 1938 divorce, Charles and Rose were the parents of one son: * David Robin Francis Guy Greville, 8th Earl of Warwick (1934‚Äì1996), who married Sarah Anne Chester Beatty, daughter of Alfred Chester Beatty (the \\"King of Copper\\"), in 1956. They divorced in 1967 and she married Harry Thomson Jones. After their divorce, Rose married three more times before her death in 1972. Lord Warwick's second marriage took place on 19 February 1942 to Mary Kathleen (n√©e Hopkinson) Bell. Mary, the former wife of Harold Edward Bell, was the eldest daughter of Percy Clifford Hopkinson of Seabarn in Kingston Gorse. In 1947, he pleaded guilty to \\"cashing two checks at Cannes, France, thus receiving francs for pounds in violation of British Treasury regulations\\" and was fined ¬£1,150. They divorced in 1949. Lord Warwick married thirdly in November 1963 to Janine Josephine Detry de Mares, a daughter of Georges Detry de Mares. Upon the death of Lord Warwick in Rome on 20 January 1984, David Greville, 8th Earl of Warwick, his only son by his first wife, inherited his titles. He was buried at St. Mary's Church, Warwick.

The organization uses the power of the courts in litigation against groups and people it accuses of supporting terrorism or being enemies of Jews and Israel. Shurat HaDin has been described by some as a pro-Israel lawfare-waging NGO. History When Shurat Hadin was founded in 2003 its stated purpose was to \\"combat terrorism and promote civil rights through research, education and litigation.\\" According to its founder, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, its creation was inspired by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the United States, which used civil litigation to cripple and bankrupt the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups in the US. According to a leaked US embassy cable, Darshan-Leitner told a US embassy official in 2007 that her organisation in its early years \\"took direction ... on which cases to pursue\\" and still \\"receives evidence\\" from the Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel. Darshan-Leitner denies ever saying that to a U.S. diplomat. Organization Shurat HaDin is staffed with activist Israeli attorneys and works with numerous other law offices internationally which serve as co- counsel on cases being litigated in courtrooms in the U.S., Canada, Israel and elsewhere. By 2012, Shurat HaDin had 11 employees, three with salaries over $100,000.Crusading for Israel in a Way Some Say Is Misguided, Jodi Rudoren, Jan. 23, 2015, New York Times It retains two public relations firms, one in Israel and one in New York. The annual budget is $2.5 million, but the donor(s) are all anonymous. Prominent cases Shurat HaDin has been involved in a range of legal actions in Israel and abroad on behalf of civil rights cases. =North Korea abduction case = Plaintiffs proved claims under the terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act leading to a $330,000,000 judgement against North Korea. This was the first time that a US court concluded that a foreign regime which abducts an individual who is then never heard from again, has the burden of proving that he has not been murdered. =Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization= In 2015, Israel Law Center represented several dozen plaintiffs who were victims of six terror attacks in Jerusalem in 2002 and 2004 committed by Hamas and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The plaintiffs sued the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act, arguing that the PLO and PA had facilitated the attacks by providing financial aid and logistical support to the attackers, and by giving \\"martyrdom\\" payments to the families of suicide bombers. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $218.5 million, which was automatically trebled under the Anti-Terrorism Act to $655.5 million. In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the verdict, finding that PLO and PA lacked a sufficient connection to the United States for the federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over them in a civil case, in accordance with the limits set by the Constitution's Due Process Clause.Benjamin Weiser, Court Throws Out $655.5 Million Terrorism Verdict Against Palestinian Groups, New York Times (August 31, 2016). =Gaza flotilla = Shurat Hadin used lawfare to threaten lawsuits against parties associated with the Gaza Flotilla. This was accomplished in three ways: 1) It informed maritime insurance companies that by insuring sea vessels used by terrorists (for delivery of weapons to be used by terrorists), they would be liable for future attacks by those terrorists; 2) It warned Inmarsat, a U.S. based satellite communications provider, that under U.S. law it would be open to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism if it provide services to those Gaza-bound ships; and 3) it filed civil lawsuits against the ships that were to participate in the flotilla.The second action was Shurat HaDin‚Äôs legal warning to Inmarsat, a U.S. based satellite communications provider, that under U.S. law they will be open to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism if they provide services to these Gaza-bound ships. =Judgement against Iran and Syria= Nitsana Darshan-Leitner of the Shurat HaDin Israel won a case in May 2012 in which she was representing the family of Daniel Wultz, a 16-year- old American who was killed in a suicide bomber attack in a Tel Aviv restaurant in 2006. The case was tried in a U.S. District Court, and represented the first time that a U.S. court issued a judgement against Syria for terror related activities. The amount of the judgement was $323,000,000. The court explained that Iran and Syria were responsible for supporting \\"Palestinian militants\\" in that bombing which killed 11 people.Israeli group wins $323 million suit in US court against Iran and Syria for restaurant bombing =Sderot= On January 7, 2008, ten families of Sderot (Israel) residents, whose relatives were killed or seriously injured by Palestinian Qassam rockets, filed a lawsuit against the Egyptian government in the Be'er Sheva District Court seeking compensation in the amount of NIS 260,000,000 ($65,000,000 US). The court complaint accuses Egypt of intentionally assisting what it calls Palestinian terror organizations in smuggling explosives and weapons into the Hamas controlled Gaza strip. The plaintiffs argue that Cairo assists the organizations by authorizing the smuggling of tons of explosives and thousands of weapons into Gaza. They also argued that the Egyptian government allowed what the group called terrorists to cross back and forth from the Egyptian-held Sinai into Gaza, permitting them an open route to and from what Shurat HaDin asserted to be terrorist training bases in states like Iran, Lebanon and Syria. =Alien Torts Act and the Torture Victims Protection Act= On September 10, 2006, Shurat HaDin and New York attorney Robert Tolchin filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the families of 12 missing Iranian Jews against the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. The complaint alleges that the former president was responsible for the kidnapping and torture of their missing family members in Iran. The families, currently residing in Los Angeles and Israel, claim that Khatami instituted the cruel policy of making Iranian Jewish detainees \\"disappear\\" ‚Äì that is imprisoning Iranian Jews without trials and refusing to provide their families any information concerning their arrests, status or whereabouts. The families of the missing Jews, who are not U.S. citizens, brought the suit under special laws ‚Äì the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 ‚Äì which permit foreigners to sue their tormentors for torture and kidnapping in American courts. The plaintiffs are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages against Khatami for what they assert to be his role in the ongoing disappearance of their relatives. Khatami has refused to answer the complaint and has defaulted the case. =Collaborators with Israel= On May 1, 2008, Shurat HaDin along with former Soviet refusenik, Ida Nudel launched a public campaign to save the life of a Palestinian police officer accused of having assisted the Israeli intelligence services in hunting down fugitive terrorists. The policeman, Imad Sa'ad, has been sentenced to death by a Palestinian military tribunal in Hebron. Sa'ad, it is alleged, provided the Israel Defense Forces with the whereabouts of four suspected bomb makers whom the Palestinian Authority was unwilling to hand over to the Israelis. Shurat HaDin accused the Palestinians of having engaged in a show trial that did not permit the defendant, a father of four, the right to counsel nor the right to call witnesses in his defense. Darshan-Leitner and Nudel wrote to then- president George W. Bush, the European Union and the Vatican to ask for their support. =UBS bank= On May 13, 2008, Shurat HaDin was co-counsel in filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Swiss bank, UBS which is accused by the plaintiffs of financing terror. The plaintiffs in the case, all of whom had family members injured or killed in Israel, allege that UBS's unlawful eight-year-long provision of financial services to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the time that the group allege that Tehran was providing material support to terrorist organizations renders the Swiss bank liable for the harm that has been inflicted upon them and their families. This was the first civil action brought by what the group allege to be American victims of Katyusha rocket attacks by Hezbollah. The group alleges that the Swiss bank was involved in transferring dollars to regimes such as Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. The UBS operation was uncovered by American soldiers in Iraq in 2003 who discovered brand new dollars, still wrapped in Federal Reserve casings behind a wall in Saddam Hussein's palace. A Federal Reserve investigation of the currency determined that UBS was responsible for illegally transferring between $4 to $5 billion to states designated by the U.S. as sponsors of terrorism between 1996 and 2004. At first UBS sought to deny the extent of the money transfers it had provided to Iran and others, but eventually was compelled to admit the scope of its criminal activities. UBS, one of world's wealthiest banks, was fined $100 million by the Federal Reserve for its conduct. The lawsuit charges UBS, which has a branch in New York, with aiding and abetting what the group allege to be Iran's support of terrorism, by illegally providing Tehran the dollars it needed to pass along to the terrorist groups for their purchases and attacks. =Iranian families and diplomats= On June 30, 2008, Shurat HaDin filed a petition in the Israeli High Court of Justice on behalf of the families of 12 missing Iranian Jews seeking to block the Israeli government from releasing information on the fate of four disappeared Iranian diplomats as part of a prisoner exchange deal with Hezbollah. The petition was heard on Wednesday, July 2, 2008. The Jews were arrested in the 1990s as they sought to escape from Iran across the border with Pakistan and they are believed to still be in Iranian prisons. The Iranian diplomats disappeared in South Lebanon in 1982. The petition demands that the Prime Minister not authorize the transfer of information regarding the diplomats until such time as reliable and detailed information is received about the missing Jews' fate. Shurat Hadin claims it has reliable information that at least one of the Jews is still alive and being held as a prisoner in Tehran. The families contend that the government must honor the obligations imposed upon it by the Israeli High Court approximately two years ago, in a prior High Court proceeding, that [the Israeli government] \\"...push forward diligently without sparing any effort in order to gain information about the [12 missing] Jews of Iran.\\" The families are insisting that there be a \\"quid pro quo\\" on information about their family members in exchange for the release of the details on the fate of the missing Iranians. Shurat HaDin emphasized that, the families' are not appealing against the deal to bring back the Hizbollah captives itself but rather are demanding that the fate of the 12 missing Jews be included as a \\"quid pro quo\\" before any information about the diplomats is released. =American Express Bank and Lebanese-Canadian Bank= On July 14, 2008, Shurat HaDin and Attorney Robert Tolchin of New York filed suit against American Express Bank (Amex), accusing it of partaking in a transfer of money to Hizbollah. The action was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Representing some 85 victims and their family members, the Shurat HaDin lawsuit alleges that the Amex and the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) unlawfully performed millions of dollars in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by Amex Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006. The plaintiffs rested their claims in part on written findings issued by the New York State Banking Department in 2007, which determined that Amex Bank had failed to establish adequate procedures to prevent terrorism financing as demanded by state and federal law. This was the first lawsuit brought by alleged victims of terrorism against a U.S. financial institution. The suite was dismissed by the federal trial judge in 2010 but reinstated on appeal in 2012. =Jimmy Carter= In 2011, Shurat HaDin sued former President Jimmy Carter and publisher Simon & Schuster over the publication of Carter's book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. The group claimed that Carter's book included anti-Israel misrepresentations that violated New York consumer protection laws. Simon & Schuster said the suit was frivolous, without merit, and a \\"chilling attack on free speech.\\" The suit was criticized by legal scholars; Kevin Jon Heller of Australian National University called it \\"dangerous\\" and \\"quite simply absurd,\\"Kevin Jon Heller, Another Dangerous Lawsuit ‚Äî This One Involving a Former U.S. President, Opinio Juris (February 16, 2011). while Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School said it was \\"clearly frivolous\\" and that the complaint was \\"written like a press release without a thin pretense of legal claims.\\"Jonathan Turley, A Basis for Damages or Sanctions? Jimmy Carter Sued Over His Book on Palestine, February 16, 2011. The plaintiffs dropped the suit. =World Vision Australia= In 2012, Shurat HaDin sent a letter to the Christian relief, development, and advocacy group World Vision Australia (WV) and the Australian government's international aid agency AusAID, asserting that the groups' funding of the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC), a Gaza-based Palestinian nonprofit group, could make WV and AusAID \\"personally, criminally and civilly liable under Australian and US law.\\" Shurat HaDin alleged that UAWC was a front group for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a proscribed terrorist organization, and asserted that by providing aid to the UAWC, WV and AusAID were \\"aiding and abetting Palestinian terrorism, and thereby violating Australian and United States anti-terrorism laws.\\" WV suspended its work with UAWC pending an outcome of the investigation, and resumed working with UAWC after AusAID and WV determined that the allegations were unfounded. An investigation conducted by AusAID in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, found no evidence to substantiate Shurat HaDin's claims of a link between UAWC and PFLP. In an October 2012 letter to Shurat ha-Din, World Vision Australia CEO Tim Costello said that the allegations made by Shurat HaDin were \\"unsubstantiated, and in some circumstances, defamatory\\". = Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, Australia = In 2012, Prof. Dan Avnon, a political theorist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, applied for fellowship at Sydney University and asked Prof. Jake Lynch at Sydney to endorse his application. Lynch refused, citing his leadership with the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies and his support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. In 2013, Shurat HaDin sued Lynch for violating Australia's anti-racism laws and attempted to use the suit to outlaw BDS in Australia. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry publicly denounced the suit as an inappropriate use of the courts. In April 2014, the court struck part of the suit, and Shurat HaDin lawyers narrowed the complaint to the specifics of Avnon and Lynch. But Avnon made known that he did not support the suit. In July 2014, noting that Shurat HaDin did not represent a willing client and did not have a complaint of its own, the court dismissed the case and awarded attorney fees to Lynch. Shurat HaDin told Haaretz that \\"the case was thrown out on a technicality, not on the merits of the arguments ... [Lynch's] lawyers came up with a trick to avoid the issue being heard on its merits.\\" The Shurat HaDin spokesman said the suit was a warning to other Australian academic institutions. =Case against Palestinian Authority= Shurat HaDin is preparing to take the Palestinian Authority (PA) to the International Criminal Court (ICC). In the event that the Palestinian Authority is accepted into the ICC, it will enable the PA to become susceptible to lawsuits. Shurat HaDin is preparing in advance by collecting thousands of testimonies from Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorist attacks.NGO to sue PA for terrorism Shurat HaDin Chairwoman Nitsana Darshan-Leitner explained, \\"we've received dozens of terror victims' testimonies, from relatively 'light' stories to truly shocking ones.\\" Shurat HaDin filed a complaint against Mahmoud Abbas before filing complaints against other PLO officials. On January 6, 2015, days after PA appealed to join the ICC, Shurat HaDin filed complaint against three PLO officials, Jibril Rajoub, Majid Faraj and prime minister Rami Hamdallah.

The lawsuit was filed under the 2011 Law for Prevention of Damage to State of Israel through Boycott. Sachs and Abu-Shanab had earlier penned an open letter on the New Zealand online current affairs magazine The Spinoff in December 2017 urging Lorde to cancel her Israel concert, citing human rights abuses against the Palestinians. In October 2018, the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that the two New Zealand activists pay NIS 45,000 ($12,300) in damages to the plaintiffs, and court fees. This is believed to be the first successful application of the 2011 law. The two activists stated that they had \\"no intention\\" of paying the teenagers, and launched a crowdfunding campaign in order to give the money to Gaza Mental Health Foundation, and raised more than $18,000 for the Gaza project in 3 days.Lorde concert boycott: New Zealanders fined by Israel raise thousands for Gaza, Eleanor Ainge Roy, 15 Oct 2018, The Guardian Darshan-Leitner said that legal agreements between Israel and New Zealand would enable here to \\"enforce this ruling in New Zealand, and go after [the activists'] bank accounts until it has been fully realized.\\" Academic legal experts in New Zealand wrote that attempts to enforce the judgement there were unlikely to be successful. =Operation Harpoon= According to the Shurat HaDin's director Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, the NGO was in regular contact with the Mossad as part of the latter's Operation Harpoon to track terrorist money networks.

Man In Oriental Costume (\\"The Noble Slav\\"), oil on canvas, by Rembrandt, 1632. A significant example of European emulation of Ottoman dress for the purpose of portraying a dignified, elite appearance. Turquerie (Anglicized as \\"Turkery\\") was the Orientalist fashion in Western Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries for imitating aspects of Turkish art and culture. Many different Western European countries were fascinated by the exotic and relatively unknown culture of Turkey, which was the center of the Ottoman Empire, and at the beginning of the period the only power to pose a serious military threat to Europe. The West had a growing interest in Turkish-made products and art, including music, visual arts, architecture, and sculptures. This fashionable phenomenon became more popular through trading routes and increased diplomatic relationships between the Ottomans and the European nations, exemplified by the Franco-Ottoman alliance in 1715. Ambassadors and traders often returned home with tales of exotic places and souvenirs of their adventures. The movement was often reflected in the art of the period. Music, paintings, architecture, and artifacts were frequently inspired by the Turkish and Ottoman styles and methods. Paintings in particular portrayed the Ottomans with bright colours and sharp contrasts, suggesting their interesting peculiarity and exotic nature. History of the movement In the wake of the Age of Exploration, roughly between the 15th and 18th centuries, there was an explosion in the number of commodities and availability of products. People were using newly created cartography and using these maps to explore the world on paper. There was an accumulation of more objects and a desire for more acquisitions. Coupling this, there was the value of exoticism, valuing things that came from a great distance. Europeans and Ottomans alike were developing a consciousness of themselves in relation to the broader world. At the same time the Ottomans were slowly ceasing to be regarded as a serious military threat to Western Europe, despite their continuing occupation of the Balkans, and campaigns such as that ended by the Battle of Vienna as late as 1683. New patterns of consumption were arising, especially with trading ships being able to navigate around Africa. Commodities that were once expensive were becoming more affordable. Products often define people in terms of gender, age, and availability of access. This notion of social definition outlines the main theme of the explosion of commodities from 16th century and onwards. The exchange system had to do precisely with accessibility and availability of commodities on a grand scale. It is important to note that this was not just a European phenomenon. The Europeans were not the only people who developed a sensibility of how consuming different things could define their relationships domestically and abroad. In this context, there was a broader view of consumption and one‚Äôs place within the world. A person would consume in order to show off their financial position and their social location. = Coffee = When coffee was first imported to Europe, locals looked to its place of origin to better understand the new phenomenon. Ottoman scholars‚Äîwho had been studying the plant for centuries and were producing relevant, new sources‚Äîbecame the main reference for Edward Pococke and Antoine Galland‚Äôs written works on coffee. Academia, such as this, was a key component within coffeehouse culture. The history of coffee in Europe as a product was inextricably linked to this culture. It was ‚Äúan institution and a set of customs‚Ä¶transferred from one region to another,‚Äù in this case from the Ottoman Empire to western Europe. The introduction of coffee to the European scene was neither new nor just a common consumable good; it was a direct result of ‚ÄúOttoman mediation.‚Äù Visiting elites from high-class European circles were frequently exposed to the drink through Ottoman elites and diplomacy, complete with porcelain, embroidered napkins, and special etiquette. Furthermore, visiting Ottoman military or diplomatic officials would serve coffee in similar ways within European cities. Adhering to strict instructions, sequences, and measures, good coffee had to be prepared with a precision that the Ottomans had perfected, a skillset that Europeans had yet to learn to apply to their version of the bitter, crude drink. = European perspective = Europeans developed an appetite for exoticism as greater emphasis was put on empire building and colonization in other nations. There was a growing fashion for Turkish styles in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. Europeans did not regard Ottomans as rivals that they had to contend with and imitate militarily, politically, or diplomatically, but rather as an exotic foreign people possessing quaint and strange fashions that could be consumed. Consuming these exotic fashions would show one‚Äôs elite place in society as well as display their open-mindedness and interest in the world. These \\"obsessions\\" with Turkish aesthetics were in part brought on by the presence of Europeans in the Ottoman Court and the acts of bringing back their products to Europe. The increased mercantile relationships between the Turkish people and the Europeans aided this process; the continuation of these trading systems helped to spread new fashions quickly in Europe.  Decorations and patterns  Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria had his working room decorated in the Turkish style in 1881. It is partially preserved at the Hofmobiliendepot in Vienna. Brightly colored Turkish styles of decoration were used on many types of objects, including timepieces. Many of those imported had the hours and religious names in Arabic characters. A person who owned one of these timepieces was one with an increased social status. The Turkish grandeur portrayed by the sultans was attractive to Europeans. Agostino Veneziano made a portrait of Suleyman the Magnificent, sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1520. He was known as the ‚Äúgrand Turk‚Äù and constantly disrupted European balance. The image portrays the sultan as a gentle, yet barbaric person. He was most known for executing the wishes of the sultana, Roxelana, who wanted their children murdered to secure the throne for one of their sons. Fabrics were often bright, rich, and embroidered, as depicted in the painting, Himan de la Grande Mosquee by Joseph-Marie Vien in 1748. In the context of turquerie, Turkish textiles were also a luxury in the elitist European homes. They often had velvet grounds with stylized floral motifs. They were often woven in Asia Minor for the European market or, more commonly, as Venetian, under Turkish influence. Italian-styled textiles were often woven by the Ottoman Turks for the Venetians because of their cheap labour and continued business relationships.  Portraits: European and American  Social position was something very important in the 18th century so things like dress, posture, and props were carefully selected in order to communicate one's status. This need to express status mixed with a new interest for Turkish style allowed for Turkish dress and decorations to become very important props. This included wearing loose, flowing gowns belted with ornate bands of embroidered cloth and ermine-trimmed robes with tasseled turbans. Women even abandoned their corsets and attached strings of pearls to their hair for much more freeing material. The loose clothing and the unorthodox styles added to the lewd perceptions of the Ottomans. This interest was something that motivated the creation of many portraits were Turkish people were often depicted as exotic, and it became rare to see portraits where they were painted without wearing their traditional cultural clothing. Writing also contributed to the visual aspect of Turkish cultural exchange and perhaps the most influential transformation into the turquerie vogue in Europe was done by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Montagu went to Turkey in 1717 when her husband was posted as ambassador there. Her collected letters describing Turkish fashion were widely distributed in manuscript form in her social circle and were then printed for the public upon her death in 1762. Her letters and descriptions helped shape how Europeans interpreted the Turkish fashion and how to dress. This phenomenon eventually found its way across the Atlantic and in colonial America, where Montagu's letters were also published.  Opera  Two 18th century Turkish women, pastel by Jean-√âtienne Liotard, who visited Turkey with a British ambassador in 1738. Unlike their baggy trousers, the huge pattens worn by the women would not have struck Europeans as remarkable, as Western women wore similar overshoes. In 18th century Europe, it was in fashion to smoke Turkish tobacco in a Turkish pipe, wearing a Turkish robe, all while in an elaborate Turkish costume. European opera was influenced heavily by the idea of turquerie. Mehmed the Conqueror (1432‚Äì1481), one of the most prominent sultans of the Ottoman Empire, had many operas written about him. His conquest of Constantinople in 1453 was the basis of the German opera Mahumeth II, composed by Reinhard Keiser in 1693. In 1820, Gioachino Rossini composed Maometto II, which is set during the Siege of Negroponte (1470) by the forces of the Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Mehmed II. Moreover, there were many operas based on the ongoing conflicts between Timur and Beyazid I, including Tamerlano by George Handel. These stories of perseverance and passion appealed to many Europeans and therefore gained popularity. One of France‚Äôs most important opera genres was trag√©die en musique, depicted by Scanderberg, with music by Fran√ßois Rebel and Francois Francoeur and the libretto by Antoine Houdar de la Motte in 1735. This opera was visually one of the most elaborate of the Turkish operas, with detailed scenic designs for mosques and seraglio courts. Many exotic characters were displayed as well. Operas using themes from turquerie were in the usual European languages but tried to imitate the Turkish culture and customs. It offered a world of fantasy, splendor, and adventure that was unattainable by the average person. Audiences would be fascinated with the Turkish and Ottoman institutions depicted. The stories and implications as well as the extravagant costumes and elaborate staging appealed to the people. The Europeans craved reality in their depiction of the Turkish peoples. During performances, females would often be in the latest fashion, where local colour was suggested by foreign attire or numerous ornaments. The males tended to wear more authentic Turkish dress than the female, including a turban, sash, long caftan, and binding with rich material, since authentic Turkish female dress was often restrictive and plain.  Music  Turquerie by Maurice Quentin de La Tour. The music in operas that utilized the notion of turquerie was not seriously influenced by Turkish music. Composers in the 18th century were not interested in ethnomusicology, to adopt the style of sound of a particular country or area. The European audiences were not yet ready to accept the unappealing and what they thought of as primitive musical style of the Turkish people. Traditional Turkish music included wavering pitches, microtones, arabesques, different scale systems, and non-Western rhythmic patterns. Europeans thought of this type of music, as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart once said, \\"offensive to the ears.\\" Having short spurts of it in the operas were common, but just to add comedic affect.

The visitor center was closed from 2006 to 2011 due to structural damage from unstable soils. The rotunda structure was demolished and replaced with a new structure of different design, while the quarry section was being stabilized and repaired. Design The visitor center was built in part to attract visitors to the little-visited monument, which had been threatened with flooding by the Echo Park Dam, as a means of guarding against renewed reservoir proposals. The visitor center's concept was first expressed in 1916 when George Otis Smith, the director of the U.S. Geological Survey, suggested that the specimens be displayed in the northern canyon wall. Local citizens, including the dinosaur quarry's discoverer Earl Douglass, proposed a skylit shelter for the display. A temporary shelter for the bones and their excavators was finally built in 1936. A preliminary design in January 1937 was produced by a group including the Park Service Western Office of Design and Construction, the American Museum of Natural History and the directorate of the Park Service that closely resembled the eventual design by Anshen and Allen. A number of succeeding designs followed, becoming more elaborate and departing from this concept. No funding emerged for the design, but a new wood and corrugated sheet metal shelter was built in 1951, reminiscent of the 1916 proposal.

The baronetcy in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom is extant as of . The Ramsay Baronetcy, of Balmaine in the County of Kincardine, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 3 September 1625 for Gilbert Ramsay, the son of David Ramsay (died 1636) and Margaret Ogilvie, daughter of Sir Gilbert Ogilvie of Ogilvie. David Ramsay was MP for Kincardineshire in the Parliament of Scotland and the grandson of John Ramsay, Lord Bothwell. The fourth Baronet was one of the Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain and subsequently sat for Kincardineshire in the British Parliament. The fifth and sixth Baronets also represented Kincardineshire in the House of Commons. The latter assumed the additional surname of Irvine. Alexander Ramsay-Irvine, the 6th Baronet, died without sons 11 February 1806, at which point the Nova Scotia baronetcy either became extinct or dormant (though two relatives styled themselves as the next baronet, without proving parentage). The Ramsay Baronetcy, of Whitehill in the County of Edinburgh, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 2 June 1665 for John Ramsay.) The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1744. The Ramsay Baronetcy, of Bamff in the County of Perth, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 3 December 1666 for Gilbert Ramsay.) The title became extinct on the death of the twelfth Baronet in 1986. The Ramsay Baronetcy, of Abbotshall in the County of Fife, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 23 June 1669 for Andrew Ramsay.) The title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet in 1709. The Ramsay Baronetcy, of Balmain in the County of Kincardine, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 13 May 1806 for Alexander Ramsay. Alexander Burnett was the second son of Catherine Ramsay, the granddaughter of Sir Charles Ramsay, 3rd Baronet of Balmain of the earlier creation (1625) in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, which was inherited by her brother, Sir Alexander Ramsay-Irvine, 6th Baronet. Catherine Ramsay married Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, 6th Baronet, and their eldest son, Robert, inherited the Burnett baronetcy, while their second son, Alexander Burnett, was his maternal uncle's namesake and heir. Sir Alexander Ramsay, 6th Baronet bequeathed his estates to his nephew and the baronetcy was revived in favour of Burnett a few months after Sir Alexander's death, who changed his surname to Ramsay by royal licence. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for MP for Kincardineshire. The third Baronet was Member of Parliament for Rochdale. The seventh and present Baronet is the presumed heir to the dormant Burnett Baronetcy of Leys. William Alexander Ramsay, eldest son of Captain Francis Ramsay, third son of the second Baronet, was a brigadier-general in the British Army.

Stand up 2011 saw Anderson launch on to the standup comedy scene, alongside old co-host and radio DJ Iain Lee. The regular night in Camden, London called Clip Joint, part standup part review show, featured a heady mix of archive television shows, audience participation, special guests and Lipton's Ice Tea. Special guests have included Josie Long, Miles Jupp and writer of The Inbetweeners, Iain Morris. Television Anderson began his television career as a music reporter for UK Play's The Phone Zone.

In 2017 he made a series of YouTube films with Graham Norton‚Äôs company So Television under the title The Douglas Anderson Show. This saw him ruminating on aspects of pop culture including music, film and television whist visiting areas of musical and filmic importance. The show‚Äôs subheading was ‚ÄòPopular Culture Defined‚Äô.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxc-AtQm92Y-NYZZSEghTSg A regular feature was Behind The Man where Anderson would literally sit behind the person he was interviewing. Interviewees throughout the series included Idris Elba, Frankie Boyle, Vin Diesel, Stephen Mangan, Melanie C and Richard Osman. In 2007 he presented the Grovesnor UK Poker Tour and in 2008 Anderson presented the Red Bull Air Race World Series alongside Konnie Huq for Channel 4. The show was nominated in the Best Sports Programme category at the 2009 Broadcast Television Awards but lost out to the BBC's 2008 Grand National coverage. Later that year Anderson presented the Scottish BAFTA awards ceremony with Lorraine Kelly. In 2009, Anderson went on tour with the England cricket team as part of a series of films entitled The Nightwatchman for Vodafone to commemorate the 2009 Ashes. Anderson was investigative reporter at the 2010 and 2011 DFS Crufts Dog Show for More 4, from the NEC in Birmingham, alongside the BBC sports presenter Claire Balding. Anderson's coverage of these events was presented from the point of view of a beginner who was keen to learn more about the events. Film In 2018 Anderson took a behind the camera role on Bart Layton‚Äôs feature film American Animals where he worked closely with Layton as music consultant.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6212478/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast In 2015 his film The London Nobody Knows Now played to sell out audiences at the BFI London On Film Festival and was also inducted into the BFI Archive.

In 2010 Anderson worked with Belle & Sebastian on the promotional film \\"Belle & Sebastian Write About Love\\", launched to coincide with the release of the album of the same name. Playing the dual roles of host and the group's stressed but pragmatic manager, the film also features the band performing songs from the album. The Guardian selected the show as a Pick of the Week, calling it \\"brilliantly filmed, edited and slightly oddball\\". Anderson reprised his role by introducing the band onstage for their headline slot at the All Tomorrows Parties Festival in December 2010 in Minehead. Anderson has talked about working with the band as well as his passion for music. Anderson has written, directed and starred in various short films.

Books  His first book was the novella-length What To Talk About When There‚Äôs Nothing To Talk About, designed to help those who struggle to have anything to talk about at social events, such as dinner parties, where conversation is imperative. His second book, Left Of The Mainstream, published in 2016, has been critically acclaimed. The book is part memoir and part guide to DIY creativity. It has been described as inspirational, brilliantly written and extremely funny. With vignettes of his career thus far, ranging from the highs of multi-faceted creativity and genuine A-list celebrity shoulder-rubbing, to the lows of severe allergic reactions to bus travel and wholly unexpected near death experiences. Never one to take the road well-travelled when there are more interesting back alleys to be explored, Anderson takes us on a cultural safari.  Podcast  Anderson has made three series and a number of specials of his music podcast, The Public Service Broadcast. They see him playing the best in new music, older and often little known classics, film and television soundtracks. He has also hosted Back To The Culture which sees him interview comedian Miles Jupp about his greatest cultural passions.https://soundcloud.com/mr-douglas-anderson/back-to-the-culture His latest is Seven Floors Up, a mix series on Mixcloud which began in 2019 and runs to the present day.

The 12-track tape was recorded at Sunburst Studio in Los Angeles, California after drummer Brad Wilk joined the band, but before they had played their first live show. When the band began performing live shows they sold the tape for $5, eventually selling approximately 5,000 copies.Malkin, John. Sounds of freedom : musicians on spirituality & social change. Page 94. Berkeley, Calif. : Parallax Press, ¬©2005. . Shortly thereafter, the band was signed to a record deal with Epic Records on the strength of the demo's success. As well as being sold at early live shows, the demo tape was sent to a number of record companies to showcase the band. Atlantic Records was sent one and produced a number of copies which the label sold under its own name. The band later discovered this but decided not to take action. The Atlantic Records issued cassette tape features an entirely different cover than the band's self-released tape, with an artistic rendering of a man with a distorted and zippered face and the band's Rage Against the Machine moniker made apparently of lettering taken from different newspaper headlines. Tracks 7 of the 12 songs on the demo tape were included on the band's eponymous debut album, with only 5 songs omitted: \\"Darkness of Greed\\", \\"Clear the Lane\\", \\"Mindset's a Threat\\", \\"Auto Logic\\", and \\"The Narrows\\". Of the 5 omitted, the first 2 were eventually included as B-sides on the lead single from the debut album, \\"Killing in the Name\\", with the remaining 3 never seeing an official release. Several songs on the demo are nearly identical to the versions appearing on the debut album, but others have noticeable differences; the tempo of \\"Take the Power Back\\" on the demo, for example, is much slower and has a different final verse. The record is notable for the first appearance of the song \\"Bullet in the Head\\", which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year after being transferred intact (with re-recorded vocals for the verses only) from the demo to the album. The song \\"Darkness of Greed\\" hails back to vocalist de la Rocha's previous band Inside Out, which broke up mid-1991. Inside Out performed the song on many occasions, and several RoIOs exist of those performances. (RATM later re-recorded the song for The Crow soundtrack.) Another significant indicator of Inside Out's influence on RATM's initial direction is the fact the name \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" is also the title of an Inside Out song. The main riff from \\"The Narrows\\" would later be reused as the main riff for \\"Fistful of Steel\\" and parts of \\"Mindset's a Threat\\" would later become a part of \\"Wake Up\\" and are present in \\"Freedom\\" and in the solo on \\"Bullet in the Head\\". The main riff for \\"Clear the Lane\\" is nearly identical to that used on their 2000 cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\". The songs \\"Darkness of Greed\\" and \\"Clear the Lane\\" were both digitally remastered and included as B-sides on the \\"Killing in the Name\\" single and have both been reissued on singles and promos many times since. The artwork features images from a newspaper's stockmarket section with a single match taped to the inlay card. The statement, \\"No samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this recording\\", can be found on the cover, and the band also refer to themselves as \\"Guilty Parties\\" as they did on each subsequent original studio album. Track listing The songs on the demo are as follows: # \\"Bombtrack\\" ‚Äì 4:14 # \\"Take the Power Back\\" ‚Äì 5:52 # \\"Bullet in the Head\\" ‚Äì 5:17 # \\"Darkness of Greed\\" ‚Äì 3:45 # \\"Clear the Lane\\" ‚Äì 3:54 # \\"Township Rebellion\\" ‚Äì 4:28 # \\"Know Your Enemy\\" ‚Äì 4:22 # \\"Mindset's a Threat\\" ‚Äì 4:03 # \\"Killing in the Name\\" ‚Äì 6:38 # \\"Auto Logic\\" ‚Äì 4:07 # \\"The Narrows\\" ‚Äì 4:39 # \\"Freedom\\" ‚Äì 5:44 Personnel * Zack de la Rocha ‚Äì vocals * Tom Morello ‚Äì guitar * Tim Commerford ‚Äì bass (listed as Timmy C.) * Brad Wilk ‚Äì drums * Rage Against the Machine ‚Äì production * Auburn Burell ‚Äì recording engineer 7\\" EP Sometime after their debut CD was released, an unofficial white label 33 RPM 7\\" vinyl was produced, simply titled Rage Against the Machine; it featured 3 tracks from the demo tape. Both catalog numbers are etched into both sides; RELAPSE-3 L-41056 appears as RELAPSE-3 L-41056-X on the B-side. A paper sleeve shows a xeroxed image of the band name and a portion of the debut CD's front cover; backside has track titles and newspaper clip images, reminiscent of the demo tape artwork. Some copies have the band's name in all capital letters ink-stamped on the white label. This is apparently a Japanese-issued fan club pressing.

It made a range of models using engines from 125cc to 250cc made by ILO, and the Gouverneur, which had a transversely-mounted 248 cc flat twin four-stroke engine designed by Richard K√ºchen, and shaft drive. The Gouverneur was developed into the MP 250-2 and finally, in 1953, the S 300 model. From 1949 to 1954 Hoffmann also made at least 60,000 Vespa motor scooters under licence. A licensing dispute brought this to an end in 1954. At the same time Hoffmann also withdrew from making its own motorcycles, and had further legal problems with their microcar, the Auto-Kabine. Beginning Hoffmann Vespa 125 Jakob Oswald Hoffmann moved his Solinger Bicycle Factory to Lintorf, near D√ºsseldorf, shortly after the end of World War II. In the immediate postwar era the factory made household goods, tools, and bicycles. The factory began making motorcycles in 1948. Vespa production On 9 August 1949, Hoffmann's factory was granted the first licence to manufacture Piaggio's Vespa scooter. One month later, on 9 September 1949, the factory changed its name to Hoffmann-Werke. Hoffmann made thousands of Vespas each year from 1949 to 1953, ultimately making at least 60,000 Vespas by the end of production.

The Gouverneur, designed by noted motorcycle designer Richard K√ºchen, expanded Hoffmann's range upmarket from their existing line of two-stroke ILO-engined motorcycles. Both the frame and the engine were new designs, and the development costs of the Gouverneur were very high. This was compounded by quality control problems caused by a workforce without experience in making engines. In 1953, the Gouverneur's power output was increased from at 4500 rpm to at 4800 rpm Auto-Kabine Hoffmann built the Auto-Kabine 250 microcar in the last quarter of 1954. This was a copy of the Isetta, using the Gouverneur's 250 cc flat-twin engine, and featuring a single suicide door on the right side of the car instead of the Isetta's door on the front. BMW, the official licence-holder for Isetta production in Germany, sued Hoffmann, forcing them to end production after selling slightly more than 100 Auto-Kabine 250s for DM 2,900 each. Downfall Hoffmann had invested heavily in developing the Gouverneur motorcycle, the Auto-Kabine microcar, and a more powerful version of the Vespa. None of these investments turned out to be profitable. The Governeur initially had quality control problems due to an inexperienced workforce and was later affected by a decrease in the motorcycle market as the German public increasingly turned to cars. Hoffmann was forced to end production of its Auto-Kabine microcar when BMW, holder of the licence to build Isetta microcars, won its infringement lawsuit against Hoffmann. Most significantly, the marketing of Hoffmann's more powerful version of the Vespa caused Piaggio to withdraw their licence. With Hoffmann's Vespa licence gone, the creditors lost faith in the company and called in their loans, forcing them into bankruptcy.

In 1920 Friedrich Kleemann (1868-1949), financial manager at the Rex Konservenglas Gesellschaft (preservative jar manufacturing company) in Bad Homburg (Germany) bought COLUMBUS MOTORENBAU AG, a small motor factory in Oberursel by Taunus, which was in the neighbourhood. The factory made the later Horex model and the name remained the same for almost 30 years. Fritz Kleemann, the son of Friedrich Kleemann, made the first cycles with a GNOM engine, delivered from the Columbus-Engine factory. In 1923 Fritz Kleemann (1901-1975), founded HOREX-FAHRZEUGBAU AG. He derived the name from his town HOmburg and his father's preservative jar company REX. He was also a motorcycle racer and was riding his own Horex machine. He built the first \\"real\\" Horex, a 248cc, OHV, that he tested himself on race. So, Horex was built for motorcycle riders by motorcycle riders. Horex built motorcycles with Columbus four-stroke engines from Motorenfabrik Oberursel. In 1925 Horex and Columbus merged. Horex developed a range of models with single-cylinder Columbus engines from 250 cc to 600 cc. In 1933 it added two parallel-twin models: the 600 cc S6 and 800 cc S8. Both twins have chain-driven OHC valvegear. 1955 Horex Imperator in the Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum Neckarsulm World War II interrupted motorcycle production, but Horex resumed in 1948 with a 350 cc single-cylinder model, the SB 35 Regina. In 1951, Horex added a 500 cc OHC parallel-twin engine called the Imperator. In 1954 it added a 400 cc version of this twin to its range. In 1955, the company replaced the Regina with the Resident. Horex motorcycles were rarely exported and only a few are surviving outside Germany. 2855 Regina s and 2420 Imperator s were produced between 1948 and 1955. Daimler-Benz which had a close association with Horex since 1948 took over the company in 1960 and motorcycle production was terminated. Friedl M√ºnch, famous for his Mammut series of car-engined roadsters, purchased the rights to the brand in 1977, and built a massive 1400cc roadster dubbed the Horex 1400 TI in 1978. In 1989 CK Design in Japan developed the Horex 644 OSCA with Fritz Roeth in Hammelbach. The 644cc single cylinder Honda RFVC engine made its debut in Berlin in 1990 . On 15 June 2010, it was announced that the brand would be revived and that a Horex motorcycle with a narrow-angle, six-cylinder supercharged engine would be available for sale in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at the end of 2011, with international sales to follow.

OBI provides a model for the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the materials used, the data generated and the type of analysis performed on it. The project is being developed as part of the OBO Foundry and as such adheres to all the principles therein such as orthogonal coverage (i.e. clear delineation from other foundry member ontologies) and the use of a common formal language. In OBI the common formal language used is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). As of March 2008, a pre-release version of the ontology was made available at the project's SVN repository.Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)  Home __TOC__  Scope  The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) addresses the need for controlled vocabularies to support integration and joint (\\"cross-omics\\") analysis of experimental data, a need originally identified in the transcriptomics domain by the FGED Society, which developed the MGED Ontology as an annotation resource for microarray data. OBI uses the basic formal ontology upper-level ontology as a means of describing general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain. As such, all OBI classes are a subclass of some BFO class. The ontology has the scope of modeling all biomedical investigations and as such contains ontology terms for aspects such as: *biological material ‚Äì for example blood plasma *instrument (and parts of an instrument therein) ‚Äì for example DNA microarray, centrifuge *information content ‚Äì such as an image or a digital information entity such as an electronic medical record *design and execution of an investigation (and individual experiments therein) ‚Äì for example study design, electrophoresis material separation *data transformation (incorporating aspects such as data normalization and data analysis) ‚Äì for example principal components analysis dimensionality reduction, mean calculation Less 'concrete' aspects such as the role a given entity may play in a particular scenario (for example the role of a chemical compound in an experiment) and the function of an entity (for example the digestive function of the stomach to nutriate the body) are also covered in the ontology.

Following a mutual decision to collaborate, this effort later became a wider collaboration between groups such as FGED, PSI and MSI in response to the needs of areas such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics and the FuGO (Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology)Whetzel, PL et al. Development of FuGO: an ontology for functional genomics investigations. OMICS 10, 199‚Äì204 was created. This later became the OBI covering the wider scope of all biomedical investigations. As an international, cross-domain initiative, the OBI consortium draws upon a pool of experts from a variety of fields, not limited to biology. The current list of OBI consortium members is available at the OBI consortium website. The consortium is made up of a coordinating committee which is a combination of two subgroups, the Community Representative (those representing a particular biomedical community) and the Core Developers (ontology developers who may or may not be members of any single community). Separate to the coordinating committee is the Developers Working Group which consists of developers within the communities collaborating in the development of OBI at the discretion of current OBI Consortium members.

It involved a global eustatic rise in sea level. It was named for the Kaƒç√°k Member of the Srbsko Formation in Bohemia, where it is represented by a black shale interval within a sequence of limestone. In marine environments, this appears as an anoxic event, often forming potential hydrocarbon source rocks such as the Marcellus Shale. Within the Old Red Sandstone continent, it is represented by the Achanarras lake, the deepest and most widespread lake that developed within the Orcadian Basin. The event is associated with significant extinctions, particularly amongst the Ammonoidea. Age and duration The event occurred towards the end of the Eifelian, extending into the earliest part of the Givetian, in the mid-Devonian period. The duration of the event has been estimated as 700,000 years from the seven cycles involved in the Achanarras interval (each cycle interpreted to represent 100,000 years), but only 200,000 years using geochemical and magnetic resonance data from the Eifelian-Givetian boundary in Morocco. Occurrence The Kaƒç√°k interval was first named from its occurrence in Bohemia as a black shale unit, known as the Kaƒç√°k Member. This organic rich shale is found within a sequence of shallow water limestones forming the Srbsko Formation of the Prague Basin. The event has also been recognised at Eifel in Germany, Gorodenka (near Omsk, Russia) and in Ontario and New York State in eastern North America, all localities lying on the then continental shelf around the Old Red continent. Further afield at the time of the event, on the continental shelf on the other side of the Rheic Ocean, it has been recognised in Morocco, Cantabria in northern Spain, the Carnic Alps and Graz Paleozoic in Italy and Austria, the Montagne Noire in France and in the Barrandian area of the Czech Republic. The Orcadian Basin of Scotland is the only locality within the continent itself that the event is recognised. Similar events have also been correlated with the Kaƒç√°k Event in China and Australia. In Brazil, the event was registered in the Paran√° Basin. Geochemistry At the level of the Kaƒç√°k Event there is a marked negative excursion in the Œ¥13C level, interpreted to be a result of the anoxic event. This reduction matches closely to an increase in both total organic carbon and a change in the fractionation of carbon between carbonates and organic 'reservoirs'. Cause The cause of this event is interpreted to be a period of high temperatures resulting from high insolation levels. This explains both the transgressive event recognised at the margins of the Old Red continent, caused by thermal expansion of the oceans, and the formation of the Achanarras lake within the continent due to the increased intensity of monsoon conditions. Extinctions The Kaƒç√°k Event was a period of significant extinctions, although not as marked as those of the subsequent Late Devonian extinctions. The group most affected was the Ammonoidea, although there were also faunal turnovers amongst conodonts and dacryoconarids. Economic importance Organic-rich black shales that formed during this anoxic event occur in several countries. In the eastern United States the Marcellus shale is in the early stages of being exploited for shale gas, with large recoverable reserves predicted. An initial USGS assessment from 2002 suggested about 2 TCF of recoverable gas, while in 2009, a study by the United States Department of Energy gave an estimate of 262 TCF.US Department of Energy (April 2009): Modern shale gas development in the United States: a primer, p.17, PDF file, downloaded 7 March 2012.

Award themes In 2005, There was a circus theme to go with the location at Luna Park Sydney. At the show they had a circus tent set up and when awards were given, clowns were shown doing things that related to the award (e.g. Best Group had clowns holding a net ready to catch the other clown jumping from a high place). The theme for 2006 was the budgie smuggler. During the lead up to the show MTV Australia aired adverts where men would talk about their budgie smugglers and how they like to wear them and so on. The logo for the show however did not reflect this theme. In 2007, the TV advertising campaign for the 2007 awards featured various singers and groups unrolling their own red carpets in different locations around Australia. This year MTV Advert was about the focus on the Technology park with people with white costumes with a white helmet with cords and plugs on the helmet it was shot at the technology park where the event is going to be taken place.

He joined the Royal Navy in 1943, being present at D-Day and then serving as naval \\"minder\\" to war correspondents covering the Battle of Normandy. Falling ill, by the end of 1944 he was demobbed [demobilized], and became a war correspondent at only 19 years old. He spent four years with the Hulton Press current affairs magazine group, being one of the first journalists to see Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and learning his trade from Alan Moorehead (later becoming his biographer). He then moved on to be a feature-writer and then Naval Correspondent on the Daily Mail, and then (in 1952) Naval Correspondent of The Times. He was a foreign correspondent and special writer for the Daily Express from 1956 to 1959, then from 1959 was feature writer, Defence Correspondent, war correspondent and finally Travel Editor on the Evening Standard.

The succeeding Chinese regimes have recycled the music and changed the lyrics. Urban legend states that the music was taken from the Prussian March of the Emperor Wilhelm II; however, no piece by this name can be found in Armeemarschsammlung. The original Qing lyrics were commissioned by Zeng Guofan for the Xiang Army. The same lyrics were used during the Yuan Shikai regime and known as the Soldier's Training Song. After the Xinhai Revolution, the lyrics were changed again and continued to be used by the Chinese military. A well known variant was the National Revolution Army Song. The Communists reworded the song into the Land Revolution Is Successful. A further modification transformed the song into Three Rules and Eight Notices, which is the best known form today. The latest lyrics are an extension of Zeng Guofan's version, and add additional rules to further inspire soldiers' discipline. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the music was used in the presence of representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China.

It travels nearly due west-east entirely within the city limits of Jacksonville, in Duval County. At its west terminus, SR 116 is signed as Merrill Road beginning at the intersection with Interstate 295 (I-295; Jacksonville East Beltway) and SR 113 (Southside Connector) near the St. Johns River. At its eastern terminus, it is signed as Wonderwood Road, ending at the intersection with SR 101 (Mayport Road) just south of Naval Station Mayport. Here, the Wonderwood Road designation continues to Hanna Park. Since the central purpose of SR 116 was to build a bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway connecting Wonderwood Drive to the rest of Jacksonville, locals often unofficially refer to SR 116 as \\"Wonderwood Connector\\" or simply \\"Wonderwood\\".\\"FDOT to fund Wonderwood Expressway\\". Jacksonville Business Journal Officially, the stretch is signed as a number of existing local roads that were utilized as parts of the route of SR 116\\\\. These sections are known as Merrill Road, Ft. Caroline Road, McCormick Road, Mt. Pleasant Road, and Wonderwood Drive. History Due to rapid growth in the East Arlington area and near SR 105 (Zoo Parkway/Heckscher Drive), a connection from the I-295 corridor to Naval Station Mayport was seen as a great need. Over the years, traffic back-ups at the Atlantic Boulevard flyover ramp escalated, as it was the only direct route to the base. These back-ups often took hours to clear, and with the rapid growth in the area, combined with the need for another hurricane evacuation route, a new road was a necessity. The base needed a more-direct route from the corridor since it was easy for new people to the area to get lost on previous directions from exits on I-295, such as SR 10 (Atlantic Boulevard) and Monument Road. The improvements to ‚Äì and subsequent de facto replacement of ‚Äì Merrill Road, Ft. Caroline Road, and McCormick Road occurred in stages.

Band History The formation of Saints Of The Underground happened quite unexpectedly, as the four musicians started out playing cover tunes together for fun during off times from their respective groups. They so enjoyed their chemistry that the band naturally evolved into a creative partnership through which original songs began to emerge. The band was originally called \\"Angel City Outlaws\\" when they posted their first two promo singles: \\"Bruised\\" and \\"Exit\\" along with a third song titled \\"Serial Killer\\" which didn't feature on the band's first album because it was written for an Alice Cooper project. The band's studio album was released in 2008, titled Love the Sin, Hate the Sinner and was recorded in Bobby Blotzer's studio (for bass and drums) and Keri Kelli's studio (for guitars and vocals), produced by Kelli and Blotzer along with Jani Lane and Chuck Wright. The album was mixed by legendary producer/engineer Andy Johns who worked with such bands as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. After the release of the CD, and live performances with Robbie Crane on bass guitar, Jani Lane returned to Warrant as lead vocalist, and toured briefly with the band until departing again in the end of summer 2008. Keri Kelli returned to touring with Alice Cooper while Bobby Blotzer and Robbie Crane are touring with their band, Ratt.

Early life Stubbart was born Audrey Morford in Newman Grove, Nebraska.\\"Audry Stubbart, 100 A Working Woman Always on the Job\\", From a U.S. News & World Report article She was the second of five siblings, but with the death of her eldest sibling shortly after birth, Audrey became the oldest. She spent her early life in Newman Grove, Nebraska, close to an Indian reservation and could recount early experiences of encountering Sioux Indians in the decades following the Battle of Wounded Knee. The Morford family moved to Gordon, when Audrey was young. Soon afterwards, her father died at the age of 36, leaving his wife and four children destitute. Following his death, she and her mother moved along with her siblings to her uncle's house nearby and then, on his death, to the house of their grandparents in Malvern, Iowa. Personal life Audrey was married at the age of 15 to a carpenter, John Stubbart, who was five years older than she. Their marriage lasted 54 years. The couple moved to Wyoming where they had their first child in 1912. They built a log house on the prairie there in 1916, where they lived for the next 28 years. They had two daughters: Enid and Carol; as well as three sons: Veryl, Donald and Kenneth. In June 1964, John suffered a heart attack, and his health apparently failed thereafter. He died at 75 in December 1965. Audrey was highly religious and taught Sunday school for 75 years. A member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, she detested the former practice of polygamy amongst Utah Mormons, which had only officially ended in 1890, and preached against it just as members of her church had done since its foundation in the 1850s. Career as a proofreader In 1944, John and Audrey Stubbart moved to Independence, Missouri, where Audrey found a job as a proofreader with her church's publishing company, Herald House, on the suggestion of her mother-in-law. Audrey recounted that her initial salary was $18 a week. During this time, Audrey's middle son Donald was serving in World War II as a bomber pilot in the Air Corps.Audrey and Her Family, a collection of photographs of Audrey Stubbart and her family members, Special Feature, The Examiner Audrey worked for 18 years with Herald House until her retirement in 1961. In that same year, she was recruited as a proofreader by The Examiner. She would eventually spend more than three decades there. Oldest full-time employee Audrey became a centenarian on June 9, 1995, thereby inviting worldwide attention. Calls and letters came in from people around the world wanting to listen to her story. At the age of 100, she was still working 40 hours per week at The Examiner. Three years later, she was honored by the US Government for being the oldest full-time employee of any business in the country. Shortly afterwards, at age 103, she wrote what was perhaps her last article for The Examiner. She continued, however, to work in her proofreader's position until August 2000 when she was 105 years and 2 months old.Biography of Audrey Stubbart 1895-2000, Newspaper Woman, Missouri Valley Special Collections Age and death At 88 she visited the Holy Land and rode a camel in Egypt. At 94 she toured England and Scotland. In 1992 at 97 she was Missouri's Older Worker of the Year, chosen as a role model who greatly contributed to her community. As she approached her 101st birthday, she had no plans to retire; her daughter Enid and son-in-law Joe celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary a few days before her 101st birthday. She sang in the choir until she was 102. In May 2000 at 104 she fell at her home. A month later she went directly from the hospital to the Examiner celebration for her 105th birthday. She retired in August. Stubbart died on November 13, 2000, three months after her retirement as proofreader. She was well over 105 years old at that time.

The division was formed on 5 April 1939 in Rome. The only difference between line infantry divisions and mountain infantry divisions was that the latter's artillery was carried by pack mules instead of the standard horse-drawn carriages. Italy's real mountain warfare divisions were the six alpine divisions manned by the \\"Alpini\\" mountain troops. History At the beginning of June 1940, the Livorno division was deployed at the border with France, south-west of Vinadio, concentrating at Pas de Saint-Anne and Lausfer pass. Rear echelons stretched back to Bagni di Vinadio. It started operations on 13 June 1940 by shelling across the border. The actual advance started 15 June 1940 with the capture of Collalunga pass at altitude 2608 m. There was intermittent fighting mostly in the form of artillery barrage until 23 June 1940, when fierce fighting erupted. After a day-long assault, the Italian forces were able to break the French defenses and reached Saint-Honorat in La Boll√®ne-V√©subie commune. Afterward, the advance stalled and not much progress was made until the armistice of 25 June 1940. The Livorno division was reformed into an assault-landing division in March 1942, for the planned Invasion of Malta. When the invasion was canceled it was transferred to Sicily in mid-February 1943,http://www.wwii-photos- maps.com/italianarmy/Order%20of%20Battle/slides/Italian%20Army%20OB%20%20068.html and was planned to be shipped to North Africa but that order was canceled. =Sicily= The Livorno Division was the only Italian mobile division in Sicily and was considered by the Germans and most Italians to be far superior to the other divisions, as they had originally been intended for the assault on Malta in June 1942. It consisted of high-quality troops and it had sufficient transport to move all of its infantry units simultaneously. Located in Caltanissetta-San Cataldo-Aragona-Raffadali-Butera area at the start of the invasion on 10 July 1943, they carried out a substantial counterattack 10‚Äì11 July 1943 and threatened to throw the invaders back into the sea, being stopped just a few hundred meters from the beaches. On 10 July Livorno infantry supported by the 155th Bersaglieri Motorcycle Company and a column of tanks poured onto Highways 115 and 117 and nearly retook the city of Gela, but guns from the destroyer Shubrick and the light cruiser Boise destroyed several Fiat 3000 tanks (a L.5/30 variant). Also, Allied forces had attacked a division right flank from Licata in the direction of Ravanusa and Riesi, tying up much of the Italian troops. The Amphibious Battle of Gela was reported by an American newspaper: \\"Supported by no less than forty-five tanks, a considerable force of infantry of the Livorno Division attacked the American troops around Gela. The American division beat them back with severe casualties. This was the heaviest response to the Allied advance.\\" The New York Times, 13 July 1943, page 2 The Livorno regrouped and made a further attempt to retake Gela two days later and the 3rd Battalion, 34 Livorno Regiment, is recorded by its commanding officer as having made a valiant effort in the Gela Beachhead. But on 15 July 1943, the Allied armored units attacked from west to between Valguarnera Caropepe and Raddusa, threatening to encircle Livorno division. Raddusa was lost by the Italians on 18 July 1943 after heavy fighting, and Livorno division took a stand at Simeto river down to the river mouth south of Catania. On 22 July 1943 the Livorno division was subject to heavy coastal bombardment by British ships between Leonforte and Simeto mouth, but managed to hold its position. Failures of other Axis units in Sicily then forced Livorno division to retreat. The retreat route passed through Agira and Regalbuto, where Livorno suffered severe losses. The remnants of Livorno were sent to 2nd echelon at Castroreale to reorganize on 30 July 1943, but because of a complete absence of supplies, the decision was made to evacuate to the mainland Italy. On 1 August 1943, the Livorno division reached Messina. From 1 August 1943 until 14 August 1943 the Livorno was ferried to Calabria, suffering further losses in the process. Only 4200 troops out of an initial strength of 13000 were evacuated. In early September 1943, the Livorno was sent to Piedmont province for reorganization. It surrendered to the German forces on 9 September 1943, while most of the personnel had deserted. Commander *Generale di Divisione Domenico Chirieleison Order of battle *33.

It is now widely used for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment.S. Judd, The MBR book (2006) Principles and applications of membrane bioreactors in water and wastewater treatment, Elsevier, Oxford Overview Simple schematic describing the MBR process When used with domestic wastewater, MBR processes can produce effluent of high quality enough to be discharged to coastal, surface or brackish waterways or to be reclaimed for urban irrigation. Other advantages of MBRs over conventional processes include small footprint, easy retrofit and upgrade of old wastewater treatment plants. It is possible to operate MBR processes at higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations compared to conventional settlement separation systems, thus reducing the reactor volume to achieve the same loading rate. Two MBR configurations exist: internal/submerged, where the membranes are immersed in and integral to the biological reactor; and external/sidestream, where membranes are a separate unit process requiring an intermediate pumping step. Schematic of conventional activated sludge process (top) and external (sidestream) membrane bioreactor (bottom) Recent technical innovation and significant membrane cost reduction have enabled MBRs to become an established process option to treat wastewaters. As a result, the MBR process has now become an attractive option for the treatment and reuse of industrial and municipal wastewaters, as evidenced by their constantly rising numbers and capacity. The current MBR market has been estimated to value around US$216 million in 2006 and to rise to US$363 million by 2010. Based on the estimated global MBR market of US$838.2 million in 2011, the MBR is projected to grow at an average rate of 22.4%, reaching a total market size of US$3.44 billion in 2018. The global membrane bioreactor market is expected to grow in the near future because of various driven factors for instance scarcity of water worldwide, which makes wastewater reclamation necessary. This will be further aggravated by climate change. The growing environmental concerns over industrial wastewater disposal along with the declining fresh water resources across developing economies also accounts for the demand of MBR technology. Population growth, urbanization and industrialization will further complement the business outlook. Contingent on their composition, these changes can be demanding on natural resources and pose unsustainable challenges for environment. Therefore, membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology is regarded as a key element of advanced wastewater treatment and reuse schemes and it is focused to grow towards a sustainable water management across the municipal and industry sectors. However, high initial investments and operational expenditure may hamper the global membrane bioreactor market. In addition, technological restraints including recurrence of fouling in the MBRs is likely to hinder production adoption. Ongoing R&D; progressions toward increasing output and minimizing sludge formation is anticipated to fuel industry growth.Schematic of a submerged MBR Membrane bioreactors can be used to reduce the footprint of an activated sludge sewage treatment system by removing some of the liquid component of the mixed liquor. This leaves a concentrated waste product that is then treated using the activated sludge process. History and basic operating parameters The MBR process was introduced by the late 1960s, as soon as commercial scale ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) membranes were available. The original process was introduced by Dorr-Oliver Inc. and combined the use of an activated sludge bioreactor with a crossflow membrane filtration loop. The flat sheet membranes used in this process were polymeric and featured pore sizes ranging from 0.003 to 0.01 Œºm. Although the idea of replacing the settling tank of the conventional activated sludge process was attractive, it was difficult to justify the use of such a process because of the high cost of membranes, low economic value of the product (tertiary effluent) and the potential rapid loss of performance due to membrane fouling. As a result, the focus was on the attainment of high fluxes, and it was therefore necessary to pump the MLSS at high crossflow velocity at significant energy penalty (of the order 10 kWh/m3 product) to reduce fouling. Because of the poor economics of the first generation MBRs, they only found applications in niche areas with special needs, such as isolated trailer parks or ski resorts. The breakthrough for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto and co-workers idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with a separation device located external to the reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on coarse bubble aeration to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the major parameters in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis. The other key steps in the recent MBR development were the acceptance of modest fluxes (25 percent or less of those in the first generation), and the idea to use two-phase bubbly flow to control fouling. The lower operating cost obtained with the submerged configuration along with the steady decrease in the membrane cost encouraged an exponential increase in MBR plant installations from the mid 90s. Since then, further improvements in the MBR design and operation have been introduced and incorporated into larger plants. While early MBRs were operated at solid retention times (SRT) as high as 100 days with MLSS up to 30 g/L, the recent trend is to apply lower solid retention times (around 10‚Äì20 days), resulting in more manageable MLSS levels (10 to 15 g/L). Thanks to these new operating conditions, the oxygen transfer and the pumping cost in the MBR have tended to decrease and overall maintenance has been simplified. There is now a range of MBR systems commercially available, most of which use submerged membranes although some external modules are available; these external systems also use two-phase flow for fouling control. Typical hydraulic retention times (HRT) range between 3 and 10 hours. In terms of membrane configurations, mainly hollow fiber and flat sheet membranes are applied for MBR applications. UF membrane side stream configuration Despite the more favourable energy usage of submerged membranes, there continued to be a market for the side stream configuration, particularly in smaller flow industrial applications. For ease of maintenance the side stream configuration can be installed on a lower level in a plant building. Membrane replacement can be undertaken without specialised lifting equipment. As a result, research continued with the side stream configuration, during which time it was found that full scale plants could be operated with higher fluxes. This has culminated in recent years with the development of low energy systems which incorporate more sophisticated control of the operating parameters coupled with periodic back washes, which enable sustainable operation at energy usage as low as 0.3 kWh/m3 of product. Configurations = Internal/submerged = The filtration element is installed in either the main bioreactor vessel or in a separate tank. The membranes can be flat sheet or tubular or combination of both, and can incorporate an online backwash system which reduces membrane surface fouling by pumping membrane permeate back through the membrane. The backwash system can be optimized using IPC membranes, as developed by Blue Foot Membranes. In systems where the membranes are in a separate tank to the bioreactor, individual trains of membranes can be isolated to undertake cleaning regimes incorporating membrane soaks, however the biomass must be continuously pumped back to the main reactor to limit MLSS concentration increase. Additional aeration is also required to provide air scour to reduce fouling. Where the membranes are installed in the main reactor, membrane modules are removed from the vessel and transferred to an offline cleaning tank. Usually, the internal/submerged configuration is used for larger scale lower strength applications. In order to optimize the reactor volume and minimize the production of sludge, submerged MBR systems typically operates with MLSS concentrations comprised between 12000 mg/L and 20000 mg/L, hence they offer good flexibility in the selection of the design Sludge retention time. It is mandatory to take into account that an excessive high content of Mixed liquor suspended solids may render the aeration system not so effective and the useful flux of water treated by the membrane would decrease; the classical solution of this optimization problem is to ensure a concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids which approaches to 10.000 mg/L, in order to guarantee a good mass transfer of oxygen with a good permeate flux. This type of solution is widely accepted in larger scale unit, where the internal/submerged configuration is typically used, because of the higher relative cost of the membrane, compared to the additional volume required into the tank. Submerged MBR has been the preferred configuration due to its low energy consumption level, high biodegradation efficiency and low fouling rate compared to side stream membrane bioreactors. This type of configuration is adopted in industrial sector including textile, food & beverages, oil & gas, mining, power generation, pulp & paper in light of its benefits. =External/sidestream= The filtration elements are installed externally to the reactor, often in a plant room. The biomass is either pumped directly through a number of membrane modules in series and back to the bioreactor, or the biomass is pumped to a bank of modules, from which a second pump circulates the biomass through the modules in series. Cleaning and soaking of the membranes can be undertaken in place with use of an installed cleaning tank, pump and pipework. Usually, external/sidestream configuration is used for small scale higher strength applications; the main advantage that the external/sidestream configuration shows is the possibility to design and size the tank and the membrane separately, with practical advantages for the operation and the maintenance of the unit. As in other membrane processes, a shear over the membrane surface is needed to prevent or limit fouling; the external/sidestream configuration provides this shear using a pumping system, while the internal/submerged configuration provides the shear through the aeration in the bioreactor, and since there is an energy requirement to promote the shear, this configuration shows this additional cost. Moreover, the MBR module fouling is more consistent, due to the higher fluxes involved into this configuration. Major considerations =Fouling and fouling control= The MBR filtration performance inevitably decreases with filtration time. This is due to the deposition of soluble and particulate materials onto and into the membrane, attributed to the interactions between activated sludge components and the membrane. This major drawback and process limitation has been under investigation since the early MBRs, and remains one of the most challenging issues facing further MBR development.Membrane Bioreactors . membrane.unsw.edu.au In recent reviews covering membrane applications to bioreactors, it has been shown that, as with other membrane separation processes, membrane fouling is the most serious problem affecting system performance. Fouling leads to a significant increase in hydraulic resistance, manifested as permeate flux decline or transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase when the process is operated under constant-TMP or constant-flux conditions respectively. In systems where flux is maintained by increasing TMP, the energy required to achieve filtration increases. Alternatively frequent membrane cleaning is therefore required, increasing significantly the operating costs as a result of cleaning agents and production downtime. More frequent membrane replacement is also expected. Membrane fouling results from interaction between the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological flocs formed by a large range of living or dead microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. The suspended biomass has no fixed composition and varies both with feed water composition and MBR operating conditions employed. Thus though many investigations of membrane fouling have been published, the diverse range of operating conditions and feedwater matrices employed, the different analytical methods used and the limited information reported in most studies on the suspended biomass composition, has made it difficult to establish any generic behaviour pertaining to membrane fouling in MBRs specifically. Factors influencing fouling (interactions in red) The air-induced cross flow obtained in submerged MBR can efficiently remove or at least reduce the fouling layer on the membrane surface. A recent review reports the latest findings on applications of aeration in submerged membrane configuration and describes the enhancement of performances offered by gas bubbling. As an optimal air flow- rate has been identified behind which further increases in aeration have no effect on fouling removal, the choice of aeration rate is a key parameter in MBR design. Many other anti-fouling strategies can be applied to MBR applications. They comprise, for example: *Intermittent permeation or relaxation, where the filtration is stopped at regular time interval before being resumed. Particles deposited on the membrane surface tend to diffuse back to the reactor; this phenomenon being increased by the continuous aeration applied during this resting period. *Membrane backwashing, where permeate water is pumped back to the membrane, and flow through the pores to the feed channel, dislodging internal and external foulants. *Air backwashing, where pressurized air in the permeate side of the membrane build up and release a significant pressure within a very short period of time. Membrane modules therefore need to be in a pressurised vessel coupled to a vent system. Air usually does not go through the membrane. If it did, the air would dry the membrane and a re-wet step would be necessary, by pressurizing the feed side of the membrane. *Proprietary anti-fouling products, such as Nalco's Membrane Performance Enhancer Technology.Nalco. http://www.nalco.com/ASP/applications/membrane_tech/products/mpe.asp . In addition, different types/intensities of chemical cleaning may also be recommended: *Chemically enhanced backwash (daily); *Maintenance cleaning with higher chemical concentration (weekly); *Intensive chemical cleaning (once or twice a year). Intensive cleaning is also carried out when further filtration cannot be sustained because of an elevated transmembrane pressure (TMP). Each of the four main MBR suppliers (Kubota, Evoqua, Mitsubishi and GE Water) have their own chemical cleaning recipes, which differ mainly in terms of concentration and methods (see Table 1). Under normal conditions, the prevalent cleaning agents remain NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) and citric acid. It is common for MBR suppliers to adapt specific protocols for chemical cleanings (i.e. chemical concentrations and cleaning frequencies) for individual facilities. Intensive chemical cleaning protocols for four MBR suppliers (the exact protocol for chemical cleaning can vary from a plant to another) =Biological performances/kinetics= COD removal and sludge yield Simply due to the high number of microorganism in MBRs, the pollutants uptake rate can be increased. This leads to better degradation in a given time span or to smaller required reactor volumes. In comparison to the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which typically achieves 95 percent, COD removal can be increased to 96 to 99 percent in MBRs (see table,). COD and BOD5 removal are found to increase with MLSS concentration. Above 15 g/L COD removal becomes almost independent of biomass concentration at >96 percent. Arbitrary high MLSS concentrations are not employed, however, as oxygen transfer is impeded due to higher and non-Newtonian fluid viscosity. Kinetics may also differ due to easier substrate access. In ASP, flocs may reach several 100 Œºm in size. This means that the substrate can reach the active sites only by diffusion which causes an additional resistance and limits the overall reaction rate (diffusion controlled). Hydrodynamic stress in MBRs reduces floc size (to 3.5 Œºm in sidestream MBRs) and thereby increases the apparent reaction rate. Like in the conventional ASP, sludge yield is decreased at higher SRT or biomass concentration. Little or no sludge is produced at sludge loading rates of 0.01 kgCOD/(kgMLSS d).T. Stephenson, S. Judd, B. Jefferson, K. Brindle, Membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment, IWA Publishing (2000) Because of the imposed biomass concentration limit, such low loading rates would result in enormous tank sizes or long HRTs in conventional ASP. Nutrient removal Nutrient removal is one of the main concerns in modern wastewater treatment especially in areas that are sensitive to eutrophication. Like in the conventional ASP, currently, the most widely applied technology for N-removal from municipal wastewater is nitrification combined with denitrification. Besides phosphorus precipitation, enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) can be implemented which requires an additional anaerobic process step. Some characteristics of MBR technology render EBPR in combination with post-denitrification an attractive alternative that achieves very low nutrient effluent concentrations. Nutrients removal in MBRs for municipal wastewater treatment Anaerobic MBRs Anaerobic MBRs (sometimes abbreviated AnMBR) were introduced in the 1980s in South Africa and currently see a renaissance in research. However, anaerobic processes are normally used when a low cost treatment is required that enables energy recovery but does not achieve advanced treatment (low carbon removal, no nutrients removal). In contrast, membrane-based technologies enable advanced treatment (disinfection), but at high energy cost. Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after anaerobic treatment (cases of water reuse with nutrients). If maximal energy recovery is desired, a single anaerobic process will be always superior to a combination with a membrane process. Recently, anaerobic MBRs have seen successful full- scale application to the treatment of some types of industrial wastewaters‚Äîtypically high-strength wastes. Example applications include the treatment of alcohol stillage wastewater in Japan and the treatment of salad dressing/barbecue sauce wastewater in the United States. =Mixing and hydrodynamics= Like in any other reactors, the hydrodynamics (or mixing) within an MBR plays an important role in determining the pollutant removal and fouling control within an MBR. It has a substantial effect on the energy usage and size requirements of an MBR, therefore the whole life cost of an MBR is high. The removal of pollutants is greatly influenced by the length of time fluid elements spend in the MBR (i.e. the residence time distribution or RTD). The residence time distribution is a description of the hydrodynamics/mixing in the system and is determined by the design of the MBR (e.g. MBR size, inlet/recycle flowrates, wall/baffle/mixer/aerator positioning, mixing energy input). An example of the effect of mixing is that a continuous stirred-tank reactor will not have as high pollutant conversion per unit volume of reactor as a plug flow reactor. The control of fouling, as previously mentioned, is primarily undertaken using coarse bubble aeration. The distribution of bubbles around the membranes, the shear at the membrane surface for cake removal and the size of the bubble are greatly influenced by the mixing/hydrodynamics of the system. The mixing within the system can also influence the production of possible foulants. For example, vessels not completely mixed (i.e. plug flow reactors) are more susceptible to the effects of shock loads which may cause cell lysis and release of soluble microbial products. Example of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling results (streamlines) for a full-scale MBR (Adapted from the Project AMEDEUS ‚Äì Australian Node Newsletter August 2007MBR- Network . mbr-network.eu). Many factors affect the hydrodynamics of wastewater processes and hence MBRs. These range from physical properties (e.g. mixture rheology and gas/liquid/solid density etc.) to the fluid boundary conditions (e.g. inlet/outlet/recycle flowrates, baffle/mixer position etc.). However, many factors are peculiar to MBRs, these cover the filtration tank design (e.g. membrane type, multiple outlets attributed to membranes, membrane packing density, membrane orientation etc.) and its operation (e.g. membrane relaxation, membrane back flush etc.). The mixing modelling and design techniques applied to MBRs are very similar to those used for conventional activated sludge systems. They include the relatively quick and easy compartmental modelling technique which will only derive the RTD of a process (e.g. the MBR) or the process unit (e.g. membrane filtration vessel) and relies on broad assumptions of the mixing properties of each sub-unit. Computational fluid dynamics modelling (CFD) on the other hand does not rely on broad assumptions of the mixing characteristics and attempts to predict the hydrodynamics from a fundamental level. It is applicable to all scales of fluid flow and can reveal much information about the mixing in a process, ranging from the RTD to the shear profile on a membrane surface. Visualisation of MBR CFD modelling results is shown in the image. Investigations of MBR hydrodynamics have occurred at many different scales, ranging from examination of shear stress at the membrane surface to RTD analysis of the whole MBR. Cui et al. (2003) investigated the movement of Taylor bubbles through tubular membranes. Khosravi, M. (2007)Khosravi, M. and Kraume, M. (2007) Prediction of the circulation velocity in a membrane bioreactor, IWA Harrogate, UK examined the entire membrane filtration vessel using CFD and velocity measurements, while Brannock et al. (2007)Brannock, M.W.D., Kuechle, B., Wang, Y. and Leslie, G. (2007) Evaluation of membrane bioreactor performance via residence time distribution analysis: effects of membrane configuration in full-scale MBRs, IWA Berlin, Germany examined the entire MBR using tracer study experiments and RTD analysis.  Market Framework  = Regional insights = The market of MBR is segmented based on end user, which includes municipal and industrial, and geography, which comprises Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC) and the Americas. In this line in 2016 some studies and report showed that APAC region took the leadership position in terms of market share, owning 41.90% of it. On the other hand, EMEA's market share is approximately 31.34% and eventually the Americas own 26.67% of it. APAC has the largest membrane bioreactors market. Developing economies such as India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines are majorly contributing to the growth. APAC is considered one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. In 2013, over thousands of people died from water-related disasters in the region, accounting for nine-tenth of the water related deaths, globally. In addition to this, the public water supply system is the region is not as developed when compared to other countries as US, Canada, Europe's countries, etc. Membrane bioreactors market in EMEA has witnessed a stable growth. Countries as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Algeria, Turkey and Spain are majorly contributing to that growth rate. The scarcity of clean and fresh water is the key driver for the increasing demand for efficient water treatment technologies. In this regards, the increased awareness about the water treatment and safe drinking water is also driving the growth. Ultimately, the Americas has been witnessing major demand from countries such as the US, Canada, Antigua, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. MBR market has grown on account of stringent regulatory enforcement towards adequate discharge of wastewater. The claim of using this emerging technology comes mainly from pharmaceuticals, food & beverages, automotive and chemicals industries.

They are a large polled white-faced sheep, having a characteristic bob of wool on the head and wool on the legs. The outer lips are of a dark colour and dark spots on the ears are common. The average litter size is 1.45 in pedigree flocks. While a major proportion of ewes within the bred weigh 80‚Äì85 kg and have a litter size of 1.3, there is wide variation to be found. This breed is primarily raised for meat. A Galway Ram at the Tullamore Show 2012 History The Galway breed was developed in the West of Ireland, as a result of the importation of English Longwools from the late 17th century onwards. From the middle of the 18th century Robert Bakewell's Dishley Leicester, also known as the New or Improved Leicester, was exported to Ireland in large numbers, in particular to the estate of Bakewell's associate, Lord Roscommon, later Lord Sheffield. A frequent claim is that the Galway is our only native breed and in 1999 there were less than 1000 true to type Galway sheep in 39 pedigree flocks (a big increase from the 14 breeders in 1990). Practically all the breeders are west of the Shannon. The breed which developed was for many years known as the Roscommon, and a Flock Book of Roscommon Long-Wool Sheep was established in 1895, surviving until at least the 1920s. The Roscommon was a large, white-faced polled breed and, though classified as Longwool, did not have the very long staple characteristic of breeds such as the Lincoln and Leicester Longwool. It bore, as the Galway does, an almost uncanny resemblance to surviving prints and paintings of Bakewell's sheep, being perhaps, closer to the Dishley breed than any of the English breeds which were influenced by Bakewell's stock. In 1923, by which time the Roscommon breed society was ailing, a group of breeders in Galway founded the Galway Sheep Breeders Society at Athenry, County Galway, and inspected over 6,000 ewes and 200 rams, presumably sheep of Roscommon type, admitting 10% of these to the new register. It is probable that the selection was for a slightly neater type of sheep than the old Roscommon. In 1969, a recording scheme, which is barely in existence today and was mainly aimed at improving profligacy, was started with the help of the Department of Agriculture and An Foras Taluntais (now Teagasc). Average litter size for 2 to 4 year old ewes in Irish pedigree flocks in 1999 was 1.62; the best flocks have achieved 2.0 Following representations to the Dept. of Agriculture by the Irish Genetic Resources Conservation Trust, the pedigree Galway is now included in the provisions of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, and breeders in Ireland receive an additional subsidy payment. There are just a few hundred Galway ewes in the UK. A frequent claim is that the Galway is our only native breed but there were many other types before the famine and many people think that mountain sheep should be recognised. In 1999 there were less than 1000 true to type Galway sheep in 39 pedigree flocks (a big increase from the 14 breeders in 1990). Practically all the breeders are west of the Shannon. It has been written that in the 1776-1779 period English breeds were not in great favour by the Irish and some of these sheep were actually killed (for political reasons). At one stage the Roscommon breed was in existence (a large Galway) and later the Galway was mentioned as a strain of the Roscommon. The Roscommon got both very high praise and severe criticism depending on the particular time and the critic. Certainly, the Roscommon would not have suitable for to-days markets. In 1969/70 the Dept. of Agriculture, with the help of the then Agricultural Institute, initiated a new Galway Breeding Scheme. The scheme is now long forgotten about as the ewes are not there to improve.Dr. Frank Crosby, University College Dublin, Ireland Galway sheep were imported to England until the 1900s.

History A 1909 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Berkeley Road The station was one of the first six stations built on the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, originally a broad gauge line overseen by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but later taken over by the Midland Railway and converted to standard gauge. It was two miles east of Berkeley and three north-west of Dursley, and for the first year of its life it was called \\"Dursley and Berkeley Road\\". Dursley acquired a station of its own in 1856 with the opening of the Dursley and Midland Junction Railway branch from Coaley Junction. View southward, towards Bristol View NE, towards Gloucester in 1961 In 1875, a branch line from Berkeley Road station was built to the new docks at Sharpness, passing around three quarters of a mile to the north of the town of Berkeley. The branch opened for goods traffic that year and to passenger services in 1876, with a station at Berkeley. In 1879 with the completion of the Severn Railway Bridge the Sharpness branch became a through- route to Lydney and the Forest of Dean. As with the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway junction at Stonehouse (Bristol Road) railway station further up the Bristol and Gloucester line towards Gloucester, the actual junction for the Sharpness line was to the north of Berkeley Road station, and branch line trains departed from and arrived at a new set of platforms built at a tangent to the existing Brunel-designed station. The junction was controlled by a signalbox at the north end of the branch line up (towards Gloucester) platform. Berkeley Road, like Stonehouse to the north and Mangotsfield to the south, was considered one of the more important stations on the Bristol and Gloucester line and some long-distance trains called there. The Sharpness branch, however, became less important and was reduced to single track in the 1930s. Damage to the Severn railway bridge in 1960 led the branch to cease being a through-route and passenger services were withdrawn in November 1964, though it remains open for some goods traffic. Passenger services were withdrawn entirely from Berkeley Road in January 1965 with the withdrawal of stopping services on the Bristol to Gloucester line. Goods facilities at the station remained open to November 1966, except for a private siding which has since closed. The station was demolished after closure. In November 2019, it was revealed that there were plans to reopen the station to serve two new garden villages nearby.RAIL Issue 892 p.28 Services References Category:Stroud District Category:Former Midland Railway stations Category:Disused railway stations in Gloucestershire Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1844 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1965 Category:Beeching closures in England Category:Berkeley, Gloucestershire ","title":"Berkeley Road railway station"},{"id":"16744158","text":"Hyderabad City Taluka (Sindhi : ÿ≠ŸäÿØÿ±ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ ÿ¥⁄æÿ± ÿ™ÿπŸÑŸÇŸà) is an administrative subdivision (taluka) of Hyderabad District in the Sindh province of Pakistan.

She has been leading the legal fight against terror financing, the boycott and divestment campaigns (BDS), and combating the multitude of lawfare tactics utilized against the Jewish State by its enemies. As the president of the Israel-based civil rights organization, Shurat HaDin‚ÄìIsrael Law Center, she has represented hundreds of terror victims in legal actions against terror organizations and their supporters. Ms. Darshan-Leitner has successfully recovered more than two hundred million dollars in compensation on their behalf. In recent years, Ms. Darshan-Leitner initiated a legal campaign to deprive terrorists of social media resources such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which they use to incite violence against Jews and promote terror attacks. In her efforts to combat anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli activities, Ms. Darshan-Leitner assisted in blocking the Gaza Flotilla, terminated efforts to indict IDF soldiers for war crimes, and filed legal actions against those who boycott Israeli academics and companies in violation of the law. Ms. Darshan-Leitner was chosen as one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world by the Jerusalem Post, and named by the Israeli Forbes magazine as one of the 50 most influential Israeli women. Early life, education and family Darshan- Leitner was born in Petah Tikva, Israel. Her family emigrated to Israel from a small village outside of Shiraz in Iran at around the time of the founding of the State.https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Fighting-Israels-asymmetric- war-601310 After completing undergraduate education, she received a law degree from Bar Ilan University in the 1990s, and holds an MBA from Manchester University. She subsequently received an MBA from Manchester University in the United Kingdom. She is a mother of six children, and is married to Aviel Leitner, an American-born law lecturer from Miami, Florida. She currently lives in North Tel Aviv, Israel. Career In the 1990s, Darshan-Leitner helped litigate a case on behalf of victims of the Achille Lauro hijacking of 1985. During work on this case, she appeared before the Israeli Supreme Court in an attempt to prevent one of the hijackers, Muhammed Abbas, from being allowed to travel to Israel.\\"Nitsana darshan Leitner born\\" at Jewish Press On April 15, 2003, Abbas was captured by American forces in Iraq while attempting to flee from Baghdad to Syria. Italy subsequently requested his extradition. The Pentagon reported on March 9, 2004 that Zaidan had died the previous day, of natural causes, while in U.S. custody. In 2003, Darshan-Leitner founded Shurat HaDin ‚Äì Israel Law Center in Tel Aviv. Shurat HaDin is an Israeli-based civil rights center which focuses on bringing lawsuits and legal actions on behalf of the victims of terrorism. She has said she was influenced by the activities of the Southern Poverty Law Center which had bankrupted several branches of the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups through civil litigation. In founding Shurat HaDin, she noted her goal was to \\"go after terrorists in the same way that they (the SPLC) were going after racists\\". According to a 2007 US embassy cable released by WikiLeaks, Darshan-Leitner explained to a US embassy official that Shurat HaDin received evidence from and had taken direction \\"on which cases to pursue\\" from Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency. Darshan-Leitner is said to have succeeded in receiving more than $1 billion in judgements, freezing over $600 million in terror assets and securing over $120 million in actual disbursements to the victims and their families. She represents hundreds of terror victims in cases brought against Jimmy Carter, the Islamic Republic of Iran, North Korea, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and the PLO, among others. She successfully represented Puerto Rican family victims of the 1972 Lod terrorist attack in a lawsuit against North Korea. In 2010, a US federal court on the island ruled in their favor, ordering the North Korean government to compensate the victims for the sum of $378 million.Calderon CV at Israel Law Center Prominent cases Since 2003, Darshan-Leitner and a team of lawyers have worked with hundreds of terror victims in lawsuits and legal actions against Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Iran, Syria, Islamic Jihad, and numerous financial institutions. Darshan-Leitner has been involved in a wide range of legal actions in Israel, and abroad, on behalf of Jewish rights cases In 2012, Darshan-Leitner (Shurat Hadin) sent warning letters to World Vision Australia and AusAID, after the two aid organizations had been accused of funding the Palestinian Union of Agricultural Workers Committee (UAWC), which Darshan- Leitner said was an instrumentality of the terrorist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). UAWC - World Vision activities were resumed in early March 2012, after an investigation by World Vision found no evidence that humanitarian support for UAWC was in any way leaking to terrorists. Darshan-Leitner rejected the finding and demanded, under Australia's Freedom of Information Act that AUS Aid and World Vision turn over details of the investigation. She noted that USAID, the agency that administers foreign aid for the U.S. government, has labeled UAWC a PFLP affiliate, an allegation based on a 1993 report. Darshan-Leitner also alleged that the President, Vice- President, Treasurer and other key members of the AUWC board are senior PFLP officials. On April 2, 2012, the Shurat HaDin Center was asked by the Australian Government to provide it with evidence of a connection between the AUWC and the PFLP. In September 2006, Darshan-Leitner and New York City attorney Robert Tolchin filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the families of 12 missing Jewish-Iranians against the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Khatami has refused to answer the complaint, and has defaulted the case. In January 2008, she filed a lawsuit for NIS 260,000,000 ($65,000,000 US) against the Egyptian Government in a court in Beersheba on behalf of ten families of Sderot (Israel) whose relatives were killed or seriously injured by Palestinian Kassam rockets. Thirty families who were victims of terrorist attacks, either because they were injured or because they lost a family member in a wave of terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel between 2001 and 2003. The families sued Credit Lyonnais, a French bank, because the bank provided banking services and maintained accounts for CBSP, a primary fund-raiser for Hamas (as designated by the US Treasury Department and by Israel in 1998). CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. The group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers to sub-organizations of Hamas. From 1997 onward, the bank allegedly knowingly transferred large sums to Hamas controlled organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. This activity occurred until 2003, when the bank finally closed the account following over three years of suspicious fund transfers. In March 2008, the court denied defendant's motion, noting in particular that France maintains a particularly strong interest in eradicating terrorism, and the likelihood of criminal or civil challenges against the bank are rather slim. In May 2008, Shurat HaDin was co-counsel in filing in Manhattan Federal Court against Swiss mega bank UBS GA which is accused by the plaintiffs of financing terror. Included amongst the plaintiffs were three families who were physically and emotionally harmed by the Katyusha rockets launched by Hizbollah into Israeli cities during the 2006 war with Lebanon. Attorneys for UBS have denied the allegations and said they would vigorously defend the lawsuit. The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint in August 2009 for lack of proximate cause between UBS' fund transfers and Iranian support of terror organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. The court found that there was no causal link between UBS and the terror organizations supported by Iran. The court stated that a requirement under the Anti- terrorism Act is that UBS not only must have known about the causal link between its funds provided to Iran and Iranian support for terror organizations, but also must have intended that the funds were to be used for that purpose. Such intent was not proven by plaintiffs. In June 2008, the families of 12 missing Iranian Jews filed a petition in the Israeli High Court of Justice seeking to block the Israeli government from releasing information on the fate of four disappeared Iranian diplomats as part of the prisoner release deal with Hizbollah. The Iranian diplomats were captured by Christian militia forces, the Samir Jaja faction, in South Lebanon in 1982. The families are represented in the court proceeding before the High Court by Darshan- Leitner. In July 2008, Darshan-Leiter received word from the Israeli High Court of Justice that the petition was being dismissed, as the issue was one of \\"diplomatic concern\\". The court did, however, point a harsh finger at Israeli PM at the time, Mr. Ehud Olmert, with an expectation that the \\"matter not be pushed asunder\\". Darshan-Leinter then turned to the PM with a request by the families for an urgent meeting before the deal went through. Receiving no response, Darshan-Leiter then turned to all 120 members of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, asking that they remember the 12 Missing Jews of Iran in their speeches and activities throughout their term of service. In July 2008, the Center joined with Montreal-based attorney Jeffrey Boro and Professor Ed Morgan of the University of Toronto's International Law and Counter-Terrorism Project to file a civil action by Canadian victims of Hizbollah. The lawsuit. contends that since 2004, the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB), formerly the Lebanese branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, permitted the Yousser Company for Finance and Investment and the Martyrs Foundation, two Lebanese organizations recognized by the United States as active terrorist groups, to open and maintain accounts at the bank. The suit alleges that LCB allowed the two groups to freely transfer many millions of dollars of Hizbollah funds and to carry out millions of dollars in financial transactions, within and without Lebanon, by means of wire transfers, letters of credit, checks and credit cards provided by LCB. LCB, the suit charged, facilitated Hizbollah's terrorist activities and is liable to the plaintiffs for the harm that has been inflicted upon them and their families in the rockets attacks launched by Hizbollah on civilians in Northern Israel in the year 2006. Darshan-Leitner claimed in filing the suit that LCB knew that both charities are part of Hizbollah's financial arm and that by providing them banking services they were really assisting the Iranian backed terrorists in Lebanon and their rocket attacks against civilians. On July 14, 2008, Darshan- Leiter and Attorney Robert Tolchin of New York filed a civil action on behalf of victims of the Hizbollah against an American Bank. The action was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan Representing 85 victims and their family members, the lawsuit alleges that the American Express (AMEX) Bank, Ltd. and the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB) unlawfully executed millions of dollars in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by AMEX Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006. The plaintiffs rested their claims in part on written findings issued by the New York State Banking Department in 2007, which determined that AMEX Bank had failed to establish adequate procedures to prevent terrorism financing as demanded by state and federal law. This is the first lawsuit brought by terror victims against a U.S. financial institution that serves as a correspondent for a bank in Lebanon. Darshan-Leitner told the Associated Press that \\"the idea of the lawsuit in part is to warn American correspondent banks that they will be held responsible for attacks by Hezbollah if they transfer money to them\\", Darshan-Leitner said. \\"We expect them to follow the law.\\" On August 21, 2008, over 100 victims of terrorist attacks carried out by the Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad (\\"PIJ\\") terror organizations in Israel filed a civil action in Los Angeles Superior Court against China's largest bank, the Bank of China Ltd. (\\"BOC\\"). The suit, Zahavi v. Bank of China, seeks both compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that starting in 2003, BOC executed dozens of wire transfers for the Hamas and PIJ totaling several million dollars. In April 2005, Israeli counter-terrorism officers met with officials from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and China's Central Bank regarding these Hamas and PIJ wire transfers. The Israelis demanded that the Chinese officials take action to prevent BOC from making any further such transfers. Despite the Israeli warnings, the BOC ‚Äì with the Chinese government's approval ‚Äì continued to wire terrorist funds for the Hamas and PIJ. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Federico C. Sayre of Los Angeles, Robert Tolchin of New York City and Darshan-Leitner. In February 2011, Darshan-Leitner and David Schoen filed a $5m lawsuit against former US President Jimmy Carter, alleging that his book, Palestine: Peace not Apartheid, \\"intentionally misleads and misrepresents about actual historic events\\", contrary to New York state law against deceptive business practices. In May 2011, three months after the filing, the suit was dropped by the plaintiffs. Israel Law Center Writ Seeking Seizure from ICANN for Iran's web domains In June 2014, Darshan-Leitner filed a writ in the United States District Court in Washington, D. C., seeking seizure of the web domains belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran to compensate victims of Iranian sponsored terrorism. The awarding of this seizure and the assets to the plaintiffs of a 2003 lawsuit where they won a monetary award, but have been unable to collect. This suit,filed against Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), seeks the seizure based on ICANN's position as a United States registered non-profit organization. The debate on whether ICANN should be under the jurisdiction of the U.S. has been going on for some time, and has not been resolved. In September 2014, Shurat HaDin filed a war crimes complaint against Khaled Mashaal, the top leader of Hamas at the International Criminal Court for executing Palestinians without trial during the Summer 2014 Gaza war. Sokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al - Darshan- Leitner was co-counsel in the civil proceedings against the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which found both organizations liable for the injuries and deaths of American citizens caused by six terror attacks in Israel between 2001 and 2004. Damages totaling $655.5 million were awarded by the jury.Palestinian Groups Are Found Liable at Manhattan Terror Trial However, on 31 August 2016, the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that US federal courts lacked overseas jurisdiction on civil cases. The suit was ultimately sent back to the trial court for dismissal. Public campaigns On May 1, 2008, Darshan-Leitner along with former Soviet Ida Nudel launched a public campaign to save the life of a Palestinian police officer accused of having assisted the Israeli intelligence services in hunting down fugitive terrorists. The policeman, Imad Sa'ad has been sentenced to death by a Palestinian military tribunal in Hebron. Sa'ad, it is alleged, provided the Israel Defense Forces with the whereabouts of four suspected bomb makers whom the Palestinian Authority was unwilling to hand over to the Israelis. Darshan-Leitner has argued that the Temple Mount is being harmed by work carried out by the Jerusalem Wakf and she organized a campaign to encourage the Israeli government to file charges against the Wakf. \\"The Temple Mount\\", one of the holiest sites in the Muslim world and home of the Al-Aqsa mosque, \\"is the property of Jewish nation and has been for thousands of years\\", claimed Darshan-Leitner. Darshan-Leitner took the case to court and lost. The High Court (BAGATZ), dismissed the claim.

Plot Paul Porterfield (Kevin Bishop) is an 18-year-old music student who is offered the chance to be the page turner for the acclaimed pianist Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys). Kennington, and his agent and lover Joseph Mansourian (Allan Corduner), is instantly attracted to Paul's youth and attractiveness, but Kennington's attempts to get to know Paul better are thwarted by Paul's possessive, neurotic mother, Pamela (Juliet Stevenson) who is initially unaware of the attraction. She dotes on her son but is faced with the revelation that her husband is cheating on her and the exasperation of her son, who feels suffocated by her love. Paul is keen to escape his mother and meets Kennington in a hotel; After talking Kennington offers Paul a massage which leads on to other things. After meeting up again in Barcelona, the two begin an affair behind the back of Pamela and Mansourian, who consistently attempts to contact Kennington to no avail after his dog dies.

While consoling herself in the bathroom, she finds a pair of her son's boxer shorts hanging on the shower line. After Kennington returns to New York, and Pamela and Paul head on to Granada, the affair seems over. Six months later Paul, now at Music College and in a relationship with another older man, meets Mansourian again who invites him to page turn at a private event, where he later seduces Paul unaware of his previous connection with Kennington. Again his mother is unaware, but while cleaning Paul's room after he returns for Christmas, she finds a photo of Kennington, with a love note written on the back, in his suitcase. She attempts to confront Paul and later Kennington as the revelations are faced by Paul, Pamela, Kennington and Mansourian.

The division participated in all the major Western Desert battles from then on; Operation Crusader, the January 1942 Axis counteroffensive, the Battle of Gazala in 1942, the Battle of Bir Hakeim, the First Battle of El Alamein and the Second Battle of El Alamein where it was virtually destroyed. During Operation Crusader the Trieste took advantage of the British 4th Armoured Brigade's withdrawal from the Tobruk sector, and achieved a notable success on December 1 when its armoured columns moved forward and cut the tenuous link the 6th New Zealand Brigade had established with Tobruk on November 27. On December 13, the 1st Buffs captured Point 204 on the Alam Hamza Ridge, but the Trieste Division successfully defended Point 208.Far from the short grass: Kildare men in the two World Wars, By James Durney, Page 153, James Durney, 1999 During the Battle of Gazala, the Trieste played an important part in the destruction of the British 2nd and 4th Armoured Brigades south of Knightsbridge on June 12.Rommel's Lieutenants: The Men Who Served The Desert Fox, By Samuel W. Mitcham, Page 118, Praeger (November 30, 2006) During the First Battle of El Alamein, the Trieste on Ruweisat Ridge put up a tenacious defence and lost two regimental commanders before being partly overcome, delaying the Allied advance for several hours and allowing German armoured forces to launch a devastating counterattack. The division fought against the British Eighth Army in Tunisia, first on the Mareth Line, then at Wadi Akarit and eventually on the Enfidaville Line.

Early life  Warg was born in √ñrebro, the youngest of two daughters, to accountant Anders Warg (died 1708) and Karin Livijn (died 1755). In 1710, her mother married the nobleman Eric Rosenstr√•le, with whom she had seven more children and moved with to Borgg√•rd Manor outside Finsp√•ng. Career Warg left home early to be the cook and housekeeper for several powerful people in Stockholm, such as the general Count Wolter Reinhold von Stackelberg. It is not known when she started her career, but von Stackelberg had previously served with her father as an officer in the army, and it is considered likely that she was employed by him as his cook by the time he married and settled down in Stockholm in 1735. She was later employed by von Stackelberg's older brother marshal Baron Berndt Otto von Stackelberg, and from the late 1740s, by the State Secretary and General Post Master Baron Leonard Klinckowstr√∂m, whose wife Catharina Ehrenpreus was the cousin of her mother. von Stackelberg was the brother-in-law of Hedvig Taube, and Warg's abilities as a cook had good opportunity to become known in influential circles. He was described as a great gourmet and also hosted many receptions for Stockholm's cultural elite, who praised the cookery art there ‚Äîone of them was Carl Michael Bellman, who wrote a poem about the food at the receptions, though he did not mention Warg by name. After the death of her last employer Klinckowstr√∂m in 1759, she acquired his apartment, where she lived on her royalties and by renting out rooms.  Cookbook  In 1755, Cajsa Warg inherited 5000 daler from her mother when she died. The same year, she published Hjelpreda I Hush√•llningen F√∂r Unga Fruentimber (\\"Guide to Housekeeping for Young Women\\") which was published in fourteen editions of which the last version was printed in 1822. It was also translated into German, which came out in four editions, and one Estonian edition. The book mostly contains food recipes but also includes instructions on dyeing textiles and other things related to household maintenance. From the third edition (1762), it included an appendix with the title Underr√§ttelse om F√§rgning (\\"instruction on dyeing\\"). The appendix on dyeing was translated into Danish with two editions (1773 and 1794). Warg's work was the leading cookbook for several generations and remained relevant until the late 19th century when new household goods, industrially manufactured kitchen stoves and changes in cuisine made most of its recipes outdated. =Editions= ;Swedish *first edition, 1755 (also published in a facsimile edition in 1970) *second edition, 1759 *third edition, 1762 (expansion with an appendix on dyeing textiles) *fourth edition, 1765 (expansion with an appendix with more recipes) *fifth edition, 1770 *sixth edition, 1773 (from this edition described as \\"√• nyo √∂fwersedd, f√∂rb√§ttrad och til√∂kt\\", \\"again reviewed, improved and expanded\\") *seventh edition, 1780 *eighth edition, 1781 *ninth edition, 1790 *tenth edition, 1795 *eleventh edition, 1800 *twelfth edition, 1809 *thirteenth edition, 1814 *fourteenth edition, 1822 ;German *Schwedisches Koch- und Haushaltungs-Buch, first edition (1772) *second edition (1778) *third edition (1789) *fourth edition (1805) ;Danish (only the appendix on textile dyeing) *Den paa Kundskab og Erfaring grundede nye Farve-Bog, first edition (1773) *second edition (1794) ;Estonian *K√∂ki ja Kokka Ramat, mis Rootsi Kelest Eesti-ma Kele √ºllespandud on (1781)  Legacy  Tradition has attributed the saying man tager vad man haver (\\"you use whatever you have\\") to Warg, though there are no accounts of her having used that expression.

Recent Articles Atlas News History Atlas Maritime draws on the long history of the Lemos family, a prominent Greek ship-owning family which has been involved in shipping since the 18th century. From 1860 to 1914 the family owned 52 vessels. Whilst their first vessels were general cargo, the family expanded their interests over the years into bulk carriers and tankers. Throughout the 20th century, the family continued to charter, sell, and purchase vessels of various types. In the two centuries of its operation, the Patitsas-Lemos family has managed over 100 ships developing a wide network of industry contacts. In 1905 Christos M. Lemos purchased, together with other prominent Oinoussian families, the family's first steamer; the 2,339 gross ton ‚ÄúMarietta Ralli‚Äù. Christos M. Lemos, who also became the first captain of the steamer, continued to build the fleet through the purchases of s/s ‚ÄúTriaina‚Äù and s/s ‚ÄúEfploia‚Äù. His sons, including Captain Leon Lemos, further expanded the shipping business by co-founding the London-based company ‚ÄúLemos & Pateras‚Äù in 1937. In recognition of their contribution in World War II and as compensation for the losses they suffered, the family, in 1947, bought the ‚ÄúHellas‚Äù, one of the hundred newly-available Liberty ships. Captain Leon Lemos became a prominent Greek shipowner in the 1970s and 1980s, building up a fleet of 17 vessels. Captain Leon Lemos was the father of Mrs. Marigo Patitsas-Lemos, and the grandfather of Leon and Philemon Patitsas. Their father Spyros Patitsas entered the family business in 1968.

Neumann-Neander designed and built a series of unusual prototype and racing motorcycles with lightweight pressed- aluminum beam frames from which the motors hung, and unique pivoting forks that used a spring box near the steering head. In 1926 he founded Neander Motorfahrzeug GmbH in D√ºren and went into production, using a pressed-steel frame that was cadmium plated instead of his aluminum prototypes. These novel frames housed a variety of motors, from small 122cc Villiers two-strokes to 350cc and 500cc single-cylinder engines by K√ºchen, to large v-twins by J.A.P. and Motosacoche. The Neander motorcycle had futuristic styling, with a curved, padded leather seat behind an egg-shaped fuel tank, and very clean lines. With excellent handling from the pressed-steel frame, Neanders won quite a few races, and have a very comfortable, stable, and predictable ridehttps://thevintagent.com/2017/07/26/the-vintagent-original-neander/. Neander also designed a sleek, torpedo-shaped sidecar to accompany his motorcycles.'Ernst Neumann-Neander und seine Motorr√§dder', Trapp, 1996, HEEl AG, Schindellegi Schweiz. In 1929 the Opel automobile factory licensed the Neander design, and built the Opel Motoclub in 1929 and 1930 only. Fritz von Opel famously attached a series of rockets to an Opel Motoclub in 1930 as a publicity stunt. There was also a briefly licensed Neander sold under the E-O (Elite-Opel) name in 1931. It‚Äôs estimated around 2000 Neander motorcycles were built, before Neumann-Neander turned his attention to a series of experimental 'Fahrsmachine' small cars with motorcycle engines (1934-39), motorcycles with differential wheel sizes (1937-40), and a few final experiments in 1977-48 with two, three, and four-wheelers.'Neander: Ernst Neumann-Neander und seine Fahrmaschinen', Trapp, 2002, HEEl AG, Schindellegi Schweiz.

It was launched in March 1939 as an open version of Singer's Bantam saloon and using many Bantam parts. After less than six months production was suspended for the duration of World War II then restarted with the engine moved forward, more interior space and other minor modifications. The Roadster was upgraded to the 4A model in 1949 with a four speed manual gearbox. The short lived 4AB and 4AC models were released in 1950 followed by the 4AD SM Roadster in 1951. Singer Roadsters competed with the MG T series. The flowing lines of the car made it one of the most attractive roadsters in the market. The last cars were made in 1955. A few special Singer 4A car bodies were made by coach maker James Young. __TOC__ Singer 9 Roadster 1939-1949 The original Roadster was an occasional four- seat, two-door tourer, mostly based on the Bantam saloon with a cheery character. It had Singer's overhead camshaft, 1074 cc inline-four engine used in the Bantam range but tuned slightly to give at 5000 rpm by fitting a high efficiency \\"hot-spot\\" manifold and downdraught SU carburettor, as well as having slightly higher compression. For 1940 sliding glass panels replaced the celluloid in the sidescreens along with other equipment improvements. A chromed front bumper was now standard as were twin aero screens for use when the windscreen was folded flat to reduce frontal area. A fitted suitcase was supplied to take full advantage of the usable space in the luggage compartment. Performance was handicapped by the use of the Bantam's three speed gearbox and top speed was in the order of .

The Times, Wednesday, 16 August 1939; pg. 8; Issue 48385 The body was built in the traditional method of aluminium panels fixed to a wooden framework. The suspension used leaf springs and was non independent with rigid axles front and rear. The brakes were mechanically operated. The successful Roadster re-appeared following the war, in 1946, with these modifications: non-lubricated rubber shackle bushes, improved seating accommodation provided by moving the engine forward and an improved lid at the rear of the body providing a flat platform for luggage.Singer Car Models.The Times, Friday, 10 August 1945; pg. 7; Issue 50217 These changes seem to have improved the handling.

A Solex carburettor replaced the SU used on the previous car, adding one extra horsepower. The driving position was also improved, with easier entry and egress, and the Nine Roadster's awkward gearchange was ameliorated as the gearbox was moved back. The bumpers on the 4A are slightly larger, stronger, and rounded towards the tips. Singer 9 Roadster series 4AB and 4AC 1950-1953 By October 1950 the further improved 4AB Roadster appeared. While superficially similar, this has an independent front suspension by coil springs and a hybrid, \\"hydro-mechanical\\" brake system by Girling. Externally, there is a shortened bonnet and disc wheels, as well as fixed sides to the bonnet. The fenders were also redesigned, becoming curvier and deeper. The steering box also received alterations, mainly aimed at centering it in the chassis so as to simplify manufacturing alternately right-hand or left-hand driven examples. The 4AB continued in production alongside the larger 4AD until January 1953. The prototype 4AC (built in about a dozen examples) used a slightly larger 1194 cc engine.

The completed Gordon Dam was the only dam built on the Gordon River, despite the support of Tasmanian politicians such as Eric Reece, Robin Gray, and others to build the Franklin Dam further downstream. The construction of Gordon Dam resulted in some flooding of the connected Lake Pedder as planned. Subsequent opposition to restore Lake Pedder failed after a Parliamentary inquiry in 1995. The dam was designed with Dr. Sergio Guidici as the chief engineer. He went on to be involved with the design of the Crotty Dam in the West Coast Range, one of the last significant dams created by Hydro Tasmania during its unabated dam-building era. The dam is connected with the Gordon River Power Station, under the surface of the switch yard. In 2015, the Perth-based YouTube channel How Ridiculous broke the world record for the world's highest basketball shot at Gordon dam, though this record has since been surpassed by How Ridiculous themselves twice over.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9SF2YIKRY8 WORLD RECORD Basketball Shot 126.5m (415 ft) - How Ridiculous = 2015-2016 Tasmanian energy crisis = Due to an extreme drought in 2015 and the untimely failure of the related Basslink power feed, electricity production needs had drained the lake to its minimum operating level in March 2016. The water level fell 45 metres to a record low of six per cent capacity. Pictures document the dramatic effect. After repair of Basslink and record rainfalls, Lake Gordon levels had recovered to -28 metres by January 2017.
