Plot  A group of male boarding school cadets, Aki, Rish and Danny, have been assigned with guarding Dhoultham School on the last day of their term. This initially seems like it'd be a boring, routine assignment that will pay off only with experience, until the cadets find that they'll be joined by some female cadets from another school, Verity, Sophie and Meenah. The teens quickly decide to throw an impromptu party, however their fun is soon spoiled when they realize that Dhoultham has been the site of multiple horrific deaths that date back to the 1600s, when many died from the Black Plague. The group soon finds that the school is very haunted and that the ghosts are out for blood.

Dewhurst, the three-term Lieutenant Governor, faced primary challenge from Tea Party favorite Dan Patrick. During the primary, Patrick triggered a runoff between Dewhurst and him by only capturing 41% of the vote. \\"Frozen\\" consisted of an edited version of Patrick, dressed like Elsa, singing a parody of \\"Let It Go\\". The lyrics to the parody claim that Patrick changed his name to avoid past debits. Dan Patrick's campaign denied the allegations and release its own Frozen themed advertisement called DewFeed. DewFeed consisted of a webpage with GIFs from Frozen with captions extolling Patrick's conservative virtues and attacking Dewhurst.  Background  David Dewhurst in 2009 Between 2003 and 2015, David Dewhurst served as the 42nd Lieutenant Governor of Texas. During his three terms as lieutenant governor, Dewhurst helped pass the controversial 2003 Texas redistricting plan as well as \\"business friendly\\" legislation. In 2012, Dewhurst ran for the United States Senate and lost in a primary runoff to Ted Cruz. In 2014, Dewhurst, who was seen as an establishment Republican, faced a primary challenge against a Tea Party-backed candidate, Dan Patrick. In the 2014 Republican primary, Patrick triggered a runoff election by only gathering 41% of the vote; Dewhurst gathered 28% of the vote. During the weeks leading up to the runoff election, Dewhurst ran a negative campaign that included \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\". Dewhurst failed to win the runoff-primary for a fourth term as lieutenant governor.  Synopsis  \\"Frozen\\" consists of a roughly animated version of Patrick lip-synching to a parody of Let It Go. The lyrics to the parody centered around Dewhurst's challenger Dan Patrick. They claim that Patrick changed his name from Dannie Goeb to Dan Patrick to escape scrutiny of a bankruptcy. The first third of the advertisement depicts Patrick, dressed like Elsa, floating in a winter scene. In the second section, Patrick floats around a static image of the Texas State Capitol. In the third section the music is played on top of stock footage of Patrick.  Reactions  = Dewhurst's Campaign = David Dewhurst personally did not find \\"Frozen\\" entertaining, but released it anyway at the prompting of his younger family members and campaign staff. Dewhurst commented that the advertisement \\"was not intended to be disrespectful\\" to Patrick. One Dewhurst staffer referred to \\"Frozen\\" as \\"just like a lighthearted thing.\\" = Patrick's Campaign = In response to the advertisement, Dan Patrick's campaign released a series of GIFs from Frozen on a site called DewFeed, a play off of BuzzFeed. The Patrick Campaign used this site to highlight a series of arguments about how he was a better candidate for lieutenant governor. One text and image combination tries to point out that Dewhurst was not concerned about security along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border until Patrick brought it up in the Senate. In another, Patrick refers to Dewhurst as a \\"moderate without conservative footing\\". In addition to DewFeed, Patrick's Campaign pointed out that the allegations that he changed his name to avoid past debit was false.

(Janzen et al. 2014) In kinematics, absement (or absition) is a measure of sustained displacement of an object from its initial position, i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. The word absement is a portmanteau of the words absence and displacement. Similarly, absition is a portmanteau of the words absence and position. Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-integral of the displacement (i.e. absement is the area under a displacement vs. time graph), so the displacement is the rate of change (first time-derivative) of the absement. The dimension of absement is length multiplied by time. Its SI unit is meter second (m¬∑s), which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1 meter for 1 second. This is not to be confused with a meter per second (m/s), a unit of velocity, the time-derivative of position. For example, opening the gate of a gate valve (of rectangular cross section) by 1 mm for 10 seconds yields the same absement of 10 mm¬∑s as opening it by 5 mm for 2 seconds. The amount of water having flowed through it is linearly proportional to the absement of the gate, so it is also the same in both cases.Maya Burhanpurkar. Absement: Direct Evidence of the Time-Integral of Distance. Canada-Wide Science Fair 2014. Occurrence in nature Whenever the rate of change ‚Ä≤ of a quantity is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel flow rate is proportional to the position of the throttle lever, then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement. The first published paper on the topic of absement introduced and motivated it as a way to study flow-based musical instruments, such as the hydraulophone, to model empirical observations of some hydraulophones in which obstruction of a water jet for a longer period of time resulted in a buildup in sound level, as water accumulates in a sounding mechanism (reservoir), up to a certain maximum filling point beyond which the sound level reached a maximum, or fell off (along with a slow decay when a water jet was unblocked). Absement has also been used to model artificial muscles,ROBUST CONTROL LAW FOR PNEUMATIC ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES, Jonathon E. Slightam and Mark L.

Applications In addition to modeling fluid flow and for lagrangian modeling of electric circuits (Jeltsema 2012), absement is used in physical fitness and kinesiology to model muscle bandwidth, and as a new form of physical fitness training.\\"Actergy as a Reflex Performance Metric: Integral-Kinematics Applications\\", Janzen etal., in Proceedings of the IEEE GEM 2014, pp. 311-2. \\"Integral Kinematics (Time-Integrals of Distance, Energy, etc.) and Integral Kinesiology\\", by Mann etal, in Proceedings of the IEEE GEM 2014, pp. 270-2. In this context, it gives rise to a new quantity called actergy, which is to energy as energy is to power. Actergy has the same units as action (joule- seconds) but is the time-integral of total energy (time-integral of the Hamiltonian rather than time-integral of the Lagrangian). Fluid flow in a throttle: Relation to PID controllers PID controllers are controllers that work on a signal that is proportional to a physical quantity (e.g. displacement, proportional to position) and its integral(s) and derivative(s), thusly defining PID in the context of Integrals and Derivatives of a position of a control element in the Bratland sense Example of PID controller (Bratland 2014): * P, Position; * I, Absement; * D, Velocity.

Strain absement Strain absement is the time-integral of strain, and is used extensively in mechanical systems and memsprings: : a quantity called absement which allows mem-spring models to display hysteretic response in great abundance. Anglement Absement originally arose in situations involving valves and fluid flow, for which the opening of a valve was by a long \\"T\\"-shaped handle, which actually varied in angle rather than position. The time-integral of angle is called \\"anglement\\" and it is approximately equal or proportional to absement for small angles, i.e. the sine of an angle is approximately equal to the angle for small angles.Integral Kinesiology Feedbackfor Weight and Resistance Training, 2019 15th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), http://wearcam.org/sitis2019.pdf See also acceleration * displacement * jerk * position * velocity References Category:Motion (physics) ","title":"Absement"},{"id":"48938691","text":"Miles Cameron Bascombe (born 12 January 1986) is a Vincentian cricketer who played a single Twenty20 International for the West Indies in 2011.

It is the only set of m√©lodies (French art songs) Satie composed to his own texts.Caroline Potter, \\"Satie as Poet, Playwright and Composer\\". Chapter 4 of \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Caroline Potter (ed.), Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013. In performance it lasts 2‚Äì3 minutes. Description The Trois po√®mes d'amour is Satie's modern reimagining of Medieval French troubadour songs. He completed the set in Paris between November 20 and December 2, 1914. It consists of three tiny 8-bar tunes: Medieval troubadours entertaining a monarch :1. Ne suis que grain de sable (Am Only a Grain of Sand) :2. Suis chauve de naissance (Am bald from Birth) :3. Ta parure est secr√®te (Your Attire is Discreet) The music and texts of the po√®mes d'amour were written in a deliberately archaic style spiced with offbeat contemporary twists. In the manner of his humoristic piano suites of the period, Satie originally adorned the songs with extramusical commentaries, including a preface which alludes to expressions of courtly love \\"in ancient times\\": ::These poems do not discuss the love of Glory, the love of Lucre, the love of Commerce or of ::Geography. No. These poems are poems of the love...of Love; they are simple and devout ::pages wherein are reflected all the tenderness of a virtuous man, very proper in his ways. ::You can listen to them without fear.Potter, \\"Satie as Poet, Playwright and Composer\\". Chapter 4 of \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\". Satie's poems are ironic, dispassionate supplications to a seemingly aloof figure of adoration. This muse is suddenly brought into the present-day world in the concluding Ta parure est secr√®te, in which Satie writes, \\"My lovely cheerful one/Smokes a cigarette.\\"Potter, \\"Satie as Poet, Playwright and Composer\\". Chapter 4 of \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\". Satie constructed his rhymes so at the end of each verse he could spoof the vocalized mute \\"e\\" in sung French to absurd effect. According to musicologist Patrick Gowers, singers who attempted to tone down this joke infuriated him.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 142. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. Musically the songs are all in simple ternary form and identical in rhythm, six 8th-notes and a quarter-note, though with subtle harmonic differences. This closely interwoven tripartite structure harkens back to such early Satie works as the Gymnop√©dies (1888), which have been likened to viewing a sculpture from three different angles. The vocal lines are in the spirit of plainsongRobert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 77-79. and the opening Ne suis que grain de sable is to be sung in the manner of the 11th century Gregorian chant Victimae paschali laudes, which Satie references in the score.Leon Guichard, \\"Erik Satie et la musique Gregorienne,\\" Revue musicale, 15 November 1936, pp. 334-35.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 94. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London.Ornella Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), pp. 71, 184, note 24.This has been disputed in Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 38. The original notebooks for the po√®mes d'amour, unearthed by Robert Orledge, show Satie also wrote additional prefaces for each song and, as a final joke, deliberately numbered the songs incorrectly as 1-3-2.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 175 and p. 354, note 34. Satie's motivation for creating this strangely retrospective piece is one of the more intriguing mysteries of his canon. He had written no art songs since the late 1880s, and had largely abandoned his early medieval influences after the Messe des pauvres of 1895.Satie authority Caroline Potter wrote that Satie's renewed interest in medievalism in the Trois po√®mes d'amour came \\"seemingly out of the blue\\", but in fact he had written a Chanson m√©di√©vale in 1906 and composed the Fugue litanique, on a plainsong-like subject in Dorian mode, for the suite En habit de cheval (1911). See Potter, \\"Satie as Poet, Playwright and Composer\\". Chapter 4 of \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\". His need to express himself in words as well as music was evident early in his career and found numerous outlets in the 1910s,Such as his ironic journalism, notably the M√©moires d'un amn√©sique (1912-1914), his play Le pi√®ge de M√©duse (1913), and the extramusical texts for his humoristic piano music (1912-1915), exemplified by Sports et divertissements (1914). but this was his lone attempt at lyric poetry. And the subject of love was an odd one for Satie, whose known romantic experience was limited to a youthful fling with the painter Suzanne Valadon in the early 1890s. He ultimately dismissed the emotion as \\"very comical.\\"Ornella Volta (editor), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 47. There is speculation that Satie may have had a brief affair with the feminist poet Henriette Sauret in 1914, which in turn inspired the song cycle, but this remains unconfirmed.Potter, \\"Satie as Poet, Playwright and Composer\\". Chapter 4 of \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\". Performance and publication Cover for the original edition of the Trois po√®mes d'amour (1916) Performance of the Trois po√®mes d'amour was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. The composer dedicated the cycle to Henri Fabert (1879-1941), a tenor at the Paris Opera, who with Satie at the piano gave the premiere at the Ecole Lucien de Flagny in Paris on April 2, 1916. As the original score was intended for a mezzo-soprano, Satie transposed the vocal lines for Fabert.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 308-309. He then wrote out a neat manuscript copy for mezzo vocalist Jane Bathori, who kept it in her recital repertory for many years.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 308-309.Bathori performed the Trois po√®mes d'amour with composer-pianist Darius Milhaud in 1937. See Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", Clarendon Press, 1999 p. 246, note 2. Contemporary performances are typically sung by either a mezzo or baritone. When Rouart, Lerolle & Cie published the score later in 1916, Satie chose to remove all the extramusical verbiage - the prefaces, odd numbering, even the witty playing directions - and allow the songs to stand on their own merits. At the proof stage he added some chromatic grace notes to the piano part of Ta parure est secr√®te which seem at odds with the work's faux-medieval simplicity, but reinforce its subtly humorous anachronistic tone.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 308-309. Today the Trois po√®mes d'amour rate among Satie's more obscure compositions, although it has had its champions.

The commission exercised section 20(1) of the Telephone Subscribers regulation (TSR) law on MTN, for not meeting the deadline set up by the Mobile network operators (MNOs) for disconnecting the Subscribers Identification Modules (SIM) with improper registration. The compliance audit carried out by the NCC on MTN network revealed unregistered 5.2 million customers lines un- deactivated. This led to the NCC fining MTN with the sum of $1000 for each unregistered SIM, which amounted to $5.2bn. What followed was major resignations among the top echelon of the organisation including the chief executive officer, Sifiso Dabengwa, the Head of Nigeria Operation, Micheal Ikpoki and the Head of Cooperate Affairs, Akinwale Goodluck being replaced with Phuthuma Nhleko, Ferdi Moolman and Amina Oyegbola as new chairman, managing director and Head of Corporate and Regulation respectively. The new management employed a diplomatic measure between the government of the Republic of South Africa and its Nigerian counterpart to ameliorate the burden of the liabilities from the fine. This action brought about the reduction of the liability to $3.2 billion. The registration of SIM cards started in the year 2010, the initial phase of this project was handled by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, NCC took over these operations because the service providers could not meet up with the six months earmarked by NCC. The registration by NCC started in March 2011 and it was anchored by seven consultants. Activities that led to the penalty  In 2010 the Nigerian government through the National Security Adviser, other securities agencies and the NCC initiated that all SIM-cards across all mobile networks in the country should be registered. The primary objective of this project is to reduce security challenges facing the country by criminals using mobile phones to perpetuate kidnapping, robbery and other criminal activities. This exercise is in line with Section 20(1) of Registration of Telephone Subscribers Regulations (TSR) 2011 which states that: \\"Any licensee who activates or fails to deactivate a subscription medium in violation of any provision of these Regulations is liable to a penalty of N200,000.00 for each unregistered but activated subscription medium.\\" In 2011, following the regulation the NCC directed all MNOs to deactivate newly registered lines that remain inactive for 48 hours after registration. In August 2015, NCC and securities agencies carried out a compliance audit on all of the MNOs networks. Contrary to the TSR, the audit revealed 5.2 million customer lines in MTN were improperly registered. Sahara Reporters claimed that the NCC and security agencies informed the public during a press conference held on 18 August 2015, that the expiration of the 7-day deactivation deadline ends on 11 August 2015. MTN failed to fully deactivate any subscribers and following repeated warnings and compliance enforcement visits by the responsible authorities only made a partial attempt to bar unregistered subscribers in selected areas over a few days in September 2015. Other operators had fully complied and reconciled their deactivations with the invalid registrations shared by the NCC up to 4 weeks earlier. The consequence of MTN's refusal to comply with the directive is even more pronounced as half of all the invalid registrations shared by the NCC belongs to MTN. In a related development, the house of representatives committee on telecommunications, headed by Saheed Akinade Fijabi to investigate the abuse among the MNOs in complying with the registration of SIM cards in the country. In a letter addressed to NCC on 2 November 2015, MTN admitted wrongdoing for their role of 5.2 million improperly registered SIMs after the NCC deadline on the network and also pleaded for mercy. NCC acknowledged the letter from MTN, but said the decision on the penalty is final, but the deadline for payment could be shifted to accommodate the position of each party. Post penalty activities In October 2015, NCC made the pronouncement to penalise MTN for their inability to disconnect 5.2 million unregistered subscribers on its network. According to the TSR signed by all stakeholders in the telecommunications industry, any erring MNO shall be charged with N200,000 or $1000 per unregistered SIM on their network after the deadline for the registration. Subsequently, the commission demanded the sum of $5.2billion being the total amount payable by MTN for their role in improper SIM registration, to be paid on or before 16 November 2015. In a swift move to pacify its shareholders, MTN published a press release on the same day of the pronouncement that the deadline for the payment of the penalty fee of the $5.2bn (16 November 2015) will not be effected by the commission until the end of the negotiation. As part of the strategy to re-stabilize the organisation, Phuthuma Nhleko, was appointed in temporary capacity as the Chairman of the organisation over the next 6 months. This action follows the resignation of Sifiso Dabengwa, the CEO of the organisation. Dabengwa in a letter confessed to Guardian Newspaper that \\"Due to the most unfortunate prevailing circumstances occurring at MTN Nigeria, I, in the interest of the company and its shareholders, have tendered my resignation with immediate effect.\\". The office of the presidency in Nigeria took over the case of improper SIM registration. This instance warranted MTN group to organise a diplomatic meeting between president Jacob Zuma of South African and its Nigerian counterpart Muhammadu Buhari. The outcome of this meeting is the reduction of the fee from $5.2bn to $3.2bn. In a related development, many Nigerians are unhappy and took the case to a court of law for proper interpretation of the position taking by the government. A group of concerned Nigerian based in Abuja, said the action taking by the FGN is a slap on the fundamental human right and breach of our Nigeria constitutions. Timipa Okponipere, the lawyer to the applicant believe the action is not only a breached of Nigeria Constitution but an attempt by NCC to conspire with MTN to cheat Nigerians of our common wealth. He said, if the decision is not pursue to a logical end it would amount to mere academic exercise. Following the report of the slash in the penalty fee, MTN Nigeria head to court challenging the 20% reduction on the ground that the amount will diminish their profit. According to the Mail & Guardian, John Burke, director of issuer regulation at the JSE said: \\"The JSE has halted all trading on MTN Group Limited. Trading will resume as soon as MTN Group Limited has issued a Sens announcement.\\" Subsequently, 14% loss was declared on the market value of the company by Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). In another fresh development, the Nigerian Governors Forum, an association of 36 governors from all the states in the federation. In a statement signed by the chairman declared their support to the NCC for penalising MTN for not disconnecting 5.2 million unregistered subscribers on their database, after the deadline given by the commission. The Chairman of the forum said \\"The forum also commended the NCC for its strict compliance and enforcement of the law with regards to the fine issued to MTN and advised the federal government to ensure prompt and full payment.\\" The deadline for the penalty expires The federal government of Nigeria after deliberations with the management team of MTN, gave 31 December 2015 as the last day for the payment of the penalty fee. According to the spokesperson of NCC, Tony Ojobo, the commission decision on this issue remains unchanged. On 17 December 2015, MTN announced their decision to contest the decision by the FGN enforcing the payment of the penalty on the last day of the year 2015. MTN Nigeria also got an order from the Federal high Court stopping the Federal Government from preventing MTN Nigeria from moving its funds in Nigerian Banks out of the country. It was announced on 22 January 2016 that MTN would have until 18 March of the same year to reach an out of court settlement. MTN engages ex US attorney general MTN has engaged the service of Mr. Eric Holder, a former US attorney general to intervene in the ongoing slam of $5.2bn fine on the telecommunications company, which was subsequently reduces to $3.9 by the Nigerian government through NCC after much persuasion. He was hired by the MTN group because of his experience in corporate settlement. He served as US attorney general between the year 2009‚Äì2015. According to report by Financial Times Holder visited Abuja, the federal capital territory, Nigeria in January 2016 to meet with the official of NCC to challenge the fine. FG sets condition for out-of-court settlement The FGN through the minister of communication, Mr. Adebayo Shittu on 26 January 2016, gave conditions to be met by MTN before FGN can agree to out-of-court settlement of the litigation made against the government by the communication firm. The case remains in court as at this date( February 2016). The minister requested that the case can be settled as per MTN request only if the communication firm withdraw the case from court and also if the president, Muhammadu Buhari approves a new deal for settlement. The minister said \\"As far as we are concerned, there can be no out-of-court settlement except the case is withdrawn from the court so that the government will not be put under pressure. If the case is out of court and if they make further moves, Mr. President may graciously make a decision. But now, I am not aware of any out- of-court settlement talks.\\". In another development, it was reported that the FGN is not ready to shift ground for the out-of-court settlement by MTN. The minister said \\"We are not aware of any out of court settlement on the issue. We will not accept out of court settlement until MTN willingly discontinue the case\\". MTN pays advance $250 million dollars On 24 February 2016, MTN announced the payment of $250 million as an advance-payment towards a reduced settlement, yet to be finalised, of the imposed penalty by the FGN. MTN group, through their spokesperson, said, \\"Pursuant to the ongoing engagement with the Nigerian authorities, MTN Nigeria has today (yesterday), made an agreed payment of N50 billion ($250 million) to the Federal Government of Nigeria on the basis that this will be applied towards a settlement, where one is eventually, and hopefully, arrived at. In an effort to achieve an amicable settlement, MTN has agreed to withdraw the matter from the Federal High Court in Lagos. Phuthuma Nhleko in his capacity as executive chairman of MTN Group and a director of MTN Nigeria is continuing to lead the team engaging the Nigerian authorities with a view to settling the matter.\\" In the same development, the MTN Nigeria Chief Executive Office (CEO), Ferdi Moolman, said the firm has withdrawn the case in the federal high court in the intent to further deliberate on the settlement of the fine Nigeria president speaks on MTN Fine On 8 March 2016, President Mohammadu Buhari (PMB) hosted Jacob Zuma, the president of the South Africa Republic (RSA), on an official visit. During the visit, PMB noted that the negligence of MTN to follow the NCC mandate to de-register unapproved SIMs had aided the activities of terrorists in the country. He said \\"The concern of the Federal Government was basically on the security and not the fine imposed on MTN. ‚ÄúYou know how the unregistered GSM (SIM cards) are being used by terrorists and between 2009 and today, at least 10,000 Nigerians were killed by Boko Haram, at least 10,000\\". MTN withdraws case suits against NCC and Nigeria Chief Wole Olanipekun, the counsel to the telecommunication company, announced on Friday 18 March 2016 the withdrawal of suits instituted against NCC and the FGN contesting the fine slammed on it for its failure to disconnect unregistered SIMs from its network. MTN finalise payment plan with NCC On 10 June 2016, MTN announced through its chief executive officer, Ferdi Moolman, that the sum of N300bn (less than $1 billion) had been accepted as the final settlement of the fine demanded by FG for not disconnecting unregistered lines from its network by the deadline giving by NCC to all MTOs in the country. The reduced fine must be paid within a period of three years. The telecommunication company also promised to list its stock on the Nigeria Stock Exchange. According to Premium Times, Ferdi said that \\"MTN will pay the NCC the sum of N330 billion in full and final settlement of the fine in line with an agreed payment plan,\\". In line with the agreement, the last tranche of the bill will be paid on 31 May 2019. =MTN paid first installment= The minister of communication in Nigeria, Adebayo Shittu, confirmed the payment of $254 million, the first tranche of the three-installments settlement plan. The fine of $5.2 billion was reduced to $1.7 billion. According to africanews, \\"For the first year, they paid N80 billion, after paying the initial N50 billion, and they will have to pay for three years until they will complete the N330 billion\\". = MTN pays additional 30 billion Naira= The telecommunication company recently paid additional 30 billion Naira to offset part of the initial fine of 330 billion Naira fined.

It was built between the 1920s and the 1960s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010.  History  The Carmila cane lift is situated to the west of Carmila south of the township of Sarina in the Broad Sound area. Sugar cane is a major crop in Queensland; the state produces almost all of the nation's sugar. The cane lifts formed part of the process of transporting bundled whole stalks of harvested sugar cane from the farms to the mill. They were rendered obsolete by the universal adoption of \\"chopper\\" harvesters from the 1960s. Sugar cane was first introduced to Australia in 1788 with the arrival of the First Fleet. In 1821, Port Macquarie under the command of Captain Francis Allman became Australia's first cane-growing area. In Queensland, the successful cultivation of sugar cane was established in 1864 at Redland Bay by Captain Louis Hope who erected Queensland's first sugar-crushing mill on the banks of Hilliard's Creek (now Ormiston) about south-east of Brisbane. Cane growing was tried at Bowen in the Whitsunday Region in 1864 but continued there only until 1869, when it became clear that the climate was too dry. In the Pioneer Valley the first grower in the Mackay region was John Spiller. He arrived in Mackay in 1865 as a would-be squatter without capital but with cane brought from Java which he planted on the north bank of the Pioneer River. In June 1867 he produced the first sugar in the region. The incipient cane growing industry was given impetus in 1864 with the enactment of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations, introduced by the government to encourage northern settlement. This enabled lessees to obtain plots of up to at a reasonable cost. Spiller and John Crees selected two blocks that became the Pioneer Plantation and built a primitive mill. T H Fitzgerald began a commercial plantation, Alexandra, in 1866 and with J Ewen Davidson set up a steam-powered mill that produced of sugar in 1868. With these facilities a sugar boom began: small growers brought their cane for crushing to the Alexandra mill and acreage under cane expanded rapidly. Cane growers pushed back the graziers and by 1870 five mills were established. By 1872 Mackay mills produced 40 per cent of the total Queensland sugar production and 37 per cent of its rum. Seventeen mills were established along the Pioneer River before 1875, most in 1872 and 1873. Another 12 including Farleigh, Habana, Homebush, and Marian were established between 1881 and 1885, then North Eton and Racecourse in 1888, Plane Creek began at Sarina in 1896 and in 1906 Cattle Creek Mill at Finch Hatton started operations. Where crops were near the main railway line, cut cane was transported from field to mill via rail wagons. However, in cases where the crops and mills were remote from the railway, many mills established extensive tram networks for transporting harvested cane. The railway and tram networks continue to be used together with road transport. From at least as early as the 1890s, cane lifts at tram or railway sidings were used to transfer bundles of cane onto rail or tram wagons. Cane was initially harvested as whole stalks by hand and, later, by wholestalk mechanical harvesters. The cane was cut close to the ground and then the top foliage was cut off. It was transported to the mill as whole stalks. A frequent practise was to lay temporary tramlines into the field so that tram wagons could be loaded with cut cane close to where the harvesting took place. Where this practise was not followed, the cane was loaded onto a horse-drawn wagon or motorised vehicle. This was done by hand until the introduction of mechanised loaders in the mid-20th century. The wagon or vehicle transported the cane to the nearest siding where the bundles of cane were transferred onto a tram or rail wagon using the cane lifts. Many lifts were on private property, others on railway land at sidings. In many cases sugar mills paid for the construction of the lifts and cane farmers repaid the money at a predetermined cost per ton of cane sent to the mill. The lifts took different forms. F W Bolton, the manager of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the \\"traverser\\" type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead travelling winch which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next to the dray. The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this type of lift was widely adopted but there are no known examples extant in the Mackay area. A similar configuration, possibly a modification of the traverser type, comprised two posts supporting a horizontal beam with a fixed pulley. These were predominantly used with tram wagons. As with the traverser the tram track passed under the horizontal beam. The wagon or truck containing the cane stalks was driven along the tram tracks to a position beneath the horizontal beam. The bundle of cane was hoisted, then the truck was driven out and its position taken by the tram wagon into which the cane was then lowered. A third or \\"derrick\\" type consisted of a load bearing boom fixed by a pivoting coupling to the bottom of a mast. It was held in a diagonal attitude to the mast by a hinged horizontal beam extending from the top of the mast to the end of the boom. The boom swung in an arc and the lifting hook was lowered from the end of the horizontal beam. Derrick type lifts were in use by 1893. They were used mostly to load cane into main line railway wagons. Albert John Wellman Fudge, a carpenter, is credited by some with inventing the derrick type lift. Fudge was a British immigrant who moved to Mackay in the 1890s. It is claimed that Fudge built over one hundred cane lifts for most district mills. His work was said to have been carried on by Harry Penny until the introduction of chopper harvesters. A variety of methods were used to power the hoist. It was common to use a horse hitched to a pole fixed to a rotating drum. This system was later adapted for use with a motor. From World War II, trucks were also used. Power was transferred via a set of rollers positioned in the ground so that they would engage with the wheels of the truck carrying the cane. These lifts were known as \\"Tracey\\" lifts. The Carmila lift is a Tracey lift. It is configured in a similar way to a traverser type, comprising a horizontal beam supported by two posts. A pulley fitted to the horizontal beam is loosely held in place with a metal clamp and lengths of heavy wire. The rollers that form part of the lifting mechanism for this type of lift remain extant in the ground beneath the horizontal beam. The lift is located on the route of the former Plane Creek Mill tramway (no longer extant). The Plane Creek Mill commenced operations in 1896 and the tramway at Carmila was present by the mid 1920s. Therefore, the lift dates to between the 1920s and the 1960s when cane lifts were no longer used. Cane lifts became redundant after the widespread introduction of chopper mechanical harvesters. Mechanical harvesting was attempted with little real success from the late 19th century. The development of mechanical harvesters accelerated from World War II. The first harvesters cut the cane as whole stalks. This meant that the labour-intensive task of bundling whole cane stalks and loading them continued. From the early 1950s, mechanical loaders alleviated this problem to some extent. The introduction of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are ejected from the harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are towed to the rail siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are tipped into bins on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded whole stalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.  Description  The Carmila cane lift is located on the southern side of the Carmila West Road, approximately west-south-west of the township of Carmila. Carmila is located on the Bruce Highway south of Mackay. Standing between high, the lift comprises two upright poles supporting a horizontal cross beam. The beam comprises an unfinished wooden log. The upright poles are covered with a climbing vine. A pulley wheel is loosely fitted to the top of the cross beam with a metal clamp and lengths of heavy duty wire. Steel cable runs through the pulley wheel and a hook is suspended at the end of the cable. Set into the ground beneath the horizontal beam are two sets of roller mechanisms each set comprising two steel rollers and a steel cog. These project slightly from the ground. The lift is located in an open grassy area containing some low scrub and a few trees.  Heritage listing  Carmila Cane Lift was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Carmila cane lift, located near Sarina, is one of a group of lifts in the Mackay/Whitsunday region, one of Queensland's oldest and most productive sugar cane growing areas. Historically, sugar has been one of the State's most important agricultural commodities. The lifts are important in demonstrating the evolution of the industry in that they provide evidence of how harvested cane was transported before the introduction of mechanical chopper harvesters. Sugar cane was originally harvested and transported to mills as whole stalks. The lifts were used to hoist bundles of stalks into tram or train wagons. They became redundant after the universal adoption of chopper harvesters from the 1960s. The Carmila lift is located on the route of the former Plane Creek Mill tramway, established by the mid 1920s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Carmila cane lift is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Tracey lift. Cane lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The Tracey lift took the latter form and was powered by a truck backed under the lift so its back wheels engaged with rollers set into the ground. The lift at Carmila is an intact example of this type and includes the roller mechanism, pulley with cable and a hook.

She is the lead character in both the novels and the television series, where she is portrayed by Eliza Taylor. She first appears in Morgan's first novel, The 100, and later in the pilot episode of the television series, as a prisoner on a space colony charged with treason. Clarke was one of the original hundred delinquents sent down to Earth to test if it was habitable again after a nuclear apocalypse destroyed it almost a century prior. Character =Novels= Clarke Griffin was born and raised in a space colony above Earth to Dr. David and Mary Griffin. She is a medical student who hopes to follow her parents' footsteps as a physician, taught by the Council's chief medical adviser Dr. Lahiri. She is also in a relationship with the colony's Chancellor's son, Wells Jaha. Clarke discovers that her parents are conducting illegal experiments on children under threat of the corrupt Vice Chancellor Rhodes. She confides in Wells, who despite swearing his secrecy, tells his father, hoping to save the Griffins from Rhodes. However, due to the lack of evidence of Rhodes' involvement, the Griffins are arrested, which also ends Clarke's relationship with Wells; Clarke assumes that her parents are executed following their arrest, leading her to hate Wells. Two years later, the Colony decides to send one hundred of its teenage prisoners to investigate whether Earth is habitable. Among the one hundred are Clarke, Wells, Octavia Blake, her older brother Bellamy Blake, and Clarke's friend, Thalia. After arriving on Earth, Clarke and Bellamy become attracted to each other and eventually develop a friendship while co-leading the 100 with Wells. Eventually, someone sets fires to their camp, ultimately they discover that they are not alone on Earth. The 100 captured an Earth-born girl, Sasha Walgrove, and she reveals there are people from the Colony who arrived before the 100. Clarke eventually meets Sasha's father, Max, who is a leader of an underground colony underneath the ruins of Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. Max reveals that he helped Clarke's parents two years ago, and thus are two of the people sent by the Colony to test Earth's environments before Clarke's, giving her hope that they are still alive. She also discovers that Wells and Bellamy are paternal half- brothers after Wells realizes that Bellamy is his father's secret son from a previous relationship. After drop ships from the Colony arrive, Vice Chancellor Rhodes attempts to take control over the community Clarke built with Bellamy and Wells on Earth. With Sasha's help, Clarke, Wells, and Bellamy escape, but Sasha is killed when she tries to help Octavia. As Mount Weather's and Rhodes' forces battle, Clarke, Bellamy, and Wells are captured during the initial exchange, but their allies defeat and capture Rhodes before he can execute the trio. During Sasha's funeral, Clarke reunites with her parents and reconciles with Wells, since her parents are actually alive, but will not resume their past relationship because she is now in love with Bellamy, whom she felt happier to be with than when she was with Wells. Later, Clarke and Bellamy lead a rescue effort to save members of their community who are kidnapped by cultists who call themselves the Protectors. After succeeding in their mission, Bellamy asks Clarke to marry him, which she accepts. =Television= Background Clarke was born in the year of 2131 in October and raised on the Ark to Jake and Abigail Griffin. Before her imprisonment, Clarke's father discovered that the Ark space station was running out of oxygen, and had an estimated 6 months' worth left. He shared this information with Clarke and planned to reveal his findings with the larger community against the Chancellor's orders, only to have Abigail report him. He was later 'floated', a form of execution where one is ejected into space. Clarke, who was under the age of 18 and therefore not subject to capital punishment, was imprisoned for acting as his accomplice. Because of her status of prisoner she was considered to be expendable by the council and was volunteered by her mother to be sent down to Earth to test the air to see if it was livable again with 99 other delinquents, including Wells. Bellamy Blake acting as a guard, snuck onto the drop ship. Storyline In the first season, Clarke and the other 99 delinquents are sent down in an exodus ship which crash lands after Earth's atmosphere cuts all communication and nearly fries the ship. After the ship lands Clarke soon realizes that they landed in the wrong location. They were originally aimed for the Mount Weather complex, a quarantine zone that had food and supplies, only to find out that they were dropped on the wrong mountain. After establishing a camping ground, Clark serves as a leader of her group with Bellamy, in addition as a medic due to having limited medical knowledge she gained from her mother. Clarke begins a relationship with Finn Collins, another delinquent from the ark, only to be heartbroken after she meets Finn's girlfriend Raven. Finn later dies after Clarke stabs him in a mercy killing that prevents him from getting tortured by \\"The Grounders\\". In 2015, it was confirmed that, unlike in the novels, this iteration of Clarke is bisexual, making her the first lead character to be LGBT on The CW and making her the first bisexual lead on network television (in reference to the five major networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, The CW and Fox). In the third season, Clarke returns to take a leading role in the war against A.L.I.E., the AI that caused the nuclear apocalypse that destroyed the world. Clarke ends up losing Lexa (the commander of the grounders/ Clarke's current lover) while many of her family and friends fall under the AI's control. In the season finale, Clarke uses a transfusion of Nightblood from Ontari of the Grounders in order to take possession of a device known as the Flame, in reality the A.L.I.E. 2.0 AI, in order to face A.L.I.E. in the City of Light. With the help of the spirits of Lexa and A.L.I.E.'s creator Becca, manifesting through the Flame, Clarke confronts and destroys A.L.I.E. using her kill switch. However, A.L.I.E. reveals that her actions have been meant to save humanity from a second nuclear apocalypse caused by the nuclear power plants around the world beginning to melt down. Clarke nevertheless destroys the AI, but believes her warnings about the threat. In the fourth season, Clarke attempts to save as many people as she can from the coming death wave as predicted by A.L.I.E. and confirmed by Raven Reyes. As part of this, Clarke allows herself to be the recipient of a bone marrow transplant as a test subject to see if Nightblood can be recreated. However, her mother stops the testing, fearing for Clarke's life and she is left unsure if she can survive the coming radiation or not. With 1,200 survivors in a massive fallout bunker, Clarke and several of her friends attempt to escape to the remains of the Ark in space as an alternate means of survival. Clarke remains behind to power up the Ark remotely, missing her chance to escape as the death wave arrives. Six years later, Clarke's Nightblood is revealed to have saved her from the death wave and she has adopted a young Nightblood named Madi, the only other survivor Clarke could find on the entire planet. As Clarke continues to attempt to communicate with her friends without success from Shallow Valley, the only inhabitable part of Earth left, a prison transport ship arrives. In the fifth season, Clarke has to juggle dealing with the Eligius IV prisoners, raising Madi, the return of her friends who have changed and the war between Wonkru and the prisoners. With Madi becoming the new Commander after taking the Flame, Clarke kills McCreary, the leader of the prisoners, but not before he launches the Damocles bomb at Shallow Valley as an act of scorched earth. Everyone manages to escape to Eligius IV in orbit where it is determined that it will take at least ten years before the Earth is habitable again. Along with everyone else, Clarke enters cryo sleep, only to emerge with Bellamy 125 years later, greeted by Jordan, the son of Monty and Harper. From Monty's video logs, Clarke and Bellamy learn of their friend's life on the ship and how Earth ultimately remained completely uninhabitable leading Monty to direct the ship to a new habitable world. Looking out over their new home world, Clarke expresses hope that they will get it right this time. In the sixth season, Clarke tries to negotiate for a home for her people with the people of the habitable moon Sanctum. However, the leaders of the society, the Primes, are the original mission team who keep reincarnating themselves by implanting drives holding their consciousness into new Nightblood hosts, similar to the Flame. Desperate to get their daughter Josephine back, the rulers of Sanctum implant Clarke with her Mind Drive, allowing Josephine to possess Clarke's body while the process is stated to wipe the host's mind, effectively killing Clarke. Its later revealed that Clarke survived the process and is trapped within her own mind. Clarke discovers that she still possesses part of A.L.I.E. within her which protected Clarke's mind. With the help of a manifestation of Monty, she attempts to regain control of her body. Though she fails, she manages to take control of one finger and use it to discreetly send Bellamy, who had since learned what happened to her, a message using Morse code that she is still alive. Bellamy quickly grasps the significance of Clarke's message and informs Nathan Miller, planning to get her back. At the same time, Josephine informs her parents and claims to know how to get rid of Clarke's consciousness for good. With Russell wanting to restore Clarke instead, Josephine plots behind his back but is abducted by Clarke's friends in an effort to save her with just over a day left before the strain kills Clarke. The situation causes Clarke and Josephine's minds to begin merging somewhat, granting each access to some of the other's knowledge. After the Children of Gabriel attempt to execute her, Josephine relinquishes control to Clarke to save their lives who begins seeing a manifestation of Josephine communicating with her in the waking world. Clarke then sets out to find Gabriel Santiago to get rid of Josephine for good. The two bond while working together to survive and Clarke expresses hope that Gabriel can save them both. Though Gabriel removes the Mind Drive, Josephine is able to hang on to Clarke's body using A.L.I.E.'s neural mesh as Clarke's mind had. With no other choice, Clarke destroys Josephine for good and is reunited with her friends at long last. Posing as Josephine, Clarke helps to overthrow the Primes, but loses her mother in the process. In the seventh season, Clarke's dreams of a peaceful new life on Sanctum are disrupted by the mounting tensions between the various factions, the resurrection of the Dark Commander in Russell's body and the disappearance of several of her friends due to a new faction called the Disciples who target Clarke specifically as they believe that she has the Key that they need to start the Last War. After Raven discovers that the mysterious Anomaly is in fact a wormhole linking six different planets together, Clarke leads a group to search for and rescue their missing friends. Eventually tracking the Disciples to Bardo, Clarke discovers that their leader is Bill Cadogan, the founder of the Second Dawn doomsday cult that built the bunker on Earth that Wonkru survived in and that worse, Bellamy is apparently dead. The Key is revealed to be the Flame which the Disciples think that Clarke has due to seeing Octavia's memories of A.L.I.E.'s destruction. Clarke leverages this belief against the Disciples, but the situation escalates when Echo tries to commit genocide and Bellamy returns alive and betrays his friends due to a newfound belief in the Disciple cause, revealing the Flame's destruction. After Bellamy discovers that Madi has the memories of the Commanders, Clarke reluctantly kills her best friend in an attempt to protect her daughter and strands her friends on a regenerated Earth in an attempt to protect the remaining people that she loves. An attack by Sheidheda causes Madi to turn herself over to Cadogan and by the time Clarke finds her again, Cadogan has gotten what he needs from Madi's mind but caused her to suffer a massive and irreversible stroke in the process, completely paralyzing Madi. In the series finale, a grief-stricken and vengeful Clarke murders Cadogan as he starts a test to determine if humanity is worthy of Transcendence or not. The Judge tests Clarke in Cadogan's place and determines that humanity should be annihilated. As Clarke rushes to Madi's side, Raven appeals the decision and convinces the Judge to change her mind. The human race Transcends and Clarke convinces Madi to join them as it is Madi's only chance of survival. Clarke is left as the sole human to not Transcend and returns to Earth after collecting Russell's dog Picasso from Sanctum. The Judge, taking on the form of Lexa, explains to Clarke that her murder of Cadogan during the test means that Clarke can never Transcend. However, Clarke's surviving friends and Octavia's new boyfriend Levitt have chosen to return to human form and live out their lives together on Earth. Madi chooses not to return as she knows that Clarke would not want Madi to return to a world where she'd have no one her own age to love, but the Judge assures Clarke that her daughter is happy and will never feel pain or die in her current state.

Econodynamics is based on the achievements of classical political economy and neo-classical economics and has been using the methods of phenomenological science to investigate evolution of economic system. Econodynamics has been proposing methods of analysis and forecasting of economic processes. The comprehensive review of the problems of econodynamics is given recently by Vladimir Pokrovskii. The Fundamentals =Concept of value= Economic events are considered as processes of creation, motion and distribution of value that is understood as exchange value without any factor interpretation. The factor theory of the exchange value is based on the Smith-Marx‚Äôs labour theory of value. according to which efforts of workers L are the most essential production factor. It was impossible to explain the modern economic growth without introduction the second value-creating factor, closely connected with production equipment. The neoclassical economics has delabourated the ideas about productive force of capital and is using the value of production equipment K as a characteristic variable.Cobb, G.W. and Douglas, P.N. (1928). \\"A Theory of Production.\\" American Economic Review, Suppl. (March), pp. 139-165.Solow, R. (1957). \\"Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function.\\" Review of Economic Studies, vol. 39 (Aug.), pp. 312-330. In addition to it, econodynamics has been taking into account the functional role of production equipment, as a set of appliances that allow to substitute efforts of workers with work of outer sources of power. A new concept of substitutive work P was introduced, to characterize the functional role of machinery in production processes. The law of substitution, which is one of the main principles of econodynamics, generalized the Smith-Marx‚Äôs labour theory of value.Beaudreau, B.C. & Pokrovski, V.N. (2010) On the energy content of a money unit. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 389 (13), 2597‚Äì2606. and provide a new interpretation of neo-classical economics. The variable P is true work of production equipment and is equivalent to workers‚Äô efforts in entire relationship, so that the production of value Y can be considered as a function of the two production factors The extension of the labour theory of value with the law of substitution allows us to formulate the theory,Pokrovski, V.N. (2003). \\"Energy in the theory of production.\\" Energy 28, 769-788. which, in fact, is a modification and re-interpretation of neo- classical theory of production with two production factors: labour L and capital K. The comparison of the theory with neo-classical theory growth accounting that introduce the technical progress as the exogenous factor A(t) gives the expression The exogenous neo-classical technical progress A(t) appears to be connected with the ratio of substitutive work to stock of capital P/K, which can be considered as a measure of technological progress itself, independent on the assumption made in the neo-classical theory. Sometimes it is convenient to use the non-dimensional ratio of substitutive work to labour efforts P/L as a characteristic of technological progress; this quantity can be interpreted as the number of 'mechanical workers', operating in the production processes, in line with an 'alive worker'. To the end of the last century, this ratio reaches, for example, 12 for the USA. Technical progress, as an internal property of the theory, is understood as a progress in substitution of labour with work of production equipment in technological processes. The introduction of the substitutive work P could be useful, if one can measure the quantity. Although one can easily find estimates of the total amount of primary energy carriers, the biggest interest for our aims is caused by possible assessments of the quantity of energy going to the substitution of workers' efforts in processes of the production. This is a problem, which has been considered specially.Pokrovski, V.N. (2007) Productive energy in the US economy, Energy 32 (5) 816-822. The direct methods of estimation of the substitutive work can be used for both past and future situations. For example, the total amount of substitutive work in the U.S. economy in 1999 can be estimated as 10^{18} J per year. It is approximately one hundred times less than total (primary) consumption of energy, which was about 97\\\\cdot10^{18} J in 1999. However, the amount of primary energy (energy carriers), which is needed to provide this amount of substitutive work, is about 25\\\\cdot 10^{18} J. It is about 26% of total primary consumption of energy. =Value, Utility and Entropy= Econodynamics establishes relationship between the concrete wealth and abstract concepts of value, utility and entropy. The artificial products created by humans: buildings, machines, vehicles, sanitation, clothes, home appliances and so on, can be sorted and counted, so that one consider the amounts of quantities in natural units of measurement Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n and the prices of all products p_1, p_2,..., p_n to be given, so that one can define increase in value of a stock of products as Due to dependence of prices on the amounts of products p_i = p_i (Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_n) , one can hardly expect that form (4) is a total differential of any function. In other words, one cannot say that W is a characteristic of the set of the products which is independent of the history of their creation. However, a function of a state, which is called utility function, can be introduced on the basis of relation (4). Indeed, the linear form (4) can be multiplied by a certain function, which is called integration factor \\\\phi = \\\\phi ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n), so that, instead of form (4), one has a total differential of a new function The introduced function U is called utility function (objective), taking into account that the properties of function U coincide with those of the conventional utility function, which is introduced as {subjective} utility function connected with sensation of preference of one aggregate of products as against another. The above transformation of value to utility reminds us transformation of heat to entropy in thermodynamics. In other terms, analogy between theory of utility and theory of heat was discussed by von Neumann and Morgenstern (see item 3.2.1 of their work). The artificial products can be considered, as it was explained by Prigogine with collaborators, as the far-from-equilibrium objects (the dissipative structures), and to create and maintain them, the fluxes of matter and energy are necessary to run through the system. In our case, energy comes in the form of human efforts L and work of external sources P that can be used by means of the appropriate equipment. The creation of dissipative structures leads to decrease in entropy, and utility U can be considered as a close relation to entropy S, though does not coincides with it. Considering that changes of internal energy in production of things can be neglected, one can write a thermodynamic relation Reconciliation of the two points of view on the phenomenon of production leads to a unified picture that enables us to relate some aspects of our observations of economic phenomena to physical principles. A flux of information and work eventually determines new organisation of matter, which acquires forms of different commodities (complexity), whereby the production process is considered as a process of materialisation of information. The cost of materialisation of information is work of production system. To maintain complexity in a thermodynamic system, fluxes of matter and energy must flow through the system. Dynamics of development =Equations of evolution= To formulate the system of evolution equations of the production system, function (1) ought to be specified and dynamic equations for production factors L, P and K to be formulated, while nessasery technological characteristics of production equipment to be introduced. In result, it came to the set of equations of economic growth  the theory of evolution, dubbed as the technological theory of social production. The theory is formulated both in one-sector, and, using the Wassily Leontief's input- output model, in multi-sector approximations. The data for the U.S. economy in the last century was used to justify the specification of the theory. It was demonstrated that the substitution of worker's efforts with work of the production equipment appears to be more adequate idea than the substitution of worker's efforts with the amount of production equipment (capital in the neo- classical theory of economic growth); work can be replaced onky with work, not with capital. The theory demonstrates that the growth of production is caused by achievements in technological consumption of labour and energy. The set of equations determines three modes of economic development, depending on deficit of one of the factors: investment, labour or substitutive work.Pokrovskii, V.N. (2011) Pulsation of the growth rate of output and technology. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Vol. 390 (23-24), 4347-4354. The changing of modes during the development reveals as short cycles in growth‚Äîthe busyness cycles. =Applications= The theory can be applied to any national economy; principles of consistent analysis and forecast are considered. As an example, dynamics of Russian economy for years 1960 - 2060 is considered in one-sector and three-sector approximations(see. Chapter 8 and 9). The elementary, three-branch model is used (see. Section 2.2.2, Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 and Section 9.5 in Chapter 9) for the description of dynamics of production (the expanded reproduction, in Marx's terms). The theory allows, being based on the Angus Maddison\\"s estimates of the Gross World Product and World population, to restore the picture of development of mankind in the previous centuries. It was shown (see , Chapter 12). that one need the theory, based on the effect of substitution of worker's efforts with work of external power (two-factor theory), for the description of the evolution of production activity from approximately year 1000 of our era. Before this time the substitution of human‚Äôs efforts for outer work practically was not noticeable, and one can use one-factor theory that is taking into account only one production factor  efforts of workers. The theory is stated (see. section 1.3.1, the formula 1.1 in chapter 1 and section 12.3 in chapter 12). =The principle of evolution= One can see on raw of examples that the production system, indeed, tries to swallow all available resources. This sentence can be considered as the principle of development of the production system and the human population itself, that has been developing as a self-organising system, trying to catch as much energy as possible. The human population, as any biological population obeys energy principle of evolution, which states that those populations and their associations (ecosystems) which can use the greater amount of energy from their environment have an advantage for survival.Lotka, A.J. Elements of Physical Biology, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1925.Odum, H.T. Environmental Accounting. Energy and Environmental Decision Making, John Wiley \\\\& Sons, New York {\\\\it etc}, 1996. A lot of energy is used by a human population through improvements of technology, and the managing huge amount of energy allows the human population to survive in every climate zone of the Earth and expand itself in great measure. The enlargement of the human population from a very small group a million years ago till about 7 billion in year 2012 ought to be apparently connected with enhancement of the living conditions. Apparently, it is impossible to explain growth of number of human population, not referring on social production system‚Äîthe means of adopting the human to conditions of existence.V.N. Pokrovski, Physical Principles in the Theory of Economic Growth, Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 1999. A revised and extended version of the monograph is published by Springer (2011) as Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production. The absolute measure of value Production of value (for year, for example) Y is a money estimate of 'useful' changes in our environment (in the form of useful consumer goods and services), which can be connected with production factors. In the Smith-Marx's theory of value, it is postulated that estimate of the efforts of workers L is an ultimate source of all created wealth (products), an absolute measure of value. When one accounts the effect of substitution of workers' efforts with the true work of the production equipment, one could expect, that the total amount of work on the production of value, which is the sum of properly accounted work of humans L and work of production equipment (substitutive work) P, both measured in power units, could be an absolute measure of value, and one can write This relation allows one to estimate the work needed for creation of wealth worth of one monetary units (energy content of monetary unit), which was done for different cases. For example, the mean value of 'energy content' of dollar of year 1996 in years 1960 - 2000 is 1.4\\\\times 10^5 J. The values of the 'energy content' of monetary units that are used for accounting change during the time, which shows that the used units of money do not present constant amounts of 'true' value. The absolute measure of value can be introduced as some amount of energy.

Just as the Laplace distribution consists of two exponential distributions of equal scale back-to-back about x = m, the asymmetric Laplace consists of two exponential distributions of unequal scale back to back about x = m, adjusted to assure continuity and normalization. The difference of two variates exponentially distributed with different means and rate parameters will be distributed according to the ALD. When the two rate parameters are equal, the difference will be distributed according to the Laplace distribution. Characterization =Probability density function= A random variable has an asymmetric Laplace(m, Œª, Œ∫) distribution if its probability density function is :f(x;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\kappa+1/\\\\kappa}\\\\right)\\\\, e^{-(x-m)\\\\lambda\\\\, s \\\\kappa^s} where s=sgn(x-m), or alternatively: : f(x;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\kappa+1/\\\\kappa} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\exp \\\\left( (\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa)(x-m) \\\\right) & \\\\text{if }x < m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\exp ( -\\\\lambda\\\\kappa(x-m) ) & \\\\text{if }x \\\\geq m \\\\end{cases} Here, m is a location parameter, Œª > 0 is a scale parameter, and Œ∫ is an asymmetry parameter. When Œ∫ = 1, (x-m)s Œ∫s simplifies to x-m and the distribution simplifies to the Laplace distribution. =Cumulative distribution function= The cumulative distribution function is given by: : F(x;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{\\\\kappa^2}{1+\\\\kappa^2}\\\\exp ((\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa)(x-m)) & \\\\text{if }x \\\\leq m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] 1-\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\kappa^2} \\\\exp (-\\\\lambda\\\\kappa(x-m)) & \\\\text{if }x > m \\\\end{cases} =Characteristic function= The ALD characteristic function is given by: :\\\\varphi(t;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa)=\\\\frac{ e^{i m t}}{(1+\\\\frac{i t \\\\kappa}{\\\\lambda}) (1-\\\\frac{i t}{\\\\kappa\\\\lambda})} For m = 0, the ALD is a member of the family of geometric stable distributions with Œ± = 2\\\\.

If X1 is drawn from exponential distribution with mean and rate (m1,Œª/Œ∫) and X2 is drawn from an exponential distribution with mean and rate (m2,ŒªŒ∫) then X1 - X2 is distributed according to the asymmetric Laplace distribution with parameters (m1-m2, Œª, Œ∫) Entropy The differential entropy of the ALD is : H=-\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f_{AL}(x)\\\\log(f_{AL}(x)) dx = 1-\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\kappa+1/\\\\kappa}\\\\right) The ALD has the maximum entropy of all distributions with a fixed value (1/Œª) of (x-m)\\\\,s\\\\kappa^s where s=\\\\sgn(x-m).

Ashish also edited the English edition of the world's largest circulated Hindi cricket magazine, Cricket Samrat, in 1999, and acted as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Naradonline, one of India's earliest news portals, in 2000, before the dot.com bubble went bust. Personal life Shukla was born in Lucknow, the capital of India's northern state Uttar Pradesh, on 16 March 1963, the youngest of two brothers and a sister who made up the family of a policeman serving in the state police department. He went to La Martiniere, St. Francis and Colvin Taluqdars‚Äô College before graduating in Lucknow University, where he achieved his masters in Western History. Shukla moved to Delhi in 1989, where he married a school teacher, Radhika, in 1993. He presently lives in Noida, part of the National Capital Region, and a suburb of Delhi, with his wife and two daughters. Career At the age of 16 Shukla accepted an internship at the sports desk of The Pioneer, an English newspaper then operating from Lucknow. He became the sports editor in 1980 while still in his teens. Shukla joined the Times of India on the sports desk, in 1989, where he began covering national and international cricket tours and tournaments. Shukla undertook an assignment for Agence France-Presse (AFP) to cover the 1996 Cricket World Cup cricket in the Indian sub-continent and followed it up with India's epochal tour to England the same year which gave India two of its most illustrious batsmen and captains, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. Shukla was still employed with the Times of India at this time, a position he found increasingly untenable. He left Times of India in 1996 and then began his long informal association with the Press Trust of India (PTI). His informal association with PTI quickly took roots and he regularly began covering Indian cricket team's tours worldwide. Such an arrangement also allowed Shukla to be footloose, letting him write articles for Rediff, ESPNcricinfo and voicing his opinion as a cricket expert on BBC and ABC among others. The large reach of PTI gave him a presence in prominent newspapers such as Indian Express, The Economic Timeshttp://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-09-24/news/42801184_1_greg- chappell-senior-players-selectors Daily News and Analysis, The Tribune and national magazines such as Outlook and Tehelka. In the new millennium, Shukla floated two private limited companies, Trans Cricket News Pvt Ltd, which syndicated articles worldwide under the banner of Cricket News, and Outliers Sports and Media Private Limited. Among clients for Cricket News were Gulf Newshttp://m.gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/indian-cricketers-anguished-by- attacks-1.145438 and Khaleej Times, both published from Dubai, UAE. This was also the spell when Shukla covered cricket tours for national news TV channels, such as Aaj Tak, Zee News and Star News, now known as ABP News, among others. He then formally joined India TV as an executive editor in 2007 before finally quitting in 2009 and resuming his association with PTI. In 2013, he ended his work in cricket journalism. He changed his focus to geopolitics, which has interested him since childhood and which he now deemed to be in a critical phase of its trajectory, to the growing drumbeats of World War III. Books During his career as a scribe, Shukla co-authored a biography of the prominent cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. The biography, Sachin Tendulkar: Masterful,https://www.amazon.com/dp/8171678068 was published by Rupa & Co. and went into a reprint order, such was its demand when it first appeared in 2002, even though a few critics didn't have good things to say about the book. Now as a full-time geopolitical analyst and commentator on international relations, Shukla has made an immediate impact with his book: How United States Shot Humanity: Muslims Ruined; Europe Next,https://www.amazon.com/dp/8193163109 which reflects the contemporary reality of existential crisis in Europe and Asia and traces its origins to the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s; and the United States‚Äô support for Saudi Arabia which lost little time in exporting its Wahhabism, leading to the creation of the first Muslim state in Europe, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The book makes an assertion that this began the export of terrorism on a worldwide scale, caused 9/11 and several attacks on major European cities such as the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the London tube bombings of 2005. Most of the alleged terrorists involved in these heinous crimes had one or other links with the Balkans, and in particular, Bosnia. The book has been well received by international geopolitical luminaries and intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky, Diana Johnstone, Shen Dingli, Joachim Hagopian and Zlatko Pranjic, winner of Penguin's Decibel prize, who praised the book for its \\"uncomprising tone.\\" Dingli opined that such \\"voices are much needed these days\\". Hagopian termed it as an \\"important contribution to addressing the truth about the destructive power of the US Empire, perhaps the most important history lesson of modern times.\\" Shukla is presently writing a book on Russia and its president Vladimir Putin which, among other issues, looks at conflicts in the Caucasus in a fresh light. The book is scheduled for release in 2016. The Caucasus, like the Balkans, is a region that lies at the border of Asia and Europe and thus carries forward the narrative of civilizational conflict of East and West and the global spread of terrorism which Shukla has researched in his work: \\"How United States Shot Humanity‚Ä¶\\" Website Shukla presently runs a geopolitical website, Newsbred, a non-profit enterprise, one of its own kind, especially in the Indian context. It has drawn in some important international voices in this field, such as Sara Floundes, Shen Dingli and Joachim Hagopian, and has content arrangement with TomDispatch and Russia-Insider. It has had a dramatic increase in its readership lately. Shukla also has a personal website where his columns, tweets and television appearances are housed. Columns Shukla is a regular contributor on geopolitical and terrorism issues on OpEdNews, which has columns from the world's best-known columnists and authors. He also occasionally pens edit pieces in leading publications, such as Economic Times.

It was established in 1866. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 August 2010.  History  Clermont Cemetery was established in 1866 to service the early Queensland mining town of Clermont in Central Queensland. The place has functioned as Clermont's only public cemetery since the town's inception in the 1860s and it contains graves dating to this period. In December 1916 Clermont experienced the greatest recorded loss of life during a flood in Queensland, and the Clermont Cemetery contains the graves of at least 36 of the flood victims. = Establishment of Clermont = Clermont, in the Peak Downs area of the former Leichhardt Pastoral District, was one of the earliest inland towns established in central Queensland. Pastoralists took up land in the area in the early 1850s but the town of Clermont owes its existence to the discovery of alluvial gold near Hood's Lagoon . With the resultant rush of miners to the site a tent town was established and a licensed hotel, the Diggers' Retreat, was opened in 1862. In late 1863 the area around the lagoon was surveyed as the town of Clermont, and in December that year the town was appointed a place for holding Courts of Petty Sessions. In 1863 the Peak Downs Copper Company opened the first copper mine in Queensland ‚Äì a rich copper lode about five kilometres south of Clermont ‚Äì and the township of Copperfield developed around the mine. The progress of the Clermont-Copperfield district was widely reported in colonial Queensland. Charles Buzacott established the Peak Downs Telegram and Queensland Mining Record at Clermont in 1864 and in 1865 Pugh's Almanac identified Clermont as \\"one of the most promising townships in the interior\\", with a bank, hospital, court-house, newspaper office, workshops, stores, three hotels and several boarding houses. In January 1865 the Clermont Electoral District was proclaimed and in November that year the township of Clermont and the adjacent mining district was proclaimed as the Provisional Council District of Clermont ‚Äì the first under the District Councils Act of 1864. In mid-1866 the residents of Clermont petitioned for municipal status which resulted in the proclamation of the combined municipality of Clermont and Copperfield in January 1867. At the time of the Queensland census of 1868, Clermont, with a population of 821, was the ninth most populous town in the colony, after Brisbane, Rockhampton, Ipswich, Maryborough, Toowoomba, Warwick, Dalby and Bowen, and had a greater population than Drayton (807), Gayndah (746), Roma (506), Gladstone (377), Townsville (346), Mackay (341), Allora (292), Leyburn (279) and Springsure (277). In the early years Clermont was sustained by gold and copper mining and the surrounding pastoral industry. However, by the time Clermont and Copperfield each gained municipal status in May 1872, payable alluvial gold in the district was declining. The town survived largely due to the completion in 1884 of a branch railway linking Clermont to Emerald and Rockhampton. From the 1890s, coal at Blair Athol replaced gold and copper as the principal mining interest in the district. By the late twentieth century, Clermont had evolved into a medium-sized town serving coal mines and agricultural holdings in the area. = Clermont Cemetery = In late 1865 the colonial government approved a grant of for a cemetery at Clermont, although when surveyor Charles Frederick Gregory made his survey early in 1866 he included a cemetery extension, bringing the total area to . In the tradition of locating public cemeteries on the outskirts of a town, the Clermont cemetery reserve was located on the banks of Sandy Creek about one kilometre north-east of the township. It was in use by April 1866 when the town buried one of its first residents, Dr WS Smith, who had been practising in the town for nearly four years. The earliest registered burial in the cemetery was that of a two-year-old child, David Kilpatrick, who was interred in 1867. Around 20 per cent of over 3,000 known burials in the cemetery pre-date 1900. Under the Cemetery Act of 1865, which provided for the regulation of cemeteries throughout Queensland, trustees for the Clermont Cemetery were appointed in August 1868. They represented the Church of England, Roman Catholic, Wesleyan and Presbyterian denominations. Burials for all Christian denominations and non-Christians were received in public cemeteries, which usually were laid out in denominational sections. Clermont Cemetery is among the earlier surviving public cemeteries in central Queensland, others being located at St Lawrence (earliest burial 1857), South Rockhampton Cemetery (established 1860), Marlborough (earliest burial 1860) and Nebo (earliest burial 1866). Early cemeteries are important records of the pattern of non-indigenous settlement in Queensland. The Clermont Cemetery is particularly important for its association with early mining in Queensland. New goldfields typically attracted fortune seekers from all over the world and the birthplaces of those buried in the Clermont Cemetery in the nineteenth century reflected the varied origins of the town's inhabitants during the peak period of mining activity in the area. Birthplaces other than Australia and the British Isles included: China (most numerous), Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Greece, France, and single burials each of an Austrian, Swiss, South Sea Islander, Japanese, Canadian and an American. Many of these nationalities, and others, are represented also in later graves. Despite the renewal of trustees in 1878, by the mid-1880s the cemetery had fallen into disrepair: According to the Brisbane Courier on 26 March 1886: > \\"The Clermont cemetery is one of those institutions which are left to manage > themselves as best they may. God's Acre is all untidy and uncared for; the > fences are going to ruin, and the management seems almost entirely to rest > upon an irresponsible undertaker and sexton.\\" In 1887 the cemetery area was expanded and proclaimed as a permanent reserve of for cemetery purposes. A late 1886 survey plan shows the cemetery occupying the south-western corner of the reserve, closest to the town and fronting Cemetery Road, and enclosed with a two-rail timber fence. Another two-rail fence separated the southern third of the reserve from the remainder, which was largely unimproved. By 1901 a substantial lychgate-cum-shelter shed had been constructed at the main entrance off Cemetery Road, in the south-western corner of the cemetery reserve. This was a timber-framed structure, three or four bays in length, open-sided, with a gabled roof. Historically during the summer months, central and north Queensland has been prone to extreme weather conditions and periods of heavy rain associated with tropical lows and cyclones which have caused major damage and loss of life. In addition to the destruction caused by high winds, torrential rain created by degenerating cyclones has caused rapid flooding of rivers and creeks, inundating large areas of land with fast flowing water. Sandy Creek, Clermont, in flood Flood damaged houses at Clermont, 1916 Clermont had long experience of damaging floods ‚Äì such as that of February 1870, when the town was inundated to a depth of and four persons were drowned (15 in the wider district) ‚Äì but nothing on the scale of the flood of late December 1916. During the morning of 27 December 1916 a cyclone crossed the coast between Bowen and Mackay bringing torrential rain and high wind. By 4.00am on 28 December it was located about north-west of Clermont. Heavy rain fell into the small catchments of Sandy and Wolfang creeks. An accurate determination of rainfall was impossible as rain gauges overflowed but it was estimated that up to of rain fell in the area during the period of the storm which lasted around 18 hours. An eyewitness described the \\"wall of water\\" that flowed rapidly down the creeks sweeping away the low-lying areas of the town of Clermont and inundating the town cemetery beside the river. In the wake of the flood the Adelaide Advertiser (9 January 1917) reported: > \\"The cemetery is merely a mass of holes. The coffins have been washed out > and carried downstream, and the headstones have been wrecked, or where they > were of wood have been borne long distances.\\" The sexton's house was washed away and the sexton was drowned. It is estimated that the river flats were submerged under of fast-flowing water. People sought refuge on roofs and in ceilings but the debris-laden flood waters destroyed many houses and lifted others from their stumps to be carried downstream. Other people were drowned in the flood waters while attempting to escape to higher ground. Over 60 people died, with the disaster reported throughout the country and in the London Times. Many flood victims were buried close to where they were found, but at least 36 are known to be buried in the Clermont Cemetery. All except one of these were buried within three days of the disaster. The burials included entire families of up to seven persons, with the age of victims ranging from two to 70 years. Most were interred in a mass grave located to the east of the earlier burials. A meeting of surviving residents soon after the flood resolved to move the town from the flats to higher ground close by. The government enacted special legislation, the Clermont Flood Relief Act 1917, to enable the town to re-establish at the new site. Some buildings were moved to the new location by traction engine. Descendants of the flood victims still live in Clermont. In 1991, a memorial to the victims was erected in the cemetery by the Lioness Club of Clermont, on the site of the mass grave. A white cross shows the approximate height of the flood waters. Another memorial is located at the site of the original township. The cemetery is now managed by the Isaac Regional Council and remains the main public burial ground for Clermont.  Description  Clermont Cemetery occupies the southern portion of a roughly triangular, ten hectare block of land located approximately two kilometres north of the town centre of Clermont in central Queensland. Access to the cemetery is via several entrance gates off Cemetery Road, which runs along the southern boundary. Perpendicular to this is the eastern boundary, which lies adjacent to Old Showground Road and privately owned land. The third boundary is formed by Sandy Creek, which crosses from the south-west to the north-east corner of the property. The northern portion of the site, separated from the cemetery by a fence line running east-west, is not in use and remains covered by what appear to be native trees. This portion of the site is not included within the heritage register boundary. Graves within the cemetery are arranged in a rectangular grid layout divided by dirt or gravel driveways and walkways, with headstones facing toward the east. The earliest graves are located towards the western end of the site, while the most recent burials and a lawn cemetery are found at the eastern end. Identified burials date from 1867 to the present, with a variety of Victorian, Edwardian and twentieth century monument styles featured throughout. The graves associated with the 1916 flood are located within the older, western half of the cemetery that lies closest to Sandy Creek. In this area, surviving headstones from pre-1916 are made from sandstone, marble and cast iron, many of them substantial headstones of good quality design and craftsmanship. The mass grave containing the victims of the flood is enclosed by a low fence, made from tubular steel posts with chain slung between them. Two marked grave plots containing flood victims are also enclosed by the fence. One belongs to Richard Hooper. The inscription states he \\"was drowned in the great flood of Clermont\\". The grave also contains his wife Elizabeth Jane Hooper who died in 1956 aged 85. It consists of a marble plaque attached to a granite headstone, with a low concrete grave kerb surrounding a concrete slab covered in black and white tiles. Four immortelles sit on top of the slab and a marble plaque with the words \\"Mother Father\\" are attached to the kerb at the foot of the grave. The other marked grave, located further to the south, has a concrete headstone with marble plaque, concrete grave kerb and gravel infill. The three names listed on this plaque are: John Thomas Wicks, Peter Olsson and Evelyn Olsson. The inscription states that they \\"were drowned in the flood of Dec 1916\\". A memorial dated 1991 is also located within the fenced enclosure. It comprises a granite block on a concrete base with small bronze plaques, naming individuals and family groups who lost their lives in the 1916 flood, attached to the eastern face. A larger plaque in the centre bears the words: \\"ERECTED BY LIONESS CLUB ON 13. 4. 1991 IN MEMORY OF KNOWN VICTIMS OF DEC. 1916 FLOOD\\". Next to the granite memorial on the right hand side is a tall timber post, painted white, with a small timber cross member marking the presumed level of the flood. Words painted on this cross member are: \\"1916 FLOOD LEVEL, approximately\\". Other flood victims' graves are found in the eastern half of the cemetery. A memorial to 34 year old Margaret Davidson (n√©e Healy) was erected by her siblings and consists of a marble angel on top of a marble pedestal. The grave itself is surrounded by iron fencing, painted white. Another monument is a large marble Celtic cross bearing the names of five members of the Carsten family. The inscription states that it was erected \\"In loving memory of my dearly beloved wife, little son, mother and sisters who lost their lives in the flood at Clermont, 28 Dec. 1916\\". The names listed are those of Maud Margaret Carsten (aged 30), Simon Henry Carsten (14 months), Kate Carsten (50), and Gretta and Eva Mary Carsten (22 and 26 respectively). Throughout the rest of the cemetery, a wide variety of monumental forms are found including sarcophagi, obelisks and columns. Headstones range from simple upright slabs to those featuring elaborate ornamentation such as angels, cherubs, bibles, urns, crosses and broken columns. Materials used include marble, sandstone, iron, granite and concrete. Of note are some cast iron monuments with filigree iron lacework borders. Included amongst the early twentieth century monuments is the work of Brisbane monumental masons AL Petrie and J Petrie and Sons, and A & G Ballantine of Melbourne. J Simmonds of Brisbane is identified on an 1894 headstone. The cemetery contains two Commonwealth war graves, which are of an Australian Imperial Force Sergeant of World War I (Row U, Grave 5), and a Royal Australian Air Force Leading Aircraftman of World War II (Section K, Grave 6). Monuments from the mid to late 20th century are predominantly of the slab and desk type, made from materials such as concrete, granite and sandstone with some marble features and plaques. Many grave surrounds and concrete slabs are clad in ceramic tiles. The lawn cemetery consists of wide, rectangular strips of ground surrounded by concrete kerbing, one of which features a row of flowering shrubs or small trees down the centre. Brass plaques marking individual graves are either set into concrete at ground level or attached to a continuous, inclined concrete strip. The main entrance archway, located towards the centre of the southern boundary fence, features an arched metal sign supported by tubular metal posts on top of stone pylons and reading \\"CLERMONT CEMETERY\\". The western and northern sides of the cemetery are screened by mature trees growing beyond the boundaries. A row of trees including Jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia) planted along Cemetery Road have a partial screening effect yet still allows views into the cemetery. A scattering of other stand-alone trees are also found growing within the cemetery. Fencing along the front boundary is made with metal post and cyclone wire and with three vehicular and four pedestrian gates spaced along its length. This fence is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. A number of sheds within the cemetery reserve are recent and are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Views over surrounding countryside and farmland are obtained to the east and south of the cemetery. Through trees along the western boundary are views towards Sandy Creek and the countryside beyond.  Heritage listing  Clermont Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 August 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Clermont Cemetery, established in 1866 and still in use, is an early public burial ground in central Queensland. It is associated with the establishment of Clermont as one of Queensland's earliest mining towns; is important in demonstrating the wide ethnic diversity of an early Queensland mining community; and is an important source of unique historical information about a community that has serviced a mining, pastoral and agricultural district since the 1860s. The place is important for its association with the great flood of December 1916 which swept away the lower areas of Clermont with the loss of over 60 lives ‚Äì the worst flood in terms of loss of life in Queensland's history ‚Äì and which brought about the relocation of the town from the flats around the Clermont Lagoon to higher ground nearby. At least 36 of the flood victims were buried in the Clermont Cemetery, most in a mass grave, providing emotive evidence of the human cost of Queensland's harsh climatic conditions. The cemetery itself was flooded and a marker at the mass grave shows the depth of the flood waters. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Clermont Cemetery is important for the aesthetic values generated by the evocativeness of the monuments and memorials, particularly those associated with the 1916 flood victims; and by the workmanship displayed in many of the early monuments, many of which were crafted in other centres and transported to Clermont.

Its peak, located in present-day Winstone Park towards the southwest end of the suburb, is 110 metres in height. It is one of the many extinct cones that dot the isthmus of Auckland, all part of the Auckland volcanic field. The scoria cone was built by fire-fountaining from two craters. Lava flowed from the base of the cone to the north and to the northwest. It was the site of a MƒÅori pƒÅ (fortified village), and was known as (\\"the flat-topped mountain\\") and as . The main southern crater was excavated in 1961/62 and filled with a water-supply reservoir. The reservoir is no longer in active service, and is only maintained as an emergency supply. Since 2009 State Highway 20 has passed close to the cone. The effects of the new motorway on the cone had been the subject of significant discussion, and a major mitigation package had been proposed to reduce the impact of the motorway (and the continuation of the Waikaraka Cycleway that runs parallel to it). The funding of this mitigation and the missing cycleway section was briefly in doubt in 2009, when a cost blowout to $2 million was criticised after Council had set aside $1.6 million. Cycling advocates from Cycle Action Auckland, the Mount Roskill Community Board Chairman Richard Barter and Councillor John Lister however noted various elements unrelated to the cycleway that had driven up the cost, such as a toilet block, bluestone walls, extensive landscaping and artwork, much of it related to Winstone Park itself, or the effects of the motorway. The cycle-path section itself was priced at only $300,000. The path section was finished after six months of construction work and it (and the park facilities) opened to the public on 25 July 2010.

It was built in 1880s. It is also known as Fleurs. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2008.  History  The stone farm building on the property known as Fleurs in the Clermont district of central western Queensland was constructed on land initially selected by William George Hatfield, the son of Thomas and Annie Hatfield. In 1880 members of the Hatfield family selected six adjoining 500 acre portions. The family's homestead was built on portion 202, where the stone farm building still stands. Although the exact date of construction is not known, the existence of a cellar indicates that the building may have been the dairy described in an 1884 inspection of the property. The Clermont district was opened to non-Indigenous settlement following Ludwig Leichhardt's exploration of the area in 1844 when he noted its potential for pastoralists, agriculturists and miners. The discovery of gold near Hood's Lagoon in the early 1860s paved the way for a rush to the district and a settlement near the lagoon renamed Diggings Lagoon was soon established. This was surveyed by the Queensland Government in December 1863 as the town of Clermont. In January 1877 the Land Commissioner's Office received a petition from the residents of Clermont requesting survey of a town common for \\"depasturing stock belonging to the town\\". An area for a town common was resumed from the Crispin Downs and Wena No. 3 runs and was proclaimed as the Clermont Town and Agricultural District Common on 1 March 1878. An 1879 map of the area described the town common as \\"well grassed open downs\\". On 7 January 1880 a section of the Common was proclaimed open for selection, and in February William George Hatfield applied to lease portion 202, consisting of 500 acres of first class pastoral land, under the provisions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1876. He was issued a deed of grant in July 1885. By 15 August 1884 improvements on portion 202 included: a dwelling house containing 12 rooms, an underground tank, kitchen and store, the whole valued at ¬£1000; stables, coach house and man's room valued at ¬£150; and a dairy with an underground tank, valued at ¬£300. The construction material for the dairy is not stated in the list of improvements, but local history suggests that this is the surviving stone building. William George Hatfield was the second oldest son of Thomas Hatfield. Thomas, born in Liverpool near Sydney, worked as a storekeeper and carrier in New South Wales before he decided to move to Queensland, where the discovery of gold at Peak Downs in 1863 had opened opportunities for carriers. Miners needed goods delivered from Rockhampton, and the Peak Downs Cooper Mine needed its smelted ore delivered to the coast. Thomas arrived at Rockhampton in January 1867, and he soon had teams carrying copper from Copperfield to Rockhampton, and later to St Lawrence. The Hatfield family, consisting of Thomas and Annie Hatfield and their seven children, settled in Clermont in late October 1867. Thomas opened stores at St Lawrence, Copperfield and Clermont to sell the goods he brought in from New South Wales, and in 1868 he also opened the Commercial Hotel in St Lawrence. In 1872 he took up a lease on the Connors River, and he used this selection \\"Yatton\\" to breed team horses and run cattle. As Copperfield declined during the 1870s Thomas focused more on Clermont. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1878, served as an Alderman on the Clermont Council, and was a foundation member of the Peak Downs Masonic Lodge in Copperfield in 1879. In early 1880 Thomas, his four oldest sons (Thomas John, William George, Ernest Alfred, and Henry Herbert) and his brother John selected six adjoining 500 acre portions numbered 200 to 203, plus 207 and 210, on the former Clermont Town and Agricultural Common. These portions were collectively known as Fleurs. The local area had been named Les Fleurs, after its wildflowers, by the first owner of Wolfang Station, Oscar de Satge. Fleurs was used to breed horses, and to conduct sheep farming and dairying. After Thomas died from typhoid on 13 December 1882, an article in the Peak Downs Telegram noted that he had recently sought to withdraw from business and devote himself to the (horse) stud farm he had recently established at Fleurs. His eldest son Thomas John took over Fleurs, running 4500 sheep and 200 cattle. Thomas John was also a JP, and he served on both the Belyando Divisional Board and the Belyando Shire Council. In early 1909 Randolph James Wall acquired Fleurs, including portion 202. Wall also ran sheep, and some cattle, on the property. The farm is currently owned by William Fraser, the great grandson of RJ Wall. The stone farm building, which was used as shearer's quarters at one stage, is now used for storage purposes.  Description  Fleurs is a pastoral property situated northeast of Clermont, about along Fleurs Lane from the Gregory Highway. The Stone Farm Building at Fleurs is one of a number of buildings within the complex, including the homestead and several corrugated iron clad sheds (but only the stone building is included in the heritage listing). The building is a well-constructed, single-storeyed, masonry structure comprising three rooms and an underground cellar. Its hipped, timber-framed roof, incorporating verandahs to all four sides in a broken back form, is clad with short, corrugated iron roof sheets. The verandah roof is supported on bush timber posts and a later verandah floor exists on the south-east and north-east sides. The substantial external walls are of random rubble construction finished externally and internally with ant bed render. Architectural historian Miles Lewis has recorded the nineteenth century use of crushed anthill clay, or ant bed, for adobe, cob, pise de terre, earthen flooring and later the surfacing of tennis courts. Ant bed appears to have been used mainly in rural areas either due to an absence of other materials, or for its adhesive and/or insulating properties. Comparatively few ant bed structures are known to survive in Queensland. Another building described as being a dairy located in the Clermont area is Irlam's farm building, which is constructed of rammed earth mixed with ant bed. There is brick quoining to the corners of the stone building at Fleurs and to window and door openings. To accommodate the original verandah floor joists, a brick-on-edge course set between two layers of timber planking, provided a level surface for the joist housing around the perimeter of the building. The existing verandah floor structure abuts the external walls. All openings have brick arch lintels. There are two windows and a pair of doors with a three-paned fanlight above in the south-east (front) wall and one window in the north-west (rear) wall. A second pair of doors with three-paned fanlight above is in the north-east wall. The window openings in the south- east elevation are lined with wire mesh and each of the windows has a sliding timber panel, and a timber-lined sill and head. The interior is divided into three rooms with exposed stud timber partition walls lined to door head height. The two smaller interconnecting rooms at the front of the building are separated by a chamferboard-lined wall. A weatherboard-lined wall separates these from the larger room at the rear. There is a timber floor throughout supported on joists housed into log bearers. Access to the cement-rendered cellar is gained through an opening in the floor in a front room via a metal ladder. The cellar is ventilated with openings formed in brickwork in each of the corners, although the exterior openings were not located. Remains of lime wash and painted finishes survive on both internal and external walls.  Heritage listing  Stone Farm Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed between 1880 and 1884 to service the Hatfield family's cluster of selections north of Clermont, collectively known as \\"Fleurs\\", the stone farm building on the property remains important in illustrating how early non-indigenous settlers made use of a range of local building materials to construct homesteads in remote districts, poorly serviced by transportation and towns. The cellar is a good example of the early practice of using cellars for cool food storage, and the building is highly intact, with its original roof form. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Constructed of random rubble stone with a rendered layer of ant bed and brick quoining, the stone farm building at Fleurs is a comparatively rare example in Queensland of the use of stone and ant bed to construct a well-made and permanent farm building.

In early November 1956, VAH-1's A3D-1s were craned aboard the at Naval Station Mayport, Florida and the Forrestal put to sea to operate in the eastern Atlantic during the Suez Crisis, ready to enter the Mediterranean Sea should it be necessary. Carrier qualifications with the A3D-1 were conducted during this period and Forrestal returned to the US on 12 December 1956. In January 1957, VAH-1 embarked on Forrestal on its first formal deployment, a cruise to the Mediterranean. In 1958, VAH-1 upgraded to the A3D-2 version of the Skywarrior and, in January 1959, relocated to Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. VAH-1 continued to operate the Skywarrior until late 1962, at which point the squadron ceased operating the now renamed A-3B and began preparations for transitioning to the A-5A Vigilante, completing transition in January 1963. The squadron made one overseas deployment with the A-5A and continued to operate the aircraft until mid-1964, at which point it began transitioning to the RA-5C Vigilante. This transition was completed in August 1964 and the squadron was redesignated as RVAH-1 on 1 September 1964.http://www.rvahnavy.com/5history.html *2 September 1958 - 12 March 1958, VAH-1 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment.http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH01.html *4 August 1960 - 3 March 1961, VAH-1 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *4 August 1961 - 19 December 1961, VAH-1 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *19 April 1962 - 27 August 1962, VAH-1 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *6 August 1963 - 4 March 1964, VAH-1 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. =RVAH-1 / Cold War & Vietnam=VAH-1 was redesignated as RVAH-1 on 1 September 1964.

Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained post-Vietnam defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. In tandem with the RVAH community, carrier-based reconnaissance had been concurrently conducted by the active duty light photographic reconnaissance (VFP) community at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews AFB / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader, continuing until 29 March 1987 when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve fighter (VF) community at Naval Air Station Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and later Naval Air Station JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) and later the Digital TARPS (D-TARPS). Following its return from its final Western Pacific deployment in late 1978, RVAH-1 was inactivated at Naval Air Station Key West on 19 January 1979 following nearly 24 years of active service.

He started his career in the doo-wop group the Hollywood Flames in the 1950s before founding the R&B; duo Bob & Earl with Bobby Byrd. As Jackie Lee, he's best known for his hit song \\"The Duck\\" (#14 Pop, #4 R&B;).  Biography  Earl Lee Neslon was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana on September 8, 1928. He sang in his church's gospel choir in his youth before his family relocated to Los Angeles in 1937. Nelson enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 17, working on the construction of the Panama Canal. In the 1950s he began singing doo-wop and joined the Hollywood Flames. He sang lead on the 1957 single \\"Buzz Buzz Buzz\\" which reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the R&B; chart. Nelson and Bobby Byrd, not Bobby Byrd of the Famous Flames, collaborated as Bobby \\"Baby Face\\" Byrd & the Birds as well as Bobby Day & the Satellites. In 1957, Nelson released his first solo single, \\"Oh Gee Oh Golly\\" / \\"I Bow To You,\\" on Class Records. That year, Nelson and Byrd released their first single as Bob & Earl, \\"You Made a Boo-Boo,\\" on Class. In 1958, Nelson sang background vocals on Day's single \\"Rockin' Robin\\" (#2 Pop, #1 R&B;). Afterwards, they left the Hollywood Flames, but after a few years, Byrd left Bob & Earl to focus on his solo career. Bob Relf from the Laurels replaced Byrd, and the new Bob & Earl recorded for different labels before releasing \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" on Marc Records in 1963. The single reached the Top 50 in the US and years later the Top 10 in the UK. Their follow up singles weren't as successful. In 1965, Nelson relaunched a solo career on Mira Records with the single \\"Ooh Honey Baby,\\" credited to Earl Cosby. Later that year, Nelson signed to Mirwood Records recorded as Jackie Lee. Jackie was Nelson's wife's name and Lee his own middle name. He released his biggest single \\"The Duck\\" in November 1965 and by January it peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on the R&B; chart. In 1966, he released his only album, The Duck, which reached #85 on the Billboard's Top Lp's chart and #8 on the R&B; chart. Though Nelson didn't have further chart success, his later singles on Mirwood are popular in Northern soul circles. Nelson later recorded for ABC-Paramount and Uni Records. Barry White produced his 1974 Warner Bros. single \\"Strange Funky Games and Things\\" (credited to Jay Dee). Nelson continued to perform around Los Angeles, but he was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nelson died at the age of 79 in Los Angeles on July 12, 2008. At the time of his death, Nelson had been married three times and he had seven surviving children (two deceased).

The Association opposed primogeniture, and sought legal changes on entails. Its programme fell short of the nationalisation of land demanded by the contemporary Land and Labour League. Background The context of the formation of the Association was the aftermath of the Reform Act 1867. While the franchise had been extended, the Reform League that had pushed for the extension then collapsed as a political force. In parallel, Mill and Edmond Beales set up the Association to promote further reform and change. Besides modifications to land law, they proposed also to encourage co-operative agriculture and smallholders. Political role Following a launch of a programme by Mill in July 1870, and organisational work in which Thomas Hare and Jacob Bright were involved, the Association held its first public meeting in 1871. A key plank of the Association's programme was taxation of the unearned increment. Mill's advocacy of this measure presaged more radical proposals of the 1880s. His views influenced Arthur Arnold, president of the Free Land League in 1885. In July 1870 The Economist argued that the LTRA's emphasis on freeing up trade in land in fact would work against the expansion of peasant proprietors, since the wealthy would pay high prices for land.F.

Published by: Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). . . On Mill's death on 1873, the Association's effective role came to an end. Mill had handed over to Alfred Russel Wallace. It was in the early 1880s that Wallace's writings led to the formation of the Land Nationalisation Society. The Association itself closed down in 1876. Land reform was a more important issue at the 1885 general election than at any previous time, or subsequently.David Nicholls, \\"The New Liberalism: After Chartism?\\", Social History Vol. 21, No. 3 (Oct., 1996), pp. 330‚Äì342, at p. 334.

He began his career working in the civil service, before becoming a successful barrister. He was first appointed a Judge of the High Court in 1996, having an instrumental role in the establishment of the Commercial Court division of the court in 2004. He was one of the first judges appointed to a new Court of Appeal when it was established in 2014. He returned to the High Court in 2015 on becoming the President of the High Court, a role which he held until retiring in 2020. He was an ex officio member of the Supreme Court of Ireland while President of the High Court.  Early career  Kelly was born in Dublin in 1950 and attended O'Connell School. Upon leaving school, he worked as a civil servant at the High Court Central Office. He was educated at University College Dublin and the King's Inns. He was called to the Bar in 1973. Kelly then worked in the European Division of the Department of Justice in Brussels and Luxembourg until he commenced practice in 1975. He was also called to the Bar of England and Wales and the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1981 and 1983 respectively. He became a Senior Counsel in 1986. He primarily practised in commercial and chancery law, though he also acted in constitutional law cases. He represented Fianna F√°il politician Des Hanafin in a case seeking to have Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, permitting divorce, declared to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court appointed him to argue for the right of the unborn in a reference made by President Mary Robinson under Article 26 of the Constitution of Ireland to the Supreme Court regarding the Information (Termination of Pregnancies) Bill 1995. Kelly acted for families of the victims Stardust fire seeking compensation from the Stardust Victims Compensation Tribunal in 1986. Other clients over the course of his career included the Aga Khan and Ben Dunne. He is a bencher at the King's Inns since 1996 and Middle Temple since 2014.  Early judicial career  = High Court = Kelly was appointed a Judge of the High Court in 1996 at the age of 46. He was the judge-in-charge of the Chancery List between 1997 and 1999 and the Judicial Review List between 1999 and 2003. Early in his career as a High Court judge he clashed with the government over the treatment of vulnerable young people. In 2000 he put in place a mandatory injunction requiring government ministers to provide specialist support care for underage patient. This provoked controversy with the government as if not followed, it would have held the relevant minister in contempt of court. An appeal to the Supreme Court of his decision was subsequently upheld. He became the first president of the Association of Judges of Ireland in 2011. In 2013, he accused the then government of taking apart the legal system \\"brick by brick\\". = Commercial Court = He was appointed as the presiding judge over a newly established Commercial Court within the High Court in 2004 to hear cases which were complex or with a claim in excess of ‚Ç¨1 million. The structure of the court came about following rules which he proposed to the Superior Court Rules Committee and were accepted by the Minister for Justice. It was launched in October 2004. Kelly continued to preside over the court throughout the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn. He heard high profile cases arising out of the economic crash including cases involving Anglo Irish Bank, Se√°n Quinn, Mick Wallace and ACC Bank. He awarded a ‚Ç¨2.2 billion judgment against Quinn. Kelly said that while presiding over the Commercial Court he witnessed \\"national and international fraud, sharp practice, chicanery and dishonesty\\".  Court of Appeal  The establishment of the Court of Appeal led to his appointment in October 2014 as one of the first six ordinary judges of the court.  President of the High Court  He was appointed as President of the High Court on 21 December 2015. By virtue of his position, he is also a member of the Supreme Court of Ireland. Upon his appointment, the Director General of the Law Society of Ireland described him as a \\"fearlessly independent judge with a ferocious work ethic\\" and said he had a \\"first-class legal mind\\". Kelly was the Acting President of the Court of Appeal for a period in 2016 while Sean Ryan was on medical leave. The Irish Times reported that he was one of three judges considered for the role of Chief Justice of Ireland upon the retirement of Susan Denham in 2017, though only Frank Clarke's name was put forward for selection by the cabinet. As President, he introduced greater safeguards for the ward of court process, re-introducing independent medical visitors. He retired on 17 June 2020 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. He received a guard of honour from judicial colleagues in lieu of a traditional ceremony, due to COVID-19 concerns. At the time of his retirement, he was the second-longest serving Irish judge. The President of the Bar Council praised what he considered Kelly's \\"competence, rigour, propriety and independence\\".  Further appointments  Kelly is an adjunct professor of law at Maynooth University, serves on the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He is chairman of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust and St. Francis Hospice, Raheny.  Personal life  Kelly lives in south Dublin and is unmarried. He also has a residence in Rome. He is a practising Catholic.

Description Leymus chinensis is a perennial plant that is normally 40‚Äì90 cm tall and is native to northern China. It is a plant that can potentially be used as a food source in future generations. Scientists have tested the effects of various stimuli on Leymus chinensis. If optimum conditions for the growth of this plant are discovered, then this plant has the capability to eventually become a potential food source for humanity. Temperature and light effects on germination Temperature and light greatly affect the germination of several species of grasses. Leymus chinensis shows 47% germination under variable temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 ¬∞C. De-husking (removing outer-covering of seeds) at constant temperature was shown to also improve germination.Ao M, Miura R, Tominaga T (2014) Germination characteristics of four common perennial grasses of Inner Mongolian grassland, China. GRASSLAND SCIENCE 1(60):9-14. The effects of light have had an interesting effect on the germination of Leymus chinensis. The plants were assessed according to three independent variables: effect of light or dark conditions under which germination occurred, the temperature under which the germination had occurred, and lastly, if the temperature had fluctuated with another temperature by about 10 ¬∞C. The effects were shown to have statistical significance but leave doors open as to why this trend had occurred. Under the conditions of light, only 7% of the Leymus chinensis seedlings had germinated at 20 ¬∞C. Under the dark conditions, almost triple the amount of seedlings germinated at 25% at 20 ¬∞C. The results were significantly lower for both the dark and light populations at the fluctuating temperatures. At 15 to 25 ¬∞C, only 15% germinated in dark and 3% germinated in light. The trend continued at 20 to 30 ¬∞C, as only about 7% germinated in dark and 1-2% germinated in light conditions.Hu XW, Wu YP, Ding XY, Zhang R (2014) Seed Dormancy, Seedling Establishment and Dynamics of the Soil Seed Bank of Stipa bungeana (Poaceae) on the Loess Plateau of Northwestern China. PLOS ONE 11(9):1-6. pH and salt effects on germination The effects of salt and pH were studied on germination as well with different findings. Increasing salt and pH decreases the rate of germination in Leymus chinensis. However, after treatments, seeds that were transferred to DI water germinated normally. A pH of 8.05 showed a remarkable decrease in growth.Lin JX, Li ZL, Shao S, Wang YN, Mu CS (2014) Effects of Various Mixed Salt-Alkaline Stress Conditions on Seed Germination and EarlySeedling Growth of Leymus chinensisfrom Songnen Grassland of China. NOTULAEBOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA 1(42): 154-159. Water-buffered pH did not affect germination of Leymus chinensis; however, at 50 and 100mM of tris, germination severely decreased. Germination increased in basic environments. Different salt concentrations negatively affected germination: Na2CO3 > NaHCO3 > NaCl > Na2SO4, with Na2CO3 having the most detrimental effect on seed germination and Na2SO4 having the least effect.Hongyuan M, Haoyu Y, Xiaotao L, Yuepeng P, Haitao W, Zhengwei L, Mark KJ (2015) Does high pH give a reliable assessment of the effect of alkaline soil on seed germination? A case study with Leymus chinensis (Poaceae). PLANT AND SOIL 1(394): 35-43. Chemical effects on germination Other effects such as those of fluridone, GA3, and KNO3 were also tested on germination. A control was set as a basis of comparison to the three added chemicals. The control had a 25% germination rate, and all the seeds were performed under a standard 20 ¬∞C temperature. Fluridone did not significantly affect germination as compared to the control, as the percentage of fluridone plus the seedlings was also about 25%. However, GA3 and KNO3 both exhibited a significant difference when added to the seedlings. The GA3 increased the percent germinated to 36%, and KNO3 increased germination to an even higher 44%. Both of these turned to be strikingly different from the control which had only 25% of its seeds germinate. When nitrogen was added at the early-vegetative stage of Leymus chinensis, it increased the inflorescence number. Adding nitrogen during the beginning of autumn and watering the plants during the final moments of the growing season may improve yield for this plant. There is a strong correlation between increased inflorescence number and fall tillers.Wang JF, Li XY, Gao S, Li ZL, Mu CS (2013) Impacts of Fall Nitrogen Application on Seed Production in Leymus chinensis, a Rhizomatous Perennial Grass. AGRONOMY JOURNAL 5(105): 1378-1384. Dry storage effects on germination The effect of dry storage was also tested on the effects of germination. The variables tested here are storage at 5 and 20 ¬∞C with a control at 0 ¬∞C, along with if the seeds were in light or dark conditions at each temperature. Another variable was that at each temperature and light condition, there was a duration of dry storage for the seeds. The seeds could have been stored at either 1, 3, or 6 months before measuring percentage of germination. At both temperatures of 5 and 20 ¬∞C and for only 3 and 6 months of storage for light conditions and at 1, 3, and 6 months of storage for dark conditions, there was a significant increase in the percentage of germination. The seeds did not differentiate much when it came to after-ripening, which indicates the germination potential of a seed at specific conditions. However, at 3 months of dry storage at 20 ¬∞C under light and dark conditions, there was an apparent significant increase in the percentage of germination in the seeds as compared to the 5 ¬∞C conditions. In addition, at 6 months of dry storage at 20 ¬∞C for just light conditions, there was a higher percentage of germinated seeds, as compared to the conditions at 5 ¬∞C.

The union of the various small rural municipalities in which the territory was fragmented gave birth in 1866 to the municipality of Brugherio. Some are still visible: Bindellera, Casecca, Cattoni, Comolli, Dorderio, Guzzina, Increa, Modesta (called also Del Bosco), Moia, Occhiate (with Occhiate's mill), Pareana, San Cristoforo, Sant'Ambrogio, San Paolo and Torazza.*  Architecture  Isolated in the countryside (as Sant'Ambrogio, Guzzina and Occhiate) or unified in a rural agglomeration (as Cassina Baraggia and San Damiano), the farms were the core of peasant life. They had closed courts and shared architectural characteristics of farms on the plains north of Milan. In such designs the yard was intended to functionally link the property, having a central role in the agricultural chain of production (as occurred in Po-valley companies). Around the courtyard, usually very large, four buildings opened: two porches on the ground floor, topped by a railing leading to the residential upper floor; the third belonged to stables and barns; and the fourth was originally made up of small rooms used as latrines. The houses were so arranged: in the ground floor there were a kitchen, pantry, closets and the living room, bedrooms being upstairs. At the center of the courtyard one could find water well.  Agriculture  In Brugherio and its surroundings, agricultural properties were mostly small and divided, apart from a few exceptions, until the Napoleonic era. Polyculture (wheat, maize, beans, potatoes) prevailed, intended mainly for personal consumption rather than sale. The area was known for the production of wine and, from the mid- eighteenth century, mulberry cultivation grew: the mulberry trees, which were customarily planted on the edge of the field, to avoid sacrificing other crops needed to feed silkworms, were given by the owner to the tenant farmers to labour them together. Women and children were in charge of breeding silkworms. The silkworm boom saw the construction of several mills, the first of which were located in Baraggia and Moncucco.  Farmhouses  = Bindellera = It was built in 1761 and it was a property of Viganone, a tape-seller. It had a big room at the ground floor where tuns were placed. The farm is located between viale Lombardia and the A4 motorway. It is still used for agricultural activities, but it is in bad condition. = Casecca = Casecca Ca secca, as it was once called to emphasize the arid nature of the surrounding land, is located in the north-west of Brugherio, lapped by the irrigation ditch Manganella. It was property of the friars of the Passion of Milan, who built a church dedicated to St. Magdalene, until the end of 1700,and then it was moved to Pecchio Ghiringhelli's family. Recently it hosted the headquarters of the sports center La mongolfiera of GIVIDI club, closed in 2013. It was known for the production of clogs, which were sold at Monza, the town of which the municipality was a member until 1866, when it was annexed to Brugherio. Of the original architectural structure remains only the wing of the portico overlooking Via Casecca, which, although much restored, retains the characteristic features of the Lombard farmhouse. = Dorderio = During the second half of the eighteenth century Dorderio was an independent town that was annexed to the municipality of Moncucco. It belonged to the Marquises Carpani, who possessed, in addition to the farm, a \\"aratorio used as furnace\\" and the surrounding grounds. In 1800 the property passed to Butti's family, who built next to the farmhouse a \\"holiday home\\", which still preserves valuable frescoes painted on the facade, the inside ones are very scarred. = Guzzina = Guzzina The farm Guzzina, in the south area of Brugherio and opposite the district Edilnord and bordering Cologno Monzese, once stood isolated in the rural town of Moncucco. Its name comes from gussetta, referret to failed cocoons, testimony of the wide spread of sericulture in these places. In addition to the breeding of silkworms, the farm was known since the eighteenth century for the production of wine. The Guzzina is a complex of buildings that includes, within the town walls plastered with intense yellow, some agricultural courts, a villa owned by Count Venino and a private chapel dedicated to St. Andrew at the beginning, then to Santa Maria degli Angeli and finally to the Magi. Both the villa and the church date back to 1500. = Increa = Increa The farm in Cr√© (Increa) is very old, dating back at least to the twelfth century and are mentioned among the farms that became part of the parish of St. Bartholomew in 1578. It has always been part of the parish of Gorgonzola, in the municipality of Cernusco Asinario.As you can see also from the map of the Teresian land registry of 1721 In 1871 it was aggregated to the municipality of Brugherio, which was formed in 1866. Until that year was the property of Count Carlo Litta, then of the Count Zumenzu. It is passed to Ottolini and Tizzoni's families and finally to Robbiani's, from who the current inhabitants purchased it. The name comes from crea, clay, which could refer to the nature of the surrounding land, or the presence in the area of an old brick kiln. The complex, a rare surviving example of folk architecture of the Renaissance, also includes villa Tizzoni Ottolini and the small church of Saint Mary Immaculate. It is in the countryside between Brugherio and Cernusco sul Naviglio, near the ring road east of Milan and to the park Increa. The planimetry has U-shape: the main structure consists of a portico with five columns topped by a wrought iron balcony. To the left of the entrance there is the small oratory of 1691, known as the church of Santa Maria Immacolata, while on the back there are traces of a large garden which has now disappeared. The cottages and barns have been restored by the municipality of Brugherio, who turned them into housing. The renovation was carried out respecting the original architecture of the farm, protected by the Superintendence for Architectural Heritage and Landscape. = Modesta o Del Bosco = Cascina Modesta is located on the eastern border of Brugherio, not far from the Cascina Sant'Ambrogio. It was built in the nineteenth century and took its name from the first owner, Brenna modesta widow Vismara, although some say the adjective should instead be referred to the original architectural structure of rural, virtuous or to the character of its inhabitants; so modesta should refear to the poor condition of the inhabitants. It is also called Del Bosco because it is located on the edge of the only large wooded area of Brugherio, known as Boscone and formerly known for its abundance of game. It is the only farm where there are still fully agricultural lands which are all cultivated.Modesta = Moia = Moia In the eighteenth century Cassina della Moglia was included in the feud of Durini of Monza. The property then passed to the counts Andreani-Sormani, in the municipality of Moncucco. Since 1866 it is part of the territory of Brugherio and it is located in the north, on the border with Monza. It seems that its name derives from the surname of a family of pharmacists, who had lived there since the sixteenth century. Historical chronicles of the early years of the twentieth century documents in Cascina Moia the presence of a furnace that made the soil particularly clayey. Although in poor condition, it retains the classic appearance of the Lombard farmhouse, with a well in the center of the court bordered by rustic barns. = Occhiate = Occhiate Wheat in Occhiate After Sant'Ambrogio, Aeclanum is the oldest farm in Brugherio, following Cascina Sant'Ambrogio. It stood in the place known Octavum, the name is due to the fact that it was at the eighth mile of road leading from Milan to Monza. Now that area is situated in the north-west of Brugherio, near the border with Cologno Monzese. The farm was manageed by the farmers, that obtained it from the monks of Saint Ambrose church, to make it a place of hospitality for the poor and pilgrims. The monks themselves with the fruits from the leasing and processing land of glances, handed out annually to the poor fifty bushels of wheat and ten amphorae of wine. Later the property passed to the church of Monza. In 1862 it became part of the municipality of Moncucco and in 1866 to the one of Brugherio. The farm is near the banks of the Lambro and has an ancient wheat, with two wheels (a wooden and a metal ones) operated by the Molinara irrigation ditch.Called also Mornera The original structure was formed by pillars, wall bricks and wooden beams. Over the years the building has been extended up to the present structure. The mill is still in good condition and it is used to illustrate activities for educational purposes. = Pareana = Pareana Cascina Pareana is located near the border with Carugate, in the territory that was part of Cassina Baraggia. It first belonged to the Counts Durini, then to Marquises Brivio (also owners of the nearby villa), who still has it. It was built in 1730. Although split between different tenants, the original structure is fairly well preserved, with the well and the wood oven that arise in their ancient form. = San Cristoforo = San Cristoforo It takes name from a small church dedicated to St. Christopher that stood beside it in the ninth century, when the territory was part of the town called Ottavo, because it was at the eighth mile of road leading from Milan to Monza. The church was listed among the assets owned by the Cathedral of Monza and had been built \\"to remind travelers of then and now\\". It was demolished in December 1995. The farm, which is located in the north-west of Brugherio, dates back at least to the '500 and in 1751 was surveyed by the Teresian cadastre as \\"a house of a farmer called San Cristoforo\\", that had been property before the accounts Serbelloni, then of the accounts Alari of Milan. = Sant'Ambrogio = Sant'Ambrogio Cascina Sant'Ambrogio is the oldest farm in Brugherio. It is next to the church Saint Ambrose, with which it shared the various owners. It is located in Via Dei Mille, which once was in open countryside in the town of Cassina Baraggia, but located sull'Itinerarium burdigalense. Commissioned by the bishop of Milan Ambrose as a summer residence, at his death it was ceded to the monastery of Saint Ambrose with usufruct to his sister Marcellina, who retired to the cloistered life. Villa, monastery, then mansion and finally farmhouse, it was restored (along oratory annex) in 1953, for will of the family Cavajoni, that bought the complex after the religious orders' Napoleonic suppression. The last renovation was done in 1995 by a special purpose company by four local businessmen, who used the apartment buildings preserving and recovering as much as possible of the original architectural elements. = Torazza = Torazza Before the establishment of the municipality of Brugherio, in 1866, the town Torrazza belonged to Monza. Since the sixteenth century, the farm was isolated in the middle of the countryside owned by several noble families of Milan (first Marino, then Alari finally the Sormani-Andreani) and was inhabited exclusively by stewards and laborers who cultivated the land. With the passing of time the territory is urbanized and the area has been transformed into a residential neighborhood, changing the character of the farmhouse. In 1963 it was built some features townhouses, while stables and barns have been turned into garages.

An explanation given is the fact that between the solar system and the cluster lie two dust layers, one at 200pc and one more at 1Kpc. Behind the cluster is one more dust layer. The cluster has approx. 80 members. The earliest spectral type is around B0 and members of the cluster are also a few luminous stars, like HD 10494, F5Ia. Also, in the cluster have been found three Be stars. NGC 654 is assumed to form part of the stellar association Cassiopeia OB8, that is located in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way, along with the open clusters M103, NGC 663, NGC 659, and some supergiant stars scattered between them, all of them having similar ages and distances.

It was built in 1886 and was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000.  History  The Nebo Hotel, believed to be the second hotel on the site, was constructed in 1886 for Jack Davis who owned the hotel until 1906. Ludwig Leichhardt first explored the area around Nebo in 1845. By the early 1860s pastoral expansion was pushing up the coast from Rockhampton towards land in the Mitchell and Kennedy districts and beyond. Land at a crossing on the Nebo Creek where good water and grass were available became a popular overnight camp for teamsters and other travellers. In 1862, Ben Reynolds, one of a party who crossed the Eton Range with a bullock dray, established a hotel on the banks of the creek. A licence for this hotel was granted in early 1863. Two years later the area around it was surveyed by TH Fitzgerald and gazetted as a township. It was called Fort Cooper after the hill that is a prominent landscape feature in the area and the hotel was named the Fort Cooper Hotel. The local people, however, had already begun to call the settlement Nebo, after the creek on which it was based. Fort Cooper was intended as a service centre for the surrounding pastoral area. From the 1870s it also served a number of copper mines and the Mount Britton gold mine from the 1880s. Fort Cooper quickly prospered gaining a second hotel, a telegraph office and a Court of Petty Sessions. However, the population of the area dropped somewhat in the late 1860s as stations replaced sheep with cattle, which did not require as many hands to care for them. In 1886, Jack Davis, who also built a residence and store across from the hotel six years later, built the current hotel and retained the name. In 1906, Davis sold the hotel to Jim Perry, who later sold it to Henry Richard Marshall. The place was again sold in 1918 when the German owner found that prejudice affected his trade. In 1920 the license was acquired by Alexander William Maclean. A number of his 13 children were born at the hotel and it has been a long association with the Maclean family. Maclean had a great interest in horse racing and for most of the time that he owned the hotel he was President of the Nebo Jockey Club. The hotel catered for race meetings and there were once stables and a stockyard on the grounds. The adjoining two storey building that forms part of the hotel and linked by the hotel's eastern verandas, was built in two stages. The ground floor was constructed following the First World War as a billiard room. The upper storey was added in 1932 as private living quarters. In 1939 Maclean sold the hotel owing to ill health. It was purchased by Tom Wright and Herb Davidson and was operated by various licensees. In 1948, local usage concerning the name of the town finally prevailed and both the township and hotel were renamed Nebo. In 1962 Jim Maclean leased the hotel and purchased it in 1964. His daughter took over the running of the hotel in 1991. The property has been sold twice since 1994. Changes have been minor. The most noticeable exterior change has been the removal of the timber veranda deck to the Reynolds Street side and the installation of low steps to provide access to the bar and the side verandas. The timber rail balustrade was replaced on the ground floor by horizontal weatherboards. In appearance the hotel is both typical of its era and an increasing rarity.  Description  The Nebo Hotel is situated at the corner of two major streets in the town, Reynolds and Water Streets, overlooking Nebo Creek. The hotel consists of two adjacent buildings. The older, larger corner building with bar at ground floor and guest bedrooms on first floor. The adjoining building houses the dining room and kitchen on its lower level with management accommodation over. The main building is two storey, timber framed with green painted corrugated iron to the hip roof with skillion veranda awnings on three sides. External walls are clad with painted vertical corrugated iron. The former front section of the timber deck veranda has been removed, the lower level open rail balustrade replaced with weatherboards and steps added to access the bar. At the upper level the cross braced open balustrade remains as does the decorative fascia boards. Timber posts support the timber deck veranda which provides access to the tongue and groove-lined guest bedrooms through individual French doors. Behind the public bar stands an old hardwood insulated coolroom which is claimed to produce excellent temperature beer. The adjoining building, situated to the east of the main hotel, is two storeyed with a painted corrugated galvanised iron hip roof. Originally single storeyed it is externally clad with painted vertical corrugated iron on the lower storey and ripple iron to the upper. The dining room has timber double hung windows and is lined with an early fibro sheeting. A skillion roofed veranda to the first floor level on the street elevation has been enclosed with flat fibro cladding. The living quarters behind it have recently been lined internally.  Heritage listing  Nebo Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Nebo Hotel, erected in 1886, is important in demonstrating the evolution and pattern of Queensland's history standing, as it does, close to a creek crossing on what was a track utilised by explorers, pastoralists and settlers seeking land in the Mitchell and Kennedy Regions of north Queensland. Further, the hotel remains as an extant reminder of the time when Nebo was a service centre for the pastoral and mining areas surrounding the town. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Nebo Hotel is significant as a relatively intact example of a nineteenth century timber and iron vernacular hotel which is representative of its type and era of construction.

The early rise of the Community in Ghana can be traced through a sequence of events beginning roughly at the same time as the establishment of the worldwide Community in 1889 in British India. It was during the early period of the Second Caliphate that the first missionary, Abdul Rahim Nayyar was sent to what was then the Gold Coast in 1921 upon invitation from Muslims in Saltpond. Having established the Ahmadiyya movement in the country, Nayyar left and was replaced by the first permanent missionary, Al Hajj Fadl-ul-Rahman Hakim in 1922.

History =Establishment= Aduogyir \\"Mahdi\\" Appah in his later years The introduction of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Ghana can be traced to a sequence of events, commencing several years prior to the establishment of the Community in 1889 in British India. Although, there were reports of small number of Muslims in southern Ghana in the early 19th century, Islam is said to have properly commenced in the region in 1885, among the Fante people. Roughly a decade prior to this, in 1872, during perhaps the third Anglo-Ashanti war, a northern Muslim cleric Abu Bakr arrived in southern Ghana to administer the spiritual needs of Muslim Nigerian Hausa soldiers brought by the British colonialists. In 1885, he converted two people who are regarded as the founding fathers of Islam among the Fante people; namely Benjamin Sam and Mahdi Appah.The birth name of Mahdi Appah was Aduogyir Appah. After converting to the Ahmadiyya movement, he changed his first name to Mahdi. See: * Both were formerly Christians. Sam was a Methodist evangelist and a trader who initially brought his friend Appah from Paganism to Christianity. The conversion of Sam is said to have been influenced through a vision and of Appah as a consequence of the fulfilment of his prayer. Islam grew rapidly among the Fante people. Starting from Ekrofol, Sam self- designated himself as its Imam, and quickly built a community of 500 Fante Muslims across southern Ghana. At times, Muslim clerics from the northern regions continued to supervise the growing, but nascent group of Muslims in southern Ghana. In July 1896, a secular Muslim school was opened in Ekrofol, and Appah was appointed as its manager. However, the northern clerics expressed strong disapproval of a secular-leaning school. Despite this, the school prospered with governmental assistance until 1908 when it was infected by Guinea worm disease and attendance soon dropped. As a convert from Christianity, Sam taught customs, brought from Christianity, that were sometimes considered un-Islamic. This was a major cause of disagreement between him and his friend Appah. As a result, Appah left Ekrofol. Sam died soon after, in the same year the disease struck the school. Appah once again returned to Ekrofol and continued to propagate Islam among the Fante people. Abdul Rahim Nayyar, the first Ahmadi Muslim missionary to be sent to the Gold Coast, modern-day Ghana, was responsible for establishing the movement in the country. The first contact with Ahmadiyya in Ghana can perhaps be attributed to a consequence of Sam‚Äôs cousin who dreamt of white men called \\"Muslims\\", with whom he was praying.The term \\"white\\" corresponded to non-African foreigners. Thus, Ahmadi Muslims from the Indian subcontinent were counted among the \\"whites\\". Before the invitation, the young group of orthodox Muslims were not aware of the existence of \\"white\\" Muslims. See:  It was believed by converts that the only people who prayed as Muslims were the northern Hausa. However, a resident in Saltpond, originally from Nigeria, informed the presence of the Indian-origin Ahmadiyya movement in Nigeria. Soon, through the Review of Religions, the Fante Muslims under the leadership of Appah made contact with the caliph, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, in Qadian, India. The Muslims were no longer interested to remain under the spiritual guidance of the northern Ghanaians or Hausa Muslims. The caliph sent Al-Hajj Abdul Rahim Nayyar who sailed from London to Freetown, in Sierra Leone. After a short stay he arrived in 28 February 1921 to Saltpond, Ghana.and started preaching in the first week of March 1921. Following a lecture, the Fante community \\"believed there and then\\", following which an oath of allegiance was held. In the history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mahdi Appah is regarded as the first Ghanaian to become an Ahmadi Muslim. Despite resistance from northern clerics, the Fante Muslims converted en masse, giving immediate rise to the Ahmadiyya movement in Ghana. Having established the Ahmadiyya movement in Ghana, Nayyar left within a month for Lagos, in Nigeria, before returning again in fall of 1921. Nayyar left the colony once again in 1922 and was replaced by Al Hajj Fadl-ul-Rahman Hakim, as the first permanent missionary to Ghana. In 1923, Hakim started an elementary school in Saltpond. Further primary schools were opened in a number of other towns and villages, such as in Mumford and Potsin, all in the coastal regions. By 1927, the Community numbered 3,000 across forty localities in the southern regions and the Ashanti Empire. In 1927, an increased missionary outlook was adopted, which facilitated its spread among the Fante people in the south, the Wala people in the north, and the Ashanti people in between. In 1929, Hakim left the colony, only to return again in 1933, for another two years. According to Samwini, the rapid expansion posed a threat to the very existence of Christianity and the Sunni order in the country. Al Hajj Fadl-ul-Rahman Hakim was the first permanent Ahmadi Muslim missionary in the Gold Coast. =Early twentieth century= Leading up to the 1950s, the presence of the Ahmadiyya movement was strongly felt throughout modern Ghana, stretching from the coastal towns, through to Kumasi, and up to Wa in the Upper West region and also among the Dagbon regions in the northeast. For the first decade, the Ahmadiyya mission had only a single missionary at any one time, supported by a Fante interpreter. During the 1920s, Hakim conducted open-air lectures across notable locations along the southern coast. In his efforts he adopted the Quran and the Bible. Many of these discussions revolved around the death of Jesus, a perspective at odds with the non-Ahmadi Muslim and Christian populations of Ghana. Titles included \\"The Bible Shows Jesus did not die on the cross\\" and \\"Jesus did not die on the cross, nor is he sitting alive in the fourth heaven at the right hand of God.\\" Such polemics, on the one hand, were a cause of confusion for the Christian peasants in the southern regions and on the other hand created a negative relationship between Hakim and some Christians. In some cases, polemics induced intra-religious violence directed towards Ahmadis. From the very beginning, the Ahmadiyya movement adopted Western-style education system and at the same time advocated for Islamic curriculum. In 1928, the Community requested the colonial government for permission to build a mosque and a secondary school in Kumasi. However, the government rejected the application, on the basis that there already existed a Muslim mosque and a school in the region. The following year, another letter was sent with over 400 signatures from Asante members of the Community. With small number of Muslims being admitted to public schools, the Community petitioned the government, in 1931, to select Muslim members for the government's board of education. Another letter was written in 1946 to the Chief Commission of Ashanti, arguing that most rights and privileges are being afforded to Christians. It was not until 1950 that the colonial government first gave permission to establish an Ahmadiyya school in the Ashanti Empire. The T.I. Ahmadiyya Senior High School in Kumasi was founded on January 50, 1950. As a consequence of the Community‚Äôs missionary efforts, its claim towards its representation of Islam, and perhaps also because of its cooperation with the reigning colonial administration, the Community faced intolerance from certain locals and religious leaders, particularly by the Wala clerics who sometimes adopted a confrontational attitude towards the Ahmadi Muslims. In 1932, a Suwarian religious scholar, Salih bin Hassan, originally from Wa, was teaching in Amumoso, a village, roughly nine miles from Kumasi. He inadvertently confronted a crowd of people gathered around a preacher, Nazir Ahmad Ali, who was to later become a pioneering missionary in Sierra Leone. Whilst Ali was preaching, a chief requested Salih to judge the message brought by Ali. With the exception of two things, which \\"held his throat\\", Salih found that the message coincided with the teachings of the Quran. He debated Ali on certain issues, but, a month later, he went to Saltpond to join the Ahmadiyya movement himself. Afterwards, he returned to his business, converting a number of his students and six of his Wala trade partners. In the same year, in 1932, Salih sent three of his colleagues to Wa, perhaps on a preaching mission. In June, the three were summoned to the ruler of Wa, Wa Na Pelpuo, and the chief Imam, Wa Limam Muhammad bin Uthman Dun. The Wala leaders expelled the Ahmadis from Wa, on hearing their views. In 1934, Salih himself attempted to introduce the Ahmadiyya teachings in the town. In response, restrictions were placed on him and his family; he was not permitted to leave his house and his family was placed under surveillance. However Salih managed to escape. It was not until 1936, that he returned to Wa, and as a consequence, the Ahmadiyya presence was strengthened but, on the other hand, Wa became a divided town, with little relationship between Wala‚Äôs members of Sunni and Ahmadi faiths. Nevertheless, Salih‚Äôs success in Wa led to his appointment as a preacher and a missionary for the entirety of Ahmadiyya in Ghana. The presence of the Ahmadiyya movement in Wa exasperated the Sunni Muslims of Wa to the extent that in the 1940s, the district commissioner began to negotiate with the missionary in-charge of Ghana, Maulvi Nazir Mobashir, the relocation of the Wala Ahmadis. Mobashir accepted the relocation, under certain conditions. However, Salih interjected and refused the offer and the plan did not go ahead. In 1949, Wala tradition appointed Mumuni Koray, a 1929 Ahmadi convert, as the Wa Na, the ruler of the Wa. Three years later, in 1951, Koray rejected Wa Limam Alhaj Sa‚Äôid Soribo, a Sunni Muslim, and instead appointed Salih as the Wa Limam, the chief Imam of the Wala people. This further agitated the Wala Sunni Muslims. However, Koray died in 1953, and the office reverted to a Sunni ruler. Two years later, Salih was removed from the Imamate. In a separate development, in the year 1939, through Salih‚Äôs efforts a mission house was established outside Tamale in Dagbon, within the northern regions. The Ahmadis particularly targeted the Muslim populations in their preaching efforts. They engaged in debates with the Sunni Muslims and the Tijaniyyah Muslims to the extent that the Tamale‚Äôs Muslims felt that their faith was threatened. As a consequence, a highly antagonistic position was adopted whereby the Ahmadi preachers were chased and stoned out of the town whenever the missionaries attempted to preach in the town. In comparison to the Ahmadiyya missions in Wa, the Ahmadis had little influence in Tamale in the early decades of its presence. =Late twentieth century= Abdul Wahab Adam was the head and missionary-in-charge of the Ahmadiyya movement in Ghana, until his death in 2014. Muhammad bin Salih is the current head of the movement. On August 10, 1974, Abdul Wahab Adam was appointed as the Amir (Head) and missionary-in-charge of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission of Ghana by the then caliph of the Ahmadiyya movement, Mirza Nasir Ahmad. Adam was the first indigenous Ghanaian to hold this office. In the early part of his ministry, Adam shifted the headquarters of the Ghanaian Ahmadiyya Muslim Community from Saltpond to the capital of the country, Accra. The move came in response to Accra's growing economic and political influence in the country, which strongly contrasts with Saltpond, a small unknown town in coastal Ghana. During the late twentieth century, the Ahmadi missionaries increasingly diverted their attention towards the Christian populations of the country. A large number of books, fliers and audio cassettes were published to meet the new objective. Articles published and public preaching sessions included titles such as, \\"Jesus Will not Come Again\\", \\"Jesus:Son of God or God?\\" and \\"50,000 errors in the Bible\\". Perhaps as a result of this, the Ahmadi Muslim teachings, and particularly its eschatological doctrines have been the most difficult theological challenge the Ghanaian Christians may have encountered since the late twentieth century. The Ahmadi Muslim missionaries, often seen as successful preachers by some locals, who adopt the Bible and Quran in their preaching efforts, have resulted in many Christian evangelists to adopt the two books as well. Another notable consequence is that, since 1964, the Christian denominations in Ghana have come to increasingly recognize the presence of Muslims as important and noticeable members of the Ghanaian society. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community significantly increased its social and humanitarian efforts in Ghana. Perhaps the most decisive was the visit to the Gambia by the then Caliph Hadhrat Mirza Nasir Ahmad, whose visit in 1970 was instrumental in the launch of the Nusrat Jahan Scheme Tahrik e Jadid Rabwah Paksitan which has been responsible for the establishment of a number of schools and hospitals all over West Africa. It has also been argued that besides the Nusrat Jahan Scheme, local missionaries and leaders boosted their efforts in humanitarian activities as well, to \\"restore the glory of Islam.\\" While opening the fourth Ahmadiyya hospital in the country in 1971, at Agona Swedru, Central Region, Basharat Ahmad Basir, a leading Ahmadiyya missionary stated that, \\"opening hospitals and educational facilities in the country was part of the programme of the Movement to regain the lost heritage and glory of Islam.\\" Demographics By 1927, Ahmadi Muslims were estimated to number 3,000 across the southern regions of Ghana. In comparison, among the northern regions, the city of Wa had roughly 100 Ahmadi Muslim, within five years of its existence. By 1948, Ahmadis were estimated to number over 22,000 and in the 1960 census Ahmadi Muslims were estimated at 175,620. According to Samwini, by the year 2000, the Ahmadiyya movement placed \\"itself and Islam in a centrally prominent position in Ghana\\". In 2010, Pew Research Center estimated Ahmadi Muslims at 16 percent of Ghana's Muslims, thereby representing the largest proportion of Ahmadis to Muslims in any known country. Taking into account census figures for the Muslim population, this corresponds to roughly 635,000 Ahmadi Muslims. However, the Coalition of Muslim Organizations maintain that the final census figures \\"contained serious flaws and as a result could not be used as reliable data for planning and projecting the country‚Äôs development agenda.\\" Some estimates place Muslim population at over twice the figure presented by the census, which can give a corresponding Ahmadi population figure of almost 2 million.Ghana's Muslims have previously raised concern over the census figures which states that 17% of Ghanaians belong to the Muslim faith. It is claimed that Muslims represent somewhere between 30 and 45% of Ghana. Under this, the Ahmadiyya population would number almost 2 million. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community itself gives an estimate of over 2 million Ahmadis in Ghana. See: *\\"Muslims cry foul over population figures\\". News From Africa. Retrieved April 30, 2014. (ref 8) *Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques around the World. p. 70 (ref 11) During the first decade of the Ahmadiyya movement in modern-day Ghana, the Ahmadiyya mission had only a single Indian missionary at any one time, supported by a Fante interpreter. By 1946, there were up to three Indian missionaries and five West African missionaries, and four teachers in the country. After almost 15 years, by 1961, there were 21 West African missionaries, and only four foreign ones. Modern community Ahmadiyya University of Theology and Languages in Mankessim, near Saltpond. By 1961, there were 161 mosques and over 20 schools in Ghana. Today, the Ahmadiyya movement maintains a large number of schools, colleges and health facilities across Ghana. There are also a large number of Ahmadi mosques, including one missionary training college in Mankessim, near Saltpond, in the Central Region. A significant number the Muslims who hold prominent offices in politics, civil service, academia, and education in the country, are Ahmadi Muslims. Unlike a number of Muslim- majority countries where the hostile attitude towards Ahmadi Muslims generates a negative relationship with the Sunni Muslims, there exists a level of cooperation between the two sects in Ghana. The national Hilal Committee comprises members from the Office of the Chief Imam of Ghana as well as leading figures of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, Ghana. The date for Ramadhan is set upon a joint declaration by the Chief Imam and the Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission. However, due to various theological reasons, the two groups do not pray in congregation with each other.

It lies where the Upper Yorke Road from Kulpara to Bute is crossed by the road from Paskeville to Lochiel. The dominant industry is broadacre grain and sheep farming. History The area of Ninnes Plain was settled by the early 1860s and the Hundred of Ninnes was proclaimed in 1874. In 1976 a bushfire started in the Hummock Range and tore westwards through Ninnes Plain towards Green Plain, near the present-day township of Paskeville. According to local reportage at the time the fire was so fierce that the townships of Wallaroo and Kadina, more than distant, were illuminated at night by the fire's glow. The District Council of Ninnes was established in 1885 and adopted a former accommodation house as a council chamber. The council chamber would also be used as a school until a separate building was constructed six years later. Ninnes Post Office opened on 1 November 1882; its date of closure is unknown. In 1910, it was reported that \\"while Ninnes...cannot claim to have built a town, and it is easy to count its public buildings, it is not backward in other things\\", citing the \\"substantially built and commodious homesteads\\" and that as one of \\"the outlying districts which support the towns, it is enjoying prosperity\\". The council seat subsequently moved to Bute, which had far outgrown Ninnes, and the council was renamed Bute in 1933. The modern locality of Ninnes was established in 1998 when boundaries were formalised for \\"the long established local name\\". An additional area within Wakefield Regional Council was added to the locality in 2000, but removed and added to Lochiel in 2007 following requests from local residents.

Unafraid of controversy in his printing he was in court multiple times and imprisoned at least once.A Dictionary of Printers and Printing: C H Timperley Sir Walter Scott discusses Watson‚Äôs collection of ancient poetry, the Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scottish Poems, in Popular Poetry (part of Poetical Works).Reliquiae Trotcosienses: Sir Walter Scott Robert Burns was also heavily influenced by Watson‚Äôs collection of old poems, both in content and presentation. Watson‚Äôs History of Printing (1713) is also seen as a milestone in printing history. James Watson senior James‚Äô father, also James Watson was a merchant turned printer in Aberdeen. He had met and married his Dutch wife whilst on a trade visit to Holland. Her family was clearly of considerable wealth as records state that her father loaned money to Charles II during his exile to Holland. Although it is recorded that this debt was never truly repaid it gave leverage to the father in his obtaining of some degree of monopoly to printing in Scotland (despite existing patents being in place in favour of Andrew Anderson). However, on the King‚Äôs reinstatement this allowed a mutual benefit in permitting the King to have a pro-Catholic printer at his disposal, and Watson was installed at Holyrood Palace to print from there (probably also having accommodation on site for his whole family).Dictionary of National Biography: James Watson (d.1722) James was given a 40-year monopoly on royal printing in 1671 (but did not live to its conclusion).Scottish Historical Review: April 1910 James (senior) is often referred to as Papish Watson or The Popish Printer. His most noted publication of non-political alignment is probably The Hind and the Panther, John Dryden‚Äôs major poem, printed at Holyrood Palace in 1687. His most noted print directly related to the royal self-projection was Prognostications by King James II (VII of Scotland).A Dictionary of Printers and Printing (p.569, by C H Timperley He had an impressive salary of ¬£1001 per year (paid direct by the king) and died in 1687. Life of James Watson the younger Mary King's Close where Watson had his first printworks He was born in Aberdeen around 1664 and educated at Aberdeen High School and Aberdeen University. He moved with his family to Edinburgh in 1685. He appears to have largely filled his father‚Äôs shoes following his death in 1687 but disappears from records, probably going to Holland to train further and gather more sophisticated presses and modern typefaces. Curiously, the Edinburgh Privy Council had issued an edict in 1687 preventing printers printing without a license (for each specific work), but specifically exempted James Watson from this requirement. This may have been a dictat imposed upon the Council by the monarch, given Watson‚Äôs connections. Watson had inherited two printworks on the Royal Mile whom his father had lent large sums to Dutch men which had not been repaid. From 1694 he reappears using one of these properties: a small printworks on Mary King's Close. In 1695 he moved to a printworks on Warriston Close and then again to a printworks on Craigs Close: presumably the larger of the two premises which he already owned. The final premises is referred to in documents as The Kings Printing House. Probably wishing to distance himself from his father‚Äôs known Catholic sympathies he publicly renounced Catholicism, thus allowing himself more public freedoms. Officially he was Episcopalian rather than Presbyterian. In reality he was at best an agnostic but continued to have clear Catholic sympathies in much of his printing. It was noted that on Royal Proclamations (which should have been his duty to publish) he picked which ones suited his own viewpoints, such that these were often privately published for the Edinburgh area. Rivals (including Anderson‚Äôs widow) frequently accused him of Papish and Jacobite sympathies. His early work though concentrated on medical and school textbooks and legal work. He had also tried printing the Bible but ended up in court due to the legal restrictions limiting who was allowed to publish these.Dictionary of National Biography: James Watson, printer His most memorable act was the publishing of a pamphlet criticising the government during the Darien expedition scandal in 1700. Whilst the co-accused, Hugh Paterson (a surgeon-apothecary also owning a printworks) was the printer of the more famous of the three problematic pamphlets created, Scotland‚Äôs Grievances Relating to Darien, Watson wrote and printed a shorter version of this The People of Scotland‚Äôs Groans and Lamentable Complaints made up of Extracts from Scotland‚Äôs Grievances. Watson‚Äôs pamphlet also included inflammatory remarks regarding the king not being the legitimate king, which would have further angered authorities. Both men were called to appear before court early in June 1700 and held at the Tolbooth but then released on bail. The court heard their petitions on 13 June 1700. Watson pleaded that his actions were caused by his \\"numerous family\\" and \\"poor circumstances\\" which had forced him to print for financial reward. The court, led by Sir James Stewart, did not accept this and set as date for later trial. The two men were officially imprisoned in the Tolbooth awaiting the judgement. Meanwhile, events at Darien led the public to riot and sympathises ran high with Watson and Paterson. On 20 June a crowd surrounded the Lord Advocates house and forced him to write a warrant for the men‚Äôs release, which he did. This action was overtaken by other events. Four men broke into the Tolbooth and forced (using a dagger or bayonet) the guards to release Watson and Paterson (plus other prisoners on minor charges).Scottish Historical Review, April 1900 Watson and Paterson were re-arrested on 25 June 1700. Watson employed John Spottiswoode as his counsel but gave no defence. The much-irritated judge found them guilty on the charge of seditious literature and sentenced each to banishment from the city (for a radius of ten miles) for a period of one year and a day. Infringement of this ban brought a fine of ¬£10 per occurrence. The four men who released them from the Tolbooth were found guilty on various charges on 22 July 1700 and ironically found themselves behind bars in the Tolbooth. Watson observed the ban and moved to the Gorbals in south Glasgow. Watson petitioned the court in March 1701 for an early return to protect the financial interests of his business. His exact return is not recorded but thereafter he appears to have focussed upon newspaper production rather than pamphlets. From 1701 to 1716 he is recorded in a series of legal disputes with Mrs Agnes Campbell, widow of his rival pamphleteer printer, Andrew Anderson, who was the only authorised printer of pamphlets and Bibles in Edinburgh, but Watson appears to have continually ignored this monopoly. However, his printing interests began drifting to newspapers, which were less rigidly controlled. He had earlier (1699) set up the initial publishing of the Edinburgh Gazette which ran only 41 issues before a dispute with its editor, but his experience led to his self-creation of the Edinburgh Courant published thrice weekly from 19 February 1705. He also began a series of other newspapers and journals.Dictionary of National Biography: James Watson (d.1722) In 1704 Watson is recorded as meeting with Evander MacIver and George Ker, both papermakers, regarding general improvements to production quality. From 1706 he begins using more contemporary typefaces in an attempt to modernise the Scottish printing industry. In 1706 he collected and published the hugely popular Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scottish Poems, of later influence on Ramsay, Fergusson, Scott and Burns. His growing success led him to open a bookshop (independent of his printworks) next to the Red Lion Tavern on the Royal Mile near St Giles Cathedral. In 1711 his business acquired a new legitimacy, being granted a Royal Patent by Queen Anne allowing him to publish major controlled items such as Bibles. One result of this was his Crown Bible of 1715, published in 8 volumes after several years of work and described as ‚Äúa matchless beauty‚Äù.A Dictionary of Printers and Printing: C H Timperley He died on 22 September 1722 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 His estate following death was a staggering ¬£32,000 the equivalent of a modern-day multi-millionaire.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: James Watson, printer This entire sum fell to his second wife.Scottish National Archive: will CC 8/8/88 Family James had a brother, Patrick Watson, also a printer, apprenticed to George Mosman, printer in Edinburgh. Patrick ended in court accused of stealing tools and type-face to pass to James in 1698. This was found not proven but continuation of the apprenticeship proved impossible and the sum paid for this to Mosman (¬£100) had to be repaid.Scottish Historical Review: April 1910 In 1700 an Alexander Watson, printer is noted, burying his child at Greyfriars Kirkyard, and may also be related. Watson‚Äôs son, again James Watson, attended the High School in Edinburgh and Edinburgh University and was then sent abroad to study printing (again probably Holland), however he died in his youth and did not follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps.

Written by Margaret Oberman, the film is about a single mom who gets a holiday job as a department store Santa to pay her rent. An angel (Wallace Shawn) enters her life and brings about some positive changes, including the spark of a new romance.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4177742/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 The film premiered on the Hallmark Channel on December 7, 2014.  Plot  With the holiday season at hand, single mom Nicky Talbot (Alicia Witt) is unemployed and struggling to afford a nice Christmas with her 8-year-old daughter Becky (T.J. McGibbon). Hearing that Cartwright's Department Store is hiring temporary holiday help, Nicky rushes in to apply, but is rejected by Senior VP Fiona Aldrich (Gabrielle Miller), who considers Nicky a threat to the relationship she hopes to have with Bill (Gabriel Hogan), a charming and handsome store manager. In a whimsical turn of events, Harry Osbourne (Wallace Shawn), claiming to be a consultant from corporate headquarters, encourages Nicky to dress up and begin working as Cartwright's store Santa Claus. The Santa job provides some much needed income but it proves hard to keep the secret that Santa is a woman. Later, Nicky and Becky run into Bill while Christmas Tree shopping, who helps them getting their tree. While Nicky is sitting down for lunch at work in her Santa costume, Bill sits at the table in front of her and starts a conversation. He tells Nicky that he is single but found a great single mom that he is interested in. With Nicky making more money, she is able to pay her rent on time and buy Becky a spelling game to help her with her spelling. Becky tells her teacher this and her teacher tells Becky that she is going to give her free tutoring, but Becky wants to keep it a secret from her mom so she can surprise her. Nicky and Bill run into each other again on the elevator at work this time with Nicky not in her Santa costume, where Bill asks Nicky out on a date. Nicky shares this with her friend and wants to confess that she is Santa. Nicky and her friend come up with a plan that her friend will call her during the date and if Nicky is feeling like she needs rescuing that she will act like it's the babysitter calling and she needs to go. On Nicky's and Bill's date everything is going fine until Bill asks about what position she got with the company, Nicky replies that it's just a temporary holiday job. Nicky tries to shift the conversation back onto Bill but then Bill wants to get to know Nicky even more. She gets a call from her friend as planned and feeling the pressure from the conversation she says it's the babysitter and needs to go. Nicky arriving at home says that it was a disaster and she called at the right time. She felt bad that she couldn't tell Bill the truth about being Santa. At work Nicky makes a kid feel happy after his best friend moved away. Becky gets a better grade on her spelling test and takes in the book The Night Before Christmas to school, as she wants to read it to her mom without messing up as a present to her. At work Bill is sitting at the table in front of Nicky who is in her Santa costume once again. Bill is talking with some co-workers about maybe writing off Nicky because of her kind of blowing him off on their date. Bill then asks Santa what does he think and Santa (Nicky) asks if he wants to see her again, to which Bill says that he does and that he is going to give Nicky a second chance. Later at school, Becky's teacher says that she will take Becky with her to see the Christmas decorations. At work, Nicky is surprised that it is busier than usual. She again helps a kid feel happy. But then her Daughter Becky shows up and recognizes her as Santa. Becky runs off while Fiona watches. Harry catches up with Becky, who Becky recognizes as the angel from the coin. Harry tells Becky they need to have a chat about her mother. Harry brings Becky back to where her teacher is and Becky says she needs to say bye to Santa and gives Santa a hug. When Nicky arrives home, she and Becky talk about her being Santa with Becky being very understanding. Nicky asks Becky if Harry knows that she is Becky's mom and Becky crossing her fingers says no. Becky then tells her mom that angels are real, like the one on the coin. Nicky then calls Bill and apologizes for running off and asks him if they could try it again after Christmas on the 27th, and he agrees happily. Later at work, Harry gets a call from his boss and must leave for a brief time on another assignment. Fiona watches as Harry gives Nicky the news. Nicky is later caught in the Santa costume room by a co-worker while Fiona is trying to find the background check that was on her desk 5 different times. Nicky is then brought to Fiona's office accused of shop lifting a Santa suit. Bill then shows up in the office as well with a separate issue and sees Nicky saying that he didn't expect to see her until their next date. Fiona is mad that they went on a date and everyone finds out that Nicky is Santa. Nicky wants a chance to explain and Bill wants to hear what she has to say. Fiona says that Nicky has made Bill the biggest fool of all. Nicky says that Bill had no idea about this at all. And Bill confesses that he didn't know. Fiona says their store doesn't need the bad publicity and tells Nicky that she can just leave right now. Nicky is heart broken when leaving the store looking at the Santa chair that she use to sit in. At home with her friend and daughter Nicky is frustrated over losing her job and how happy Fiona was to fire her. Nicky feels she has made a mess of everything and feels that she lied and tricked everyone. Then there is a knock on the door. It's Nicky's landlord saying that she's on the news. They turn on the TV to see breaking news. The reporter is saying how just yesterday there were lines around the building to see the new Santa because this Santa touched their hearts and lives and many wanted to thank him but they are all gone now because Santa has been fired 4 days before Christmas because he was a she. The reporter continues saying that Santa was Nicky Talbot, a single mother of an 8-year-old daughter, unemployed and unable to pay for rent. Bill is in a coffee shop asking the barista to turn the news down and the barista says no, that Nicky is one of their regular customers. The reporter still going on about the story says not worried about herself but worried about her daughter Nicky took the job pretending to be a man. Wondering how they had so much information, her friend confesses that it was her who gave them the story. Peg shows up at Nicky's house with a pizza and Nicky apologizes for not telling her the truth and Peg accepts. Nicky goes to Cartwright's and sees Bill and apologizes for not being honest and explains how interested she was in him and that's why she wanted to go out. Bill was disappointed that Nicky didn't trust him enough to tell him the truth and walks away. Fiona is in trouble for firing Nicky and ends up getting fired by Mr. Cartwright. Nicky is then called into Mr. Cartwright's office and asked how she got the job and Nicky tells him that it was because of Harry. Mr. Cartwright says he has no idea who Harry is and Nicky examines the coin a bit closer noticing that Harry looks exactly like the face on the coin. She then says that she needs to go talk to her daughter. Becky tells her mom that Harry is an angel and was sent to help them. Another news story tells how Nicky got her job back. Nicky is then shown back at work and Bill is approached by Peg while at work to discuss Nicky. Bill acts like he doesn't want to ever hear about her. When Nicky is about to leave work on Christmas Eve night, Sara tells Nicky that Mr. Cartwright wants to see her. Mr. Cartwright with all the staff present offers Nicky Fiona's old job. Nicky happily accepts the offer and drinks egg nog with everyone. Bill congratulates Nicky on her new job. Nicky and her friend are then sitting on the door step under a warm blanket, drinking egg nog and talking. Nicky says she can't stop thinking about Bill. Later that night, Nicky and Becky are in the house by the Christmas tree when the door bell rings - it's Bill. He came over to tell Nicky that he misses talking to her and they kiss. Becky then asks her mother to pick a page out of the book 'Twas the Night Before Christmas where Becky starts to read to Nicky and Bill without missing any words. Becky tells her mom that she has been getting help from her teacher. Harry standing outside watching the heart warming scene tells his boss that his work here is done.http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/christmas-at-cartwrights/about  Cast  Alicia Witt as Nicky Talbot * Gabriel Hogan as Bill * Wallace Shawn as Harry Osbourne * T.J.

The attack was the opening engagement of Operation Compass a British raid which, if successful, would be followed up to try to expel the Italians from Egypt. Italy had declared war on France and Britain on 10 June and in the Italian invasion of Egypt (Operazione E) from 1940, the Italian 10th Army had reached Sidi Barrani and dug in to await the completion of the Via della Vittoria, an extension of the Via Balbia, being built from the frontier; the Maletti Group garrisoned a camp at Nibeiwa, south of the port of Sidi Barrani. The British had fought a delaying action during the Italian advance with the 7th Support Group of the 7th Armoured Division and kept their main force at the railhead of Mersa Matruh about east of Sidi Barrani. The British probed the Italian defences continually and then planned a five-day raid on the Italian camps, which had been built in an arc from the coast at Maktila to Sofafi in the south-west on the inland escarpment. The British intended to advance into the Nibeiwa‚ÄìRabia gap and attack Nibeiwa from the west and if this attack succeeded, move on to attack the camps at Tummar West and Tummar East. The tanks of the 7th Armoured Division would form a defensive screen to the west to intercept a counter- attack and to protect the flank of the 4th Indian Infantry Division as it attacked the camps. The British and Indian infantry rehearsed an attack with the tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment in late November and another rehearsal was announced for early December, which was actually the attack. On the night of 9/10 December the attack began with diversions on the east side as the main force closed up from the west. The real attack took the Italians by surprise, destroyed the 28 tanks before their crews could react and then broke into the camp. The Italian and Libyan garrison resisted the attack with great determination but were systematically overrun by a combination of tanks, artillery firing from point-blank range and infantry. The Italian and Libyan troops suffered 4,157 casualties for a British loss of 56 men killed and 27 tanks disabled or broken down. The success at Nibeiwa began the collapse of the Italian position in Egypt.  Background  =Italian invasion of Egypt= The Italian invasion of Egypt by the Italian 10th Army began against the Western Desert Force on 13 September 1940, after several days of operations on the Italian side of the border to push back British troops. The original goal of the offensive had been an advance by the 10th Army from Italian Libya along the Egyptian coast to the Suez Canal. After numerous delays, the aim of the offensive was reduced to the capture of the port of Sidi Barrani, an advance of about . Two divisions of the 10th Army advanced and met screening forces of the 7th Support Group (7th Armoured Division) which fell back slowly from Sollum. On 16 September, the 10th Army halted and took up defensive positions around Sidi Barrani, to build fortified camps while the Via Balbia was extended by the Via della Vittoria. Once the road was built and supplies accumulated, an advance on Mersa Matruh, about further east was to begin. Camps were built from Maktila with the 1st Libyan Division, east of Sidi Barrani, south through Tummars (east and west, 2nd Libyan Division), to Nibeiwa (Maletti Group) thence to four camps at Sofafi to the south-west, on the escarpment above the coastal strip. Blackshirt divisions held Sidi Barrani and Sollum; a metropolitan division garrisoned Buq Buq. Italian engineers worked on a new road from Fort Capuzzo through Sollum to Buq Buq, close to Sidi Barrani and a water pipe from Bardia. In December the 10th Army in Egypt had about and =Western Desert Force= The British Middle East Command (General Archibald Wavell) had in Egypt and Palestine about Commonwealth and Free French soldiers, and in two squadrons of Hurricanes, one of Gloster Gladiators, three of Bristol Blenheims, three of Vickers Wellingtons and one of Bristol Bombays, about and The Western Desert Force (WDF, Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor) comprised the 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse) and the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Sir Michael O'Moore Creagh). The British had some fast Cruiser Mk I, Cruiser Mk II and Cruiser Mk III tanks with 2-pounder guns, which were superior to Italian M11/39 tanks. The British also had a battalion Matilda II infantry tanks that, while slow, carried the 2-pounder and armour that was impervious to Italian anti-tank guns and field guns. =Maletti Group= The I Medium Tank Battalion (Major Victor Ceva) and the II Medium Tank Battalion (Major Eugenio Campanile) and their M11/39 tanks of the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment in Italy had landed in Libya on 8 July 1940 and transferred to the command of the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment. The two battalions had an establishment of and each. The medium tanks reinforced the already in Libya. The Maletti Group/ (General Pietro Maletti) was formed at Derna the same day, with seven Libyan motorised infantry battalions, a company of M11/39 tanks, a company of L3/33 tankettes, motorised artillery and supply units as the main motorised unit of the 10th Army and the first combined arms unit in North Africa. Prelude =Nibeiwa= Nibeiwa was about south of Sidi Barrani; the camp was a double stone walled rectangle about , with shelters every behind an anti-tank trench and a minefield, which had a gap to the north-west to allow easier access for supply trucks. The 10th Army began to prepare an advance to Mersa Matruh for 16 December. Only the IX Light Tank Battalion with L3/33 tankettes attached to the 2nd Libyan Division Pescatori, the II Medium Tank Battalion with M11/39s, with the Maletti Group at Nibeiwa camp and the LXIII and XX Light Tank battalions, with the XXI Corps HQ, were still in Egypt. The five fortified camps from the coast to the escarpment were well defended but too far apart for overlapping fields of fire and the defenders relied on ground and air patrols to link the camps and watch the British. Italian air reconnaissance spotted British vehicle movements in the area but Maletti was apparently not informed. On 8 December, Maletti alerted the nearby 2nd Libyan Division Pescatori that unusual low-level flying by the RAF was probably intended disguise the movement of armoured units. At on 9 December, Maletti contacted the commanders of the 1st Libyan Division Sibelle and the 2nd Libyan Division Pescatori, reporting British preparatory movements. =British plan= Training Exercise No 1 was held from near Matruh, on a model marked to resemble the Italian camps at Nibeiwa and the Tummars and the troops were told that another rehearsal would be run in early December. The exercise was useful in providing experience in night moves under moonlight and attack tactics against a defensive position in the desert. A Method of Attack on an entrenched Camp in the Desert was distributed to units ready for Training Exercise No 2. The 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division were reinforced with the British 16th Infantry Brigade, the 7th RTR and the Matruh Garrison Force of a Coldstream Guards battalion and a battery of field artillery; the 7th Indian Brigade was to act as a reserve and protect the lines of communication. Guarded by the Support Group, the rest of 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division were to drive between Nibeiwa and the Sofafi camps and then attack Nibeiwa from the west with the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade (Colonel Reginald Savory) and 47 Matilda II tanks of the 7th RTR. The cruiser tanks of the 7th Armoured Division were to prevent a counter- attack from Sofafi and cover the left flank of the 4th Indian Division once Nibewa had been captured the attackers would move on to the Tummars. Each division was to have a field supply depot about west of Matruh, which were elaborately camouflaged and filled sufficient for five days' operations and two-day's supply of water. If the attack succeeded, the 7th Armoured Division tanks were to drive north to cut the Italian line of retreat from Sidi Barrani while the Indians captured the other camps near the port. Maktila was to be cut off by the Matruh Garrison Force and the tanks were to drive for Buq Buq to cut of the retreat of the garrison to Sollum. On the night of 6/7 December, the 4th Indian Division left camp for Training Exercise No 2 in a cold wind that raised dust and concealed the lorries of the 4th and 6th New Zealand Reserve Mechanical Transport companies as they drove spread out over the desert, in air formation (no lorry to be within of another). After driving for the force rendezvoused at Bir Kenayis, about south of Matruh and dug slit trenches. The troops rested on 7 December, unseen by Italian air reconnaissance and were told that the attack was the real one that evening. On 8 December, the advance continued into a bright, cold windless day, at about at the front and in bursts at the back, everyone expecting to be attacked by Italian aircraft, none of which appeared. By late afternoon the Indians were south-east of Nibeiwa, west of their jumping-off point. At dusk two battalions of the 11th Indian Brigade and the 7th RTR moved off and drove in moonlight to a position south-west of Nibeiwa; before sunrise the units assembled at a jumping-off point north-west of the camp. The third battalion drove about short of the east side of the camp, which was on a flat plateau with a shallow valley on that side. Battle British aircraft bombed the camps and flew overhead all night, to disguise the sound of the ground force vehicles and to keep Italian aircraft grounded. At after the Indians had advanced on foot to the perimeter, they came upon listening posts and commenced firing, at which the Italian garrison sent up flares and returned fire. When the garrison ceased firing, the Indians shifted position and fired again, Under cover of the noise on the east side of Nibeiwa the British tanks and lorries drove round the west side of the camp and at the Indians on the east side retired. A bombardment by British artillery began from the east, to mislead the Italians. At the artillery of the 4th Indian Division fired on Nibewa from the south- east, around and at the tanks began the attack with the 31st Field Battery RA and flanked by the Bren Carrier platoons of the Indian infantry. The Italians had concentrated their 28 M11/39 tanks beyond the perimeter wall, where the tank crews were caught while warming engines. The Italian tank crews had no time to react before their tanks were knocked out. The British tanks broke down the walls and drove into the camp, where the Italians had just breakfasted; Maletti advanced with a machine-gun and was killed by a gunshot wound. At the British and Indian infantry followed up on board lorries, which stopped away for the men to disembark and charge into the camp. The Italian and Libyan artillerymen stood by their guns but found that even field artillery shells fired at range were ineffective against the armour of the Matilda tanks. The Italian and Libyan infantry fought on and isolated parties stalked British tanks with hand grenades but the British methodically occupied the camp, tanks artillery and infantry co-operating to reduce isolated pockets of resistance. By the last Italian resistance was overcome and large amounts of supplies and water were discovered intact. Aftermath =Analysis= After the battle, Alan Moorehead, an Australian war correspondent, visited Nibeiwa after moving around destroyed lorries and Bren Carriers which had run onto mines and past square holes in the ground, which had been dug for machine-gun posts. Dead lay around the fort; derelict light tanks were at the west wall, where the Maletti Group had made its last stand. Other tanks were inside the camp facing in all directions. The capture of Nibeiwa camp cleared the way for the next stage of the British attack, when the remaining operational tanks and the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade moved west of the Tummar camps and the 16th Infantry Brigade closed up to the area vacated by the Indian brigade. The Western Desert Force completed the capture of the camps and captured Sidi Barrani, destroying two Italian divisions by 10 December as two more divisions were caught on the Mersa Matruh‚ÄìSidi Barrani road and forced to surrender. By the time that Sidi Barrani was captured on 11 December the WDF bag had increased to 38,300 prisoners, 73 tanks and 422 guns for a loss of 133 men killed, 387 wounded and eight missing. On 28 December, planning with photographs from reconnaissance aircraft and night patrol reports began for the capture of Bardia, which would not have the benefit of surprise like the attack on Nibeiwa, which had far less extensive defences and was too far from neighbouring camps to be supported. The defences of Bardia were reminiscent of the defensive structures used in the First World War and British artillery would be much more important than at Nibeiwa. The experience of the attack there was important for the plan to use a combination of shock, firepower, tanks and the mobility of the Infantry tanks to break into the port defences. =Casualties= In 1954, the British official historian I. S. O. Playfair wrote that the attackers took and Libyan prisoners and a large quantity of supplies and water for a British loss of In 1979 the Italian official history gave a total of and Libyan soldiers killed along with Maletti and =Subsequent operations= The attack on Tummar West began at after the 7th RTR had refuelled and artillery had bombarded the defences for an hour. Another north-west approach was made, the tanks broke through the perimeter and were followed twenty minutes later by the infantry. The defenders held out for longer than the Nibeiwa garrison but by Tummar West was overrun except for the northeastern corner. The tanks moved on to Tummar East, the greater part of which was captured by nightfall. The 4th Armoured Brigade had advanced to Azziziya, where the garrison of surrendered, light patrols of the 7th Hussars pushed forward to cut the road from Sidi Barrani to Buq Buq, while armoured cars of the 11th Hussars ranged further west. The 7th Armoured Brigade were held in reserve ready to intercept an Italian counter-attack. The 2nd Libyan Division lost and killed, and wounded, with the survivors being taken prisoner.

Similar procedures in other countries of the UK are called child practice reviews in Wales, case management reviews in Northern Ireland, and significant case reviews in Scotland. An SCR should be held if abuse or neglect is suspected to have been involved, a child has died or been seriously harmed and if there are concerns about the way organisations or professionals worked together to safeguard the child.

History Ward was born in Philadelphia in 1871, and arrived in Australia as an actor, first appearing in June 1899 at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney in the Hoyt ‚Äì McKee company's production of A Stranger in New York, which toured extensively throughout Australia to rave reviews. The company returned to America after playing New Zealand in February 1900, all except Ward, who had been offered a contract by J. C. Williamson. He visited London in 1903, playing at Drury Lane with the Arthur Collins company, played at New York for the notorious Klaw and Erlanger, then returned to Australia in 1906. He produced a number of plays for George Willoughby. In 1909 he formed a company of his own, which toured India, Burma and China for Allan Hamilton and, reportedly, displayed a gift for publicity stunts by faking the abduction of a princess, before returning to Australia, where he is made his \\"last appearance on stage\\" on 4 March 1910, in a revival of The Man from Mexico, though Melba-like, he made another farewell appearance in The Girl from Rector's in Brisbane in March 1911. He joined \\"The Firm\\" of J. C. Williamson in 1908, for whom he worked with considerable success as a managing director. On the death of Williamson in July 1913 he became chairman of directors. He announced his resignation in March 1922 to form his own management business, Hugh J. Ward Theatres. Ltd., in association with the Fuller brothers. He was a notable fundraiser for patriotic causes during the First World War, and in recognition of his aid to Belgium he was made Knight of the Order of Leopold II. He became a naturalised Australian in 1922,Martha Rutledge, 'Ward, Hugh Joseph (1871‚Äì1941)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1990, accessed online 31 December 2015. and his obituaries report him as receiving an OBE, though he had hoped for a knighthood, but this is hard to verify and must surely be fictitious. He retired from the theatre in September 1926, but maintained a high public profile until shortly before his death of heart failure in 1941. He was notable as an organizer of activities in conjunction with the Sydney sesquicentenary celebrations in 1938. Tributes Ward was a blue-eyed handsome, benevolent, outgoing fellow, a raconteur with a ready wit, who could entertain his friends for hours with anecdotes of the stage and performers. On his death E. J. Tait, managing director of J. C. Williamson, Ltd., paid tribute to him as \\"... 100 per cent, in earnest all through his career, and never appeared in a \\"flop\\", except The Emerald Isle .... The longer I knew him, the more I admired his strength and great will-power. The theatre will sadly miss him.\\" John Fuller said of Ward \\"... he was a gentleman in every respect, and a noteworthy judge of things theatrical. He had associated himself with everything that was cultural and beautiful in the life of this country. He had been a great and noble citizen.\\" The theatre critic of the Sydney Morning Herald, calling him a \\"picturesque theatrical personality\\" praised his public-spiritedness and dedication to his craft. Performances He was a clever and agile dancer, described as an early Fred Astaire. His \\"Scarecrow Dance\\" (perhaps invented by Johnny Coleman) A lively read, but a dubious source of information. received favorable reviews in New York and London, as well as in Sydney. Though appearing in many musicals, critics never mentioned his singing ability, though he must have been an adequate basso as he played in at least one Gilbert and Sullivan opera. Grace Palotta (1870 ‚Äì 21 February 1959) was the leading lady in most of these productions.

Original bridge The original bridge during construction in 1922 The original bridge in 2012 An older concrete arch bridge existed at the site from 1922 to 2015. This bridge was officially named the Beechwood Boulevard Bridge, but was generally referred to as the Greenfield Bridge. The bridge was constructed in 1921‚Äì1923. It was completed by December 1922, but some of the approaches still needed to be filled in. The final cost was $370,000.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \\"Boulevard Bridge To Be Opened to the Public This Month\\", December 9, 1922; page 1. The original bridge was in total length with a main span. By the late 1980s, the bridge had begun to decay. In September 1989 debris from the bridge impacted cars, injuring three people. By this point nets had been placed under the bridge.The Indiana Gazette \\"Chunks of Bridge Damage Cars\\" September 16, 1989; page 1 A city engineer said he suspected vandals may have thrown the concrete, but one of the drivers said they were watching the bridge after they were forced to stop and saw no one on the bridge.The Indiana Gazette \\"Chunks Fell Off Bridge, Says Driver\\" September 19, 1989; page 3. The decrepit condition of the bridge became \\"a national symbol of infrastructure failure\\" in the United States, and its poor condition was featured on 60 Minutes and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.Melissa Daniels, Greenfield Bridge, symbol of infrastructure decay, to be built anew, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (October 10, 2015). A makeshift 'bridge under a bridge' was constructed to prevent any falling debris that evaded the old bridge's nets from crashing onto I-376. The bridge was imploded on December 28, 2015 at 9:20 am. The inbound side of I-376 reopened to traffic on the 31st, a day ahead of schedule. However, the outbound side suffered damage despite a protective layer of dirt placed under the bridge for the implosion and its reopening was delayed. New bridge The replacement bridge opened to traffic on October 15, 2017. It is officially known as the Beechwood Boulevard (Greenfield) Bridge II. The new bridge cost $17.5 million to construct and was designed and engineered by HDR, Inc. The new bridge mimics the appearance of the original structure and many of the stone ornaments from the original bridge were restored and incorporated into it. The new bridge has wider lanes and sidewalks and a dedicated bicycle path. Its steel elements are painted green to reflect its connection to the community of Greenfield.

History  It has existed as a pub since 1738 and has been known as The Black Swan since 1776, although it may have been given this name earlier. However, the pub is more commonly known as The Dirty Duck. It is unclear where this name originates from. One reason could be that it was given this name by brewery families who played darts in the pub. Another reason could be that actors nicknamed it The Dirty Duck. It is the only pub in England which has a licence under its two names. According to the pub menu, the contemporary name, The Dirty Duck, was given to the establishment by American GIs, who were stationed across the river Avon, opposite this establishment, at a military camp during WW2. The pub was originally three buildings dating from the 15th century before becoming a single property. One of the buildings became a pub in 1738. A house next door was integrated into the pub in 1866 and in 1937 the pub was extended into a third property. The building has a Grade II listing, meaning it is of 'special interest'.  Royal Shakespeare Company connections & notable clientele  The Dirty Duck is located close to two Royal Shakespeare Company theatres, namely, the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and the Swan Theatre and is frequented by actors performing at the theatres and theatre critics. It is also a popular pub for theatregoers. As a result, it has become intrinsically linked to the RSC, described by The Telegraph as \\"the unofficial licensed extension of the Royal Shakespeare Company\\". Inside The Dirty Duck, there are many photos of well known actors who have performed at the RSC theatres and visited the pub including Judi Dench and Richard Burton and many of the photos have been signed. There is also a table signed by Judi Dench. Kylie Minogue once pulled a pint during a visit. Other notable visitors to The Dirty Duck include Laurence Olivier and Richard Attenborough. Actor Len Parish, who was a member of Frank Benson's acting company, wrote a poem in the pub called Stratford Ale.

The novel follows the motifs and plot framework of a Bildungsroman, exploring the development of the main character, Vera Stark. The novel is set during the early 1990s in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela. The novel focuses on Stark shedding personal ties to find her \\"true self\\" in a political cause: fighting apartheid as a civil rights lawyer. Her decisions also effect, her friends, a Black African family who had lived in political exile: Sibongile and Didymus Maqoma. The first printing of the novel included 60,000 copies.  Style  La Times Reviewer Richard Eder focused on the novel's political novel features, describing the novel as having hints of \\"Animal Farm foreboding\\". The novel uses the characters for exposition to create commentary on the new political situation of South Africa.  Critical reception  Reviews of the novel were mixed. New York Times Books reviewer Michiko Kakutani wrote a lukewarm review, describing the novel as successfully profiling Grodimer's \\"psychological insight\\" while \\"the attempt in these pages to render a more realistic post-apartheid South Africa frequently feels pat and contrived.\\" (emphasis original) Publisher's Weekly was generally positive, describing the novel as \\"occasionally overdetermined by too many parallels and patterns, Gordimer's novel is powerfully complex and startling in its insights.\\" The LA Times review focuses on the effective impact of the novel as an exploration of Vera's development in a new post-apartheid political environment: \\"\\"No One to Accompany Me,\\" alludes both to the waning of all white hegemonies, even that of heroic idealism, and the waning of old age.

The story follows the lives of the characters Kavya, Kuhu and Muskaan - the daughters of Divya, Pavitra and Bhoomi from the previous season.  Plot  Kuhu, Kavya and Muskaan live with their grandmother \\"Dadi Maa\\". Dadi Maa has always kept Kaavya at a distance and dislikes her since she is Divya's daughter who had pretended to be Bhoomi and whose first husband Yuvraj had murdered the entire Prajapati family. The family is shown to have fallen on hard times and barely scraping through. One day, after a boy meets with a road accident, Kavya stops a passing car asking for help. However, the owner is the rich businessman Samarth Ranawat who tells her off accusing her of being one of those poor people who try to defraud rich car owners for money. An angered Kavya slaps him but later that day discovers that Samarth is her new boss. Samarth appoints her his personal assistant making her work like a servant at his house. Kavya, who has taken a loan from the firm, is forced to work for Samarth and also clashes with his dominating older sister Bhairavi. Muskaan runs into a young boy named Sambhav. Sambhav begins pursuing Muskaan and after he buys her expensive gifts, they start dating secretly. Meanwhile, Samarth also falls in love with Muskaan at first sight. He sends Bhairavi with a marriage proposal to Muskaan's house but, unaware of Samarth's wealth and believing Sambhav to be more successful, Muskaan rejects the proposal leaving Samarth shocked. While helping Kavya with her office work, Muskaan discovers that Sambhav is Samarth's good-for-nothing nephew who is living off his uncle's wealth. She quickly ends her relationship with Sambhav and accepts Samarth's proposal. The wedding day is set for three days later. On the wedding day, Muskaan runs away and Bhairavi and Dadi Maa convince Kavya to marry Samarth. Right after the wedding rituals, a dejected Samarth is manipulated by Muskaan into thinking she was abducted and marries her at a temple and brings her home declaring her to be his wife. Kavya confronts Muskaan about her premarital affair but Samarth refuses to believe her and expresses his desire to give her a divorce so he can be with Muskaan. Dadi Maa and Bhairavi side with Kavya but Samarth is adamant. Muskaan goes missing the next day and Samarth quickly blames Kavya who is arrested by the police. Bhairavi's older son Shrenik supports Kavya and bails her out. Meanwhile, Sambhav is discovered injured outside a temple where he was attacked by Muskaan after she realised he did not have any money and decided to return to Samarth. Sambhav throws Kavya under the bus and decides to stay quiet to save himself. However, in her efforts to find Muskaan, Kavya discovers Muskaan's secret boyfriend was Sambhav and Samarth breaks all ties with him. Muskaan is discovered in an abandoned building and brought home where she pledges her love to Samarth who is cold towards her. Sambhav has a change of heart and warns Kavya about Muskaan's selfishness. Kavya and Samarth grow closer as he sees her selflessness and concern for everyone and feels confused about his feelings for her. He reveals to Kavya that he married Muskaan only because she looked like his dead wife Priya. Kavya overhears Muskaan discussing a plan over the phone and follows her to discover that Muskaan, Shrenik and Bhairavi have been working together to control Samarth's wealth and that Shrenik and Bhairave were responsible for the accident that killed Priya. Kavya is abducted by them and Samarth is drugged to be thrown off a cliff in a car. However, he bribes the hired thugs and manages to record Bhairavi's confession.

MER-25 was first reported in 1958, and was the first antiestrogen to be discovered. It has been described as \\"essentially devoid of estrogenic activity\\" and as having \\"very low estrogenic activity in all species tested\\". However, some estrogenic effects in the uterus have been observed, so it is not a pure antiestrogen (that is, a silent antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER)) but is, instead, technically a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). For all intents and purposes, it is a nearly pure antiestrogen, however. MER-25 produces antifertility effects in animals, and garnered interest as a potential hormonal contraceptive. However, clinical development was discontinued due to its low potency and the incidence of unacceptable central nervous system side effects, including hallucinations and psychotic episodes, with higher doses. Undesirable gastrointestinal side effects were also described. Prior to being discontinued, the drug was also administered by Roy Hertz to three patients with metastatic breast cancer and was found to provide relief from bone pain, presumably due to dissolution of bone metastases. This was the first such study of its kind of antiestrogen therapy for the treatment of breast cancer, and it led to the development of the highly successful tamoxifen for this indication a decade later. The drug was also evaluated for the purpose of ovulation induction and as a treatment of chronic mastitis and endometrial cancer before clinical development was stopped. MER-25, a simple triphenylethanol derivative, is closely related structurally to the triphenylethylene (TPE) group of SERMs, which includes clomifene and tamoxifen. The drug, a derivative of the cholesterol-lowering agent triparanol (MER-29) (which itself was derived from the estrogen chlorotrianisene (also known as TACE)), was originally being studied in animals at Merrell Dow as a treatment for coronary artery disease. Its antiestrogen properties were discovered serendipitously when a young research endocrinologist at the company named Leonard Lerner, who was employed to study nonsteroidal estrogen pharmacology, noted the structural similarity of MER-25 to estrogenic TPE derivatives and decided to test it for estrogenicity, only to find that it blocked the effects of estrogen instead. Lerner subsequently went on to be involved in the discovery of clomifene, the first considerably antiestrogenic TPE derivative to be characterized. The structure of clomifene is similar to that of its predecessor, MER-25. Clomifene is about 10-fold more potent than MER-25.

There is a rather curved thick shade of whitish suffusion from beneath the middle of the costa beyond the cell to the tornus, including three or four indistinct blackish dots in its upper portion. There are some indistinct small blackish dots on the terminal margin. The hindwings are dark grey.Exotic Microlepidoptera 1 (17): 536 References Category:Moths described in 1916 Category:Stenoma ","title":"Stenoma hydraena"},{"id":"48941761","text":"Ischioceratops is an extinct genus of small ceratopsian dinosaur that lived approximately 69 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period in what is now China. Ischioceratops was a small sized, moderately- built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore, whose total body length has been estimated to be about 2 meters. The ceratopsians were a group of dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which fed on vegetation and thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended approximately 66 million years ago, at which point they all became extinct. Its name means \\"ischium horned face\\", referring to the peculiar shape of the ischiatic bones. Ischioceratops existed in the Wangshi Group during the late Cretaceous. It lived alongside centrosaurines, saurolophines, and tyrannosaurines. The most common creatures in the formation were Sinoceratops and Zhuchengtyrannus. Description Restoration Ischioceratops is one of the few ceratopsian dinosaurs which is not known by the skull. The most peculiar traits were located in the ischium, which shows a unique morphology. Another characteristic of Ischioceratops was the presence of a caudal elevation in its proximal part, which is present also in Protoceratops, Koreaceratops and in a more similar way in Montanoceratops and Cerasinops. The taxon has been referred to Leptoceratopsidae and distinguished from other known leptoceratopsids based on the following combination of characters: nine sacral vertebrae, more than in any other known basal (non-ceratopsid) ceratopsian but fewer than in ceratopsids; the ischium has a robust shaft that resembles that of a recurved bow and flares gradually to form a subrectangular-shaped obturator process in its middle portion. An elliptical fenestra perforates the obturator process. Discoveries and species The holotype (ZCDM V0016) was discovered in Kugou, a locality in the Shandong Province of China which presents layers of the Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Group. It is part of the Zhucheng Dinosaur Museum collection and it includes an incomplete, partially articulated specimen comprising the entire sacrum, a few ossified tendons, both halves of the pelvis, the anteriormost 15 caudal vertebrae in an articulated series, and the right femur, tibia and fibula. Ischioceratops was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. Classification Holotype seen from above Skeletal reconstruction of the known bones Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed Ischioceratops as a leptoceratopsid. Its closest relative taxon has appeared to be Montanoceratops. The following cladogram is based on a 2015 analysis by Yiming He, Peter J. Makovicky, Kebai Wang, Shuqing Chen, Corwin Sullivan, Fenglu Han, Xing XuMichael J. Ryan, David C. Evans, Philip J. Currie, Caleb M. Brown and Don Brinkman.

She was best known for her appearances in Goldfinger and A Hard Day's Night and six Carry On films and also regularly appeared on screen from the 1960s to the 1980s. Early life Nolan was born in Hampstead, London. Her mother Molly was an English nurse and her father Jack was an Irish army clerk. They spent the duration of the Second World War in County Waterford in Ireland until the war ended in 1945. Nolan began training as a teacher but began dating Tom Kempinski, who was acting with the National Theatre at the time, who persuaded her to begin a career in acting. Career Margaret Nolan began her career in front of a camera lens as a model. As her glamour modelling career took off, she was briefly known as Vicky Kennedy in the early 1960s. Nolan reverted to her birth name as soon as acting roles beckoned; appearing in numerous television shows, theatre productions and films. The latter included A Hard Day's Night with the Beatles, Ferry Cross the Mersey with Gerry and the Pacemakers, and Marcel Carn√©'s Three Rooms in Manhattan. Nolan also appeared in one of the first episodes of the television spy thriller The Saint with Roger Moore. In 1964, Nolan played the role of Dink, Bond's masseuse, in the James Bond film Goldfinger. She was also painted gold and wore a gold bikini for Robert Brownjohn's title-sequence, advertisements and soundtrack-cover (not Shirley Eaton as in the narrative of the film). This led to photographs in Playboy magazine's James Bond's Girls edition of November 1965. In the 1971 film Carry On at Your Convenience, composer Eric Rogers referenced Nolan's Goldfinger affiliation by using its three-note motif on a close-up of her. Nolan appeared on the front cover of both the US and UK versions of the 2005 book Robert Brownjohn: Sex and Typography. In 2012, Nolan gave her first interview concerning her experiences as the model. Asked if the imagery liberates or celebrates womanhood, Nolan responded that: > It does celebrate the physical form. If I'd been nude it might have been > about liberation because up to that point you wouldn't have seen a nude > woman in a publicly visible thing like that. I could have been very > pretentious and said this is liberating. But because I was dressed-up anyway > I didn't get that sense.Playerist (2012:03) Margaret Nolan Interview > Playerist No. 2 It became the first film-title to be shown in installation at MoMA, New York (2012).

Nolan gave a live reading of the work at the Poetry Society in Covent Garden, reviewed by What's On London as a \\"deeply-personal memoir... her performance simply magical.\\" She spoke of her awareness of Milligan's depressive character but also of their friendly working relationship; noting that \\"Professionally, he taught me that timing is what makes things funny. Timing is crucial...\\"Nolan, M (2013) Room at the Top Playerist No. 3, p. 16 Nolan was given bigger roles in several 1970s Carry On films ‚Äì and most sizably Carry On Girls. The scene in Carry On Girls where a woman in a one-piece swim suit sneezes and bursts open two buttons on her outfit (revealing most of her breasts) is Nolan. The same film contains the sequence of Nolan (in a silver bikini) and Barbara Windsor cat-fighting on a hotel floor. Nolan also appeared in serious theatre, motivated by political themes. In 2011, Nolan's work as a comedy actress was recognised with her name included on Gordon Young's Comedy Carpet installation in front of Blackpool Tower. Also in 2011, Nolan returned to the screen after a gap of nearly three decades. She starred in a role especially written for her by Ann Cameron, in Yvonne Deutschman's The Power of Three. The film was set in Hampstead, and well-received on the independent circuit with a 7.2 rating on IMDb. In 2019, Edgar Wright cast her in his upcoming 2021 film Last Night in Soho. Art career As a visual artist, Nolan produced graphic and sometimes grotesque photo-montages assembled from cut-outs of her early publicity photographs. These pieces concern \\"a unique and personal dialogue intrinsically related to a view of a woman and how a woman is viewed.\\"Playerist (2012:02) Margaret Nolan Interview Playerist No. 2 She exhibited in London at venues including the Brick Lane Gallery (2009), The Misty Moon Gallery (2013) and Gallery Different (2013), whilst a screen-print is held by Kemistry Gallery.

Early life  Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi was born, on 8 January 1933, into a Jewish family in London, England, where he continued to live and work, along with his wife, Rebekah. On his father's side of the family, he was descended from a rabbinical Sephardi line with roots in Bessarabia which was, at the turn of the 20th century, a province of Russia. On his mother's side, he was descended from a Polish Ashkenazi family. His Ashkenazi great-grandfather was Zerah Barnet, who helped found the Orthodox Meah Shearim district, just outside the Old City of Jerusalem, and a Hebrew yeshiva in Jaffa. He attended Saint Martin's School of Art and the Royal Academy, studying painting during his time there. After college his jobs included working in general and psychiatric hospitals, as well as in a theatre workshop and at the Royal Opera House. Besides theatre work and practising graphic design , he also taught at RADA and the Architectural Association. He ran workshops for the Wrekin Trust and has lectured at the Theosophical Society, the Royal College of Art and the Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture.  Kabbalistic work  He first started studying Kabbalah at the age of 25 and was a student and tutor of Kabbalah for more than 60 years, beginning to teach in 1971. During this time he visited nearly all the old major centres of Kabbalah in Europe, North Africa and Israel, while specialising in the Toledano Tradition, a form that derives from the Sephardi Kabbalah which developed in early medieval Spain and France and which included among its focal points the towns of Lunel and Girona and the city of Toledo. left These and other centres flowered, producing among their practitioners of mysticism and Kabbalah Solomon ibn Gabirol, Isaac the Blind and Nachmanides. During this period Kabbalists incorporated into their expositions and exegeses a degree of Neoplatonic emanationism, called Ein Sof by kabbalists, that conformed to the requirements of Jewish theology and philosophy, though, to some extent, in medieval times, it conflicted with the Aristotelian approach to Jewish philosophy by Maimonides and his followers.Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought, edited by Lenn Goodman, Albany: SUNY Press, 1992 A fellow of the Temenos Academy, UK, instituted by the poet, Kathleen Raine, Halevi regularly lectured there. He taught groups on every continent, including at Interface Boston, the New York Open Centre; The Centre for Psychological Astrology, UK; Omega Institute; New York Kabbalah Society; the Jungian Institute of Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Karen Kabbalah, Atlanta, as well as in synagogues and at rabbinical colleges. He was the Director of Tutors for the Kabbalah Society and for many years ran a series of Kabbalah courses at Regent's College in London. He traveled widely and ran a continuing series of Way of Kabbalah courses and lectures held in many countries, including America, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Scotland and Spain, though few of his lectures have been published and fewer still are online; similarly with his articles.Kenton, W., Kenton, Kabbalah, Circles: Magazine of the Theosophical Society, Spring, 1990 .

Influence  ;HRH The Prince of Wales right In an introduction to the Sacred Web Conference, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, 23/24 September 2006 at the University of Alberta in 2006, the Prince of Wales, a Patron of the Temenos Academy, said, when talking of the tension between Tradition and Modernism: > This dilemma is captured in ancient notions of balance and harmony; notions > that are, for example, expressed in many guises in that wonderful > Kabbalistic diagram of the Tree of Life. As the Temenos Fellow, Warren > Kenton, so beautifully explains in his lectures to the students of the > Academy, the teaching of the Tree of Life is that the \\"active\\" and the > \\"passive\\" aspects of life, which on their own may lead to imbalance and > disharmony, must be, can only be, brought together in harmony by the influx > into our lives of the Divine and the Sacred. Whether or not we interpret > this image as an explanation of an outer or an inner orientation, it is in > this way, and only in this way, that the forces, or characteristics, of > expansion and constraint can be brought into balance. There is a DVD that includes this portion of the Prince's talk on the World Wisdom website. ;Kathleen Raine The poet, Kathleen Raine, had this to say about Halevi's work: left > A feature of this author's system not found in others (although doubtless it > is traditional though not universally taught) is the beautiful way in which > the interfaces of each 'world' overlap with the one above (or below). Thus, > the highest experiences of the physical world overlap the lower part of the > next world (the psychological]: and again psyche's highest experiences of > the individual soul coincide with spiritual regions of the transpersonal > world of universal forms. So from illumination to illumination we reascend > the 'ladder' by which each of us 'came down to earth from heaven'. The awe- > inspiring sublimity of the Kabbalistic universe at once convinces and > comforts. It is our destiny to descend and to fulfil some task, learn some > lesson in the natural world; as it is to follow the path of return, to > reascend from world to world, no matter how many lifetimes this may take us > before we return to our true home, 'the kingdom of Heaven'.

While the internal fulfillment process may diverge to optimize the operations, the outbound process only diverges at the point of pack out and shipping. It allows companies to deliver goods to multiple channels using a single facility with a single workforce, delivering from a single inventory. The channel dictates the order size, delivery requirements, packaging, shipment method and rules for handling shortages. Single-channel facilities can have a fixed set of criteria. Some embodiments of omnichannel order fulfillment eliminate the need for bulk storage, pallets and lift trucks. Instead, products are sent directly to universal storage and pick modules. The process is designed so that items can be selected simultaneously for any channel requirements. Omnichannel solutions may operate where orders are not grouped into waves, as is common in pick operations. Instead, customer orders or product demand is entered into worker pick lists as soon as they are initiated for processing at the distribution center, which promotes both fulfillment flexibility and processing speed. In such operations associates doing the picking don't know whether they are picking an online order or a store order. They pick and replenish simultaneously, work with dynamic stock keeping unit (SKU) locations, and generally touch and move items with minimal fear of introducing errors.  Warehouse management  Software is what makes warehouse management possible throughout the omnichannel order fulfillment process. In the era of online shopping, fulfillment centers need versatility, flexibility and visibility. Therefore, using the correct software is critical. The software needs to be able to handle a variety of orders and find the most cost- efficient way to sort SKUs based on physical characteristics, SKU velocity and order profiles. Systems that give fulfillment centers access to real-time information about what‚Äôs going on in their facilities at all times provide the flexibility needed to respond quickly as events are occurring rather than after the fact. Retailers are increasingly using warehouse management systems (WMS) and warehouse execution systems (WES) to improve store-level inventory accuracy and expand support for new omnichannel flow paths. The WMS/WES supports processes such as pick-to-cart, return fulfillment and the ability to see a picture of the item to be picked.

His best- known work is probably the wide-ranging and substantial (3 volume) biography of Cavour, of which the third volume appeared only in 1984, following a gestation period, according to at least one source, of nearly thirty years. Romeo also became a politician, sitting as a member of the Italian Republican Party in the European Parliament between 1984 and his death in 1987. Life Rosario Romeo was born in Giarre, a small town on the eastern coast of Sicily. His passion for History was triggered when he was 14 and he read \\"Il Medioevo\\" (\\"The Middle Ages\\") by Gioacchino Volpe. He studied at the University of Catania under the historian-politician Gioacchino Volpe and the historian Nino Valeri, graduating in 1947 with a dissertation on the Risorgimento in Sicily. In 1947 he won a scholarship awarded by the newly established Naples based Italian Historical Institute (Istituto italiano per gli studi storici) and was thereby enabled to develop his university dissertation into his first book. After this the Institute's president, Federico Chabod, invited Rosario to collaborate on the Italian Dictionary of National Biography, then as now a \\"work in progress\\". Romeo then moved to Naples, accepting an appointment as secretary of the Historical Institute in 1953, staying in Naples till 1956. He took a history professorship at Messina where in 1956, still aged only 31, he was immediately elected head of the History Faculty. In 1962 Rosario Romeo took a position as Professor of Modern History at Rome University, working initially in the Faculty of Education, and transferring later to the Humanities Faculty. In 1977 he became a professor at the European University Institute in Florence where he stayed for most of 1978. Back in Rome, in November 1978 he was appointed rector/provost of the \\"Guido Carli\\" Free International University for Social Studies (LUISS): he stayed at the LUISS till 1984. Rosario Romero was often seen as a conservative liberal historian, as a young professor refuting Gramsci's Marxist reading of the Risorgimento, and more recently robustly unimpressed by Mack Smith's version of the same events. In the sometimes fevered political context of Italian historiography, none of this was enough to prevent the maverick academic journalist Panfilo Gentile from (somewhat implausibly) describing Rosario's own 1950 book on the Risorgimento in Sicily as a Marxist work. In a well ventilated controversy involving Renzo De Felice, in 1968 Romeo was instrumental in obtaining for De Felice a professorship at Salerno, and in subsequent years he vigorously defended De Felice when the latter's monumental biography of Mussolini drew charges of (pro-Fascist) revisionism from Leo Valiani (and others). In 1986 Rosario Romeo was appointed a member of the Lincean Academy (Accademia dei Lincei). On the political front, in 1984 Rosario Romeo's name was on the candidate list of the then Italian Liberal Party for the 1984 election to the European Parliament: when the votes had been cast his name appeared high enough up on the party list, and his party had won sufficient votes, for him to have been elected. Within the parliament he was elected vice-president of the Liberal and Democratic parliamentary group and of the Liberal and Democratic Reformist parliamentary group which replaced it at the end of 1985. He also served between 1984 and 1987 as a member of the parliamentary committee for Regional Policy and Regional Planning, and between January and March 1987 as a member of the parliamentary committee on Institutional Affairs (on which he had been sometimes co-opted as a substitute member since 1984). Rosario Romeo died on 16 March 1987 in Rome. He was 62.

Shadow mapping) is a new positioning method that improves positioning accuracy of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in urban environments. The shadow matching positioning principle was first proposed and the name 'shadow matching' was first introduced by Paul D Groves. The principle of shadow matching combines two commonly known principles together: GNSS signal availability determination using 3D building models and the fingerprinting-like positioning techniques. The principle of shadow matching is simple. Due to obstruction by buildings in urban canyons, from many GNSS satellites will be receivable in some parts of a street, but not others. Where each direct signal is receivable can be predicted using a 3D city model. Consequently, by determining whether a direct signal is being received from a given satellite, the user can localize their position to within one of two areas of the street. By considering other satellites, the position solution may be refined further. At each epoch, a set of candidate user positions is generated close to the user‚Äôs low-accuracy conventional GNSS positioning solution. At each candidate user position, the predicted satellite visibility is matched with the real observations. The candidate position that has the best match between the prediction and the real observations can be deemed the shadow matching positioning solution. This process can be conducted epoch by epoch, so the GNSS user can be either static or dynamic.

The painting was Trumbull‚Äôs first depiction of an American victory. It is one of a series of historical paintings on the war, which also includes the Declaration of Independence and The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776. The artist expressed his great admiration for General George Washington in this painting as he wrote in the catalogue for his exhibited works at Yale University in 1835: It was a personal favorite of Trumbull himself. When asked by Benjamin Silliman which paintings he would save from destruction in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale, he said this one. Trumbull used the General's son, Hugh Jr., as a model for the painting. Description The picture displays several different events of the battle as if they occurred simultaneously. At the center, American General Hugh Mercer, with his dead horse beneath him, is shown mortally wounded. Mercer was commanding the leading division of the Continental Army when attacked by British Colonel Charles Mawhood near Princeton, New Jersey. Mercer's horse was killed and he was attacked by two grenadiers. The British were in control of the battle at this moment. Mercer would be treated for his wounds by Dr. Benjamin Rush the next day, January 4, but died on January 12 as a result, Dr. Rush believed, of a concussion caused by a musket butt to the head At the left, American Daniel Neil is shown bayoneted against his cannon. Capt. Daniel Neil was the Captain of Artillery and began his service in the Revolutionary War as Captain-Lieutenant in the East New Jersey Artillery in Knox's Battalion March 1st, 1776. He was appointed Capt on May, 9th 1776. Captain Neil died on the battlefield by an excessive number of saber wounds by the British. At the right, British Captain William Leslie is shown mortally wounded. Leslie died during the battle and was put on a wagon by the British that was later taken by the Americans. Rush also learned of his death on January 4. He would be buried at Pluckemin, New Jersey the next day, January 5. In the background, American General George Washington and Dr. Benjamin Rush enter the scene. After Mercer became a casualty, Washington needed to lead the charge to overtake Mawhood's troops and win the battle. On the far left, American General Thomas Mifflin is shown leading a cavalry charge. American Colonel John Cadwalader and British Colonel Edmund Eyre are also depicted. Other versions Trumbull worked on this painting for many years and created several sketches and final oil paintings. A collection of sketches is located at the Princeton University Library. A large scale version ( x ), painted in 1831, is owned by the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut.

In a racing career which lasted from July until October 2010 she was undefeated in four races of increasing importance. After winning a maiden race on her debut she won the Group Three Sweet Solera Stakes, the Group Two May Hill Stakes and the Group One Fillies' Mile. She suffered training problems in the early part of the following year and was retired without racing again. She has produced at least one foal. Background White Moonstone is a bay mare with no white markings bred by the Paris, Kentucky-based Stonerside Stable. She was sired by the American stallion Dynaformer whose wins included the Jersey Derby and whose other progeny have included Barbaro, Americain, Blue Bunting and Lucarno. Her dam, Desert Gold was a daughter of Desert Stormette, a half-sister of Desert Stormer (Breeders' Cup Sprint). Desert Stormette was in turn a granddaughter of the broodmare New Tune, whose other offspring included the Queen's Plate winner Sound Reason. In September 2008, Stonerside Stable was bought by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. White Moonstone was sent to Europe where she was trained by Saeed bin Suroor and raced in the colours of Godolphin Racing. She was ridden in all of her races Frankie Dettori. Racing career =2010: two-year-old season= White Moonstone began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Ascot Racecourse on 23 July and started at odds of 15/2 against ten other fillies. After racing wide on the final (right-handed) turn she tracked left to race up the stands-side rail, took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by one and a quarter lengths from the favourite Florestans Match. Two weeks later she was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Sweet Solera Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and started 11/4 joint-favourite alongside the Empress Stakes winner Khor Sheed. She started slowly and raced at the rear of the nine runner field before taking the lead a furlong out and won \\"comfortably\\" by a length and a quarter from Crying Lightening despite hanging left in the closing stages. Dettori commented \\"She drifted to the left but that is just immaturity. I thought I was in trouble three out but she soon came back on the bridle and quickened really well when I asked\\". On September 10 White Moonstone was stepped up in class and distance again and started 8/11 favourite for the Group Two May Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. The best fancied of her six opponents were the John Gosden-trained maiden winner Midnight Caller and the Star Stakes winner Lily Again. After being restrained by Dettori in the early stages she began to make progress in last quarter mile. She moved into the lead and quickly went clear to win \\"easily\\" by five lengths from the 66/1 outsider Al Madina. After the race the filly was made 7/1 favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. Saeeed bin Suroor said \\"I like her. She's got plenty of speed and she worked very well in her last piece of work. She's sound and happy and I'd like to go for a Group 1 with her. We've always liked her she's got class and is a big strong filly\\" whilst Dettori described the winner as being \\"like a super model - she's tall, skinny and beautiful\\". On her final appearance White Moonstone was one of five fillies to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse on 25 September. She started the 4/5 favourite ahead of the Prestige Stakes winner Theysken's Theory and the Silver Flash Stakes winner Together whilst the two outsiders were Fork Handles (unplaced behind White Moonstone at Newmarket) and the maiden Traffic Sister. The favourite raced in last place as Fork Handles set the pace before giving way to Theysken's Theory in the straight. White Moonstoned took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Together to win by a neck. Commenting on the filly's performance, Dettori said \\"I don't think she ran as good as she did at Doncaster. Her turn of foot wasn't as good and the race came a bit quick, but to win like that is still very pleasing\\" but added \\"she is quite light-framed and I don't think she'll take much more racing\\". =2011: three-year-old season= White Moonstone returned to England in the spring of 2011 to begin serious training for the 1000 Guineas. Eight days before the race she was found to be \\"stiff\\" after a training gallop and was withdrawn from the race. Godolphin's racing manager commented \\"Unfortunately, White Moonstone is not right and we need to find the cause of the problem\\". The filly never raced again and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, White Moonstone became a broodmare for Darley Stud. Her first foal, a filly sired by Dubawi was born in February 2013.

History On 10 September 1915, the British government sent a formal appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. In August 1915, the Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer Edgeworth David, after reading reports about mining operations and tunnelling during the Gallipoli Campaign, along with Professor Ernest Skeats, a professor at the University of Melbourne, had already written a proposal to George Pearce, the Australian Defence Minister, suggesting that the government raise a military force to undertake mining and tunnelling. After the proposal was accepted, David used his advocacy and organisational abilities to set up the Australian Mining Corps, and on 25 October 1915 he was appointed as a major, at the age of 57. The first contingent of the corps consisted of 1,300 officers and men that were initially organised into two battalions before being reorganised into the units listed below: * 1st Australian Tunnelling Company * 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company * 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company * Australian Electrical Mechanical Boring and Mining Company The first three of these units were tunnelling companies, while the Electrical Mechanical Boring and Mining Company was tasked with carrying out related repairs. The four mining units formed by the Royal Australian Engineers for the British Expeditionary Force departed Australia for the United Kingdom in February 1916, became fully operational by March 1916, and arrived on the Western Front in May 1916. After May 1916, the four constituent companies of the Australian Mining Corps were deployed directly as part of the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers.

Her debut novel, My Dark Vanessa, was published in 2020 and became a national bestseller.  Biography  Russell was raised in the town of Clifton, Maine, attending John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor, Maine,and Brewer High School in Brewer,Maine, from which she graduated in 2002. She subsequently studied as an undergraduate at the University of Maine at Farmington, earning a B.F.A. in Creative Writing in 2006, and went on to earn an M.F.A. from Indiana University and a Ph.D. in Creative Writing from the University of Kansas. My Dark Vanessa Russell's first novel offers a fictional account of a traumatic sexual relationship between its protagonist, Vanessa Wye, and Jacob Strane. Wye is 15 years old and a lonely student at boarding school when Strane, her 42-year-old English teacher, begins grooming her for a sexual relationship which will come to cast an appalling shadow over her life. The novel is a first-person narrative, jumping forward and backward in time amongst 2000, 2007, and 2017, with this last year affording Russell the social context of the Me Too movement. It is implied that Vanessa is, at least in part, an unreliable narrator owing to her reluctance to see herself as a victim or Strane as a predator. My Dark Vanessa was a national bestseller. It was selected for translation and publication in 22 countries, and optioned for the screen. Reviewed positively by The New York Times, National Public Radio, The Atlantic, The Guardian,, The Economist, and The Washington Post, My Dark Vanessa brought Russell into a public conversation regarding the novel's treatment of abusive sexual relationships, as well as an individual's right to privacy regarding past trauma. Controversy My Dark Vanessa occasioned pre- publication controversy when author Wendy C. Ortiz complained that Russell's novel had received different support from that given to Ortiz's memoir concerning a relationship with her 8th grade English teacher. Ortiz further alleged that My Dark Vanessa, which she had not read, possessed 'eerie story similarities' to her memoir. As was reported by the Associated Press, 'Reviewers who looked at both books saw no evidence of plagiarism.' Nevertheless, in response to social media comments, and in the wake of the controversy over American Dirt, Oprah Winfrey, who had originally tapped My Dark Vanessa as a selection for her influential Book Club, rescinded the selection.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The William Colburn House is located north of Orono's downtown, on the west side of Bennoch Road (Maine State Route 16), between Noyes and Winterhaven Drives. It is set on a terrace above the road, and would at one time have had views of the Stillwater River. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The center bay contains an unusually wide doorway, that includes flanking sidelight windows and a fanlight. The interior of the house retains original woodwork and finishes, include wide pine floors, wainscoting, and a large kitchen fireplace with crane and builtin ovens. The house was built in 1780 by William Colburn, who first arrived in the area in 1774 with his father Jeremiah. They fled the area at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, and returned in 1780, at which time they built two houses. One of them was destroyed by fire.

She was raised in Ey√ºp district of Istanbul, Turkey. In 2000, she entered Marmara University to study physical education and sports. After graduating in 2004, she began to work as a physical education and sports teacher. Topaloƒülu played tennis, football, and basketball during her university years. She had to retire from active sports, however, because of an injury. She decided to pursue a career as a basketball referee, and applied for the required course. At the same time, her older sister, who wanted to be a football referee, was rejected due to exceeding the age limit. She named Yeliz instead on the application. Yeliz' career as a football referee began as a surprise. Football referee =Domestic= Topaloƒülu began her referee career in 1999, officially debuting as an assistant referee in a Women's League match played on December 29, 2001. On February 9, 2002, she was appointed referee in the Women's League, which was the forerunner of the Turkish Women's First Football League. She served in various refereeing roles for youth leagues for boys in several different age categories. She officiated men's A2 League, Regional Amateur League, TFF Third League, and TFF Second League matches as assistant referee. She is also referee at all three women's leagues. =International= On April 4, 2014, she served as the fourth official at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification match between the national teams of Turkey and Wales.

FIFA replied that they would agree if Yeliz could pass the required courses. She became the world's first female beach soccer referee after meeting all the FIFA requirements. Her first international appointment as beach soccer referee was at State 1 of the 2014 Euro Beach Soccer League, held in Catania, Italy between June 20 and 22.

Gallagher. The name denotes a heightening of the large sieve. Combinatorial sieves like the Selberg sieve are strongest, when only a few residue classes are removed, while the term large sieve means that this sieve can take advantage of the removal of a large number of up to half of all residue classes. The larger sieve can exploit the deletion of an arbitrary number of classes.  Statement  Suppose that \\\\mathcal{S} is a set of prime powers, N an integer, \\\\mathcal{A} a set of integers in the interval [1, N], such that for q\\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} there are at most g(q) residue classes modulo q, which contain elements of \\\\mathcal{A}.

According to the original program notes, \\"'Punch and the Judy' concerns man and woman. The text is squabble and scuffle. The Three Fates are any three women who direct the lives of others. The Three Heroes are the Idealists. Pegasus is that force which enables us to imagine or escape.\\" The ballet unfolds in seven sections: *Overture *Prologue-The Fates set the stage *First Dilemma-The Judy soliloquizes-Punch shows off-The Child enters-Trouble starts *Interlude-Pegasus enters-The Flight to Dream *Second Dilemma-The family gathers-Pretty Polly enters-Punch seduces-The Judy rages-The Heroes exalt-The Judy despairs *Interlude-Pegasus enters-The Flight to Dream *Third Dilemma-The Justice is blindfolded-Punch triumphs-The Heroes march-The Fates intervene- Punch falls-The Judy intervenes-Punch brags again-The Judy chooses-The Fates direct, da capo The action revolves around the Judy, the discontented wife of boastful, unfaithful Punch. To escape her unhappiness, she turns to Pegasus, who carries her to a blissful dreamworld. In search of a new mate, she flirts with each of the Three Heroes, but is ultimately unsatisfied with them. In the ballet's finale, a game of blind man's bluff, she grasps a promising manly figure.

It is based on the book of same name and The World According to Bob by James Bowen. The film stars Luke Treadaway, Ruta Gedmintas, Joanne Froggatt, Anthony Head, and Bob the Cat as himself. The film premiered in London on 3 November 2016, followed by a general release the next day. The title is a spoof of A Streetcar Named Desire. The film won Best British Film at the UK National Film Awards on 29 March 2017.  Plot  James Bowen is a homeless man and former heroin addict, living on the streets of London down to his last bits of change. After a life threatening drug-related incident, his support worker Val, in an attempt to get him off the street, gets him into a council flat and prescribes him methadone. On his first night in his flat, James discovers a cat rifling through his food. Assuming the cat had escaped from somewhere, James tries to return the cat to his real owners. After letting him go, the same evening the cat returns to James's flat, this time with a purulent wound on his back leg. Worried, James consults his animal-loving but allergic neighbour, Betty. She informs James of a local charity vet where she volunteers, and names the cat Bob. Waiting on a queue at the vet, James misses a meeting with Val. After the appointment, James has Bob neutered and sets him free. However, Bob keeps following James into town, eventually drawing more crowds of people, making James more wealthy, and he eventually decides to keep Bob. Bob becomes a tourist hotspot, and James and Betty start to become romantically attached. One night while returning home, James finds his old friend, Baz, unconscious on his flat estate, overdosed on heroin. Baz later dies in hospital, and James finds out that Betty cannot be around drug addicts, as her deceased brother had been one. On New Year's Eve, James makes an impromptu visit to his biological father, Jack, his stepmother, Hilary, and his lost sisters, Pris and Faith. After Bob destroys their living room, Hilary sends James and Bob out. One day, while busking, James gets into an argument with a chav, causing the crowd to get in a brawl with the man and James getting arrested for it. Although found innocent, he is prohibited from busking for 6 months. While in the chemist, receiving his methadone, Betty notices him. Betty and James argue and go their separate ways. Later on, James visits the offices of The Big Issue to make some more money for him and Bob. He regains his popularity with tourists by selling The Big Issue. After being accused of illegally selling magazines on another vendor's patch, James and Bob are banned for a whole month. After going back in business, James gets into an argument with a rude woman trying to buy Bob off him, losing Bob in the scuffle. Bob does not return for a few days, leaving James devastated. After Bob returns, James feels he is ready to come off the methadone. After a week of gruelling withdrawal symptoms, James awakes, clean and healthy. A journalist, Mary, requests to write a book about James and Bob after his Internet and media popularity, and James agrees. James then fixes up his relationship with his father Jack, and his life turns around for the better.  Cast  Luke Treadaway as James Bowen * Bob as himself.

Life Harkness was born on 28 February 1854 at Upton-on-Severn in Worcestershire.Margaret Harkness, Victorian Web, Retrieved 29 December 2015 Her parents were Robert and Jane Waugh Law Harkness. Her father, Robert, was an Anglican priest. She had four siblings and a half sister as her mother had been widowed before she married her father. Her second cousin was the economist Beatrice Webb. She was sent to finishing school at Stirling House in Bournemouth. She is thought to have taken the name \\"Law\\" as part of her nom de plume because it was her mother's maiden name or because she was also a relation of Bishop George Henry Law.John Lucas, 'Harkness, Margaret Elise (1854‚Äì1923)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 accessed 29 Dec 2015  Work  After attending a finishing school in Bournemouth, she left home at the age of 23 to make her living. She there trained as a nurse and worked as a dispenser. Harkness lived in various locations in London with her cousin, Beatrice Webb, in Katherine Buildings near St. Katherine's Dock, where Webb worked as a rent collector. She had a difficult relationship with a Radical politician, Joseph Chamberlain, that ultimately foundered, after which she started thinking of herself as a \\"glorified spinster,\\" able to devote herself completely to her work.  Author  In her works of social investigation, Harkness uses a tone of social realism or naturalism, making her different from her male contemporarites. With the financial assistance of her sister and Beatrice Webb, she was able to continue living in London and become a writer. In 1883 she wrote Assyrian Life and History and the following year Egyptian Life and History according to the Monuments. She was introduced to socialism and a group of people who based themselves at the British Museum Reading Room; her friends included her sister Katie, Eleanor Marx, Olive Schreiner, and Annie Besant. Susan David Bernstein argues that this group of women enacted a \\"transformation of women's work that \\"entails a proliferation of women's labor across private homes and public spaces.\\" In 1887 she published A City Girl. Engels gave her advice on her novels where he proposed that she should discuss typical people and situations and not create a stark socialist approach to writing.Margaret Harkness: 'In Darkest London' ‚Äì 1889, Flore Janssen, LondonFiction.com, Retrieved 30 December 2015 In 1888 she wrote her novel Out of Work included descriptions of what happened in Trafalgar Square on 13 November 1887. On that day actions by the police to control a demonstration by the unemployed resulted in injuries, one death and many arrests. One of the arrests was of the socialist John Burns who she would later work with, together with Tom Mann and Henry Hyde Champion, editor of the socialist paper Justice. The novel Captain Lobe followed in 1889. She put her politics into action during the London Dock Strike that year when she is thought to have influenced Cardinal Manning who successfully interceded in the dispute.Kent, William. \\"Henry Edward Manning.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 24 Feb. 2015 In 1905 she published George Eastmont: Wanderer about her life during the 1889 Docks strike when she was briefly a member of the Social Democratic Federation. She described the conditions of the poor in London but she did not make it clear about her contact with Bishop Manning although the book was dedicated to him. Her book In Darkest London documents poverty in the East End and the Salvation Army's approach to the problem. She wrote a book about Indian life which was published as Glimpses of Hidden India in 1907 and as Indian Snapshots in 1912. At the end of her life she lived in France and then Italy. Her last work A Curate's Promise: a Story of Three Weeks was published in 1921 and she died in Florence in 1923.

Crowdfind uses their Image-Led Workflow software technology to make day-to-day tasks simple for companies. Crowdfind helps improve companys' processes by providing software focused on maintenance, security, and lost and found. This software improves customer and department communication, tracking, reporting, and shipping. The ease of the process cuts employee's time spent working on these tasks and provides customers with a better experience. In 2018, they began work to expand their software offerings to include their facility maintenance software, FixIt which launched September 2019. History Crowdfind launched in April 2013 at TechCrunch Disrupt New York. It started as a crowdsourced mobile application, but grew into a Lost and Found management tool for businesses. In 2018, Crowdfind announced their plans to expand beyond their Lost and Found software via their crowdfunding campaign. Crowdfind is now used by companies such as Navy Pier, Bonnaroo Music Festival, Salt Lake City International Airport, Virginia Tech, among many others. Lost and Found software Crowdfind's first product was Lost and Found, released in 2013. Originally a crowdsourced mobile application where people could post lost and found items on an app, the application was later developed into enterprise software. Their first client was Navy Pier, and since then they have grown to be used at many transportation hubs, colleges and universities, festivals, events, and venues around the world. The application has image-based features, in which companies use their app to take a photo of an item. These photos integrate onto company websites so customers can browse through lost and found items and file claims. Crowdfind supplies companies with claim forms to gather information and ways to verify ownership before making returns. Through the software's dashboard companies can manage inventory, manage customer claims, communicate with customers, create automated reports, and invoice customers to have items shipped back to them through the integrated shipping feature. Maintenance software In September 2018, Crowdfind released their facility maintenance software, FixIt. Like their lost and found software, FixIt also uses photos to improve procedure. Companies can have their employees download the app, then when they notice something wrong on-site, they can take a photo of the issue. This picture notifies maintenance, who see the picture and location and can go fix the issue. Once fixed, maintenance close out the work order with another picture, notifying management the job is complete.

Toby \\"TobiWan\\" Dawson is an Australian former Dota 2 eSports caster. Dawson is employed by the Electronic Sports League.  Career  TobiWan was a competitive Call of Duty player during the Call of Duty: United Offensive era. TobiWan began his casting career at the JoinDotA studio. The first Dota tournament he casted was World Cyber Games 2005 in Singapore, for which he was chosen even though he had only played a few games of Dota in his life. His first achievement was being able to cast The International 2011 final. Unlike most Dota casters, TobiWan was never a competitive Dota 2 gamer, but got attracted to it because his mother's profession involved casting. TobiWan went on to cast most of the grand finals of major tournaments such as The International, The Defense, DreamHack, and JoinDotA Masters. TobiWan has cast every iteration of The International to date. During a 2012 broadcast, TobiWan made the following comment in chat: \\"have you heard the expression..lame as a n baby?\\". He later apologised for using a racist word. He casted the Professional Gamers League (PGL) Counter-Strike: Global Offensive championship in 2015. Tobiwan and Troels \\"Synderen\\" Nielsen commentated the finals of The International 2015 between Evil Geniuses and CDEC Gaming. Tobiwan, Soe, and Maelk commentated the 2015 MLG World Finals.

Location of Haymarket pushcart vendors shown in blue on a map of downtown Boston. The market is operated by the Haymarket Pushcart Association, which was founded in 1974 to negotiate with the city on issues such as waste removal and traffic. The roughly 50 Haymarket vendors sell fruit, vegetables, and seafood at very low prices. The market offers \\"produce its vendors obtain from wholesale distribution terminals north of Boston,\\" primarily the New England Produce Center in Chelsea. Prices are low because the wholesale markets need to make room for new shipments arriving over the weekend. The market is open \\"from dawn to dusk\\" every Friday and Saturday. The market's location and days of operation were established by a 1952 state law and by a 1978 city ordinance. Vendors are licensed by the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department. The market is adjacent to the Haymarket MBTA station, which is served by two subway lines and many bus routes. Inexpensive validated parking for Haymarket shoppers is available at the Parcel 7 Garage. The discount was created as a \\"mitigation\\" measure for the impact of the Big Dig highway project on Haymarket. A study conducted for the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 2009 by the Project for Public Spaces found that \\"Haymarket attracts one of the most diverse populations of any market we have worked on. ... Customers include almost every imaginable ethnic group and income level. Haymarket is the primary place where most of its shoppers buy produce and it serves a vital role in the Boston food distribution system.\\" In 2015, two Johns Hopkins University graduate students proposed the creation in Baltimore of a market modeled after Haymarket, to address the problems of food going to waste and the lack of access to fresh produce in low-income communities. History View in South Market Street, Boston (Winslow Homer) Markets have operated in this part of Boston since the 1600s. The first market buildings were constructed in 1734. The indoor market at Faneuil Hall opened in 1742. Open-air markets have been in continuous existence in the vicinity since early in the 19th century, with many transformations over the years. The Haymarket Pushcart Association traces its roots to 1820. In the early 20th century, hundreds of street vendors did business on 24 city blocks. Laws passed beginning in 1908 limited the locations where vendors could set up shop. The predecessor of today's market was relocated from Haymarket Square in 1952 to make way for construction of the elevated Central Artery. A state law passed in that year designates the current location of Haymarket for use by \\"hawkers and peddlers\\" on Fridays and Saturdays. Through much of the 20th century, most Haymarket vendors were of Italian ancestry. Today the mix of vendors is more diverse. According to Haymarket Pushcart Association President Otto Gallotto, \\"This place has always been an immigrants‚Äô market with affordable prices. From when the Irish and Italians came to Boston and even now, we have every ethnicity both buying and selling at Haymarket.‚Äù The market takes its name from Haymarket Square, a former town square that was located a block to the north, where some vendors operated during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The market is located on the Freedom Trail, adjacent to the Blackstone Block Historic District, which is \\"the oldest extant city block in the country.\\" This part of Boston has been called the \\"Market District\\" since at least 1910. The name was in use through at least the 1950s, then fell out of use, and has recently been revived. The Market District also includes the indoor Boston Public Market (which opened in 2015), Quincy Market, and a market in the proposed Haymarket Square Hotel. Criticism Haymarket inspires strong feelings, both pro and con, among Boston residents and visitors. trash compactors Conflicts between Haymarket vendors and the City of Boston have arisen at times over issues including trash and truck parking. A 2005 Boston Globe article quoted then-Mayor Thomas Menino: \\"Haymarket is part of the uniqueness of Boston. My parents took me there when I was a kid. I wouldn't want the vendors to not be part of the Boston landscape. We want people to be able to buy affordable fruit and vegetables. But [the vendors] have to meet us halfway. They can't continue to live outside the rules. We have to have constructive dialogue with them.\\" Concerns about odor and litter led the City of Boston to install several large trash compactors on the site in 2009. Art and culture In 1976, the Massachusetts Bicentennial Commission and the City of Boston commissioned a public art installation in the streets and sidewalks used for the market. The installation, called \\"Asaroton, 1976\\", by Mags Harries and Lajos Heder, was described by the artists as follows: \\"The embedded bronze pieces replicate the trash and debris that might normally cover the street. When the stalls and real debris of the farmer‚Äôs market cover the art, it becomes part of a living experience. On the other days of the week it is a memory of the market.\\" The installation was removed prior to the Big Dig construction, and stored at the Museum of Science. An updated version was reinstalled at Haymarket in 2006. Scenes in the 1968 movie The Thomas Crown Affair, the 1972 movie Fuzz, and the 1982 movie Hanky Panky were filmed at Haymarket. Haymarket is a frequent subject for local artists and photographers. Modern Day Today the Market is in full operation. Licensed Vendors are not allowed to sell anything to the public after 7 pm or risk a $1,000 fine issued by the city if caught. On Saturday nights nearing the 7 pm market-shut-down deadline, vendors often liquidate any remaining inventory selling whatever they have left for pennies on the dollar. What is not sold is thrown out by the pallet full into the onsite trash compactors. Also worthy of note, the Hay Market Garage offers $1.00 parking up to two hours or $3.00 parking for two to three hours with a validated parking ticket. Garage parking tickets can be validated by any licensed haymarket vendor‚Äîand consist of a rubber stamp pressed onto the back of the ticket. Future Haymarket pushcart market relocated from Blackstone Street to Parcel 9 in 2018 as Blackstone Street is reconstructedHaymarket is adjacent to and makes use of part of a Big Dig development site called Parcel 9. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) secured a developer for Parcel 9 under a Request for Proposals issued in 2011. The RFP requires the developer of Parcel 9 to work with the Haymarket Pushcart Association on numerous enhancements to the existing market, including creating space for some vendors within the Parcel 9 building; providing waste handling, utility, office, storage, and restroom facilities for the market; and rebuilding the curbs and sidewalks of Blackstone Street and Hanover Street to make the market accessible to customers with limited mobility. The City of Boston Zoning Code includes \\"design guidelines\\" for Parcel 9 stating that any building on the parcel must be designed in a way \\"allowing the Haymarket pushcart/food vendor activities to continue to occur along Blackstone Street.\\" The Haymarket Pushcart Association initially opposed residential condominium development on Parcel 9, arguing that new condo owners would object to the ongoing operations of the market. Four proposals were received in 2012 response to the RFP, including two apartment developments, a hotel, and a proposal for The Boston Museum. In 2013, MassDOT accepted a proposal from Normandy Real Estate Partners for construction of the Haymarket Square Hotel. In April 2016, a revised plan for the proposed hotel was submitted for review by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The BRA board approved the proposal in June 2016. The initial phase of the project began in 2018, with the relocation of most of the Haymarket vendors from Blackstone Street onto Parcel 9, to permit the reconstruction of Blackstone Street. After this phase was completed, the vendors returned to Blackstone Street, and construction of the \\"Canopy Hotel Parcel 9\\" began in fall 2019.

They include general oversupply as US and Canadian tight oil (shale oil) production reached critical volumes, geopolitical rivalries amongst oil-producing nations, falling demand across commodities markets due to the deceleration of the Chinese economy, and possible restraint of long-term demand as environmental policy promotes fuel efficiency and steers an increasing share of energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The world price of oil was above US$125 per barrel in 2012, and remained relatively strong above $100 until September 2014, after which it entered a sharp downward spiral, falling below $30 by January 2016. OPEC production was poised to rise further with the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, at a time when markets already appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day. In December 2015, The Telegraph quoted a major oil broker stating: \\"The world is floating in oil. The numbers we are facing now are dreadful\\" ‚Äì and Forbes magazine stated: \\"The ongoing oil price slump has more or less morphed into a complete rout, with profound long-term implications for the industry as a whole.\\" As 2016 continued, the price gradually rose back into the $40s, with the world waiting to see if and when and how the market would return to balance. In October 2018, Brent prices had recovered to their pre-2015 levels, peaking at $86.29 a barrel on 3 October. Soon after, however, prices began a collapse as fears over the global economy and fast-increasing shale production began to take hold. The following month, Brent prices fell approximately 22%, constituting the largest monthly loss in a decade, ending the month at $59.46 per barrel on 30 November. Unsustainable prices The global economy after the Great Recession was particularly weak compared to before. In 2006, over 100 nations achieved economic growth over 5% annually; in 2014, roughly 50 nations achieved over 5% growth. Many large economies, like the EU, US, and China, were unable to support 2005 levels of growth, and China almost fell into its own financial crisis during its 2015 stock market bubble and crash. Oil demand growth, as a result of all this, dropped. On 6 April 2014, writing in a Saudi Arabian journal, World Pensions Forum economist Nicolas J. Firzli warned that the escalating oversupply situation could have durably negative economic consequences for all Gulf Cooperation Council member states: Causes =North American oil production increases= U.S. oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels, due to substantial improvements in shale \\"fracking\\" technology in response to record oil prices. The steady rise in additional output, mostly from North Dakota, West Texas, Oklahoma, and several other US states eventually led to a plunge in U.S. oil import requirements and a record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage. Canada also significantly increased oil production during the 2000s oil crisis, mostly in Alberta in the form of the Athabasca oil sands, though a transportation and logistics crisis in Alberta has slowed continued growth in supplies. =Global Growth slowing= The 2015‚Äì16 Chinese stock market turbulence slowed the growth of the economy in China, restraining its demand for oil and other industrial commodities. China's fast rising debt pile, especially since 2008, has also led to concerns about a Chinese financial crisis and/or Chinese recession, which led to significant volatility and loss of asset value in other world markets. China's slowing economy led to many other economies slowing or falling into recession, and the end of QE in the United States also contributes. Many developing nations heavily borrowed in foreign currencies, which has fueled worries over a balance of payments crisis or debt defaults. =Geopolitical rivalries= In spite of longstanding geopolitical rivalries ‚Äì notably the GCC bloc versus Iran and Venezuela ‚Äì emerging markets oil producers within and outside OPEC maintained at least some output discipline until the fall of 2014, when Saudi Arabia advocated higher OPEC production and lower price levels to erode the profitability of high-cost shale oil production. It has been suggested that the Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict was a powerful influence in the Saudi decision to launch the price war, as was Cold War rivalry between the United States and Russia. Larry Elliott argued that \\"with the help of its Saudi ally, Washington is trying to drive down the oil price by flooding an already weak market with crude. As the Russians and the Iranians are heavily dependent on oil exports, the assumption is that they will become easier to deal with.\\" Vice President of Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft, accused Saudi Arabia of conspiring against Russia. Some geoeconomics experts have argued that the Saudi ‚Äì Qatari rivalry has shattered the semblance of unity that may have existed amongst fossil fuel producers: :What we‚Äôre witnessing here is a fight to the death between the world‚Äôs leading oil and natural gas producers at a time when fossil fuel prices are collapsing across the board. =Combating climate change= The environmental impacts of fossil fuels, especially oil, led to government policies promoting the use of zero-carbon energy sources to prevent or slow climate change. Future action on such environmental concerns, ranging from climate change to smog, has seriously hurt the notion that oil demand would forever rise. One example of international action to attempt to curb fossil fuel use is the 2016 Paris Climate Accords, though its effects and impacts are controversial and the United States has already withdrawn from it. The EU has implemented a bloc-wide carbon tax, while many nations are raising fuel taxes and are implementing carbon taxes. Zero carbon energy, especially renewables like wind and solar, are being subsidized to support their adoption. One commentator has said that the \\"energy revolution\\" has forced oil producers with large reserves to produce as much of their reserves as fast as possible, while oil still has energy value. Oil exporters are \\"unable to sit on their reserves to attempt a higher price tomorrow.\\" Effects =Venezuela= Under Hugo Ch√°vez and his Bolivarian government, PDVSA resources were used to fund social programmes, with Ch√°vez treating it like a \\"piggybank\\". His social policies resulted in overspending that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world. According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew \\"from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006\\";Cannon, p. 87. oil exports increased \\"from 77% in 1997 ... to 89% in 2006\\"; and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was \\"one of the chief problems facing the Ch√°vez government\\". By 2008, exports of everything but oil \\"collapsed\\". and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is \\"extremely vulnerable\\" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 \\"96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue\\" relied on oil production. When oil prices dropped in 2015, this worsened the crisis Venezuela was experiencing from the government's mismanagement. Venezuela's economic crisis has been called ‚Äúthe worst economic collapse outside of war since World War II.‚Äù =Cuba= Immediately after the death of Hugo Chavez, Castro sought a new benefactor as the oil that was shipped from Venezuela to Cuba began to slow. With Cuba needing new support, relations between the United States and Cuba began to be reestablished in 2014 during United States‚ÄìCuban Thaw. However, in 2016, Cuba still relied on Venezuela's oil and economic assistance. With Cuba's economy slowing as a result of Venezuela's own crisis, many Cubans feared that their nation would soon return to having similar experiences to that of the Special Period, which occurred following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which Cuba heavily relied on. OPEC The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been seriously affected by the 2014 collapse in prices. Shale production robbed OPEC of a large portion of its market power, forcing OPEC to cooperate with other producers to keep prices up after Saudi Arabia effectively declared defeat in the price war in 2016. Many OPEC members, such as Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Ecuador, and Nigeria, have had internal crisis spawned or worsened by the collapse in oil revenues. In many of these nations, the response to the 2011 Arab Spring was spending oil money for internal stability, which has caused financial troubles for these nations as oil revenue dried up.

He kicked two goals on the day, though Manly were beaten 15-11.Rugby League Tables - Rd.7, 1959 Playing behind representative fullback and club captain Ron Willey, Batty played mostly in Reserve Grade for Manly, winning the Reserves premiership in 1960 before getting his chance when Willey moved to Parramatta in 1963. With Willey's departure, Batty moved permanently into the fullback role and also took on the goal kicking duties for the first grade side. He would be a fixture in the Manly side until his retirement after a trial game before the 1972 season, making way for 18 year old goal kicking fullback Graham Eadie to take over the role. Ironically, after making his debut against Newtown at Brookvale in 1959, Batty's last regular premiership game for the Sea Eagles was also against the Bluebags at Brookvale Oval in the final round of the 1971 season.

He has previously served as vice-governor and local deputy. Biography Casas has been a local deputy for the La Rioja Province from 2005 to 2011. He served as vice-governor from 2011 to 2015, under Luis Beder Herrera. He won the primary elections in the local Justicialist Party to run as governor, defeating the ministers Javier Tineo and N√©stor Bosetti; Bosetti would run as his candidate for vicegovernor. He was elected governor in 2015 with the 53% of the vote. The candidate of the Radical Civic Union denounced electoral fraud, but eventually accepted Casas' victory. The province allows for a re-election, but as he served as vice-governor and governor in two consecutive terms, he may not run again in 2019. He acknowledges both the former governor Beder Herrera and the former president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner as political leaders. Casas attended the presidential inauguration of Mauricio Macri on December 10, 2015, despite of the instructions from the Front for Victory to avoid doing so. He then returned to La Rioja, to take office as governor. He had a personal meeting with Macri shortly after they took office, and they talked about the problems of the province. They agreed in the need to improve the infrastructure of the province. In contrast with Beder Herrera, Casas received the local mayors and legislators of other political parties, to arrange joint actions on behalf of the province. He announced that he would promote the production of tomatoes. He made an amendment to the constitution of La Rioja, to be able to run for a new term in 2019. It was followed by a referendum: only 43.95% of the registered voters attended it, and of those 25.27% supported the amendment and 17.90% rejected it. However, the local parties do not agree on the interpretation of the results. Cambiemos, the main opposition party, considers that Casas should have obtained 35% of the vote to approve the amendment, and Casas considers that it is instead the explicit rejection the one that should have achieved such 35%. As a result, they do not agree if the amendment should be in force or not.

As with other ambers, a wide variety of taxa have been found as inclusions including insects and other arthropods, as well as plant fragments and epiphyllous fungi.  Context  Mexican amber is mainly recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. It is one of the main minerals recovered in the state of Chiapas, much of which is 25 million years old, with quality comparable to that found in the Dominican Republic. Chiapan amber has a number of unique qualities, including much that is clear all the way through and some with fossilized insects and plants. Most Chiapan amber is worked into jewelry including pendants, rings and necklaces. Colors vary from white to yellow/orange to a deep red, but there are also green and pink tones as well. Since pre-Hispanic times, native peoples have believed amber to have healing and protective qualities. The largest amber mine is in Simojovel, a small village 130 km from Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, which produces 95% of Chiapas' amber. Other mines are found in Huitiup√°n, Totolapa, El Bosque, Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuac√°n, Pantelh√≥ and San Andr√©s Duraznal. According to the Museum of Amber in San Crist√≥bal, almost 300 kg of amber is extracted per month from the state. Prices vary depending on quality and color. The amber dates from between 22.5 million years old, for the youngest sediments of the Balumtun Sandstone and 26 million years old for the oldest La Quinta Formation.  Origin  The amber was produced by either the two extinct leguminous trees Hymenaea mexicana or Hymenaea allendis, both of which were initially described from fossil flowers included in Mexican amber.  Fossil inclusions  Piece of amber with scorpion as seen through magnifying glass at the Museum of Amber in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico The Tityus apozonalli scorpion holotype fossil is composed of a very complete adult male recovered from the Guadalupe Victoria site. The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest. The Guadalupe Victoria site is an outcrop of amber bearing strata belonging to the Mazantic Shale and Balumtum Sandstone. The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem.

The first to open was a branch line of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway from Tweedmouth near Berwick, to Sprouston. It opened in 1849. The next was a branch from the North British Railway Hawick branch line at St Boswells, to a temporary station just outside Kelso. As the St Boswells to Kelso branch line, it opened in 1850. The gap between the two lines was closed, and a permanent station at Kelso was opened, in 1851. Finally the independent Jedburgh Railway opened its line from Roxburgh in 1856. Although woollen manufacture was an important industry locally, the economy was largely agricultural. The two lines reaching Kelso directly were under competing managements, and they failed to develop a through service over the line. With the rise of reliable road transport and improved roads, goods and passenger carryings on the lines declined from the 1930s. The Jedburgh line passenger service closed in 1948, and the passenger service on the other lines was heavily reduced in 1955 and withdrawn in 1964. History =Background= Kelso's industry was a little different to that of the other famous woollen towns of the borders; a writer in 1825 said: > Kelso, though not entitled to rank among the commercial towns of Scotland, > has nevertheless a considerable trade... The first and principal branch is > the dressing of lamb and sheep skins, the tanning of hides and the currying > of leather, all which are carried on to a vast extent ... Pork is here cured > to a great extent, which finds a ready sale in the English market. The > manufacture of flannel is pretty extensive, as is also that of different > kinds of linen. Woollen cloth is likewise made here but not in any great > quantity... Boot and shoe-making is carried on upon a very large scale... > disposing of immense quantities at the different fairs and markets in the > north of England.James Haig, A Topographical and Historical Account of the > Town of Kelso, John Fairbairn, Edinburgh, 1825 Jedburgh, with a population of 5,251 in 1821, was predominantly engaged in agriculture, although the manufacture of blankets and carpets was also significant, as well as there being an iron foundry and a manufacturer of printing presses.The New Statistical Account of Scotland, volume V, William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh, 1835 The location of the towns, remote from navigable water, made transport of products and raw materials difficult. =First railway authorisation= A railway to Kelso was first projected in 1809, to run from Berwick, where the harbour would give access to coastal shipping. The line, The Berwick and Kelso Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation on 31 May 1811.Joseph Priestley, Historical Account of the Navigable Rives, Canals and Railways of Great Britain, Longman Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831 It was the first railway in Northumberland to obtain an Act of authorisation (and the first anywhere to refer to the conveyance of passengers in its Act).W W Tomlinson, The North Eastern Railway: Its Rise and Development, Andrew Reid and Company, Limited, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1914, page 32 It was to start from Spittal, near Tweedmouth, which at that time was in County Durham, which then had a detached portion there; it is in Northumberland now. The scheme was not proceeded with, and was formally abandoned in 1827, but local promoters revived the scheme in 1836 and had the estimates for construction updated: they amounted to ¬£100,000 for a 22 mile line. This too came to nothing,K Hoole, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 4: The North East, David and Charles, Dawlish, 1965 and the Berwick and Kelso Railway Company was dissolved in January 1838. =Main line railways= The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its main line in 1842, showing that a general railway could be successful, where in the past practically all railways had been involved with bringing coal or another mineral from its source. At the same time as the E&GR; was being built, the English network seemed to be taking shape, and it was considered urgently necessary to determine the route that a line from central Scotland to England might take. For some time it was assumed that only a single railway route could be commercially viable, and great consideration was given to the route it might take. This was particularly significant because of the barrier of the Southern Uplands and the Cheviot Hills, both considered passable only with great difficulty. A route put forward by G Remington was proposed to run from Edinburgh through Lauder, Kelso, Wooler and Morpeth to Newcastle; the line was to use the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway, a horse-drawn line using stone block sleepers, for access to Edinburgh. A Government commission, the so- called Smith-Barlow Commission, examined this and numerous other routes, but Remington had not prepared estimates of cost for his line; it was said to require works of a most formidable character, and would cost so much that it could not conceivably pay. His scheme fell by the wayside.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722‚Äì1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, In fact the first main line between central Scotland and England was the North British Railway route, running from Edinburgh through Dunbar to Berwick, where it met the Newcastle and Berwick Railway. At first the line was not carried over the River Tweed and through passengers had to walk, or be conveyed by coach, across the road bridge. While the North British Railway was building its main line, the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, authorised by Act of 13 July 1845, with capital of ¬£1,400,000, was building its line. Its prime objective was to further the chain of railways that was to form the East Coast route from London to Scotland; its main line was to be 65 miles in length, but there were to be several branches, for which powers were obtained in 1846, including a branch from Tweedmouth to Kelso. The Newcastle and Berwick Railway merged with the York and Newcastle Railway, becoming the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway on 9 August 1847. The Newcastle and Berwick Railway completed its line between Tweedmouth and Newcastle on 1 July 1847. =Tweedmouth to Sprouston= Construction of the branch from Tweeedmouth to Sprouston followed, and it opened as a double track on 27 July 1849.Roger Darsley and Dennis Lovett, Berwick to St Boswells via Kelso including the Jedburgh Branch, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2015, Tomlinson Goods train operation seems to have started earlier. The line followed the southern bank of the River Tweed as far as Sprouston. It had been intended to reach Kelso, another two miles, but hostility from the Duke of Roxburghe prevented this for the time being, so Sprouston became the station for Kelso. > The Berwick and Kelso Railway: This railway, a branch of the York, Newcastle > and Berwick line was on Monday last (23 July 1849) examined by Capt. Wynne, > the Inspector-General of Railways... The whole length of the line is 20¬º > miles from Tweedmouth to the village of Sprouston, which is the Kelso > terminus of the railway, though at a distance of between two and three miles > from the town of Kelso. There are stations at Velvet Hall, Norham, Cornhill, > Carham and Sprouston, from whence omnibuses are to run to Kelso in > connection with each train... Goods trains have for several weeks been > running between Tweedmouth and Sprouston, but the line is to be opened > tomorrow [27 July 1849].Edinburgh Evening Post and Scottish Standard, 28 > July 1849, reprinting an article from the Berwick Warder, 26 July 1849 At this stage the Royal Border Bridge crossing the River Tweed and connecting Berwick and Tweedmouth had not yet opened; it did so on 29 July 1850, to goods trains only at first. The junction at Tweedmouth faced the south, so that through trains from Berwick had to reverse there. Sprouston was regarded as a permanent terminus, and all facilities including an engine shed and turntable were provided there. The initial train service was three trains daily each way, two on Sunday. The Y&NBR; stations at Carham and Sprouston and 3¬Ω miles of track in their vicinity \\"were the only conquests ever made by an English company on Scottish soil\\".John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, =St Boswells to Kelso= By the end of 1844, with their main line not yet open, the North British Railway were planning a branch line to Carlisle. This prodigious scheme was portrayed at first as simply a branch from near Edinburgh to Hawick, in itself a huge project, and a branch to Kelso was being discussed. The plans took shape and at a Shareholders' Meeting on 9 February 1846 a large collection of branches were approved, including a group from the Hawick line to Kelso, Jedburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, with share capital of ¬£770,000. The Act was secured on 26 June 1846. Tenders were accepted in early 1847. The Kelso branch route was 12¬Ω miles long from Kelso Junction at St Boswells; it ran for eight miles down the Tweed Valley before crossing the River Teviot on a high stone arch viaduct (Roxburgh Viaduct). The line from St Boswells to Kelso opened on 17 June 1850,Ross, pages 34 and 239, says 7 June 1850, but this seems to be a mistake. but at first this was only to a temporary station at Wallace Nick, (often spelt Wallacenick, ) about a mile west of Kelso.Henry Grote Lewin, The Railway Mania and its Aftermath, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, revised edition 1968, This too was due to the objections of the Duke of Roxburghe. =Closing the gap= Two railways had tried to reach Kelso but were obliged to stop short: the York, Newcastle and Berwick RailwayThe York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway was the successor to the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, since a merger on 9 August 1847. In 1854 a further merger made the YN&BR; part of the North Eastern Railway. branch from Tweedmouth at Sprouston, and the North British Railway branch from St Boswells at Wallace Nick. An accommodation with the Duke of Roxburghe seems to have been made, and the two railways worked together to close the gap. In fact they met half way, by an end-on junction at Mellendean Farm, east of Kelso. There was no station or other facility there. The North British built the new Kelso station, but this was in a district of Kelso called Maxwellheugh, inconveniently located south of the River Tweed. The new railway opened between Wallace Nick and Sprouston on 1 June 1851, and Wallace Nick station closed.1 June 1851 seems to be the consensus. Dissenters are Thomas (volume 1 page 239): Wallacenick to Maxwellheugh 1 January 1851; Ross (page 239): Wallacenick to Maxwellheugh 7 January 1851; Darsley and Lovett (caption to picture 59): the North Eastern (sic) \\"did not reach the town until 27th January 1851\\"; also (caption to map XVIII) Wallacenick to Sprouston opened 27 July 1851; Lewin (page 522): NBR to Maxwellheugh 27 January 1851; Maxwellheugh to Sprouston NBR and YN&BR; 1 June 1851; and Quick (page 168), quoting Grevill: 27 January 1851.M D Grevill, Temporary Stations, in Railway and Canal Historical Society Journal, volume 4, no 6, November 1958 In building a portion of line beyond Kelso, the North British Railway clearly had expectations of running through to Berwick. The YN&BR; trains used the NBR Kelso station. For a short time in 1854 a through passenger service was operated, but relations between the NBR and the North Eastern Railway (successor to the YN&BR;) became strained over negotiations for through running between Berwick and Edinburgh, and from the Border Counties Railway to Newcastle upon Tyne, and as a result of the antagonism the service at Kelso was stopped from running through. Punctuality leaving Tweedmouth was heavily dependent on the timekeeping of main line trains from the south, and for local passengers from Kelso westward this made the service hopelessly unreliable. By 1859 through tickets were not available; passengers had to rebook at Kelso., and in fact the timetables were not co-ordinated to give useful connections there. Many references use the term Maxwellheugh for Kelso station.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 =Jedburgh branch= Construction of the Jedburgh branch was authorised in the North British Railway Act of 26 June 1846, along with the Kelso line and other branches. However the Jedburgh line was not proceeded with, and an independent company, the Jedburgh Railway Company obtained its own authorising Act on 25 July 1855; capital was ¬£35,000. It opened its line on 17 July 1856, and the line was worked by the North British Railway. The Jedburgh Railway Company was absorbed by the North British Railway by Act of 3 July 1860, effective from 31 July 1860, and from that time the line was simply a branch of the North British.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The line was seven miles long, and kept to the west bank of the River Teviot as far as Nisbet; it then crossed to the south bank following the Jed Water into Jedburgh. Stations were (at first) Old Ormiston, Nisbet, Jedfoot and Jedburgh. Jedburgh station had an overall roof, but the location of the station at ¬æ mile from the market place was awkward, and an omnibus connection was operated for some years. Passenger trains generally ran to Kelso, reversing at Roxburgh. =Alnwick branch= In 1887 the North Eastern Railway built a branch line from Alnwick to Coldstream, on the Kelso line; it opened on 5 September 1887. It was never heavily used, and the Alnwick line closed to passengers in September 1930, but goods trains continued to serve Wooler until 29 July 1965. =Train service in 1895= The passenger train service in 1895 consisted of five trains each way on weekdays between Berwick and Kelso, with an additional short working from Berwick to Coldstream, in connection with the Alnwick branch there. There were two trains each way throughout on Sundays. On the Kelso to St Boswells and Jedburgh section there were five trains each way weekdays, two on Sundays, making connections at Roxburgh for the Jedburgh line which had a similar service, running from Kelso to Jedburgh. There seems to have been no attempt to arrange good connections at Kelso.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland, December 1895, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, The twentieth century =Shunting at Kelso= There was a celebrated horse at Kelso in the early years of the twentieth century, employed in shunting. The curves in the yard were exceptionally severe and a steam locomotive was unable to negotiate them. However in 1921 the North British acquired a petrol shunting locomotive of extremely short wheelbase, such that the driver sat athwart the vehicle. This replaced the horse shunting and reduced the annual cost from ¬£1,180 to ¬£904, although the company spent ¬£121 on easing the curves in addition.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, Darsley and Lovett have it arriving a little later: Petrol engine no 1 arrived at Kelso in September 1923; it cost ¬£1200. It was sent to Cowlairs works and fitted with a much larger cab, and returned to Kelso in December 1927. The LNER classified it as class Z6 no 8431. In July 1930 it was transferred to Ware, on the Great Eastern section. It was the North British Railway's only non-steam motive power. A Sentinel shunting locomotive class Y1 no 7134 was based at Kelso from 1928 to 1955; it was the only Sentinel locomotive in Scotland. After 1955 it was moved to Ayr, where it worked until 1959. =1920 traffic= The year 1920 was a peak year for the towns in the area; the Jedburgh branch in particular took ¬£21,126 in the year, and Kirkbank station dispatched 11,748 head of cattle. The passenger train service had declined, however, with three trains plus two short workings between Berwick and Kelso weekdays, two on Sundays; and six westbound, five eastbound on the Kelso to St Boswells section; one eastbound train is noted as through to Berwick. The Jedburgh line had six trains each way weekdays, not so carefully arranged to connect from Jedburgh to St Boswells at Roxburgh. There was no Sunday service west of Kelso.Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide, Guild Publishing, London, 1985 =Grouping of the railways= A rail tour on the line in the Roxburgh area in 1961.In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" under the Railways Act 1921. Both the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway were constituents of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The combined management of the railways west and east of Kelso did not result in any improved co-ordination of the passenger services through the town. =Singling= In 1933 the St Boswells (Kelso Junction) to Kelso section was reduced from double track to single: Kelso Junction to Roxburgh Junction was singled on 5 November whilst Roxburgh Junction to Kelso was singled on 10 December. After closure to freight traffic from Tweedmouth to Kelso in 1965 by NERegion/ScRegion, only one track of this double track section was removed, and, for a few years, a single, but out-of-use line remained between Kelso and Tweedmouth. After withdrawal of the ScRegion freight service to Kelso (now utilising a 350hp 0-6-0 shunter based at Galashiels) in 1968, lifting of the complete branch started at the Kelso Junction in 1969, the contractors working eastwards to Tweedmouth. =1938 train service= Twizel ViaductIn 1938 the passenger train service was under unified command under the LNER, but there was still limited evidence of co-ordination of the two lines at Kelso. The Berwick line had four trains plus a short working to Coldstream on weekdays, with an additional Saturday train. The St Boswells line had seven daily trains with two extra Saturday trains; several had through carriages to or from Edinburgh via St Boswells and one ran through to and from Berwick. None of the other connections at Kelso were practical. However there was a Sunday through train from Newcastle to Edinburgh via Tweedmouth, Kelso and St Boswells, with a buffet car. It left Newcastle at 10:30 a.m. and called at Morpeth, Alnmouth, Tweedmouth 11:58 - 12:05, Norham, Coldstream, Kelso 12:39, St Boswells 1:04 to 1:09 p.m., Melrose, Galashiels, Portobello, and arrived at Edinburgh at 2:15 p.m. The return journey left Edinburgh at 5:45 p.m., Portobello, Galashiels, Melrose, St Boswells 6:58, Kelso 7:20, Coldstream, Norham, Tweedmouth 8:00 to 8.07, Alnmouth, Morpeth and arrived at Newcastle 8:57. This service ran from 1933 to 1939. The Jedburgh branch had 6 trains each way on weekdays, with two additional trains on Saturdays.Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David and Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, 0 7153 4686 5 Nationalisation In 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were nationalised, and the lines in the area came under the control of British Railways (BR). The BR Scottish Region controlled the lines from Carham westward, and the BR North Eastern Region the lines eastward from Carham boundary marker. =1948 floods= During the autumn of 1948, the Borders area and the east coast of Berwickshire experienced exceptional rainfall, which reached a peak on 12 August 1948. This resulted in the breaching of the main line between Berwick and Dunbar in several places, as well as the Jedburgh branch. The Jedburgh branch service was suspended temporarily on 13 August, and for some time, through main line passenger and goods trains were diverted over the Kelso line, from Tweedmouth to St Boswells, and then over the Waverley Route to Edinburgh. The decision was made not to resume the Jedburgh line passenger service, partly due to the increased movement of trains between Roxburgh and Kelso, a section of track that most of the branch trains also used. =Line closures= Although the Jedburgh branch passenger service never recommenced, goods services were reinstated. They were discontinued from 10 August 1964. For many years after the closure to passengers, there was an annual Church excursion from Jedburgh to Spittal Beach at Tweedmouth. A thousand passengers were the norm on these trains, which continued until June 1964. The Tweedmouth to St Boswells passenger service was threatened with closure in 1955, but the train service was cut considerably instead: > Five stations to be closed on Tweedmouth - St Boswellls Line. British > Railways estimate that they will save ¬£7,744 in a year as a result of > economies which are to be introduced on the Berwick to St Boswells Branch > line.

The cut in the number of trains has been > enforced as an economy measure ... As a result the stations of Twizell, > Sunnilaws, Velvet Hall, Sprouston and Carham will be closed to passengers, > and the trains will stop only at Kelso, Coldstream, Norham and > Tweedmouth.The Berwick Advertiser: 2 June 1955 The stations between Kelso and St Boswells were not affected at that stage, but the skeleton service continued to lose money. The line between St Boswells and Tweedmouth closed to passengers on 15 June 1964, and to all trains on 1 April 1968. Railway replacement Footbridge below Roxburgh ViaductIn 1998‚Äì1999 the footbridge attached to the Roxburgh Viaduct was being repaired. By then it had become the responsibility of the British Railway Board Residuary Body, responsible for former British Railways liabilities that had not been disposed of. The viaduct was legitimately used as a footpath, but it had to be closed during the works, and the alternative walking route for schoolchildren in Heiton attending Roxburgh school was unreasonably long and circuitous. The BRB residuary body arranged a replacement school bus during the work. Topography =Tweedmouth to Kelso= Built as double track. The line opened from Tweedmouth to Sprouston on 27 July 1849 and closed to passengers on 15 June 1964. Stations were at: * Tweedmouth; trains for Kelso left northwards; * Velvet Hall; closed 4 July 1955; * Norham; * Twizel; opened November 1861; closed 4 July 1955; * Cornhill; renamed Coldstream 1 October 1873; * Wark; renamed Sunilaws 1 October 1871; closed 4 July 1955; * Carham; open 27 July 1849; closed 4 July 1955; * Sprouston; opened 27 July 1849; closed 4 July 1955; originally terminus; closed 4 July 1955; * Kelso; opened 27 January 1851. Carham village was in England but the station was in Scotland; Carham and Sprouston are the only Scottish railway stations belonging to an English railway company. Gradients: from the zero mile post at Tweedmouth the line undulated then climbing at 1 in 140 for much of the way to Velvet Hall; further undulations followed, though generally falling as far as Twizell then climbing at 1 in 167 towards Coldstream. From there a three mile climb at 1 in 330 followed to past Sunilaws, with further undulations ending with a 1 in 72 climb into Kelso station. =Kelso to St Boswells= Built as double track; opened from Wallace Nick to Kelso Junction on 17 June 1850; closed to passengers on 15 June 1964. The line was singled in stages in 1933. * Kelso; above; * Wallace Nick; opened as temporary terminus 17 June 1850; closed on extension to permanent Kelso station 27 January 1851; * Roxburgh; sometimes known as Roxburgh Junction during currency of the Jedburgh branch; * Rutherford; * Maxton; * Charlsfield Depot; not a station but a loop and siding connection near Merwick cottage; the depot was an Ordnance Depot; it opened in 1942 and closed in 1945; it was then a Royal Naval Armaments Depot in 1949, but finally closed in 1961; * Kelso Junction; convergence with Hawick line; * New Town St Boswells; station on Hawick line; later renamed St Boswells. Gradients: from the zero milepost at Kelso Junction, the line fell at 1 in 100 to Maxton, rising gently to Rutherford and then descending again at a ruling gradient of 1 in 100 to Roxburgh; from there it climbed at 1 in 135 for 1¬Ω miles before descending at 1 in 72 to Kelso station. =Jedburgh branch= The line was opened on 17 July 1856, and closed to ordinary passenger trains on 13 August 1948. It was a single line. * Roxburgh Junction; above; * Old Ormiston; renamed Kirkbank 20 May 1868; closed 13 August 1948; * Nisbet; * Jedfoot Bridge; early renamed Jedfoot; * Jedburgh. The line fell with gradients at 1 in 110 and level sections to beyond the 2 milepost (zero was at Roxburgh Junction); there was then a mile of level and further falls to beyond Nisbet, where the line climbed again from the 5 milepost to Jedburgh at a ruling gradient of 1 in 147.

The entire course of the river lies within the Siuslaw National Forest. The map includes mile markers along the Smith River. The river supports populations of Chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, cutthroat trout, and lamprey. Fishing in Oregon, a sportfishing guide, describes the river as \\"a beautiful wild trout stream\\". Degraded in past decades by logging, splash dams, and in-stream debris removal, the stream has been chosen for restoration. Using grant money from the state, the Partnership for Umpqua Rivers has been placing thousands of boulders in the streambed to improve the spawning, rearing, and refugia habitat for fish.

A US coast defense battery with two guns on disappearing carriages, similar to the batteries at Fort Armistead. Fort Armistead was a United States Army coastal defense fort, active from 1901 to 1920, that defended Baltimore, Maryland.Berhow, p. 211 History Fort Armistead was built from 1897 to 1901 as part of the large-scale Endicott Program. Other forts of this era in the Coast Defenses of Baltimore include Fort Howard, Fort Carroll, and Fort Smallwood. Fort Armistead is in the Hawkins Point section of the city. The fort is named for Major George Armistead (1780-1818, later promoted to Colonel), commander of Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore with the British Royal Navy attack in September 1814 in the War of 1812 that inspired \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" writing of the poem by Francis Scott Key that later set to music became the American national anthem in 1931. The battle and bombardment has since been celebrated annually by the city / county / and state as Defenders Day.Fort Armistead article at FortWiki.com Fort Armistead had four gun batteries: Battery Winchester with one 12-inch M1888 disappearing gun, Battery McFarland with three 8-inch M1888 disappearing guns, Battery Irons with two 4.72-inch 45 caliber Armstrong guns on pedestal mounts, and Battery Mudge with two 3-inch M1898 guns on masking parapet (retractable) mounts. Battery Winchester was named for James Winchester, a Maryland officer in the Revolutionary War and a general in the War of 1812. Battery McFarland was named for Daniel McFarland, an officer killed in the War of 1812. Battery Irons was named for Joseph Irons, killed in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Battery Mudge was named for Robert R. Mudge, killed in action against the Seminoles. The fort also included a mine casemate and command station to control a naval minefield in the harbor.Baltimore forts at NorthAmericanForts.com Battery Irons had been added to Fort Armistead as part of a series of measures to quickly deploy modern weapons to the East Coast after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing Office The Endicott Program was still years from completion, and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the U.S. Battery Irons was disarmed in 1913 and the guns sent to Fort Ruger in Hawaii. After the American entry into World War I in April 1917, many guns were removed from coast defenses for potential service on the Western Front. Most of these weapons were not sent overseas or did not see action; however, most of the heavy guns in the Baltimore area were dismounted in 1917‚Äì18 and not returned to the forts. Battery McFarland's three 8-inch guns were removed in 1917 for potential use as railway artillery, while Battery Winchester's 12-inch gun was sent to Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, New York to replace a gun sent to the railway artillery program.Fort Wadsworth article at FortWiki.com With the war over, in 1920 Fort Armistead's service came to a close; Battery Mudge's 3-inch guns were scrapped as part of a general withdrawal from service of the 3-inch M1898 gun type. In World War II (1939/41 - 1945), the fort site was briefly reclaimed by the military and used by the United States Navy for ammunition storage. In 1952‚Äì54 a four-gun 90 mm anti- aircraft battery was stationed on site. Present After World War I, the fort property was declared surplus and abandoned by the United States Department of War and the U.S. Army in 1923. Five years later it was turned over to the City of Baltimore's Department of Recreation and Parks (Bureau of Parks). It is now a Baltimore city park and at various occasions during subsequent decades was given various improvements and landscaping projects, including construction of a fishing pier and parking lot. In 1975-1977, the Hawkins Point area was impacted by the construction of the Outer Harbor Crossing carrying the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695) over the Patapsco Harbor, named the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which now towers over the 1890s era seacoast defense site below. The batteries are partly buried in the underground with tunnels and a deep trench providing access but often overrun with shrubs, small trees and weeds after infrequent widespread cutting and mowing, but are still visible. The fort and surrounding tunnels are open to exploration, though largely abandoned by the city and unfortunately covered with graffiti on the deteriorating poured concrete walls and garbage litter.

He is known for his work in chemical reaction engineering, complex reacting systems, multiple steady-states reactor design, dynamics of chemical reactors, and combustion.  Career  Luss received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1960 and Masters of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1963 from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel. In 1966, he received a Ph.D from the University of Minnesota in Chemical Engineering, with a thesis on reaction engineering supervised by Professor Neal Amundson. In 1966, he served one year as Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. In 1967, Luss joined the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Houston as an assistant professor. Promotion to Associate Professor (1969-1972) and Professor (1972 - Present) preceded his appointment as Cullen Professor in 1984. He served as chairmen of its Department of Chemical Engineering first from 1975 to 1995 and again from 1999-2000, and as Associate Director of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston in 1988. He completely or jointly supervised nearly 75 Ph.D. and Masters theses, and published well over 200 journal articles.  Research  Luss' research has been primarily in the causes of steady-state multiplicity and dynamics of chemical reactors. This research led to improvements in the safer operation of industrial reactors and to a more reliable development and operation of novel reactor types. He also made contributions to the modeling of multi-reaction systems leading to many follow-up studies. His group is currently conducting research on several topics. The main emphasis is on problem related to the reduction of environmental emissions from diesel engines. These include enhancement of the efficiency and safety of the regeneration diesel particulate filters, development of novel catalyst architectures which improve the destruction of NOx and organic compounds emitted by diesel engines. We also conduct studies of novel synthesis of solid oxides and the dynamic features of the combustion of solid nano-particles. Specific research projects include: = Combustion of soot in diesel particulate filters = A major research activity in his Department is the reduction of NOx emissions in the oxidizing exhaust emissions of diesel engines. This reduction may be conducted by use of selective Catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR) which required feed of ammonia precursor or by use of Lean NOx Trap (LNT) which contains expensive precious metals. Another option is the use a reactor with LNT catalyst followed by one with SCR to avoid the need to inject ammonia precursors. Luss and colleagues are conducting both experimental and simulation studies of novel catalyst architecture with goal to enable a reduction of the expensive precious metal without affecting the effectiveness of the NOx destruction. = Development of novel catalyst architecture = The presence of excessive high local temperatures (hot spots) can severely damage chemical reactors and monolith reactors used to destruct environmental pollutants. There is a technological to detect the amplitude and motion of small hot zones the location of which is not known and which may meander with time. Dan Luss and colleagues have recently developed a novel technique for measuring the spatio- temporal temperature, which measures continuously the temporal temperature profile along a special optical fiber. The technique is currently used to measure the temperature profiles in a monolith reactor and a packed bed reactor in which several reactions are conducted. This novel technique is expected to lead to major advances in the measurements and control of temperature in chemical reactors and provide essential information that could not have been obtained until now. = Nanoparticle synthesis and pressure release during their combustion = Luss and colleagues have developed a novel method for the synthesis of solid oxides by having a high temperature front propagate through a mixture of carbon and some minerals. The method (which has a 2 mm spatial resolution and temperature resolution of 0.5 C) enables a more economic synthesis than do other methods. Moreover, it can be used directly to produce nano-particles. Luss and co-workers currently conduct studies on the impact of the operating conditions and reactants mixture composition on the product properties and the magnitude of the amplitude and duration of the pressure pulse generated by the released gaseous products and its dependence on the nano particles size.  Honors  Luss was awarded the Alan P. Colburn Award by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1972 and elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1984. He was awarded the Wilhelm Award by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1986 and became an AIChE Fellow in 1990. In 2005, he was awarded the Founders Award by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). In 2010, he was awarded the Near R. Amundson Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering, which was awarded at the 2010 ISCRE symposium in Philadelphia, PA. In addition, he has served as editor for numerous publications including Reviews in Chemical Engineering, Industrial Engineering Chemical Research, Catalysis Reviews ‚Äì Science and Engineering, and AIChE Journal.

It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 and the Amstrad CPC in 1986. The game contains elements of dungeon crawling and revolves around a customisable player-character navigating through catacombs in order to secure a large wealth of treasure, whilst simultaneously collecting seven pieces of sacred armour. The game was released with dedicated t-shirts, badges and posters. It suffered from several delays throughout 1985 due to the complexity of programming. Swords and Sorcery received positive reviews from critics upon release; prominent praise included the graphics, colours, animation and its menu interface. It also won the \\"Game of the Month\\" award from Computer and Video Games in January 1986. Gameplay first person view of a location, and a command box. In this screenshot, the player-character has died and the Grim Reaper grants them an extra life. Swords and Sorcery is presented in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait of role playing video games. The game is set in a fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment. Movement through the catacombs is controlled by command inputs and keywords, which is referred to in-game as MIDAS. For example, entering in the word \\"hit\\" will bring down a menu which will display various forms of attacking techniques. The left side of the screen displays an animated first person perspective of the respective tunnel or room the player is in, whereas the right side of the interface displays a general top-down view of the catacombs. The bottom of the screen features a command box and announces available options or hints to the player; flashing arrows indicate where movement is possible throughout the catacombs. During the game, enemies such as gargoyles, catmen and warriors will appear at random and attack the player if confronted. Magic spells such as poison and fire are able to defeat enemies, alongside weaponry such as swords and axes. The player-character has both a health and magic bar, which will slowly deplete once attacked by an enemy or by using magic spells, respectively. Items in the game include treasure and artefacts which may have a chance of giving the player negative effects, such as draining life and paralysing movement. Background The game was announced in summer of 1984, but was delayed several times for over a year. Before its announcement, Swords and Sorcery had been in development from nearly two years prior to 1985. PSS explained the delays as due to game's complexity that required a lot programming man-hours. The game was PSS's biggest launch to date. Upon release, Swords and Sorcery came with t-shirts, badges and posters. Reception The game received positive reviews upon release. Rachael Smith of Your Sinclair praised the imaginative atmosphere the game offered, stating that developers drew the players into a \\"convincing world\\" and speculated that the game would become a \\"cult of sorts\\". Philippa Irving of Crash praised the presentation as \\"super\\" and the graphics as \\"rare for this type of game\\", adding that it also offered \\"brilliant\\" animation which shows the detail in the \\"best way possible\\". Gary Rook of Sinclair User opinionated that Swords and Sorcery was aimed at \\"Rambo- style\\" dungeon explorers. Regarding the graphics, Rook stated that they were \\"not staggering\\", but felt that they served a purpose and would have been \\"deadly dull\\" if the game was text-based only. A reviewer of ZX Computing called it the best Dungeons and Dragons version \\"ever produced on a computer\\", and stated that it was \\"worth the wait\\". A reviewer of Computer and Video Games stated that the game was \\"unique\\" and could not be classified. However, the reviewer did criticise the speed of in-game combat, calling it \\"frustrating\\" at times. Despite this, Computer and Video Games awarded it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award for January 1986. Robert Fripp of German magazine Aktueller Software Markt concluded that the game presented a \\"successful\\" adventure. Bob Wade of Amstrad Action praised the game's presentation, depth and atmosphere but criticized initial complexity and required time commitment. Computer Gamer received the game highly positively, calling it complex, difficult and immersive, giving particularly high points to atmosphere. In a later retrospect of role-playing games, Advanced Computer Entertainment noted that common criticism of the game was similar to \\"exploring a car park\\", however the reviewer praised the game's ability to portray a \\"complex\\" world.

Early life and career  Joyce Kennedy was born in Anguilla, Mississippi, in 1948. Growing up as a young African American woman in Mississippi had little to no effect on young Joyce. This was due to the fact her grandparents were Masons, which allowed the family to own their own property, grow their own produce, and keep away from the racial tensions of the time. Her stay in Mississippi allowed her to enjoy the company of her family. In an interview done by the Jungle Room, Kennedy recalled how her grandmother would play the piano and sing throughout their home and while cousins would play their instruments by ear. Music was a recurring theme in the Kennedy household. After the death of her grandfather when she was 7, Kennedy moved to Chicago with her mother. It was there she began her singing career. In 1963, Joyce released her first single. With the help of Andre Williams, she recorded her first song for Ran-Dee Records. The song Darling I Still Love You became a local hit, which inspired her to further pursue her singing career.  Mother's Finest  Kennedy met Glenn Murdock, formerly of The Vondells and they started to perform together as a duo and eventually got married. Murdock and Kennedy would form what is considered to be the original black rock band: Mother's Finest. They recruited Gary Moore and Jerry Seay on guitar and bass, respectively. Mother's Finest was initially signed with RCA but eventually landed at Epic Records, where their third, fourth, and fifth albums were certified gold. They opened for the likes of Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, The Who, Aerosmith, and AC/DC. The band would go on to sign with Atlantic Records, taking a break after their 1981 album Iron Age while Joyce pursued a solo career. The band reunited in 1989 for Looks Could Kill at Capitol/EMI, with Joyce and Glenn's son Dion taking over drums from original member Barry Borden. They continued through the 1990s on various labels, releasing and touring primarily in Europe. Their style came through in songs like Baby Love, where they drew from black gospel roots with a choir-like sound and the pattern of call-response between Joyce and her back-up singers. They incorporate synthesizers to achieve a more modern, technological sound. Not unlike Nat King Cole at some points in his career, Mother's Finest struggled to establish a strong connection with black fans. This highly affected their touring, for ‚Äì rather than fighting for a place in American culture at the time ‚Äì they sought what they thought to be the more forward-thinking, progressive culture of Europe. Their album Black Radio Won't Play This Record highlights their disconnection from the black music population, and the name of the album itself displays it. The album's tracklist included songs Like a Negro, which differentiated their everyday experiences as black people as a completely different day-to-day experience. This album touched on many social issues ‚Äì The Wall talked about the growing separation and segregation in terms of religion, and how it is dividing the world. In Power, Joyce questions what sexuality meant in society at that time: ‚ÄúTimes have changed, traditions rearranged‚Ä¶ who says I can‚Äôt make a move on you, who says I can‚Äôt do what a man can do‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis is my body I do what I want, I‚Äôm the one who says if I will or I won‚Äôt.‚Äù  Touring  Mother‚Äôs Finest was known for their interactive and lively performances as well as their progressive music. This led to them being successful in their own way and touring across the world. Mother‚Äôs Finest is also known as ‚Äúa very tough act to follow on stage‚Äù due to their engaging live shows. This is considered to apply even for very popular bands such as those mentioned above or Santana or Earth, Wind & Fire. Mother's Finest tours in Europe more frequently due to audiences being more open to bands that break grounds musically and racially. Concerts such as Rockpalast in 1978 and in 2016 were the norm to the band. They have had such success with the European crowds that they have even signed a recording deal with German indie label Steamhammer.  Solo career  Joyce Kennedy's mentor was Andre Williams, who produced nearly all of her singles for different record companies (Ran Dee, Fontana, and Blues Rock Records) when she first began to sing. Darling I Still Love You was her first local hit released in 1963, which launched her singing career. She released her second song with Ran Dee records entitled Can't Take a Chance, but it failed to succeed like her first hit. She then created Paddle My Own Canoe and released it on Fontana Records. Her second local hit was I'm a Good Girl, again with Fontana Records and Williams still helping her write and produce. While performing throughout all of Chicago, she met Glenn Murdock, who became her husband and formed Mother's Finest with her. In 1984, the band broke up, and Kennedy signed with A&M; Records. Lookin' for Trouble was her debut with A&M.; Along with that single, she released the singles Stronger Than Before and The Last Time I Made Love, which was a duet with Jeffrey Osborne. The Last Time I Made Love was her most successful single, reaching number 2 on the R&B; charts and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Kennedy said the record label tried to have her music appeal to a \\"predominately black\\" audience. Despite going on a \\"farewell\\" tour with Mother's Finest in 2017, proclaiming that she would stop touring with Mother's Finest, Joyce Kennedy still tours with Mother's Finest regularly and will embark on a 50 year anniversary tour in 2020. Joyce Kennedy has a son, Dion, who was raised in her rock 'n‚Äô roll lifestyle.

Life Louis Nicolle was born on 16 June 1871 in Lille, Nord. Nicolle's father was a former naval officer. His mother came from an established family of Lille industrialists. Nicolle attended the lyc√©e in Lille, undertook his year of military service, then entered the business of manufacturing linen from flax. He became honorary chairman of the French Flax Committee, president of the Industrial Society of the Nord and French president of the International Federation of Flax Spinners. He was elected mayor of Lomme. In 1911 Nicolle bought the Vandenbosh flax mill in Wambrechies. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the Germans occupied the town, removed the machinery and dismantled the facilities. After the war Nicolle used compensation for wartime damage to build a modern new factory. The architect Andr√© Granet, nephew of Gustave Eiffel, undertook the project in 1923‚Äì25 using reinforced concrete. The building was a pioneering example of the new construction approach. In 1924 Nicolle was elected deputy on the Democratic Republican Entente list, and was reelected until he retired from political life in 1936. He was Minister of Health from 24 January 1936 to 4 June 1936 in the cabinet of Albert Sarraut. Louis Nicolle died in Paris in the 8th arrondissement on 23 July 1942 at the age of 71.

It is stationed at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island, West Sussex. Formed 1838 as Shah Sujah's Troop, it was part of Shah Sujah's force that attempted to restore him to power in Afghanistan. After the assassination of Shah Sujah in 1842, the battery was transferred to the Bengal Army of the Honourable East India Company. It remained loyal during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and took part in the Siege of Delhi where its commander, George Renny, won the Victoria Cross. In the aftermath, it was transferred to the British Army's Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), eventually becoming T Battery Royal Horse Artillery. It took part in the Second Boer War and the First World War (Western Front and in Italy). The post-war reductions in the RHA saw the battery revert to the Royal Artillery in 1920. In 1926 it was officially granted its Honour Title \\"Shah Sujah's Troop\\". It then took part in the Second World War (Middle East and Italy again). Since the Second World War, it has seen a wide variety of service as anti-tank and anti-aircraft gunners, as a towed and self-propelled anti-aircraft missile battery and as a Headquarters unit. It has spent much of that time in Germany as part of the BAOR, but also served in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and took part in the Falklands War and the Gulf War. The Bty disbanded on the 31/10/1991 with the bulk of the members of the Battery going to 9 Plassey Bty and forming Friday troop. Temporarily reroled to Javelin prior to being the first Troop to convert to the new weapon system HVM starstreak mounted on the Stormer AFV. The Battle honours and name of the Bty then went to the Regts HQ Bty thus then being called THQ Bty Shah Sukah's Troop RA. History =Early history= The battery was formed on 13 September 1838 as Shah Sujah's Troop, Horse Artillery at Delhi and Meerut. It was raised as part of Shah Sujah's force of 6,000 troops which invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to restore him to power. Equipped with ten 6 pounder guns and two 12 pounder howitzers, it was twice the normal strength of a battery. It was commanded by Captain William Anderson of the Bengal Artillery. For two years, from the winter of 1839, it served at Kandahar. After the assassination of Shah Sujah in 1842, the battery was withdrawn to Ferozepore. It was transferred to the Bengal Army of the Honourable East India Company and became the 5th (Native) Troop, 1st Brigade, Bengal Horse Artillery on 23 December 1842. It served in the First Anglo-Sikh War and on frontier expeditions. =Indian Mutiny= By the time the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out, the Bengal Horse Artillery had grown to 13 batteries, organized as three brigades. Four of these batteries were manned by sepoys (native Indian soldiers) and two mutinied: 4th Troop, 1st Brigade at Neemuch and 4th Troop, 3rd Brigade at Multan. Shah Sujah's Troop remained loyal and it took part in the Siege of Delhi where its commander, George Renny, won the Victoria Cross. All four Native Bengal batteries were promptly reformed as European units. As a result of the Rebellion, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bengal Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Artillery as its 2nd and 5th Horse Brigades. On transfer, Shah Sujah's Troop became E Battery, 2nd Horse Brigade (E/2 in short) at Allahabad. =Late Victorian era= A reorganization of the horse artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 2nd Brigade became C Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the batteries were also redesignated and it became F/C Battery at Lucknow. This was the first in a bewildering series of redesignations. From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the battery was designated F/C Battery, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. Further reoganisations saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each) then two (of 13 batteries each) and consequently lead to the redesignation of the battery as F/D (16 January 1873), C/E (1 April 1875), C/C (1 July 1877), and N/B (28 March 1882). The brigade system was finally abolished on 1 July 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. The battery took on it final designation as T Battery, Royal Horse Artillery. Equipped with six 12 pounders, the battery was sent to South Africa with the 1st Cavalry Brigade and saw active service in the Second Boer War, notably at the Battle of Paardeberg (27 February 1900). =First World War= On 1 March 1901, a new brigade system was introduced, this time as a tactical, rather than administrative, formation. The battery was assigned to XIII Brigade- Division, RHA along with U Battery. In 1903 this was redesignated as XIII Brigade, RHA and was stationed in South Africa with the battery at Krugersdorp. By 1905 it was in India and it took part in the Rawalpindi Parade. On 1 October 1906, the brigade was redesignated as XI Brigade, RHA. Photo showing 13 pounder gun team galloping into action. By the time the First World War broke out, the battery had been re-equipped with six quick-firing 13 pounders. It was still assigned to XI Brigade (though U Battery was at Lucknow in India) and was stationed at Abbassia, Cairo serving in the Force in Egypt. It returned to Europe and joined XIV Brigade, 7th Division on the Western Front on 21 December 1914. It served with the division on the Western Front until February 1917. It missed the actions in 1914, but saw considerable action serving in the battles of Neuve Chapelle (1013 March 1915), Aubers Ridge (9 May), Festubert (1519 May), and Givenchy (15 and 16 June). On 19 June, the battery replaced its 13 pounders with six 18 pounders. It then took part in the Battle of Loos (25 September8 October 1915), the Somme (120 July and 37 September 1916) and the Operations on the Ancre (1115 January 1917). On 10 February 1917, the battery and brigade left 7th Division and became XIV Army Brigade, RHA. It moved to the Italian Front in December 1917, before returning to the Western Front in March 1918. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Third Army still armed six 18 pounders. =Inter-war period= Post-war plans for the RHA envisioned that it would have 27 batteries in nine brigades. XIV Brigade was disbanded in Germany in May 1919 and in June the battery returned to the United Kingdom and was stationed at Aldershot and Newbridge. Clarke states that the battery was assigned to IX Brigade, RHA which was based at Trowbridge with N, S and U Batteries but that it probably did not join the other batteries at Trowbridge as the brigade was broken up very soon after being organized. In contrast, Frederick says it joined IV Brigade, RHA which was at Newbridge and Kilkenny with I and L Batteries. In either case, the new organisation was short-lived as the usual post-war reductions took their toll and the Royal Horse Artillery was reduced to five brigades and 15 batteries. Consequently, on 4 May 1920, T Battery was redesignated as 146th Battery, RFA and joined 1st Brigade Royal Field Artillery. Between 1922 and 1924 it served with the brigade at the Royal School of Artillery at Larkhill. On 1 November 1922 it was redesignated as 111th Battery, RFA before resuming its original designation as T Battery, Royal Field Artillery on 1 March 1924 when it transferred to 15th Brigade Royal Field Artillery. As the Royal Field Artillery was reamalgamated into the Royal Artillery, it became T Battery, Royal Artillery on 1 May 1924. In commemoration of its origins, the Honour Title \\"Shah Sujah's Troop\\" was officially granted to the battery on 13 October 1926. With effect from May 1938, brigades were redesignated as regiments and 15th Brigade became 15th Field Regiment, RA. T Battery was still with the regiment on the outbreak of the Second World War with R, S and U Batteries and was stationed at Lahore, India. =Second World War= The battery served with 15th Field Regiment throughout the Second World War. In November 1940 they moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi. From 1938, field artillery brigades had been reorganized from three or four six-gun batteries to two 12-gun batteries. Rather than disband existing batteries, they were instead linked in pairs. Strangely, this did not happen in 15th Field Regiment until 12 November 1940 (after arrival in Rawalpindi) when T Battery was linked with R Battery as R/T Battery (and S and U batteries were linked as S/U Battery). The experience of the BEF in May 1940 had already shown the limitations of having artillery regiments formed with two 12-gun batteries: field regiments were intended to support an infantry brigade of three battalions (or armoured brigade of three regiments). This could not be managed without severe disruption to the regiment. As a result, field regiments were reorganised into three 8-gun batteries but this did not happen in 15th Field Regiment until November 1942. On 27 June 1941 it departed India and arrived in Iraq on 3 July where it was assigned to the 2nd Indian Armoured Brigade Group. It went with the brigade to Persia in August and returned to Iraq in October. It was at Quayarrah (or Qaiyara) on 31 January 1942 and Mosul on 31 March. It was unlinked from R Battery at Sheraiba (or Shuabia) on 9 November and was once again T Battery, RA. 2nd Indian Armoured Brigade (by now renumbered as 252nd Indian Armoured Brigade) came under the command of 31st Indian Armoured Division and the regiment came under the direct command of the division on 1 August 1942. It left the division and Iraq on 1 September 1943 when it was transferred to Egypt, arriving on 11 September. On 21 October, 31st Indian Armoured Division also arrived in Egypt and the regiment rejoined the division. The division was preparing to take part in the Italian Campaign; however more armoured formations were not needed in Italy and division remained in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. On 15 November 1943, the regiment left the Indian establishment and was assigned to the 7th AGRA (Army Group Royal Artillery). By January 1944, the regiment had been equipped with Sexton 25 pounder self-propelled guns. In July 1944, it moved to Italy where it served with the British 8th Army and U.S. 5th Army. 15th Field Regiment ended the war in Italy as a self-propelled artillery regiment. =Post-war= Plans were put in place at the end of 1946 to create a total of eight RHA regiments to form the artillery element of the 6th and 7th Armoured Divisions in the British Army of the Rhine. 7th Regiment, RHA was to be an Anti-Tank Regiment with R, S, T and U Batteries. T Battery became RHA on 15 November 1946. Initially formed in the BAOR in October 1946, the decision was rescinded in March 1947 before the regiment was fully constituted. On 1 April 1947, the regiment became 12th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery and the battery reverted to Royal Artillery. It has remained with 12th Regiment ever since. Equipped with 17 pounder anti-tank guns, it was initially based in Palestine from May 1947 before returning to England (Woolwich) briefly in 1948. It then moved to Libya and on to Trieste in June 1950. In February 1951, it moved to Germany for the first time and joined the BAOR at Celle. On arrival in Germany, 12th Regiment was converted to the anti-aircraft role as part of 6th Armoured Division and the battery was re-equipped with Bofors guns (initially with the L/60 variant, later L/70). It spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in Germany, though from 1963 to 1966 it was at Tampin, Malaya (at the time of the confrontation). From 25 Nov 1971 to 17 Mar 1972 it undertook the first of nine roulement tours to Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) in the infantry role, either with 12th Regiment or separately. A Rapier missile speeds towards its target during a live firing exercise. It moved to Rapier Barracks, Kirton-in-Lindsay in August 1972. From July 1973, 9 (Plassey) Battery of the regiment began trials with the Rapier anti-aircraft missile and by September 1975 the regiment was back in Germany fully equipped with the new system. It returned to Rapier Barracks in May 1981 and was there when the Falklands War broke out. T Battery was dispatched to the South Atlantic to take part in the conflict. It was back in Germany in January 1985, by now equipped with Tracked Rapier. From there, it deployed to the Gulf in January 1991 to take part in the Gulf War. The Bty disbanded on the 31/10/1991 with the bulk of the members of the Battery going to 9 Plassey Bty and forming F troop. Temporarily reroled to Javelin prior to being the first Troop to convert to the new weapon system HVM starstreak mounted on the Stormer AFV. The Battle honours and name of the Bty then went to the Regts HQ Bty thus then being called THQ Bty Shah Sujah's Troop RA. In April 1993, T Battery rerolled as the Headquarters battery of 12th Regiment. It undertook a tour to Cyprus as part of UNFICYP (December 1995 to June 1996) and to Kosovo in 1999. It returned to England in 2009 and has been based at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island, West Sussex since then. =Current status= Stormer firing a Starstreak anti-aircraft missile. Under Army 2020 plans, 12th Regiment was reorganized. The battery relinquished its headquarters role to 170 (Imjin) Battery and was rerolled as a self-propelled air defence battery. It is equipped with Starstreak Surface-to-air missiles mounted on Stormer armoured vehicles.

Early life  Jos√© J√∫lio da Costa was the second of seven children of Eduardo Brito Julius and Maria Gertrudes da Costa Julius. He grew up in a family of owners which were considered wealthy. At the time of his arrest he was married to Maria do Ros√°rio Costa Pereira, but had no children. = Military service = On 21 May 1910 at the age of 16, Jos√© enlisted as a volunteer in the Portuguese Army. He participated in the military uprising that led to the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic on 5 October 1910. He was later placed in the Portuguese colonial army in which took part in actions in Portuguese Timor, Mozambique and Angola. When the first world war started in 1914, Jos√© tried to enlist as a volunteer to fight in World War I, but was refused. On 11 April 1916, after 6 years in service, Jos√© left the army with the rank of Staff Sergeant and returned to his homeland. = President Pais = When President Sid√≥nio Pais was elected president in April 1918, Jos√© became angry at the government. Being a left- wing political activist, Jos√© believed that the new president ruled the country like a dictator. In a few interviews Jos√© gave before his death, he said that he was discontent with the Presidents policy and even accused Pais of betraying the ideals of the Portuguese Republican revolution of 1910 to be adapted in Germany and line up alongside the Monarchists and Clergy which were the enemies of the Republic. Jos√© also wanted revenge on Pais because he had abandoned the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps that had fought in Flanders and France during World War I. Jose was also angry about the outcome of a failed strike by farm workers of Vale de Santiago in which he had acted as a negotiator between the authorities and the rebels, after which the agreement that he made with the authorities was repelled and the workers were severely punished with a number of strikers being deported to Portuguese Africa. After this incident, Jos√© felt betrayed by the lack of trust from the authorities. Jos√© became radicalized and vowed to avenge his countrymen and fellow soldiers by assassinating who he felt was the cause of all their problems, President or as he called him President-King Pais.  Assassination  Jos√© carefully prepared the assassination, as a letter written by himself on 12 December indicates. He waited for the President to arrive at the Rossio Station in Lisbon on 14 December 1918. The President arrived in the station but was protected by a number of bodyguards following a previous failed assassination attempt on 6 December. This however couldn't save the President, for while the president was preparing to embark on the first-floor of the station, Jos√© drew his pistol which he concealed in his Alentejo cloak and fired two shots at the President. Both shots hit the President and he fell to the ground. A panic erupted in the station but Jos√© made no attempt to escape and was apprehended moments after firing. He was arrested and brutally beaten, right on the spot. The President however was still alive and rushed to a hospital, but the second shot, which hit the President in the stomach, proved to be fatal and Pais died shortly before midnight on 14 December 1918.  Aftermath  Jos√© was imprisoned and tortured by the government. Jos√©'s mother and wife were arrested and were held in the dungeons of the civil government before they were finally released. Jos√© never stood trial for his actions and was locked away in a psychiatric hospital in Lisbon where he was forgotten by the government and fell into obscurity. Jos√© died in the hospital on 16 March 1946 at the age of 52, 28 years after the assassination.

Delany and illustrated by Howard Chaykin. Plot Thousands of years in the future, a powerful device has been hidden in separate pieces. Qrelon, whose planet was destroyed by the empire, leads a small group of rebels that risks everything to collect the pieces of the device that, once complete, will be the weapon powerful enough to destroy the planet-sized computer that runs the empire. Wryn, an archaeology student, is chosen by the empire to assassinate the rebel leader.  Style  Empire is categorized as speculative fiction and science fiction. The graphic novel is a fantastical foray into space and planetary travel. It is 120 pages long. Delany challenges traditional stylistic approaches to the science fiction genre by selecting a protagonist and sidekick who are both female. In a 1979 interview, Delany notes the lack of representation of women in speculative fiction as well as female friendships within this genre, highlighting how he has broken \\"a lot of mythical patterns\\" by selecting this approach. Yet, despite this claim, Delany continues to comment that he wishes he had focused on this female friendship more, arguing that they may not have \\"done enough with the woman sidekick\\" and that \\"there are times when the male point-of-view-character almost displaces her.\\" In regards to illustrations, Chaykin primarily utilizes three-panelled pages which feature bold, detailed, and colourful painted graphics. This artistic approach allows Delany and Chaykin to portray \\"action [which] shifts from landscape to landscape pretty quickly.\\"  Reception  Reviews contemporary with Empire's publication identify issues with the visual novel's integration of literary and visual storytelling techniques.

Geis' review in Science Fiction Review, derides Empire as a ‚Äúbasic interstellar Star Wars plot‚Äù that is not at par with some of Delany‚Äôs other fiction and suggests \\"the pretty comic book pictures [are] where it's at in this book.\\" Bob Toomey in The Comics Journal writes a more detailed criticism of Empire's failings in terms of literary merit and visual design and concludes that ‚Äúin nearly all respects‚Äù Empire is ‚Äúboring, hard to follow, and poorly conceived.‚Äù The graphic novel received 8th place in the 1979 Locus Award for Best SF Art or Illustrated Book.  Publication history  Published in 1978, Empire is regarded as one of the first graphic novels in the United States. The first edition of Empire was published as a hardcover by Berkley Windhover with Byron Preiss. Delany and Chaykin, illustrator of Star Wars comics, had been looking to collaborate since the late 1960s. In 1976, Delany, Chaykin and Preiss, who knew Chaykin from school, finally began to discuss and devise a visual novel which would become Empire. Before its publication, Mediascene reported that Berkley Publishing science fiction editor David Hartwell was so confident about this \\"breakthrough novel in graphic story form\\" that the print run for the $9.95 paperback edition was planned for 50,000 copies, with 1,500 signed and numbered hardcovers retailed at $24 each.Advert for Supergraphics, TBG, 230 (14 April 1978), 76; advert for the Monkey‚Äôs Retreat Retail Mail Order, 46. = Edits by Byron Preiss = In 1977, Preiss told convention-goers that for Empire, \\"separate, type-set text was necessary for commercial reasons.\\" In a 1979 interview with The Comics Journal, Delany recalled Preiss suggesting that Empire would use no speech balloons because \\"they made things look too comicy,\\" which Delany thought \\"was a mistake.\\" Despite being marketed as a \\"science fiction novel,\\" the writer protested that \\"I never thought of it as such... I think of it as a comic book.\\" In the same interview, Delany also remarked that Preiss ‚Äúrewrote a good number of my sentences‚Ä¶ I take full responsibility for maybe half the sentences in the text.‚Äù However, this was soon corrected by Delany in a later volume of The Comics Journal in a Letter to the Editor, in which he says only \\"a mere 39 percent\\" had been rewritten by Preiss.  Influences  When asked about his influences for writing Empire in a 1979 interview with The Comics Journal, Delany acknowledges being largely inspired by comic writers he admires, including, but not limited to: Dennis O'Neil, Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, S. Clay Wilson, Jan Strnad, Lee Marrs, Richard Corben, and Trina Robbins. Chaykin identifies his greatest artistic influence as former DC Comics' and Marvel Comics' artist, Gil Kane. Delany and Chaykin have each acknowledged their interest in working together as well as their admiration of each other's work. Aside from Delany's and Chaykin's personal influences, Empire is undoubtedly influenced by the creative direction of Preiss, who took many personal liberties in editing as he altered the style and content of the creators' work. Oxford Bibliographies also identifies M√©tal Hurlant, a French science fiction magazine, as a potential source of inspiration or influence for Empire.

The road bridge is believed to date from around 1700. It is the main route connecting the two sides of the town and one of two road crossings in the town, the other being the bridge for the A64 bypass. Tadcaster Bridge partially collapsed on 29 December 2015 after flooding that followed Storm Eva, and reopened on 3 February 2017. History The first bridge is believed to have been constructed around 1200, using stone from Tadcaster Castle, and the current bridge was built around 1700. Each of its seven bays has a cutwater and arch supporting the roadway and parapet. Built of Magnesian Limestone, the bridge was widened in the 19th century on the upstream side. It was listed at Grade II on 12 July 1985. The bridge was temporarily closed after flooding in 2012. =Partial collapse and repair= The bridge on the day after the collapse Concerns for public safety led to the bridge closing to pedestrians and traffic on 26 December 2015. The town started to flood the same day as a result of heavy rainfall following Storm Eva, and on the evening of 29 December the bridge partially collapsed. It caused the gas main to fracture and prompted the evacuation of hundreds of residents. Without use of the bridge, traffic could cross the river only via the A64, which required a long detour. Pedestrians could cross the river using the Tadcaster Viaduct. In early 2016, Historic England carried out an assessment of the significance of the Grade-II listed bridge to inform its restoration, revealing that the bridge had been widened in 1791, expanding a structure built in 1698, replacing an earlier one. The bridge repair took thirteen months at a cost of ¬£4.4 million. The provision of an adjacent temporary pedestrian footbridge was deemed essential. Following a refusal by Samuel Smith's Brewery to allow a temporary footbridge to be built on its land, an alternative site was found using land owned by Selby District Council and Tadcaster Town Council. Tadcaster Albion Football Club allowed access across its car park for people to reach the footbridge. The bridge reopened on 3 February 2017. The reconstruction, which included a widening of the structure, was funded with ¬£3 million from the government and ¬£1.4 million from the York, North Yorkshire and East Riding Local Enterprise Partnership.

He led the first Fatimid attempt to conquer Syria in 970‚Äì971, but his attack on Byzantine-held Antioch was repulsed, and he lost his life in June 971 fighting against the Qarmatians.  Biography  In summer 969, the troops of the Fatimids of Ifriqiya, under the command of Jawhar al-Siqilli, conquered Egypt from its Ikhshidid rulers. The only resistance was offered by the regiments of the Ikhshidid army barricaded on the Rawdah Island near the capital, Fustat, but the Nile was low and the Fatimids' Kutama Berber troops quickly crossed it and massacred the Ikhshidid troops. Ja'far ibn Fallah was instrumental in this success: he not only led the Fatimid troops that crossed the river, but also, according to al-Maqrizi, captured the boats used to do this from a fleet sent by Ikhshidid loyalists from Lower Egypt. At the same time, further north, the Byzantine Empire captured Antioch. Seized with the spirit of jihad and aiming to legitimize their rule, the Fatimids used the Byzantine advance on Antioch and the \\"infidel\\" threat as a major item in their propaganda aimed towards the newly conquered region, along with promises to restore just government. Jawhar therefore sent Ja'far ibn Fallah to invade Palestine, where the remnants of the Ikhshidids were holding out. Ibn Fallah defeated and captured the Ikhshidid governor al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj and took Ramla, the capital of the province of Palestine, on 24 May 970. He then moved against Tiberias, held by the ghulam Fatik and his Banu Uqayl Bedouin allies. Fatik was killed through treachery, while Ibn Fallah used other Bedouin tribes, the Banu Murra and the Banu Fazara, to drive the Uqayl north towards Homs. At the news of these events, the Ikhshidid-appointed governor of Damascus, Shamul, surrendered himself to the Fatimids. After Ibn Fallah's Kutama soldiers mistreated and robbed a delegation of leading citizens, the Damascenes resolved to resist and set up a government of their own, under the Abbasid Ibn Abi Ya'la and a certain Muhammad ibn Asuda. The Damascene militia drove off the first detachments of the Fatimid army that appeared before the city walls, but as soon as Ibn Fallah himself with the bulk of his force appeared before the city in November, they were driven back behind the city walls, and offered to surrender. In stark contrast to the leniency Jawhar had shown to Fustat, Ibn Fallah imposed humiliating terms on Damascus, demanding that the women come out and let their hair down in the dust. During the takeover of the city, the Kutama pillaged the markets and clashed with the populace for three days, after which Ibn Fallah executed several prominent citizens. This quietened the situation for the time being, and Ibn Fallah secured Damascus by erecting a citadel in the city, but it left a legacy of hatred towards the Fatimids and their Berber troops in the city. Almost as soon as Damascus submitted, Ibn Fallah entrusted one of his ghulams, named Futuh (\\"Victories\\"), to carry out the promised jihad against the Byzantines. Futuh assembled a large army of Kutama, strengthened with levies from Palestine and southern Syria, and moved to besiege Antioch in December 970. The city resisted with success, and although Ibn Fallah sent reinforcements, they were unable to take it. In spring, a Byzantine relief army defeated a detachment of the Fatimid troops, forcing the Fatimids to raise the siege and withdraw. At the same time, Ibn Fallah faced an invasion by the Qarmatians. The Damascene leader Muhammad ibn Asuda, along with the Uqayli chieftain Zalim ibn Mawhub, had sought refuge with the Qarmatians of the Syrian Desert, and urged them to attack the Fatimids. The Qarmatians were all the more responsive because the Fatimids had stopped the Ikhshidid practice of paying them a tribute of some 300,000 gold dinars a year in exchange for peace. The Qarmatians mounted a major retaliatory expedition that involved a broad coalition of the region's powers: not only were the Qarmatians of Syria aided by their co-religionists of Bahrayn, but they also received aid from the Buyid ruler of Baghdad, Izz al- Dawla, and the Hamdanids of Mosul. They were also joined by former Ikhshidid ghulams, the Bedouin of the Banu Kilab tribe, and the Uqayli followers of Zalim. Unwisely, Ibn Fallah chose to confront them in the open desert, where he was defeated and killed in battle in August 971. Muhammad ibn Asuda cut off his head in revenge at the death of his brother, who had been among the Damascene notables executed by Ibn Fallah. This defeat led to the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and the Qarmatian invasion of Egypt. The Fatimids were victorious in a battle before Fustat, however, and eventually managed to drive the Qarmatians out of Syria and restore their control over the restive province. His son Sulayman also became a senior Fatimid commander, serving from the late 970s until the late 990s, as did his brother Ibrahim. Another brother, Ali, also became a senior commander at the turn of the 11th century, and was honoured with the laqab of Qutb al- Dawla (\\"Axis of the Realm\\") for his services against Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah and his Bedouin.

Summit is estimated to cover the space of about 55 meters and require 219 kilometers of cabling. Researchers will utilize Summit for diverse fields such as cosmology, medicine and climatology. In 2015, the project called Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne and Lawrence Livermore (CORAL) included a third supercomputer named Aurora and was planned for installation at Argonne National Laboratory. By 2018, Aurora was re-engineered with completion anticipated in 2021 as an exascale computing project along with Frontier and El Capitan to be completed shortly thereafter.  Uses  The Summit supercomputer provides scientists and researchers the opportunity to solve complex tasks in the fields of energy, artificial intelligence, human health and other research areas. It has been used in Earthquake Simulation, Extreme Weather simulation using AI, Material science, Genomics and in predicting the lifetime of Neutrinos in physics.  Design  Each one of its 4,608 nodes (2 IBM POWER9 CPUs and 6 NVIDIA Tesla GPUs / node) has over 600 GB of coherent memory (6√ó16 = 96 HBM2 plus 2√ó8√ó32 = 512 GB DDR4 SDRAM) which is addressable by all CPUs and GPUs plus 800 GB of non-volatile RAM that can be used as a burst buffer or as extended memory. The POWER9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta GPUs are connected using NVIDIA's high speed NVLink. This allows for a heterogeneous computing model. To provide a high rate of data throughput, the nodes will be connected in a non-blocking fat-tree topology using a dual-rail Mellanox EDR InfiniBand interconnect for both storage and inter-process communications traffic which delivers both 200Gb/s bandwidth between nodes and in-network computing acceleration for communications frameworks such as MPI and SHMEM/PGAS.

It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa and southern Europe where it is used as a fodder plant for livestock. Description Salsola vermiculata is a small, greyish, much-branched shrub ranging in height from . The branches themselves branch repeatedly and are wiry and woody at the base. The leaves are tiny and scale-like, clasping the stem and covered with minute hairs. The inflorescence is a leafy spike with solitary flowers in the axils of the leaves. The flowers have persistent, pinkish, winged sepals and no petals and are about in diameter. Distribution and habitat This plant is native to Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, as well as Egypt and Morocco. It is also native to southern Europe, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Its natural habitat is semi-arid and arid grassland, and it has been introduced to Pakistan and to California to provide forage in arid locations. In California it has become a weed and is regarded as an invasive species. Ecology Salsola vermiculata is part of the climax community in the Syrian steppe where it grows alongside Artemisia herba-alba, Atriplex leucoclada and Stipa barbata. It also grows on the Jordanian steppe along with Artemisia herba-alba and Achillea fragrantissima, but all three of these useful fodder species are becoming increasingly rare because of overgrazing. Exclusion of livestock from an area produces a large increase in the biomass of these species. It has a high protein content and is of high value as a forage crop in arid areas. It is planted in the Middle East for grazing by cattle, sheep, goats and camels. Natural regeneration occurs in both spring and autumn, but plants germinating in autumn are more drought tolerant and more likely to become established. Rainwater harvesting, in the form of contouring furrows that prevent run-off, increases the successful establishment and growth of S. vermiculata. Planting this and other native species, such as Atriplex halimus, shows high potential for the improvement of the Badia rangelands in Syria. Prolonged drought sometimes caused the plants to shed their leaves. In California, S. vermiculata has been shown to be an alternate host for the plant viruses that cause curly top, a disease of sugar beet, tomatoes and cucurbits.  Systematics  Salsola vermiculata was first published in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum. Phylogenetic research led to the re- circumscription of the genus Salsola, and in 2007, the species was transferred to Caroxylon vermiculatum (L.) Akhani & Roalson.Akhani, H., et al. (2007).

The Derry Brigade was one of the most active groups in the IRA. Origins A small IRA battalion existed in Derry since the Troubles began, but it never had a steady number of volunteers until Bloody Sunday, which saw an influx of new recruits.  Structure and operational area  The Derry Brigade was organised in three different levels. The highest position was occupied by the Brigade's officer commanding, the top IRA ranking in the city. Beneath him was the ten-men Derry Brigade Command, made of experienced IRA volunteers, among them one or two prominent Sinn F√©in politicians. The lower layer was the Command Staff, which includes the quarter-master, the engineering department, the financial department and internal affairs, the latter to deal with informers. The Brigade strength was around 50 active members. The Command Staff, through their Officer Commanders, operated active service units in the four republican strongholds of the city: Bogside/Brandywell district, Creggan, Waterside and Shantallow. Notable IRA actions within the brigade's operational area 14 April 1974 ‚Äì Captain Anthony Pollen of the Special Reconnaissance Unit was shot dead by the IRA in Derry while carrying out undercover surveillance on a demonstration in the Bogside area. * 18 December 1975: two British soldiers, Cyril McDonald (aged 43) and Colin McInnes (aged 20), were killed in a bomb attack on the sangar they were manning at the city walls, near Guildhall Square. *28 August 1986: Mervyn Bell, a civilian contractor to the British Army, was shot dead by the IRA while sitting in stationary car outside his father's workplace, council depot, Strand Road, Derry. The IRA rejected claims that the killing was sectarian, stating: \\"The man's religion is of no interest to us. Despite previous warnings he continued to work for the UDR, and that was the reason he was targeted.\\" *8 March 1989: two British soldiers were killed and six others badly wounded when their vehicle struck a massive IRA landmine on the Buncrana Road in Derry. The second vehicle in the patrol was completely destroyed. *28 January 1990: a civilian (Charles Love) was killed when he was hit by debris when an IRA bomb exploded on Derry's walls during a march to commemorate Bloody Sunday. The security forces described his death as a \\"freak accident\\" as he was a quarter of a mile from the bomb, which was targeting security forces. Love was a member of Republican Youth. He is commemorated at a Sinn F√©in-organised march in his home town of Strabane each year. *24 October 1990: in a proxy bomb attack, the IRA forced a British Army civilian employee (Patrick Gillespie), by holding his family hostage, to deliver a bomb to a British Army checkpoint at Buncrana Road, Coshquin, County Londonderry (on the County Donegal border). The bomb detonated, killing Gillespie and six British soldiers. As the bomb exploded an IRA unit opened fire from across the border. The military facility was wrecked and several armoured vehicles destroyed by the huge blast. Over 25 houses in a nearby estate were damaged by the bomb. *29 June 1991: high ranking Ulster Defence Association commander Cecil McKnight was shot dead by IRA volunteers in the Waterside area of Derry.

Still like this, the names of the stars are not engraved on the brass. The words ROME and FRANCE are engraved in Latin characters in one of the eardrums. These characters are accompanied by the numbers 41-30 (in Arabic figures).Un astrolabe carolingien et l'origine de nos chiffres arabes; Marcel Destombes; Paris, Peyronnet, 1962 The characters are identical to those used at the end of the 10th century in the Catalan Latin manuscripts, being Catalonia in that moment a mark of the Carolingian France. This would explain the presence of the word FRANCE. The figures express in degrees and minutes: 41¬∞ 30‚Ä≤, which correspond exactly to the latitude of Barcelona. The fact of having engraved the date 980 AD. and the latitude of Barcelona (41‚Äì30), which archdeacon in those dates was Sunifred Llobet, to whom is attributed the authorship of the Ripoll's manuscript: ms.225, which contains the description of an astrolabe, has led the scholars to attribute the paternity of the astrolabe to this famous astronomer, also known with the name of Lupitus BarchinonensisAssaig d'hist√≤ria de les idees f√≠siques i matem√†tiques a la Catalunya medieval / J.

The act was carried out by the left-wing political activist Jos√© J√∫lio da Costa.  Assassination  President Sid√≥nio Pais was on his way to the Lisboa-Rossio Railway Station after having dinner at the restaurant Silva, located at the Chiado. The President was accompanied by his brother and his son, he was going to take the train to Porto to confer with the Board of the Northern Military. When he entered the station at around 11PM on 14 December 1918, he was received by a Republican Guard who would protect the President. There was a failed assassination attempt on the President on 6 December so the security was higher than ever, this however couldn't ruin the mood as a band played a popular song when the President entered the station. What the President didn't know was that Jos√© J√∫lio da Costa was waiting for him, having with him a pistol which the assassin had concealed in his Alentejo Cloak. When the President passed by the assassin on the first floor of Rossio station, the assassin penetrated the double police cordon that surrounded the President and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his Alentejo cloak. The first shot hit Pais in the right arm and the bullet became lodged in his arm, but the second shot hit the President in the stomach which made a fatal wound. The President fell immediately to the ground and a panic broke out. During the confusion, four innocent bystanders were fatally wounded by the guards and the assassin who didn't try to escape was arrested after being brutally beaten by the crowd. The President was still alive at this point and was rushed to St. Joseph hospital, he however died of his wounds en route to the hospital shortly before midnight.  Aftermath  The assassination was a traumatic moment for the First Republic of Portugal, then from any semblance of stability vanished, settling a permanent crisis that only ended after almost eight years with the National Revolution of 28 May 1926 which ended the regime. New elections were held two days after his assassination so a new president could be elected. His funeral was momentous, bringing together tens of thousands of people. The funeral however was interrupted by multiple violent incidents since some viewed him as a dictator. He was called a true King President, he entered the Portuguese imaginary, in particular that of the most conservative Catholic sectors. He is viewed as a mix of savior and martyr among some Portuguese. This image of a martyr led to the emergence of a popular cult, similar to what exists around the figure Sousa Martins, who made Pais holy with promises of honors and ex-votos, which still remains to this day. It is common to lay flowers and other votive elements next to his grave.

Royalist General Vang Pao's guerrilla army regained the vital all-weather forward fighter base at Muang Soui on the Plain of Jars from the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). The preemptive Counterpunch was credited with delaying an imminent PAVN wet season offensive for a month. The guerrilla army survived, though still heavily outnumbered by the PAVN. Overview Beginning in 1946, France fought the Viet Minh insurrection in French Indochina, including the Kingdom of Laos. When it lost that war, Laotian neutrality was established in the 1954 Geneva Agreements. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors. A North Vietnamese-backed communist invaded during the opium harvest season of 1953. It settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30‚Äì34.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18. As the Laotian Civil War began, the Central Intelligence Agency established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars to oppose this insurgency. Hmong military irregulars fought the communists in defense of their traditional territory in Laos.Warner, pp. 44‚Äì47 Background After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars the following year to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' Long Chieng main base in Military Region 2. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao had launched another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists with Kou Kiet. However, the communists fought back with their own Campaign 139, which largely regained lost ground.Warner, p. 264.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210‚Äì211.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 298, 300. Vang Pao countered with Operation Off Balance.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 213-214.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 304-306. Operation Thanong Kiet Operation Thanong Kiet (translation: Operation Preserve Honor) was a limited objective offensive meant to clear the way for further action by Hmong General Vang Pao's clandestine army of guerrillas. Although there was apprehension from Headquarters that this assault might spark retribution on the order of Campaign 139, Thanong Kiet was believed necessary if the guerrilla forces were to survive.Ahern, p. 345. Scheduled for 3 August 1970, foul weather would delay the start until the 18th. Then Bataillon Guerrier 227 (BG 227) was helilifted into position northwest of North Vietnamese troops from Ban Na with the expectation of driving them from the position. However, nonflying weather reoccurred, and the attack was deprived of tactical air support. The small People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) garrison resisted vigorously; without air power, BG 227 was unsuccessful.Conboy, Morrison, p. 265. Gaining Auto Defense Choc (ADC) militia reinforcements from nearby Xieng Dat, BG 227 headed north on 27 August. Their target this time was the all-weather fighter base at Muong Soui, which had earlier fallen to the communists. The Royalists reached the western end of the L-108 airstrip there, only to be repelled by another small cadre of North Vietnamese defenders in mid-September. Despite this lack of success by Thanong Kiet, beginning 26 September 1970 Vang Pao would throw three Counterpunchs. Operation Counterpunch and Operation Counterpunch II On 26 September 1970, to begin Operation Counterpunch, Vang Pao sent one of his battalions to raid communist supply caches along Route 4. Meeting little opposition on this sweep, the battalion was redirected on 2 October to recapture a formerly lost stronghold at Khang Kho. On 8 October, they were reinforced and feinted northwards towards the strategically vital Plain of Jars. In conjunction with this, an ad hoc regiment, Groupement Mobile 22 (GM 22) was inserted on the hilltop of Phou Long Mat. On 11 October, the original battalion split into two columns. One of them linked up with GM 22 in the Muang Pot Valley. The other skirted the southwest fringe of the Plain. In an effort to hold the Royalist gains, Vang Pao sent GM 22 along the western edge of the Plain. Groupement Mobile 23 (BG 23) was placed north of Ban Na as a protective shield. A Thai mercenary battalion, Bataillon Infanterie 15 (BI 15), was brought in to establish Fire Support Base Puncher; part of a Thai artillery unit was also inserted with them. To placate Neutralist Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, Bataillon Infanterie 17 (BI 17) from Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes was entrusted with occupation duty at Moung Soui. The guerrillas they replaced were slated for a southward operation.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 265‚Äì266. Operation Counterpunch II began when BG 227 re-entered the operation in the first week of October, being helilifted to a mountaintop position 12 kilometers northeast of Moung Soui to start Counterpunch II. A battalion-sized Special Guerrilla Unit (SGU) was imported from Military Region 1 and added into the original Counterpunch effort. Meanwhile, BG 227 moved toward Moung Soui, only to be stopped by PAVN forces on 8 October. However, while the communists were blocking BG 227, other Royalist forces overran Moung Soui on 11 October. On 17 October, Ban Na fell to the original Counterpunch Royalists. GM 22 captured Phou Seu, just off the western edge of the Plain, and began to patrol onto the Plain itself, into PAVN territory. However, the column slated to attack southward from Moung Soui remained in place. Then two events occurred on 1 November 1970. USAF tactical air sorties into MR 2 were curtailed, as increased air power was directed against the Ho Chi Minh Trail. And six PAVN companies took Phou Seu back from GM 22. GM 22 halted their patrolling and their advance. Operation Counterpunch III On the night of 26 November, Vang Pao launched Counterpunch III (Lao name: Pasanmit, or 'Friendship'). A 40-man team of Commando Raiders made a daring aerial hop courtesy of 21st Special Operations Squadron all the way to Ban Ban in the rear of the PAVN aggressors, at the eastern terminus of the communist supply line into the Plain. On 27 November, Groupement Mobile 21 (GM 21) and Bataillon Guerrilla 224 (BG 224) landed on the field the Commando Raiders had cleared. Several older helicopters on the operation lacked the fuel to return to base until it was parachuted to them.Conboy, Morrison, p. 266. By 29 November, the Royalist force began moving north into the Ban Ban Valley. They moved tentatively against light resistance, worried that ground fog would frustrate air support. ADC militia from Bouamlong moved south to meet them, but stopped short in the mountains. Finally, on 25 December 1970, they struck enemy supplies‚Äî100 tons of rice, munitions, and four trucks. Without any raiding any further communist caches, GM 21 and BG 224 halted in place. Counterpunch was ended on 7 January 1971.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 266‚Äì267. Results The American Embassy in Vientiane estimated that the pending North Vietnamese wet season offensive had been forestalled for a month.Conboy, Morrison, p. 311 note 48. However, PAVN still outnumbered the Royalist guerrillas, and still held strongholds on high ground west of the Plain of Jars near Royalist guerrilla headquarters. This left PAVN forces entrenched only 20 miles from the guerrilla base at Long Tieng.Anthony, Sexton, p. 339. Noting the urgency of the situation, the CIA Chief of Station noted the Hmong resistance had been worn thin by heavy casualties among its male members, the enervation of relocating the soldiers' dependents as refugees, and dwindling support from tactical air strikes.Ahern, pp. 386‚Äì387. He requested an infusion of modern weaponry, such as M16 rifles, M60 machine guns, and Claymore mines. He also asked for an increase in airpower. His plaint reached the highest levels. President Richard M. Nixon stated he wanted northern Laos to remain in Royalist hands.Ahern, p. 392. Notes References Ahern, Thomas L. Jr., Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

He spent the majority of his playing career at Cardiff, spending nine seasons at the club. During his time there, Cardiff won the SWALEC Cup in 1994 and the Heineken League title in the 1994/95 season. Roy was included as part of Wales' 1995 Rugby World Cup squad, and made his first and only appearance for the national team in their opening pool match against Japan, coming on as a replacement for Derwyn Jones with around eight minutes of the match remaining. He was included in Wales' squad for the 1998 Five Nations Championship, but remained on the bench and won no further caps. Roy moved from Cardiff to Pontypridd RFC for the 1997/98 season.

In its present form, the Society came into being in 1974, but it has antecedents dating back to 1844. Activities and branches The Society's activities include arranging lectures and other events about Lincolnshire's history and archaeology, and the publication of a journal, a newsletter and books about Lincolnshire. The Society has its headquarters at the Jews' Court in Lincoln, where it has a lecture room, and runs a bookshop for new and secondhand books. It has two branch groups, the Sleaford History Group and the South Holland History Group at Spalding, and also works with other local groups throughout the historic county of Lincolnshire.Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology Earlier societies Seal of the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society engraved by Orlando Jewitt The Lincolnshire Topographical Society was established in 1840 under the patronage of Lord Monson. Among its members were the architects Edward James Willson and William Adams Nicholson. It only published one volume of proceedings and appears to have been defunct by 1843. Albion Rooms, Louth In 1844 the Lincolnshire Society for the encouragement of Ecclesiastical Antiquities was founded in Louth. The first meeting was held in the Albion Rooms in the Cornmarket on 21 November 1844. Meetings were held monthly and membership was by election. Initially this was limited to members of the Anglican church. This is probably the reason why Edward James Willson, a Roman Catholic, did not join this Society. In 1849 the Society changed its name to the Lincolnshire Architectural Society and then in 1853 to the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society.Hill 1966, p. 58. White's Directory for Lincolnshire noted in 1856 that the \\"Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society has an interesting collection of curiosities, drawings etc. in the Louth Corn Exchange [opposite the Albion Rooms], but that it was proposed to move it to Lincoln\\".White's Directory for Lincolnshire, 1856, p. 251. Archdeacon Edward Trollope was appointed as secretary of the Society in 1850 and it was probably on his initiative that the Society moved to Lincoln and started to publish its proceedings in the Reports and Papers of the Associated Archaeological Societies. A further name change occurred in 1885 when it became the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Architectural and Archaeological Society. This was to reflect the removal of the Archdeaconry of Nottingham from the Diocese of Lincoln and the creation of the new Diocese of Southwell. In 1902 Nottinghamshire was dropped from the title.Sturman 1994, p. 251. During these early years a high proportion of the members of the Society were clergymen within the Diocese of Lincoln and most of the published articles are about Church history and architecture. While the Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society continued to publish its papers with the Associated Archaeological Societies until 1936, other developments were taking place. In 1930 the Lindsey Local History Society was founded and it came to publish the Lincolnshire Historian. In 1945 the Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee was founded and this started to conduct a series of notable excavation both in the City of Lincoln and in the County. The Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society merged with the Lindsey Local History Society in 1965 and in 1974 the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology was created by a further mergers with the Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee.Sturman 1994, p. 256. and the Lincolnshire Industrial Archaeology Group.

Originally from Trabuco Canyon, California, Chamberlain played college softball at Oklahoma and was part of the 2013 Women's College World Series championship team. Collegiate career Born in Orange, California and raised in Trabuco Canyon, Chamberlain graduated from El Toro High School in Lake Forest. Chamberlain played for the Oklahoma Sooners from 2012 - 2015 As a freshman in 2012, she set the Big 12 conference's single-season home run record, hitting thirty home runs; she finished second in the nation in home runs that year. She was three times-named Big 12 Player of the Week, becoming the first freshman in Big 12 softball history to win the award three times. As a true freshman, she led her team in home runs, RBI, runs scored, and total bases; second in walks; and third in batting average, hits, doubles, and stolen bases. Following the season, she was named to the all-conference first team and a first-team all- American. In 2013, Chamberlain led the nation in four statistical categories, including home runs; home runs per game; slugging percentage; and runs per game. She ranked in the top ten nationally in four other statistical categories, including on-base percentage and batting average. She set eight single-season school offensive records, including for batting average; slugging percentage; on-base percentage; runs scored; RBI; extra-base hits; total bases; and walks. Chamberlain helped lead the Sooners to the National Championship in 2013. Following the season, she was again named a first-team all-American and a member of the all-conference first team. In 2014, Chamberlain only played in thirty-nine games after she suffered a back injury in March and a partially-torn right PCL in May. In the games she did play, Chamberlain hit twelve home runs and led her team in on-base percentage and walks. Her fifty-one (51) walks is the sixth-best mark in Big 12 conference history. Despite the time missed due to injury, she was named a third-team all-American after the season. Entering 2015, Chamberlain needed eighteen home runs to tie the all-time record. She led the team in six statistical categories, including runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage; she led the Big 12 conference in on-base percentage; slugging percentage; walks; and runs per game. On April 30, 2015, Chamberlain hit a grand slam in a game against North Texas pitcher Kenzie Grimes; with the home run, the 91st of Chamberlain's career, she moved into sole possession of first place all-time on the NCAA career home runs list. Following her senior season, Chamberlain was nominated for the Honda Cup Award and was named the Big 12 conference's Female Athlete of the Year. She was named to both the all-American first-team as well as the Big 12 first-team. International career Chamberlain played for Team USA in 2013. She previously spent two years (2010‚Äì11) as a member of the Junior Women's National Team and was named the 2010 USA Softball Athlete of the Year for the JWNT.

It first flew in 1930; at least two were built. Design and development The Lachassagne AL 3 was the first French monoplane to have wings with in-flight adjustable camber. The idea was to provide a high camber, high lift airfoil at low speed and a lower camber, lower drag section at high speeds, increasing the speed range of the aircraft. The AL 3 first flew late in 1926 and only survived a short period of testing before its old and fragile undercarriage collapsed whilst landing, badly damaging it. Nonetheless, enough had been learned to encourage Lachassagne to build a new, improved version incorporating, amongst other things, a stronger undercarriage and a more modern engine. Apart from its ability to alter its camber, each low-mounted wing of the AL5 was externally unremarkable, with a rectangular plan out to broadly rounded tips. There were two spars, rigidly and conventionally joined together. The plywood covered leading and trailing edges were each rigid structures but they were hinged on duralumin tubes which ran through the lower parts of the forward and rear spars respectively. Their angular positions were controlled together via rod and lever linkages and determined the profile of the surfaces between the spars. As the edges were rotated downwards, the underside surface bent upwards; spacers kept the local thickness constant so the upper surface curvature also increased, as did the overall camber. As a result, the upper side surface path between the spars increased, so extra skin was allowed to slide out from under the upper side of the trailing edge. There were three wing settings, one for take-off, one for speed and a third for landing. Lachassagne estimated that the camber-changing features added about 15% to the weight of the wing. Broad chord ailerons occupied about 40% of the span. Each wing was wire braced with two pairs of long Vs from the spars at about mid- span, one to the upper fuselage and the other to the landing gear. The AL 5's fuselage was built around four longerons, giving it a rectangular cross- section. The forward part had a high rounded decking between the nose and the pilot's open cockpit; this dropped away aft and ended about halfway to the tail. The engine was a ABC Scorpion flat twin, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed for air-cooling and driving a two blade propeller. At the rear, the AL 5 had a low, rounded fin and a distinctly stepped, rounded, balanced rudder which reached down to the keel. A trapezoidal horizontal tail, braced to the fuselage, was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage; its camber was altered along with that of the wing and in a similar way, though the camber rage was greater and could be negative. It carried separate elevators which had inner cut-aways for rudder movement. The AL 5 had a much more robust undercarriage than its predecessor. A frame with two near vertical legs to the lower fuselage longerons and two diagonal struts to the central fuselage underside supported a single axle within an airfoil section fairing, with the wheels at its extremities. A long tailskid protected the bottom of the rudder. The Lachassagne AL 5 flew for the first time on 25 May 1930 at Orly, piloted by Marcel Haegelen. Test flights continued up to August, when a two-month break was taken to improve both the engine and the camber controls. Modifications included making the camber-setting for take-off semi-automatic. The test programme resumed around the middle of October. A second AL 5, built to order, had its first flight on 11 September 1935 Its revised undercarriage had extra diagonal cross-bracing struts. In 1936 Lachassagne introduced the AL 6. This was a close relative of the AL 5 but powered by a Aubier-Dunne air- cooled, twin cylinder, inverted inline two-stroke engine. It was externally similar to the AL 5, though its dimensions and weights are not known, but it had a new undercarriage with split axles hinged on a transverse V-strut from the fuselage longerons. Operational history In May 1932 the AL 5 attended a rally at Orly, along with many light aircraft. In June 1934, Bourr√©, a young and inexperienced pilot, brought the AL 5 to Vincennes to demonstrate it but was caught in turbulence as he landed and suffered multiple injuries. The second AL 5 was developed and tested at Enghien-les-Bains, then shipped to Cameroon, where it was flown for some time by Berberoux. Starting on 8 September 1936, the AL 6 flew from Orly with a diverse collection of current French prototypes on a ten-day Tour of France.

The term Serb Muslims () refers to ethnic Serbs who are Muslims (adherents of Islam) by their religious affiliation. Since it is defined by ethnicity and religion, term Serb Muslims should not be confused with term Serbian Muslims which refers generally to all adherents of Islam in Serbia, regardless of their ethnicity. Use of the term The term has several particular uses: *In ethnographic, historical and comparative religious studies it is used as a designation for Islamized families of ethnic Serb descent. *It has been used as a self-identification (Srbi-muhamedanci, Srbi-muslimani) in former Yugoslavia. *It is used in historical studies to identify Ottoman people of Serb origin. *It is used for the Muslim population in the region of Sand≈æak (Serbia). *It has been historically used by Serbian nationalists for the Slavic-speaking Muslim populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks), Sand≈æak (Bosniaks and Muslims by ethnicity), and Kosovo (Bosniaks, Muslims by ethnicity and Goranci). History Ottoman general and statesman Omar Pasha Latas (1806-1871), who was ethnic Serb by birth Since Serbs were, and still are, predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians, their first significant historical encounter with Islam occurred in the second half of 14th century, and was marked by Turkish invasion and conquest of Serbian lands (starting in 1371 and ending by the beginning of 16th century). That interval was marked by first wave of Islamization among Serbs: in some regions, substantial minority left Christianity and converted into Islam, willingly or by necessity, under the influence of Ottoman authorities. The most notable Muslim of Serb ethnicity was Mehmed-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá (1506-1579), Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire (1565-1579), who was ethnic Serb by birth, and so was Omar Pasha Latas. =Kingdom of Yugoslavia= Gajret Gajret (known as Serbian Muslim Cultural Society after 1929) was a cultural society established in 1903 that promoted Serbian identity among the Slavic Muslims of Austria-Hungary (today's Bosnia and Herzegovina). The organization viewed that the Muslims were Serbs lacking ethnic consciousness. The view that Muslims were Serbs is probably the oldest of three ethnic theories among the Bosnian Muslims themselves. It was dismantled by the Independent State of Croatia during World War II. Some members, non- Communists, joined or collaborated with the Yugoslav Partisans, while others joined the Chetniks. World War I Muslims joined the Serbian army in World War I. The majority were Muslims who had a Serb identity, declaring as Serbs. Among notable soldiers were Avdo Hasanbegoviƒá, ≈†ukrija Kurtoviƒá, Ibrahim Had≈æimeroviƒá, Fehim Musakadiƒá, Hamid Kukiƒá, Re≈°id Kurtagiƒá, who all fought as Serbian volunteer officers at the Salonica Front. Among the most active in the group of Muslims who were engaged in Yugoslav propaganda on Austro-Hungarian Muslim POWs were A. Hasanbegoviƒá, Azis Sariƒá, F. Musakadiƒá, Alija D≈æemid≈æiƒá, R. Kurtagiƒá, Asim ≈†eremeta, Hamid Kukiƒá and Ibrahim Had≈æiomeroviƒá. World War II During World War II in Yugoslavia, few Muslims joined the Chetniks. These espoused a Serb ethnic identity. The most notable of these was Ismet Popovac, who commanded the Muslim National Military Organization (Muslimanska narodna vojna organizacija, MNVO). The resolution of MNVO states that \\"Muslims are an integral part of Serbdom\\". World War I veteran Fehim Musakadiƒá also joined the Chetniks. =SFR Yugoslavia= Me≈°a Selimoviƒá, Yugoslav writer declared himself as Serb Muslim. In the 1948 census, Muslims in Yugoslavia were allowed to declare as \\"Serb-Muslims\\", \\"Croat-Muslims\\" or \\"Undetermined\\" Muslims, the overwhelming majority choosing the option undetermined. Some prominent Muslims in Yugoslavia openly declared as Serbs, such as writer Me≈°a Selimoviƒá. =Yugoslav Wars= During early talks of the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ejup Ganiƒá remarked that the Bosniaks \\"are Islamized Serbs\\", and should thus join the Serb side, at a time when the SDA shifted in favour of siding with the Serbs and continuing struggling against the Croats. Political analyst Jochen Hippler noted in 1994 that \\"Muslims are mostly ethnically Serb, a minority Croat, but this did not save them from being slaughtered by their fellow ethnic groups for being different.\\" Serb nationalists usually insisted that Bosnian Muslims were Serbs that had abandoned their faith. Serbian historiography emphasizes an Orthodox Serbian origin for the Bosniaks who are interpreted as relinquishing ties to that ethno-religious heritage after converting to Islam and later denying it by refusing to accept a Serbian identity. According to war and post-war Bosniak historiography, Bosnian Muslims within the bulk of Serbian nationalist historiography are presented as the descendants of the mentally ill, lazy, slaves, greedy landlords, prisoners, thieves, outcasts or as Serbs who confused and defeated chose to follow their enemies religion. On the one hand, Bosnian Muslims emphasize that they have no ties with Serbs or Croats, while on the other hand, Serbs emphasize the common origin and role that the occupiers played in the quarrel between the Balkan peoples. Censuses =Serbian censuses= In the 2014 census in Serbia, of those who declared as ethnic Serbs, 0.04% (2,816) declared Islam as their religion.

Usually depicted as a foe of Odin and Thor, the Serpent has also come into conflict with the Avengers. He is the brother of Odin, therefore the uncle of Thor, Tyr, Balder, Loki, Laurussa, and Angela. He is known as the Norse God of Fear. Publication history Serpent first appeared in Fear Itself #1 (June 2011), and was created by Stuart Immonen and Matt Fraction. Fictional character biography Cul Borson first appears in the 2011 Fear Itself storyline, when he is freed from his underwater prison by Red Skull's daughter Sin who possesses the Hammer of Skadi. Upon emerging as an old man, Serpent claims that he is the true All-Father of Asgard, and not Odin, father to Thor. The Serpent prepares Skadi's army and calls the Hammers of the Worthy, which he sends to Earth, transforming a number of superhuman beings into his henchmen, the Worthy, who will help him spread fear and chaos across the globe: Juggernaut becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, Hulk becomes Nul: Breaker of Worlds, Attuma becomes Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans, Titania becomes Skirn: Breaker of Men, Grey Gargoyle becomes Mokk: Breaker of Faith, Absorbing Man becomes Greithoth: Breaker of Wills, and Thing becomes Angrir: Breaker of Souls. As the Worthy attack a number of high-profile cities on Earth, Serpent is rejuvenated by the fear experienced by the global citizenry, restoring his youth. When Thor appears at his stronghold to confront him, Serpent confirms to Thor that he is the Serpent destined by prophecy to kill Thor, and not the Midgard Serpent. Serpent reveals that he is Odin's brother and Thor's uncle. He dispatches Thor, sending him to Manhattan, which lies in ruins following an attack by Skadi and two of the Worthy, Nul and Angrir, who then attack Thor. Serpent himself later confronts the Avengers, and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands before teleporting away. Thor manages to dispatch Nul, who is transformed back into Thing, and as Nul, but is seriously wounded, and transported to Asgard to recuperate. In an attempt to destroy Odin and his followers, Serpent and his followers appear in Broxton, Oklahoma in order to use Heimdall's Observatory to transport themselves to Asgard. They are confronted by the heroes of Earth, who stage a last stand to prevent them from doing this. When a healed Thor appears, Serpent transforms into a giant serpent, and battles his nephew while the Avengers fight the Worthy with weapons that Iron Man made in Asgard's workshops. Thor slays his uncle with Odinsword (revealed to be Ragnarok) and dies in the arms of Odin, thus fulfilling the prophecy. Following Thor's funeral, Odin takes Serpent's corpse to Asgard, casts out the other Asgardians, and locks himself alone with the body until the end of time, blaming himself for not preventing Thor's death. During the 2014 Original Sin storyline, Serpent is revived by Odin as he is contacted by Loki.Original Sin #5.4. Marvel Comics (New York). Serpent later repents his sins, and is pardoned as a reformed god by Odin, who makes him Royal Inquisitor and Minister of Justice.Thor Vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics. Serpent's first task as the Royal Inquisitor is to retrieve Mjolnir from the female Thor. While using the Destroyer armor, Serpent confronted her as she was about to take action against Malekith the Accursed and Minotaur.Thor Vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics. Serpent managed to briefly reclaim Mjolnir until Thor managed to call it back to her. Thor continued her fight against Serpent until she received aid from Thor Odinson, Freyja, and an army of women that Thor Odinson suspected of being the female Thor.Thor Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics (New York). After a fierce battle, Freyja convinced Odin to call off Serpent's mission by mocking him.Thor Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics (New York). When Asgardia was destroyed, Serpent is sent to Svartalfheim by Odin in order to find out how Malekith the Accursed's forces are able to travel undetected.Thor Vol. 5 #10. Marvel Comics (New York). During the War of the Realms storyline, a flashback shows Cul declining Malekith the Accursed's offer to join the Dark Council. In the present, Cul discovers that Malekith and his forces are using the Black Bifrost Bridge. Cul relays this to Odin, and resolves to remain in Svartalfheim to discover how it works. After spending months studying it, Cul steals some explosives from the Swamp Mines and throws them towards the Bridge. He then discovers that Malekith has enslaved Dark Elf children to mine the explosives. Freeing them, and as a final act of redemption, he urges them to use the explosives to create another escape route while he fends off their guards until he is mortally wounded. In the aftermath of the Swamp Mines' destruction, the freed Dark Elf children began to fight the other Dark Elf soldiers in his honor.Aaron, Jason (w), Del Mundo, Mike (a). \\"The Ballad of Cul Borson, God of Fear\\", Thor Vol. 5 #13 (2019). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Cul possesses all the conventional attributes of an Asgardian God. However, as the son of Bor, many of these attributes are significantly superior than those possessed by the majority of his race. He possesses sufficient superhuman strength to shatter Captain America's shield with his bare hands. He possesses the ability to manipulate magic as he was able to tele-transport, revive the dead and transform into a giant serpent. As the God of Fear, he could consume the fear of other people to empower himself, making him stronger and younger in the process. In other media = Television = Serpent appears in Guardians of the Galaxy, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. A seven-episode story arc beginning with \\"Paranoid\\" and ending \\"Just One Victory\\" depicts his escape from imprisonment in the Darkhawk realm and his attack upon Asgard, which pits him against a group allied against him, including the Guardians and Thanos. The episode \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\" reveals that it was Serpent who planted the World Tree when it was a sapling. In the story's climax, \\"Just One Victory\\", Groot pushes a weapon called the Dragonfang blade into the corrupted World Tree, which causes Serpent to age, and after falling from the Tree, to turn to sand upon hitting the ground. = Video games = Serpent appears in the 2012 social-network game Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

He attended Virginia University of Lynchburg. He signed with the New York Jets after going undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft. He has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Omaha Mammoths, Calgary Stampeders, San Diego Chargers, Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions.  College  At Marie Sklodowska-Curie Metro High School in Chicago, Lewis amassed over 30 football scholarships and was one of the top players from the region. But with low ACT scores, he didn't get through the NCAA clearinghouse so he enrolled at the College of DuPage, a nearby junior college. He would go on to become an All-American at the junior college but grades were now an issue for him to transfer to a major program. So Lewis stepped away from football for nearly two years in order to get his life in order. He applied for and got into Harold Washington College, a college in Chicago without a football program. At Harold Washington, the lack of a football program meant that Lewis had the chance to focus on the classroom. He spent more time studying and getting his grades up.

He was regarded as one of the foremost authorities on spiders and highly regarded for his superb scientific illustrations.Obituary (1895) Life and career Marx was born on June 22, 1838 at Laubach in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, where his father was a court chaplain. At age fourteen he entered a gymnasium (high school) in Darmstadt with the expectation that he would follow his father into the ministry. While at school Marx became interested in botany and displayed such an aptitude as an artist that he was employed to illustrate a book on the local flora. Against his father's wishes, he decided to study pharmacy because it would provide him an opportunity to pursue his interest in botany.Mallis, 1971 After completing his pharmaceutical studies at Giessen Marx traveled to the United States in 1860. At the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted in the Union Army and served as a private until the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. Afterwards, his expertise in pharmacy and medicine resulted in a transfer to the medical corps where he served as an assistant surgeon. In July 1862 Marx was honorably discharged because of illness and a severe wound. Illustration of ticks (Ixodida) by Marx After receiving his discharge, Marx settled in New York City and worked as a pharmacist for the duration of the war. In 1865 he moved to Philadelphia, started a business, and married Minnie Maurer. While in Philadelphia he became interested in collecting and studying spiders. In 1878, he took a position in Washington D.C. working as a natural history illustrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Division of Entomology. He earned a reputation as a skilled artist and many of the Division's publications were illustrated with his works. In 1889 he was appointed chief of the USDA's newly established Division of Illustrations. His colleagues said the \\"plates and figures which adorn his contributions to science are by far the best illustrations of Arachnids that have ever been produced in America\\". In addition to his work on illustrations, Marx continued to collect and study spiders. He published his first paper, \\"On Some New Tube- Constructing Spiders\\" in 1881 and went on to write some thirty additional papers on arachnids, many of them illustrated with his own drawings. He was recognized as an authority on spiders and collaborated with noted arachnologists in America and Europe including Tamerlan Thorell, Eug√®ne Simon, James Henry Emerton and George Williams Peckham. Marx completed and edited Die Spinnen Amerikas (The American Spiders) which had been left unfinished by the death of the original author, Eugen von Keyserling. Marx was a founder and active member of the Entomological Society of Washington and served as president of the organization in 1891. In addition to all his other activities he also found time to continue his medical studies and in 1885 received an M.D. from Columbian University (now George Washington University). Marx died on January 3, 1895 in Washington D.C. He left a collection of over 1000 spiders to the United States National Museum. The remainder of his collection and his extensive library was put on sale for $1500. Publications A few of his titles follow.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Susquehecka Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is above sea level. The creek is a relatively small stream. In the middle of the 20th century, the channel of Susquehecka Creek was significantly modified and relocated. The modifications included straightening, adding dikes, cleaning, and widening and deepening. A. Joseph Armstrong's book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams described the creek as \\"yet another alleged limestone stream in an area with little appeal\\".

However, its source is in the quadrangle of Dalmatia. Flooding has been known to occur along Susquehecka Creek and its tributary Dry Run in the borough of Freeburg. The designated use of Susquehecka Creek is aquatic life. History Susquehecka Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1189115. The creek is also known as Freeburg Creek or Freeburg Run. The former variant name appears in a 1953 United States Geological Survey map. However in 1965, USGS agent William L. Cain discovered that no locals had heard of the name \\"Freeburg Creek\\", and that every local he spoke toincluding the then-mayor of Freeburg, a postmaster, a farmer, and a retired manknew the creek as \\"Susquehecka Creek\\", though only two people he spoke to knew how to spell it. The name \\"Susquehecka Creek\\" had already been in use for many years by 1965. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 2003 over Susquehecka Creek was built in 1937, south of Freeburg and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 35 across the creek was built in 2008, east of Fremont and is long. This bridge replaced a steel bridge built over the creek in 1952. Biology The drainage basin of Susquehecka Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.

Its original position was just north of the main Roman bed of the River Potenza (the ancient Flosis), which now flows more than to the north.  History  In 268 BC the central Adriatic homeland of the local Picene peoples was military dominated and incorporated by the Romans. Later, under emperor Augustus, it was organized as Regio V Picenum. The installation of a series of mostly maritime Latin and Roman colonies during the second part of the 3rd and the 2nd centuries BC was a major impulse for the Romanization of a region that knew no real urbanized society before. In 184 BC with the foundation of Potentia, a coastal colony for Roman citizens (mentioned by Livy), the lower Potenza valley, and with it the whole area of northern Picenum, entered its first phase of real urbanization. By 174 BC the colony probably received a circuit wall with three arched gates, a street network with sewers, an aqueduct, a temple to Jupiter, and a portico with shops enclosing the forum.Livy XLI.27, 1 and 10‚Äì13 The flourishing of the town from the Augustan Age onwards far into the late 2nd century AD, is attested by epigraphic evidence. From the 3rd century AD onwards, the lack of significant numbers of inscriptions could point to a decline in the city‚Äôs prosperity. Although the city became an Episcopal seat around AD 400 and is still mentioned in sources at the beginning of the 7th century AD, Potentia clearly did not survive into the Middle Ages. Archaeological and historical research Nereo Alfieri, an Italian specialist in ancient topography, located the archaeological site of Potentia in 1940. The first architectural remains were investigated in the 1960s-70s under the direction of Liliana Mercando. Between 1986 and 2006 systematic excavation campaigns under the direction of Edvige Percossi of the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici delle Marche, have been organized. These excavations revealed a late Republican temple (2nd century BC) surrounded by a portico and other buildings of Republican and Imperial Age. The Potenza Valley Survey Project (Ghent University), under the direction of prof. Frank Vermeulen, made it possible to understand the wider picture of the city‚Äôs plan and development. Due to intensive aerial coverage, geomorphological approaches, artefact surveys and studies, geophysical prospections, and the excavation of the western city gate there is now a more defined chronological interpretation of the site as well as a comprehensive cartographic mapping of its main features. Archaeological remains from the late Republic and early Empire =City wall, gates and streets= The city has a strictly rectangular town plan of c. 525 x 350 m (around 18), and is laid out parallel with the coast. The urban area is subdivided by a regular network of streets oriented parallel with the walls, thus forming city blocks or insulae (a minimum of 58) of different dimensions. Fairly central to the plan are the principal streets, the cardo and decumanus maximus, with the forum square set south west of their crossroads. The regular street system consist of cardines and decumani neatly parallel and perpendicular with the main axes. According to the evidence from the surveys and the excavations they are some 5 m wide and normally consist of a surface of battered river pebbles. Excavations have revealed that at least some of them had one or two parallel footpaths and brick sewers, which lay underneath the roadway. It is likely that the city wall incorporated three major gates, as suggested by Livy‚Äôs account. The northern and western gates, both more or less centrally placed on the respective sides of the city and well-connected with the extramural road are securely located. All three roads leaving the city gates were bordered by cemeteries, with funeral monuments facing the roadway. =The city center= Excavations as well as geophysical survey have located several public buildings around the forum square: a possible basilica, a main temple, a possible curia and a food market (macellum). A small theatre lies near the eastern city wall and a possible baths building in the south. The geophysical surveys helped also to distinguish remains and partial plans of many housing units, some of domus type, others clearly tabernae, and others simple habitations and shops, spread all over the many insulae. =Date= According to the dates of the portico surrounding the excavated temple east of the forum and of the macellum to the north and a luxurious building (domus?) to the east of the temple, the city centre was especially monumentalised in the time of Augustus. Further expansion and investment continued until the Antonines, before major problems hit the town in the \\"Crisis of the 3rd Century\\".

The concept is sometimes seen as far-left, although there are also right-wing and centrist pan-human organisations, including the United Nations, some of which have even received significant opposition from the far-left over globalisation policies. History Humanism originates in the European Renaissance, especially the Italian Renaissance, although the word was not coined until the early nineteenth century. Rather than an ideology, it was a cultural frame of ideas with a non-absolutistic approach to any truth. It emphasized the uniqueness of the individual and often claimed a connection between man and nature.http://www.panhumanism.com/articles/2006-03.php At the core of Renaissance humanism was the concept of humanitas, which meant the development of human virtue to its fullest extent. The possessor of humanitas could not be merely a sedentary and isolated philosopher or man of letters but was of necessity a participant in active life. Just as action without insight was held to be aimless and barbaric, insight without action was rejected as barren and imperfect. Humanitas scholars also believed it was inevitable to project humanitas from the individual into the state at large. Interperatations = Carl Sagan = Carl Sagan's ideas have attracted criticism. Some argue that the trend is in fact not in that direction, as part of the reason why we evolve is in order to continually face a greater enemy.http://www.thephora.net/forum/showthread.php?t=3421 Therefore, without an enemy that places the whole of humankind on the other side, panhumanism is not possible. = Marxism = A communist society or communist system is the type of society and economic system postulated to emerge from technological advances in the productive forces in Marxist thought, representing the ultimate goal of the political ideology of Communism. A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless, implying the end of the exploitation of labor. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme Karl Marx referred to this stage of development as upper-stage communism.Critique of the Gotha Programme, Karl Marx. = World Government = World government is the notion of a common political authority for all of humanity, yielding a global government and a single state. Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory world domination or through peaceful and voluntary supranational union. Currently there is no worldwide executive, legislature, judiciary, military, or constitution with jurisdiction over the entire planet. The United Nations is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster cooperation between existing national governments rather than exert authority over them. A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the United Nations System that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea was raised at the founding of the League of Nations in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the Cold War. In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a parliamentary assembly to scrutinize their activity.Watson, Graham (26 September 2007).

He twice served as the chief judge of the Abbasid Caliphate, from ca. 825 to 833 and 851 to 854.  Career  Yahya was born in Marw in Khurasan and was a member of the Banu Tamim; he himself claimed descent from the judge Aktham ibn al-Sayfi. He studied hadith and fiqh in Basra, and is usually characterized as having been affiliated with the Hanafis, but he may alternatively have been a Shafi'i or part of an independent Basran school. In 817-8 he was appointed as qadi (judge) of Basra, and he held that position until 825.; ; ; ; . Following his dismissal from Basra, Yahya was selected by al-Ma'mun () to serve as chief justice (qadi al-qudat). Yahya enjoyed strong relations with the caliph and became an immensely influential member of the administration, with all decisions made by the viziers being reportedly submitted to him for approval first.; ; ; . In 831 he participated in al- Ma'mun's campaign against the Byzantines and was put in command of a raiding party which set out from Tyana,; . and in the following year he accompanied the caliph to Egypt and briefly acted as judge there.; ; ; ; . By the end of al-Ma'mun's reign, however, Yahya had fallen out of favor, and he decided to return to Iraq. Throughout his career he had been forced to defend himself against consistent allegations of pederasty,; ; . and by the time of al- Ma'mun's death he was also facing accusations of financial mismanagement.; . As a supporter of Sunni orthodoxy, he was also opposed to the Mu'tazilite belief that the Qur'an had been created, which put him at odds with the caliph's adherence to Mu'tazilism. Following the accession of al-Ma'mun's brother al-Mu'tasim (), Yahya lost his position and was replaced with the Mu'tazilite Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad.; ; . In 851, following the abandonment of Mu'tazilism by al-Mutawakkil (), Yahya was again made chief judge and he moved to Samarra. During his judgeship he appointed a mix of qadis, selecting both men who had formerly been affiliated with Mu'tazilism, as well as those who appealed to the orthodox Hanbalis. He remained chief judge until July 854, when al-Mutawakkil dismissed him in favor of Ja'far ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Ja'far al-Hashimi. His money and land were also seized at the time of his dismissal, and he was placed under house arrest.; ; ; ; ; ; . In 857 Yahya decided to go on the pilgrimage and intended to take up residence in Mecca. Upon learning that al-Mutawakkil had forgiven him, he changed his mind and set out to return to Iraq, but he died on the journey in April 857 and was buried in al-Rabadhah.; ; ; ; .

Christophe Cochet, known in Rome under the name Cristoforo Coscetti or Coscietti (attested after 1606 - death 1634) was a 17th-century French sculptor. Son of the Parisian master mason Jean Cochet, he began training as a sculptor with Pierre Biard the Elder, and was already a sculptor when first mentioned in 1606. His sister, Germaine Cochet, married the sculptor Simon Guillain in 1612. Christophe Cochet went to Rome, where his presence is attested since 1615, and where he stayed alongside the painter Simon Vouet, at a house on Via Serena, in the parish of San Lorenzo in Lucina. During his stay in Rome he was maintained by the Queen Mother Marie de Medici who granted him an annual allowance, which was known to reach 400 Livres in 1618. In Rome he met with several artists, including sculptor Jacques Sarazin. No work of his Roman period is known to have survived. Back in Paris at 1629, he became the official ‚ÄúSculptor to the King and the Queen Mother.\\" Queen Mother Marie de Medici commissioned him to execute stucco work at the Luxembourg Palace, for which he received various payments until 1630. (In 1631, when the Queen Mother was forced from court following the \\"Day of the Dupes\\", work on the Luxembourg was interrupted.) His first marriage was to Marie Passart, who bore him a son, the painter Dominique Cochet. From his second marriage - in 1630 with Anne Chauchet, daughter of a wine merchant - he had two daughters (including Antoinette, who was born in 1634). He is best known for creating ‚ÄúDido About to Take Her Own life‚Äù offered by the Duke of Montmorency to Cardinal Richelieu (before 1632). The sculpture was praised by men of letters of the time, including Tristan Lhermite. This might be the Dido originally displayed at the Ch√¢teau de Marly (nowadays at the Louvre in Paris,), which was previously identified as a Lucretia or Cleopatra (all of them known for a dramatic suicide). Cochet was also the creator of several sculpted funerary monuments: he was engaged in 1631 to realize the tomb of Roland Neuburg (died 1629) for the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul Church at Sarcelles. The monument, in the form of a praying man perched on a high pedestal flanked by torch-bearing geniuses, is lost - but remains known due to an anonymous drawing preserved at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris. In 1631 he got the order, for the large sum of 11,000 Livres, for the Mausoleum of Charles de Bourbon, Count of Soissons (died in 1612), and his wife Anne de Montafi√©, Countess of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis ‚Äì erected in the Choir of the Church of the Chartreuse in Gaillon. The monument is in the form of two effigies placed on a high pedestal of black marble, shown in the clothing of a Prince of the Blood and his spouse. At the corners are white marble allegories of the four cardinal virtues, as well as various funerary spirits. In the niches at the base are depicted in white marble the recumbent figures of Elisabeth (died in 1611) and Anne-Charlotte (died 1623), daughters of the Duke and Duchess.
