Biography Case was born in Cleveland on January 27, 1820, in a house located on the corner of Superior Avenue and E. 6th Street (known then as Bank Street).https://newspapers.case.edu/?a=d&d;=CT19040511-01.2.8&srpos;=4&e;=-------en-20 --1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Leonard+Case%22------ In his youth, he was educated locally in Cleveland at Rev. Colley Foster's private school, located at St. Clair Avenue and Ontario Street, followed by preparatory study at Franklin T. Backus's classics school. Case entered Yale University in 1838, graduating in 1842 with honors in mathematics and languages, and notably helped found the secret society of the Scroll and Key. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1844,https://archive.org/details/listofgraduateso00univ and opened a law office in Cleveland in 1845 after passing the Ohio bar exam.https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0900160 He limited his practice to working with his father, Leonard Case Sr., in settling claims arising from Moses Cleaveland's Connecticut Land Company. His elder brother, William Case, served as Mayor of Cleveland from 1850‚Äì1851. Leonard stayed away from the Cleveland political life, although he did build and finance the Cleveland City Hall in the form of the \\"Case Block\\" located at Superior Avenue and East 3rd Street, leasing it to the city beginning in 1875. Later when asked why he continued to own the building, he was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying, \\"how to dispose of the property so that it shall most benefit the city has given me much concern, but on one thing I am determined. Not a dollar of it shall, so far as I can help, go into the hands of politicians to be mismanaged and wasted.\\" Leonard never married. Though he was ill for all his life, he was devoted to academic affairs. His most famous poem Treasure Trove, appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in 1860, whose literary standard remained high during the period. To the surprise of the publication, Leonard mailed back a substantial check he had received for his submission, requesting the money go to another author whose poem was featured in the same edition. The Editor of the Atlantic Monthly, wrote back saying: \\"Dear Sir:- Your note, returning the check for \\"Treasure Trove,\\" reached me; and I can only now mingle surprise for so unexpected courtesy with acknowledgements for it. It may, perhaps, be something of a return for the pecuniary abnegation to learn that both Holmes and Saxe spoke highly of the poem...https://newspapers.case.edu/?a=d&d;=CT19060207-01.2.1&e;=-------en-20-- 1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Leonard+Case%22------\\" The work was later published in 1873 by James R. Osgood and Company. Leonard concealed his involvement in a work published in 1876 known as Vocabulary of English Rhymes: Arranged on a New Plan, paying and supporting fellow Yale alumnus, Samuel Weed Barnum, to devote two and half years to its creation.https://newspapers.case.edu/?a=d&d;=CT19060307-01.2.1&srpos;=12&e;=-------en-20 --1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Leonard+Case%22------ In a preface in the second addition dated January 10, 1896, the authors son, Thomas R. Barnum wrote: \\"it is proper to make a brief statement...in regard to the origin of the book. The late Leonard Case, Jr., of Cleveland, Ohio, Founder of the Case School of Applied Science...undertook to make for his friend, Dr. Alleyne Maynard of Cleveland, a rhyming dictionary arranged without regard to spelling, but according to the vowel sounds in the accented syllables of the rhymes. The result of Mr. Case's labor was embodied in a beautiful manuscript volume containing perhaps half of the words in this present Vocabulary...insisting that his own connection with the matter should be carefully concealed. This wish was scrupulously respected while Mr. Case lived, but now it is right to take this opportunity not only to acknowledge his share in the conception and execution of this work, but also to make grateful mention of one of those generous acts with which he quietly filled his life.https://archive.org/stream/vocabularyofengl00barnrich/vocabularyofengl00barnrich_djvu.txt\\" Case died at age 59 on January 6, 1880, after a coughing spell in his home on Rockwell Ave in Downtown Cleveland. His funeral was held three days later on January 9, 1880, inside his home, and he was buried in Erie Street Cemetery in Downtown Cleveland. In 1919, his body and those of his family were transferred to Lake View Cemetery in University Circle. The family monument still stands in Erie Street Cemetery. Endowment Upon his death in 1880, $1.25 million was set aside for the founding of \\"The Case School of Applied Science,\\" carried out by his confidential agent, Henry G. Abbey. Case specified the school teach the subjects of mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, economic geology, mining and metallurgy, natural history, drawing, and modern languages. For any unforeseen needs in the future, Case wrote he would grant permission for adding \\"other kindred branches of learning.\\" On March 29, 1880, articles of incorporation were filed for the founding of the Case School of Applied Science. Classes began on September 15, 1881, first being held in the Case homestead on Rockwell Ave in Downtown Cleveland, before relocating to University Circle in 1885. With the merger with Western Reserve University in 1967, the Case surname remained, honored in the combined institutional naming of Case Western Reserve University.

Plot Geneticist Nathan Sands and his daughter Nicole are hired by the U.S. Navy to create a new weapon; they create an intelligent shark that has the tentacles of an octopus, dubbed S-11, controlling the creature using electromagnetic pulses with a device attached to its head. During one of the test missions, S-11 discards the device before traveling to Mexican waters to find food. Sands and his daughter are then assigned to catch S-11 and travel down to Mexico, where they meet up with fishermen Andy Flynn and Santos, who work for Sands to help capture S-11. Andy, Nicole and Santos track S-11 on Andy's boat as Sands and his men follow in a yacht behind them. Several sightings occur as S-11 kills tourists and locals in the area. Fisherman Pez sends a photo of the creature to a news station, and news reporter Stacy Everheart and her cameraman Bones arrive to find the creature, enlisting Pez's help in the process. Stacy researches Sands and deduces that S-11 is a biological experiment. She, Bones and Pez record it killing a few people on a beach before heading into the ocean on Pez's boat to capture more evidence. Andy and a group of his diver friends go into a cave to find S-11, although the creature attacks them, killing everybody except Andy. He, Nicole and Santos then encounter Stacy, Bones and Pez, although Pez is killed by S-11 before it runs off. Andy, Nicole and Santos pursue it, resulting in Santos being killed. An enraged Andy radios Sands and tells him he's going to kill S-11 despite his orders. Andy and Nicole track S-11 to the mainland, where it kills a few people before Sands and his men arrive and hold Andy hostage. Nicole reprimands her father for wishing to further the experiments, although S-11 arrives and kills Sands's men before Sands himself is killed saving Nicole. Andy and Nicole encounter Stacy and Bones again, who drive them to a resort which S-11 is attacking. Nicole creates a plan to shoot S-11 with a device that will allow her to blow up a computer chip in its brain using her computer. The group arrives at the resort and Bones soon quits as Stacy attempts to put his life in danger to record S-11. However, S-11 then kills them both. Andy manages to shoot S-11 with the device, and Nicole hacks into the chip before overloading it, causing it to explode and kill S-11. Andy and Nicole reunite, and walk off to safety. Cast Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, Sharktopus has a 57% approval rating, based on reviews from 7 critics. Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures described it as \\"cinematic junk food\\" and gave it 3.5 out of 5. Annalee Newitz of io9 wrote \\"Sharktopus represents both your guilt, and the assuaging of it, all in one tasty morsel\\" and called it the Inception of giant monster movies. Home video Sharktopus was released to DVD and Blu-ray on March 15, 2011. A limited edition soundtrack album containing Tom Hiel's musical score to Sharktopus was released by BSX Records in 2012 and is available on CD and digital mp3.

Political career Wight ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Lethbridge in the 1935 Alberta general election. He defeated incumbent Andrew Smeaton and two other candidates with a landslide majority to pick up the seat for his party. The Lethbridge Herald broke a story on August 25, 1937, saying that Wight was imminently to resign his seat. On the same front page, the paper also broke the news that William Chant was to leave the Social Credit caucus. The newspaper had come under attack by Social Credit supporters, forcing the paper to issue a news story standing by its claims the next day. Wight had denied that he had given information about any plan to resign. Seven days later, Wight made his formal announcement of resignation to the media on September 2, 1937, giving as his reason acceptance of a job as an engineer at a department store in Calgary. He sent his resignation letter to speaker Peter Dawson by mail. Wight's resignation caused a controversy as more than a week after Wight announced his resignation the government was claiming that he hadn't resigned. After weeks of turmoil and charges of grandstanding and claims that the government was afraid of losing a by-election, the government finally announced that it had accepted Wight's resignation on September 14, 1937.

His singles are included in the compilation series Max Mix, including Max Mix 2 (\\"Let's Go to Sitges\\"), Max Mix 3 (\\"Bambina\\"), Max Mix 4 (\\"Playboy\\"), Max Mix 5 (\\"Bye Bye Mi Amor\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Lose You\\"), and Max Mix 6 (\\"Never Say You Love Me\\"). In 1990, Lyme left Max Music and joined the label Blanco Y Negro (a competitor at the time for Max Music). He then released the single \\"Perestroika\\". However, it was less successful than his previous singles. This led to the end of Lyme's singing career. Despite the collapse of his singing career, he now owns a recording studio. He produces and writes music for other artists. He also writes songs for TV commercials for companies such as Coca-Cola and Chupa Chups. A compilation of his singles was released by Sony Music in 2004.

The song was written by Shaffer Smith, Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, with production helmed by StarGate. Ne-Yo served as the assistant producer. It was written two days before Rihanna and then boyfriend Chris Brown's altercation on the night of the 2009 Grammy Awards, which occurred on February 8, 2009. The lyrical content, which describes an abusive relationship, led Ne-Yo to describe the song as a \\"premonition\\". \\"Stupid in Love\\" is a R&B; power ballad. Instrumentation is provided by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs. The lyrics of the song revolve around a female protagonist who realizes that she needs to escape an abusive and adulterous boyfriend. \\"Stupid in Love\\" received a mixed to positive response from music critics. Some critics praised Rihanna's emotional delivery of the song whereas others criticized it as being overly dark. Upon the release of Rated R, the song peaked at number seven on the South Korea Gaon International Chart on December 27, 2009. Background and development Co-writer of the song Ne-Yo stated that \\"Stupid in Love\\", which contains lyrics associated with domestic violence, was written two days before Rihanna and Chris Brown's altercation on the night of the 2009 Grammy Awards, which occurred on February 8, 2009. \\"Stupid in Love\\" was written by Shaffer Smith, under his stage name Ne-Yo, and Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, under their production name StarGate. Ne-Yo served as the assistant producer. The song was recorded in 2009 at Metropolis Studios, London. On February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards was cancelled. Reports later surfaced regarding an alleged altercation with then boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, who was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats. In the months that proceeded the altercation, both Rihanna and Brown kept low profiles and avoided media attention. In an interview for MTV News, co-writer of \\"Stupid in Love\\" Ne-Yo, who had collaborated with Rihanna on her previous albums A Girl like Me (2006) and Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), clarified that he would not write a song for Rihanna with regard to Brown as he found it unnecessary and because of his friendship with Brown. Producer Chuck Harmony concurred with Ne-Yo's statement, saying that no matter what song Rihanna released as the lead single people would immediately think that the song is about Brown. In an interview with USA Today, Ne-Yo later revealed that the song was written two days before Rihanna and Brown's altercation, citing it as \\"a premonition.\\" In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News at Rated Rs preview in New York City, Rihanna stated that the album represented her honesty and vulnerbility. During the preview, Calloway noted that \\"Stupid in Love\\" was the song most likely to receive comparisons to Brown, with emphasis on the lyric \\"I still love you, but I can't do this/ I may be dumb but I'm not stupid.\\" Composition \\"Stupid in Love\\" is a R&B; power ballad which lasts for 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is provided by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of \\"Stupid in Love\\" revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line \\"Let me tell you somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life.\\" Rihanna sings the line \\"This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid\\" during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing \\"Trying to make this work / but you act like a jerk.\\" As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing \\"the dunce cap is off\\". \\"Stupid in Love\\" contains a lyrical metaphor, \\"Blood on your hands.\\" Critical reception \\"Stupid in Love\\" garnered mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly praised Rihanna's high level of emotional conviction on \\"Stupid in Love\\", writing that it is a piece of \\"self-lacerating balladry.\\" Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that the song was a direct reference to Rihanna and Brown, writing \\"Rihanna notoriously received a black eye prior to the 2009 Grammy awards when she was attacked by her then boyfriend, R&B; singer Chris Brown. Clearly, this is a potentially life-changing incident, and we get some sense of the emotional aftermath on the ballad Stupid In Love.\\" Norman Mayers for Nu-Soul Magazine concurred with McCormick, writing that Rihanna does not shy away from what happened between herself and Brown, rather, she confronts it directly on \\"Stupid in Love\\". Alex Thornton for HipHopDX wrote that it is difficult to listen to the song without thinking of \\"you know who,\\" referring to Brown. Michaelangelo Matos for The A.V. Club wrote that \\"Stupid in Love\\" sounded more like a therapy sessions than a song. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was critical of the song, labeling it as \\"quite-dim.\\" Emily Tartanella for Popmatters was not impressed by the song, writing Stupid in Love' might be aiming for something more, but they arrive at something less.\\" Chris Richards for The Washington Post wrote that \\"Stupid in Love\\", along with the lead single released from the album \\"Russian Roulette\\", consisted of \\"plodding beats\\" and \\"forgettable hooks\\". Richards continued in his review to write that the song is about \\"heavyhearted confessions to the treacliest of melodies.\\" Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine was critical of the first six songs on Rated R (\\"Mad House\\", \\"Wait Your Turn\\", \\"Hard\\", \\"Stupid in Love\\", \\"Rockstar 101\\" and \\"Russian Roulette\\") were \\"grim and relentless.\\" Track listing *Album version # \\"Stupid in Love\\" ‚Äì 4:01 *Remix version # \\"Stupid in Love\\" (Chew Fu Small Room Fix) ‚Äì 5:32 Credits and personnel ;Recording *Recorded at Metropolis Studios, London; *Mixed at Chung King Studios, New York City ;Personnel *Songwriting ‚Äì Shaffer Smith, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S.

Te Uenuku (literally \\"The Rainbow\\") represents Uenuku, a tribal atua of war who manifests as a rainbow. The taonga is of extreme significance both to the local Tainui people and also for its archaeological value. It is 2.7 metres in height and consists of a simple upright post, the top of which has been carved into a spiral form. From the top of this spiral emerge four waving verticals, reminiscent of the teeth of a comb. The form, though seemingly simple, often causes a powerful reaction in viewers of the artifact.Simmons, D.R. (captions), Brian Brake (photos), and Merimeri Penfold (translations) (1986). Te Maori: Te hokinga mai, the return home, Auckland: Auckland City Art Gallery. . pp. 14‚Äì15. In appearance the carving is very striking and different from the style of carving seen in the later Classic period. Because of the carving's spiritual and cultural significance, photographs are prohibited without the permission of the MƒÅori sovereign. One must seek further written permission to publish the photos anywhere, which is more likely to be granted if the sovereign deems it to be for the nation's interest. Similarly, while the form of Te Uenuku is a popular motif for New Zealand artists, they must still exercise care in its use because of its sacred significance. It is used in stylised form as the logo of the MƒÅori Broadcasting Agency Te MƒÅngai PƒÅho. History The carving is unique in form, and bears a noted resemblance to Hawaiian carving styles. Tainui tradition would suggest that it dates from circa 1400 CE, an era known to New Zealand ethnologists as Te Tipunga or Archaic period. Tradition goes on to say that the spirit now inhabiting the carving originated from Hawaiki, brought over on the Tainui canoe inside a stone, which was later placed inside the spiral at the top of the carving. Sure enough, recent work by the museum has shown that it is made from t≈çtara, a common native New Zealand hard wood. According to MƒÅori verbal history, around the year 1807 the Waipa District of the Waikato was invaded by a strong force led by NgƒÅti Toa chief Pikauterangi. In the Battle of HingakƒÅkƒÅ between Tainui and NgƒÅti Maniapoto warriors close to Lake Ngaroto, the sacred carving of Te Uenuku was lost.Museum website The carving was found buried close to the lake's shore in 1906 when a farmer was draining swampland, and spent some time in the R.W. Bourne collection before being acquired by the Te Awamutu Museum. The stone has not been identified let alone discovered. The work was the centrepiece of the Te Maori exhibition which toured North America and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Te Uenuku was on loan to Te Papa museum in Wellington till September 2011 then returned to its usual resting place at a refurbished display in the Te Awamutu Museum in New Zealand.

Pheromones have evolved in all animal phyla, to signal sex and dominance status, and are responsible for stereotypical social and sexual behaviour among members of the same species. In mammals, these chemical signals are believed to be detected primarily by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a chemosensory organ located at the base of the nasal septum. The VNO is present in most amphibia, reptiles and non-primate mammals but is absent in birds, adult catarrhine monkeys and apes. An active role for the human VNO in the detection of pheromones is disputed; the VNO is clearly present in the fetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults. Two distinct families of vomeronasal receptors ‚Äì which putatively function as pheromone receptors ‚Äì have been identified in the vomeronasal organ (V1Rs and V2Rs). While all are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), they are distantly related to the receptors of the main olfactory system, highlighting their different role. The V1 receptors share between 50 and 90% sequence identity but have little similarity to other families of G protein-coupled receptors. They appear to be distantly related to the mammalian T2R bitter taste receptors and the rhodopsin-like GPCRs. In rat, the family comprises 30‚Äì40 genes. These are expressed in the apical regions of the VNO, in neurons expressing Gi2. Coupling of the receptors to this protein mediates inositol trisphosphate signaling. A number of human V1 receptor homologues have also been found. The majority of these human sequences are pseudogenes, but an apparently functional receptor has been identified that is expressed in the human olfactory system. The V2 receptors are members of GPCR family 3 and have close similarity to the extracellular calcium-sensing receptors. Rodents appear to have around 100 functional V2 receptors and many pseudogenes. These receptors are expressed in the basal regions of VNO, where they couple to G proteins to mediate inositol trisphosphate responses. Homologues have also been identified in fish, and the ligand specificity of one such receptor has been determined: a receptor from goldfish olfactory epithelium has been reported to bind basic amino acids, which are odorants for fish.

Found in North America and Europe, it produces small whitish to gray fruit bodies with bell-shaped caps that are up to in diameter. The distinguishing characteristic of the mushroom is the fragile stipe, which is seated on a flat disk marked with distinct grooves, and fringed with a row of bristles. The mushrooms grow in small troops on leaves and other debris of deciduous and coniferous trees. The mushroom's spores are white in deposit, smooth, and ellipsoid-shaped with dimensions of 6‚Äì10 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 Œºm. In the development of the fruit body, the preliminary stipe and cap structures appear at the same time within the primordium, and hyphae originating from the stipe form a cover over the developing structures. The mycelia of the mushroom is believed to have bioluminescent properties. Taxonomy The species was first named Agaricus stylobates by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, and sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries. It was later transferred to the genus Mycena in 1871 by Paul Kummer when he raised many of Fries' \\"tribes\\" to the rank of genus. The species has also been placed in the genera Basidopus by Franklin Sumner Earle in 1909, and Pseudomycena by Karel Cejp in 1930; both of those genera have since been subsumed into Mycena. The Greek word stylobates means \\"column foundation or base\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"bulbous bonnet\\". British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke called it the \\"discoid Mycena\\" in his 1871 Handbook of British Fungi. Description The delicate stipe rests atop a flat circular disc. The cap of M. stylobates is in diameter, and depending on its age may range in shape from obtusely conic to convex to bell-shaped to flattened. The structure of the cap margin also depends on the age of the mushroom, progressing from straight or curved inward slightly, to margin flaring or curved backward. The cap surface is smooth, although if viewed with a magnifying glass, minute spines can be seen. As it ages, the surface becomes smooth, moist and somewhat glistening, and it shows grooves corresponding to the position of the gills underneath the cap. The cap color is evenly pale watery gray. The flesh is thin, pallid, and has no distinguishable odor or taste. The gills appear closely spaced in unexpanded caps, but usually more distant in old individuals. Between 8 and 16 gills extend from the margin to the stipe; there are additionally one or two tiers of small gills (lamellulae) that do not reach fully from the margin to the stipe. The gills are narrow but become ventricose (swelling in the middle) and sometimes very broad in age, and are attached by a line or are very narrowly adnate. Sometimes the gills split away from the stipe while remaining attached to each other; in this way they form a collar around the stipe. Gills are pale gray but soon become whitish, with even edges. The stipe is long, 0.5‚Äì1 mm thick, and, above the level of the flat circular disc at the base, is equal in width throughout. The stipe is covered with fine white scattered fibrils, or is delicately pruinose (as if covered with a fine white powder), but it later becomes smooth. Its color is bluish-gray when fresh but soon it fades to gray. The basal disc is grooved (from gill impressions) and pruinose or covered with fine minute hairs, but soon becomes smooth.Smith, pp. 53‚Äì55. The insubstantial fruit bodies are considered inedible. =Microscopic characteristics= The spores are 6‚Äì10 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 Œºm, narrowly ellipsoid, and faintly amyloid. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, rarely two-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidium (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant and variable in structure, usually club-shaped with between two and five thick obtuse projections that arise from near the apex, sometimes more or less covered with numerous protuberances over the enlarged portion and the neck more or less contorted. They measure 26‚Äì38 by 8‚Äì13 Œºm, and are hyaline. The gill flesh is made of greatly enlarged cells, and stains pale vinaceous (red wine color) in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a pellicle which usually gelatinizes in potassium hydroxide or water mounts prepared for microscopy. The surface hyphae are covered with short rodlike projections. Sometimes some of the hyphae become aggregated into peglike structures that project from the surface, and cause the appearance of scattered coarse spines on the cap when viewed under a 10X magnifying lens. The tissue beneath the pellicle is made entirely of greatly enlarged cells, which appear pale vinaceous in iodine stain. The mycelia of M. stylobates, when grown in pure culture, is bioluminescent, a phenomenon first reported in 1931. The fruit bodies are not known to be bioluminescent. =Similar species= There are several species of Mycena that have a basal disc similar to M. stylobates. Mycena mucor is usually smaller than M. stylobates, and grows on fallen, decaying leaves of oak. It has different cheilocystidia, with very slender excrescences. Also, the margin of the basal disc is not ciliate like M. stylobates. M. bulbosa, a species that grows on woody stalks in wet habitats, has nonamyloid spores, and gill edges that contain a tough-elastic, gelatinous thread. M. pseudoseta, described as a new species from Thailand in 2003 forms smaller fruit bodies with differently shaped cheilocystidia and cap hyphae. Fruit body development The ontogeny, or development, of Mycena stylobates fruit bodies has been investigated in detail using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. According to Volker Walther and colleagues, the development can be divided into two phases: in the first, the primordium is established that contains all the structures of the mature fruit body; in the second stage, the primordial stipe elongates rapidly, and the newly exposed hymenium immediately begins spore production. The first detected stage of fruit body formation was an irregularly arranged hyphal structure within the colonized substrate. After rupturing the surface of the substrate and establishing itself there, the structure develops a layer of wrapping hyphae that covers the entire primordium. The structures of the stipe and the cap develop simultaneously. The developing stipe, cap, and basal disc together form a secondary ring-like cavity, in which the gills develop. Gill development initiates with a number of small alveolae on the lower side of the cap, which are covered with a hymenophoral palisade (a group of tightly packed, roughly parallel cells). The margins of these alveolae form the primary gills. The hymenophoral palisade spreads from the developing alveolae to the gill edge; the edge of the primary gills is forked in the early stages of its development. The secondary gills (lamellulae) are formed by the ridges folding down from the lower side of the cap. In contrast to the primary gills, they are covered with hymenophoral palisade from the beginning. Spore production begins immediately after the stipe elongates. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Mycena stylobates grow scattered or in groups on oak leaves or coniferous needles, in the spring and summer or early autumn. It is common during warm, wet seasons. Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith has collected it in Tennessee, Michigan, Idaho, and Washington in the United States, and in Nova Scotia and Ontario in Canada. It is also found in Europe, including Britain, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania, Scotland, Serbia, Sweden, and Turkey. Although it has been reported several times from Australia, mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic concluded in a 2003 publication that the records \\"are best regarded as erroneous\\".

She was initially elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1952 and served seven consecutive terms in the House. In 1966, Weisenborn was elected to the Ohio Senate, following the Voting Rights Act of 1965. She was reelected to a second term in 1970. An advocate for women's rights, Weisenborn challenged and was critical of the fact that no women served as committee chairs in the Ohio legislature. Ultimately, she became one of the first, as chair of the Senate Education Committee. By 1974, the Fifth Senate District was equally distributed among Republicans and Democrats, and Weisenborn was considered vulnerable in her bid for a third term. She was challenged by Neal Zimmers, who was an attorney in Dayton. Ultimately, Weisenborn lost the election, in a year where Democrats took control of both houses of the state legislature. In all, Weisenborn served twenty two years as a legislator. Following her time in elected office, Weisenborn returned to Dayton where she remained active in gardening and her local historical society, as well as championing many park districts throughout the Miami Valley.

Career =Youth= Koffie grew up in the Ghanaian capital Accra, and began his soccer career when he joined Rot-Weiss Accra - a development club affiliated with German club Rot-Weiss Essen - as a nine-year-old in 2000. He spent five years with Rot-Weiss Accra, before signing his first professional contract in 2006 with Ghanaian Division Two League team International Allies at the age of 15. =Professional= Koffie played four full seasons with International Allies, scoring 28 goals in all competitions, before leaving the club in 2009 to try to secure a spot with a professional team in Europe. The Swedish side Hammarby IF was at a scouting trip in Ghana when Koffie broke his leg. Hammarby helped him with the operation and the rehabilitation in Sweden. Later on he trained with the Danish club Randers, but was not offered a contract. Having been spotted by Vancouver's director of soccer operations Tom Soehn at a tournament in Ghana six months previously, Koffie relocated to Canada in 2010, and subsequently signed with the Vancouver Whitecaps of the USSF Division 2 Professional League.Whitecaps add four, including MLS signer SalgadoTeen Whitecap Gershon Koffie aims to impress with an eye to MLS He made his Whitecaps debut on September 5, 2010, in a 0-0 tie with the Puerto Rico Islanders.

Vancouver were also to receive a percentage of any future transfer fee obtained by New England. Koffie would later move on to make 22 competitive league games for New England during the season.

He succeeded Kasim Khan Zainuddin bin Feer Khan. He was the first Da'i to be martyred for his faith, and in a manner that resembles the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, and so his burial place, Mazar-e-Qutbi, is referred to as Choti Karbala (smaller Karbala).  Early life  Syedna Qutbuddin was born in Ahmedabad during the era of the 26th Dai, Dawood ibn Ajab Shah, on the night of 30th Dhu al-Qadah 985 AH. During his youth, he accompanied his father, the 27th Dai, Dawood Bin Qutubshah to Lahore to the court of the Mughal Emperor, Jalal-ud-din Akbar, during the fitnah of Sulayman bin Hassan. Akbar had summoned Qutub Shah to his court to address the dispute of succession raised by Sulayman, but ultimately issued a royal decree in Qutub Shah's favor.  Accession  Qutubuddin was close-confidant to his brother, the 29th Da'i, Abd al-Tayyib Zakiuddin I. After his brother's death, Qutubuddin continued to serve the 30th Da'i, Ali Shams al-Din IV, who was based in Yemen. Later, the 31st Da'i, Kasim Khan Zainuddin, appointed Qutubuddin as his Mazoon (second-in-command), and a while later, his Mansoos (successor).Khaza‚Äôin u Imam il Muttaqeen; By:Syedna Taher Saifuddin; 1372AH Qutubuddin became Da'i al-Mutlaq in 1054 AH (1646 AD). He held the office for 1 year and 8 months before he was slain on the order of Aurangzeb, the Mughal governor of Gujarat, on the grounds of heresy.  Martyrdom  In the month of Jumada al-Ula 1056 AH (1646 AD), false allegations of rafida (one who rejects the sunnat of Muhammad, introduces innovations viz. bidat, and practices exaggeration viz. ghulat), were made to Abdul Ghawi, an office bearer of the governorate. On 28 Jumada al-Ula, Shah Beg arrested Qutubuddin and Feer Khan Shujauddin.(Kitab al-Tadhkirah ; By: Syedi Hasan-ji Badshah ibn Syedi Shamas- Khan, fore father of Syedna Taher Saifuddin) Qutubuddin and Shujauddin spent the next twenty days in prison, meanwhile, Abdul Ghawi instructed his scholars to peruse books ceased from Qutubuddin's personal library but was unable to discern anything blasphemous or apostastic. On 21 Jumada al-Akhir, Qutubuddin was summoned to an audience in front of Aurangzeb where Abdul Ghawi asked him to enter guilty plea and repent for his sins in exchange for pardon. Qutubuddin retorted, \\"I am not rafzi, nor were my forefathers. We are truly upon the sunnat of prophet Muhammad. I declare that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger. I read the holy book, I offer daily prayers, give zakat, fast in the holy month of Ramadan, and perform hajj to the Bayt al-Allah. I am a Muslim. How is my blood legal for you to shed?\\" Abdul Ghawi had a group of elites from the city sign their names to a false confession (mehzara) under duress. The confession was introduced as evidence but the judge demanded an in-person testimonial. On 26 Jumada al-Akhir, Abdul Ghawi summoned two children from Qutubuddin's household who confessed under the false-pretense that Qutubuddin would be released. The judge instead issued a death sentence. On the morning of 27 Jumada al-Akhir 1056 H, Aurangzeb approved the execution order. Abdul Ghawi had Shah Beg carry out the death sentence immediately.  Succession  Qutubuddin was succeeded by Feer Khan Shujauddin. Mufaddal Saifuddin, the current Da'i al-Mutlaq, is from his progeny.

Emergence =The issue= The scandal began in September 2010 after Michael Arrington, editor of the TechCrunch publication, wrote in his blog that he had been turned away from a secret meeting among so-called \\"super angels\\" he knew, held at Bin38, a wine bar in San Francisco's Marina District. The participants at the meeting, among other things, discussed how they could compete with other angels, venture capitalists, and the Y Combinator business incubator for the limited pool of worthy investment opportunities. Arrington said that after the meeting, he had been informed by two of the attendees that the investors had discussed how to fix low valuations for new start-up companies, and how to keep better-funded venture capitalists from investing. The blog became the subject of discussion among the Silicon Valley start-up community over the next several days. Investor Ron Conway, whose business partner attended the meeting, wrote an email highly critical of the angels involved and called the event \\"despicable and embarrassing\\". Dave McClure, a well-known angel present at the event, wrote in a blog that Arrington's account was inaccurate, and a tweet (later deleted) complaining about Conway. Chris Sacca wrote a lengthy email that defended the participants and was critical of Conway, which was also leaked to TechCrunch. Aftermath and critique Reports arose that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation began reviewing the incident. There was skepticism that there was actually any collusion or that price fixing could succeed if it was attempted. The event also gave rise to various online cultural phenomena. Among other things there was a flash mob at the wine bar, a Hitler Downfall parody, a spike in the establishment's Google rank, a number of Twitter jokes, and so-called \\"fakeplans\\" for super-angel meetups on the site plancast.com.

Real rigidities can be distinguished from nominal rigidities, rigidities that do not adjust because prices can be sticky and fail to change value even as the underlying factors that determine prices fluctuate. Real rigidities, along with nominal, are a key part of new Keynesian economics. Economic models with real rigidities lead to nominal shocks (like changes in monetary policy) having a large impact on the economy. In the product market Real price rigidity can result from several factors. First, firms with market power can raise their mark-ups to offset declines in marginal cost and maintain a high price. Search costs can contribute to real rigidities through \\"thick market externalities\\". A thick market has many buyers and sellers, so search costs are lower. Thick markets can be expected to occur more often during booms, and they thin during downturns. If this pattern causes marginal costs to increase during recessions, thick markets can lead to real rigidities. \\"Customer markets\\" can also create real rigidities. In customer markets, firms take advantage of their market power and refuse to lower prices because they do not want to give customers an incentive to shop elsewhere and search for prices that are even lower. They would rather offer the customer a consistent price and have the customer consistently shop at their store. Also, customers will likely not notice a price cut as much as a price increase, giving the store less of an incentive to cut prices. The complexity of the \\"input-output table\\" can also lead to rigidity. Decentralized global supply chains lead to many firms competing for the same inputs and producing the same outputs, but an individual firm does not know whether the other firms and industries will be affected the same way in a shock. Cutting prices in a situation would not necessarily create more demand for a firm's products; it may just lead to lower profits and bankruptcy. Firms face large information requirements in determining how to optimize their pricing. They not only have to know the demand for their own goods and their own costs, they have to know the pricing factors for all their competitors and other firms in the vast market of inputs and outputs. Capital market imperfections lead to more real rigidities. Capital markets may have asymmetric information problems because borrowers are better aware of their situation than lenders. This can lead to firms seeking more external finance during downturns, which drives up the firm's cost and creates another rigidity. Imperfect information can also create rigidity in the consumer market. Consumers may see price as an indicator for quality. Firms may be reluctant to cut their prices if they fear that consumers might start to the product as \\"cheap\\". In the labor market New Keynesian economists have sought to explain persistently high unemployment in industrialized economies. New Keynesians explain part of this excess supply in the labor market with real wage rigidities that hold wages above market clearing levels. Economists have three main groups of theories for explaining real rigidities in the labor market: implicit contract theories, efficiency wage theories, and insider- outsider theories. New Keynesian economics is especially associated with the latter two. Implicit contract theory attributes stable real wages to implied agreements between employers and workers. Firms serve not just as consumers of labor, but also as wage insurers. By showing their workers that they will provide stable real wages, firms secure their loyalty. Seeing implicit contracts as a poor basis for real wage rigidities, new Keynesian economists sought other explanations. Efficiency wage theories explain why firms might pay their employees more than the market clearing rate. Since workers' productivity can be dependent on their wages, employers have an incentive to pay their workers to the point where they are most productive. Under these models, wages are not determined strictly by the supply and demand for labor but by the marginal productivity of workers. Economists have several explanations for the intuition behind efficiency wages. In \\"adverse selection\\" models, firms find it more cost effective to offer a high wage and attract skilled workers rather than carefully investigating a workers skills and firing workers who turn out not to be adequately skilled. In the \\"shirking model,\\" a firm pays a worker above the market rate because they want to give the worker an incentive to perform well and not shirk at his current job. If the worker's next best job opportunity offers lower pay than his current position, he will have an incentive to perform well to keep his current job. In \\"turnover cost\\" models, firms pay their workers above market wages to prevent turnover and the costs of recruiting and training replacement employees. In \\"gift exchange\\" models firms pay high wages to increase productivity through improved worker morale. In fairness models, a more recent trend in the efficiency wage literature, employers have to pay a sociologically \\"fair\\" wage in order to encourage workers to be productive.

Its enactment has thus preceded the birth of the Italian Constitution, which the statute would become an integral part on February 26, 1948. The statute was drafted by a commission formed by politicians of the Committee of National Liberation accompanied by three teachers of the Law Faculty of the University of Palermo. The three lawyers make a crucial contribution and was in particular administrative cases expert Giovanni Salemi (one of the three lawyer) to treat the drafting of the entire text of the bill containing the Statute. The process which would create the Statute began May 13, 1945, a year before its enactment. The principles constituting the text was intended to define the character of the Sicilian Region with great force. The new entity, in addition to being equipped with tangible assets like land and people, under the Statute also had intangible items such as power control. This power allowed the Sicilian Region for their own development and the right to adopt legal standards are major, assuming an identity that differentiates it from the State despite the commitment to maintain its political unity. The statute stipulated that all state property and assets, except those involving the defense of the State or services of national character, go from the Italian state to the Sicilian Region and that it should provide for their financial needs with own taxes. In the special statute was provided for the establishment of a High Court established in Rome appointed to ensure compliance with the limits of the different powers of the Region and State and the principles enshrined in the Constitution. The High Court, with one major ruling of July 19, 1948, enshrined the principle of the immutability of the statute with an ordinary law of the State. After ten years, its power to affirm a judicial review on laws has been stripped by Constitutional Court.This free zone from centralized control on laws was not justified: it was an in-house constitutional review and ran off for the uniqueness and exclusivity of the judicial review on laws, from the only organ that has been invested in by the Constitution: the Constitutional Court: The statute also establishes the governing bodies of the Region: the Sicilian Regional Assembly, the Executive and President of the Region.

Creation thumbnail The creation of the monument was undertaken by the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus, so as to have a permanent Armenian Genocide monument within the Armenia street compound. The foundation of the monument took place in 1985, on the 70th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, but at the time there was no timetable for the erection of this monument. Bone fragments brought from Der Zor of victims of the Armenian Genocide In 1989, the Armenian Prelature selected this out of two designs submitted by well-known painter and architect, John Guevherian, and construction started in early 1990. It features three marble arches, representing Armenia, the Armenian Diaspora and Armenians within the former Soviet Union. In the centre of the central arch there is a black granite cross, sculpted by famous Armenian sculptor Levon Tokmadjian, who was a guest at the Melkonian Educational Institute at the time, commissioned to carve a series of busts for pillars of Armenian history and letters. The marble monument is positioned on a raised marble base and bears (from left to right) a Greek, Armenian and English inscription. Unveiling The monument was unveiled by Senior Archimandrite Yeghishe Mandjikian on 24 April 1992, in the presence of a large number of people attending. In 1996 some bone remains of martyrs of the Armenian Genocide brought by a delegation of the Armenian Relief Society from Markade, Deir ez-Zor desert, were interred within the monument. In 2000 more bone remains were placed within two reliquaries, built after the donation of the Eghoyian and Tembekidjian families, surrounded by five khachkar-like columns built after the donation of Anahid der Movsessian.

In Child's canonical approach, writes Barton, \\"the interpreter of the Bible should not confront the biblical text as if it were a newly discovered document.\\" To the contrary, as Barton reads Childs, \\"a properly theological reading of the Bible, by contrast, would treat it just as it stands as a vehicle of a living faith.\\"John Barton The Nature of Biblical Criticism (Westminster John Knox, 2007), 143-144.

He was also a well-respected innovator in industrial design and an architect of exhibition arrangements. While a professor of the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w, he was among the co-creators of the Industrial Forms Department. Pawlowski's experimental work looked at the relationship between visual form and kinetic movement. Work His 1957 experimental film Kineformy (Cineforms) consisted of projecting moving abstract models onto a screen using a special image-distorting lens. Pawlowski devised a light machine with two crank-like handles to move the models and the lenses. The light, passing through the lenses, distorted the forms, resulting in a series of very complex images ‚Äì wispy smoke, diaphanous curtains, passing ghosts and then suddenly solid organic forms. This light performance was then filmed. It became an international success and today is one of the leading examples of avant-garde film and video in Poland. Paw≈Çowski's later work included Naturally Shaped Forms (1963), reliefs produced by the pressure of metal tape on the reverse of the picture, Mannequins (1968), sculptures produced from a liquid medium setting in sacks tied with a cord into casts shaped by the force of inertia of the medium, Stimulators of Inadequate Impressions (1967), sculptures enclosed in containers whose shapes may only be determined by touch, and Conversations with an Idiot (1977‚Äì1980), an attempt to design the 'ideal' chair with the aid of a computer.

The equidistant conic projection with Tissot's indicatrix of deformation. Standard parallels of 15¬∞N and 45¬∞N. The equidistant conic projection is a conic map projection commonly used for maps of small countries as well as for larger regions such as the continental United States that are elongated east-to-west. Also known as the simple conic projection, a rudimentary version was described during the 2nd century CE by the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy in his work Geography. The projection has the useful property that distances along the meridians are proportionately correct, and distances are also correct along two standard parallels that the mapmaker has chosen. The two standard parallels are also free of distortion. For maps of regions elongated east-to-west (such as the continental United States) the standard parallels are chosen to be about a sixth of the way inside the northern and southern limits of interest. This way distortion is minimized throughout the region of interest. Transformation Coordinates from a spherical datum can be transformed to an equidistant conic projection with rectangular coordinates by using the following formulas, where Œª is the longitude, Œª the reference longitude, œÜ the latitude, œÜ the reference latitude, and œÜ and œÜ the standard parallels: :\\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\rho \\\\sin\\\\left[n \\\\left(\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_0\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ y &= \\\\rho_0 - \\\\rho \\\\cos\\\\left[n \\\\left(\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_0\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\end{align} where : \\\\rho = (G - \\\\varphi) : \\\\rho_0 = (G - \\\\varphi_0) : G = \\\\frac {\\\\cos{\\\\varphi_1}}{n} + \\\\varphi_1 : n = \\\\frac {\\\\cos{\\\\varphi_1} - \\\\cos{\\\\varphi_2}}{\\\\varphi_2 - \\\\varphi_1} Constants n, G, and œÅ need only be determined once for the entire map. If one standard parallel is used (i.e. œÜ = œÜ), the formula for n above is indeterminate, but then : n = \\\\sin{\\\\varphi_1} The reference point (Œª, œÜ) with longitude Œª and latitude œÜ, transforms to the x,y origin at (0,0) in the rectangular coordinate system. The Y axis maps the central meridian Œª, with y increasing northwards, which is orthogonal to the X axis mapping the central parallel œÜ, with x increasing eastwards. Other versions of these transformation formulae include parameters to offset the map coordinates so that all x,y values are positive, as well as a scaling parameter relating the radius of the sphere (earth) to the units used on the map. The formulae used for ellipsoidal datums are more involved.

He was the son of sultan Muhammad I Tapar. At the age of twelve (1120‚Äì1121), he rebelled unsuccessfully against his elder brother, Mahmud II, who however forgave him. At Mahmud's death in 1131, the power was contended between Mahmud's son, Dawud, Mas'ud, whose powerbase was in Iraq, Seljuq-Shah (in Fars and Khuzistan) and Toghrul II. In 1133 Mas'ud was able to obtain recognition as sultan from the emirs of Baghdad, and to receive the investiture by caliph al-Mustarshid. Toghrul, who controlling the eastern provinces of the western Seljuq, launched a military campaign but was defeated by Mas'ud in May 1133. Toghrul died in 1134. Also in 1133 Mas'ud supported Zengi, besieged by al-Mustarshid's troops in Mosul. In 1135 caliph al-Mustarshid contested his authority but, on 14 June of that year, he was defeated and made prisoner at Daimarg, between Hamadan and Baghdad, and killed two months later by the Hashshashins. As al-Mustarshid's successor, al-Rashid, also rebelled with the support of Zengi, Mas'ud besieged him in Baghdad, forcing him to flee to Mosul, where he was also killed by the Hashshashins. Although able to ensure control over Iraq, Mas'ud's power over the rest of the Suljuq empire was uncertain: apart from Khorasan and Transoxiana, which had been long time under the control of his uncle Ahmed Sanjar, Dawud kept control over Azerbaijan for several years, while weastern Persia was effectively ruled by emir Bozaba until Mas'ud defeated him, together with other emirs, in 1147. In 1148 Mas'ud faced another coalition against him, this time aiming to place Malik Shah on the throne in his place. During his troublesome reign, Mas'ud was forced to accept to delegate his authority to numerous emirs with the iqta', a tax institution which reduced the imperial incomes. Other became effectively independent sultans, such as Zengi. This caused, according to historian ibn al-Athir, the beginning of the steep decline of the Seljuq Empire. Mas'ud died at Hamadan in 1152. He was briefly succeeded by Malik-Shah III, who had been forgiven by Mas'ud, and also given one the sultan's daughters as spouse.

Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, wearing a gown designed by Ethel Franken of Bergdorf Goodman, arrive at the D.C. Armory in Washington D.C. for an inaugural ball held on the evening of Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961 United States presidential inaugural balls are large social gatherings, both white tie and black tie, held to celebrate the commencement of a new term of the President of the United States. Planned and sanctioned by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the official inaugural balls occur throughout the evening of Inauguration Day in the Washington D.C. area and are invitation-only, attended by guests who are issued pre-paid tickets. The President, First Lady, Vice-President and Second Lady, all make personal appearances at each of the inaugural balls held in their honor. Catered food, beverages, and live entertainment performed by national and globally acclaimed musicians are provided at the inaugural balls. Other inaugural balls, unofficial and often less formal that occur before and on Inauguration Day, are given by state societies, businesses, and private organizations. History A stereoscopic view of a ballroom in Washington D.C. decorated for an inaugural ball held for the first inauguration of William McKinley on March 4, 1897 The tradition of presidential inaugural balls in the United States has evolved over time. The first inaugural ball was held by sponsors on May 7, 1789 in New York City, one week after the first inauguration of George Washington. In 1809, Dolley Madison hosted a gala at Long's Hotel in Washington D.C. after the first inauguration of James Madison was held earlier in the day at the United States Capitol. A total of 400 tickets were sold for $4 a piece. In 1833, two balls were held for the second inauguration of Andrew Jackson and in 1841, a third ball was added for the inauguration of William Henry Harrison. For the inaugurations of Zachary Taylor in 1849, James Buchanan in 1857, and the second inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant in 1873, temporary buildings were constructed at Judiciary Square. In 1865, a ball was held for Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration in the Model Room at the United States Patent Office, the first ball held in a government building, while in 1869, Grant during his first inauguration, was honored with an inaugural ball held at the Treasury Building. Between 1885 and 1909, inaugural balls were held at the National Museum Building (now the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building) and the Pension Building (now the National Building Museum). Other presidents have cancelled inaugural balls for various reasons. Franklin Pierce, who was mourning the recent death of his son in 1853, Woodrow Wilson, who in 1913 felt that inaugural balls were too expensive, and Warren G. Harding, who in 1921 wanted to set an example of simplicity, all opted to end the custom of inaugural balls. Private parties known as \\"charity balls\\", were held during the second inauguration of Calvin Coolidge in 1925, for Herbert Hoover in 1929, and especially during the depression and World War II era inaugurations of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, 1937, 1941, and 1945. Official inaugural balls were not reinstated until the Second inauguration of Harry S. Truman in 1949. Due to their growing popularity, the number of inaugural balls grew starting in the 1950s. During the 1953 inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, there were two balls and by 1957, there were a total of four balls held for Eisenhower's second inauguration. A fifth was added for the Inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Reflecting the mood of previous presidents in the early 20th century, Jimmy Carter stripped his 1977 inaugural balls of their frivolity and glamor, charging no more than $25 per ticket. By 1997, the number of inaugural balls reached a peak of fourteen during the second inauguration of Bill Clinton. However, the number was reduced to eight for the first inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001 and nine for his second inauguration in 2005. For the inaugural balls held during the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, 10 official and 121 unofficial inaugural balls were given.

It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin in an hour and last for up to a day. Common side effects include sleepiness and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied while use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is believed to work in part by anticholinergic and antihistamine mechanisms. Meclizine was patented in 1951 and came into medical use in 1953. It is available as a generic medication and often over the counter. In the United States the wholesale cost per dose is about US$0.03. It is not available in Australia. In 2017, it was the 161st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical uses Meclizine is used to treat symptoms of motion sickness. Safety and efficacy in children younger than twelve years of age has not been established; therefore, use in this population is not recommended. Meclizine should be taken with caution in the elderly due to increased risk of confusion and amnesia.MICROMEDEX 2.0. Accessed 7 November 2010. =Motion sickness= Meclizine is effective in inhibiting nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness. The drug is safe for treating nausea in pregnancy and is a first-line therapy for this use.Embryotox: Meclozin Doxylamine is similarly safe. Meclizine may not be strong enough for especially sickening motion stimuli and second-line defenses should be tried in those cases. =Vertigo= Meclizine may be used to treat motion sickness or vertigo such as in those with Meniere's disease. Side effects Some common side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, and tiredness may occur. Meclizine has been shown to have fewer dry mouth side effects than the traditional treatment for motion sickness, transdermal scopolamine. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but immediate medical attention should be sought if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing.Meclizine - oral, Antivert, D-vert, Dramamine II. Accessed 7 November 2010. =Drowsiness= Drowsiness may result as a side effect of taking meclizine. Users are advised not to operate heavy machinery while under the influence. The consumption of alcohol while under the influence of meclizine may result in additional drowsiness. =Elderly= As with any anticholinergic agent, meclizine may cause confusion or aggravate symptoms in those with dementia in the geriatric population (older than 65 years). Therefore, caution should be used when administering meclizine to the elderly.Merck Manuals, Online Medical Library: Meclizine (Drug Information Provided by Lexi-Comp), revised January 2010, accessed 7 November 2010. Mechanism of action Meclizine is an antagonist at H1 receptors. It possesses anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Its antiemetic and antivertigo effects are not fully understood, but its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. It has however been suggested that meclizine only has an inhibitory effect under normal viewing-circumstances, as the drug has been shown to enhance an isolated vestibular response. Much like motion-sickness arises from a discrepancy between multiple senses, Meclizine most likely affects a wide array of sensory mechanisms related to self-motion. Meclizine also is a dopamine antagonist at D1-like and D2-like receptors but does not cause catalepsy in mice, perhaps because of its anticholinergic activity. Chemistry Meclizine is a first-generation antihistamine (nonselective H1 antagonist) of the piperazine class. It is structurally and pharmacologically similar to buclizine, cyclizine, and hydroxyzine, but has a shorter half-life of six hours compared to cyclizine and hydroxyzine with about 20 hours (though half-life should not be confused with duration). It is used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent, specifically in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness.Clinical Pharmacology. Clinical Pharmacology, revised 20 November 2009, accessed 7 November 2010. Meclizine is sometimes combined with opioids, especially ones of the open-chain class like methadone, dextropropoxyphene, and dipipanone. Similarly, Diconal is a combination drug containing dipipanone and cyclizine. Synthesis (4-Chlorphenyl)-phenylmethanol is halogenated with thionyl chloride before adding acetylpiperazine. The acetyl group is cleaved with diluted sulfuric acid. An N-alkylation of the piperazine ring with 3-methylbenzylchloride completes the synthesis. 450px Alternatively, the last step can be replaced by a reductive N-alkylation with 3-methylbenzaldehyde. The reductive agent is hydrogen, and Raney nickel is used as a catalyst.US 2 709 169 (UCB, 1955) 525px Meclizine is obtained and used as a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of the two stereoisomers.

It is the first known Mesozoic bird with heterodactyl feet specifically adapted for climbing, and was probably among the most arboreal of the enantiornithines. Unlike its relatives, it had an unusually long (17mm) skeletal tail made up of 20 vertebrae, similar to the tails of dromaeosaurids. However, this may have been a juvenile feature. The fossil was named after Yang Liwei, the first Chinese astronaut in space.  Description  Some sources have doubted the presence of heterodactyl feet in this genus. Lockley et al. (2007) found that its metatarsal II was not strongly curved inwards compared to other enantiornitheans, and they also noted that the supposed reversed second toe claw probably acquired that position after the animal died. In 2009, Jingmai O'Connor considered Dalingheornis to be a nomen dubium due to its remains being stored in a private collection. However, this proposal has been criticized by Mickey Mortimer, as Dalingheornis is a valid genus under ICZN guidelines despite its inaccessibility to paleontologists.

He was the first foreign Engineer-in-Chief appointed by the Japanese government, for guiding and supervising railway construction. Biography Morel was born in London on 17 November 1840 (recorded as 1841 on his gravestone). He studied civil engineering at King's College London. Between 1862 and 1863, Morel was involved in railway construction in New Zealand followed by a period in Australia between 1864 and 1865. In 1867, Morel was active in British North Borneo for the Labuan Coal Company, building railways and sinking mining shafts, living at Labuan island, when he was invited to Japan by British envoy Sir Harry Parkes. During his short assignment he made significant proposals to the Japanese government regarding engineering administration and education. The government established the Ministry of Public Works in December 1870 on his advice to integrate the introduction of foreign technologies and their application. Morel designed Japan's first railway, connecting Shimbashi Station in Tokyo with Sakuragich≈ç Station in Yokohama. The locomotives and rails were imported from England. Through discussions with It≈ç Hirobumi and ≈åkuma Shigenobu, Morel advised on what industries and technologies were necessary for Japan to build railways, and through discussions Japan's standard gauge of was established. During poor weather when work on the line was not possible, he took his Japanese engineers and surveyors into his house for lectures.Pedlar, The imported pioneers: Westerners who helped build modern Japan. p.96 Morel's grave in Yokohama Morel suffered from tuberculosis before his arrival in Japan, and as his condition worsened he resigned his post with the intention of going to India. He received a 5,000 yen reward from the Japanese government, a tremendous amount at the time. However, he died in Yokohama on 5 November 1871, shortly before the opening ceremonies for the railway. His grave in the Foreigner's Cemetery in Naka-ku, Yokohama is designated as a \\"national railway memorial\\". A bronze bust outside Sakuragich≈ç Station commemorates his work. Morel's wife was long reported to have been Japanese, but this was made up by a novelist to make Morel's story more interesting: he married Harriett Wynder, an Englishwoman, on 4 February 1862 at St Pancras Church in London. She died in Yokohama on 6 November 1871, the day after Morel, from acute nervous or respiratory disease.Hayashida (2010) pp.5‚Äì42 See also Oyatoi gaikokujin, hired foreigners in Japan Notes References *Nish, Ian.

As it is the GTP bound form of ras which is active, these proteins are said to be down-regulators of ras.

In an urn model, objects of real interest (such as atoms, people, cars, etc.) are represented as colored balls in an urn or other container. In the basic P√≥lya urn model, the urn contains x white and y black balls; one ball is drawn randomly from the urn and its color observed; it is then returned in the urn, and an additional ball of the same color is added to the urn, and the selection process is repeated. Questions of interest are the evolution of the urn population and the sequence of colors of the balls drawn out. This endows the urn with a self-reinforcing property sometimes expressed as the rich get richer. Note that in some sense, the P√≥lya urn model is the \\"opposite\\" of the model of sampling without replacement, where every time a particular value is observed, it is less likely to be observed again, whereas in a P√≥lya urn model, an observed value is more likely to be observed again. In both of these models, the act of measurement has an effect on the outcome of future measurements. (For comparison, when sampling with replacement, observation of a particular value has no effect on how likely it is to observe that value again.) In a P√≥lya urn model, successive acts of measurement over time have less and less effect on future measurements, whereas in sampling without replacement, the opposite is true: After a certain number of measurements of a particular value, that value will never be seen again. One of the reasons for interest in this particular rather elaborate urn model (i.e. with duplication and then replacement of each ball drawn) is that it provides an example in which the count (initially x black and y white) of balls in the urn is not concealed, which is able to approximate the correct updating of subjective probabilities appropriate to a different case in which the original urn content is concealed while ordinary sampling with replacement is conducted (without the P√≥lya ball-duplication). Because of the simple \\"sampling with replacement\\" scheme in this second case, the urn content is now static, but this greater simplicity is compensated for by the assumption that the urn content is now unknown to an observer. A Bayesian analysis of the observer's uncertainty about the urn's initial content can be made, using a particular choice of (conjugate) prior distribution. Specifically, suppose that an observer knows that the urn contains only identical balls, each coloured either black or white, but he does not know the absolute number of balls present, nor the proportion that are of each colour. Suppose that he holds prior beliefs about these unknowns: for him the probability distribution of the urn content is well approximated by some prior distribution for the total number of balls in the urn, and a beta prior distribution with parameters (x,y) for the initial proportion of these which are black, this proportion being (for him) considered approximately independent of the total number. Then the process of outcomes of a succession of draws from the urn (with replacement but without the duplication) has approximately the same probability law as does the above P√≥lya scheme in which the actual urn content was not hidden from him. The approximation error here relates to the fact that an urn containing a known finite number m of balls of course cannot have an exactly beta-distributed unknown proportion of black balls, since the domain of possible values for that proportion are confined to being multiples of 1/m, rather than having the full freedom to assume any value in the continuous unit interval, as would an exactly beta distributed proportion. This slightly informal account is provided for reason of motivation, and can be made more mathematically precise. This basic P√≥lya urn model has been enriched and generalized in many ways. Distributions related to the P√≥lya urn * beta- binomial distribution: The distribution of the number of successful draws (trials), e.g. number of extractions of white ball, given n draws from a P√≥lya urn. * Dirichlet-multinomial distribution (also known as the multivariate P√≥lya distribution): The distribution over the number of balls of each color, given n draws from a P√≥lya urn where there are k different colors instead of only two. * martingales, the Beta-binomial distribution and the beta distribution: Let w and b be the number of white and black balls initially in the urn, and w+n_w the number of white balls currently in the urn after n draws. Then the sequence of values \\\\frac{w+n_w}{w+b+n} for n=1,2,3,\\\\dots is a normalized version of the Beta-binomial distribution. It is a martingale and converges to the beta distribution when n ‚Üí ‚àû. * Dirichlet process, Chinese restaurant process, Hoppe urn: Imagine a modified P√≥lya urn scheme as follows. We start with an urn with \\\\alpha black balls. When drawing a ball from the urn, if we draw a black ball, put the ball back along with a new ball of a new non-black color randomly generated from a uniform distribution over an infinite set of available colours, and consider the newly generated color to be the \\"value\\" of the draw. Otherwise, put the ball back along with another ball of the same color, as for the standard P√≥lya urn scheme. The colors of an infinite sequence of draws from this modified P√≥lya urn scheme follow a Chinese restaurant process. If, instead of generating a new color, we draw a random value from a given base distribution and use that value to label the ball, the labels of an infinite sequence of draws follow a Dirichlet process. * Moran model: An urn model used to model genetic drift in theoretical population genetics. This is closely similar to the P√≥lya urn model except that, in addition to adding a new ball of the same color, a randomly drawn ball is removed from the urn. The number of balls in the urn thus remains constant. Continued sampling then leads ultimately to an urn with all balls of one color, the probability of each color being the proportion of that color in the original urn. There are variants of the Moran model that insist that the ball removed from the urn be a different ball from one originally sampled in that step, and variants that do the removal of a ball immediately after the new ball is placed in the urn, so that the new ball is one of the balls available to be removed. This makes a small difference in the time taken to reach the state in which all balls are the same color. The Moran process models genetic drift in a population with overlapping generations.

William Morrison (April 24, 1891 ‚Äì January 1, 1970) was a farmer, church minister, soldier and politician from Alberta, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for a short time in 1935 sitting with the Social Credit caucus in government. Early life William Morrison born on April 24, 1891 in Megantic, Quebec. His family moved west in 1906 and they settled at Okotoks, Alberta. He took his early schooling in Okotoks while helping his father run the farm. Morrison took his post secondary education at Robertson College he graduated in 1925. That year he was also ordained as a United Church Minister. Morrison served several years in the Canadian Armed Forces attaining the rank of Sergeant. He served with the Edmonton Highlanders and the 5th Canadian Railway Troop. Political career Morrison ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Okotoks-High River in the 1935 Alberta general election. He defeated former cabinet minister George Hoadley and two other candidates with a landslide majority to pick up the seat for his party. The first Social Credit caucus meeting saw Morrison sponsor a motion with John Hugill to confirm William Aberhart as party leader and Premier of the province. He also decided to vacate his seat for the new Premier who did not have one. He did so along with Clarence Tade who vacated his seat for Charles Ross the new Minister of Lands and Mines. Aberhart convinced Morrison to resign so that he could take the seat and provide cabinet representation to southern Alberta to quell complaints about the lack of ministers for the region. His resignation occurred before the newly elected Legislative Assembly had its first sitting. After resigning Morrison regretted his decision telling the press that he made his decision with too much haste and he did not have time to think about it. Backlash from Morrison's campaign supporters living in and around his home town in Blackie, Alberta spilled over to the federal election campaign being waged in the Macleod electoral district at the time. His supporters threatened to deliver half the votes that Morrison got in the provincial election away from Social Credit candidate Ernest Hansell to incumbent UFA MP George Coote to ensure his re-election. That support did not quite materialize, however, and Coote was defeated.

She was found guilty of murdering her de facto partner in 1984 and was sentenced to death. Her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and she was released in 1995. Early life Brenda was born Dorothy Brenda White in Victoria in 1951 to Beryl Nanette MacKenzie. Her childhood was unhappy. She was frequently the victim of beatings by her alcoholic mother. Her brother Danny constantly bullied her and she grew up with numerous of her mother's partners. Brenda claimed to have been sexually abused when she was as young as four, by a babysitter who would continue to sexually abuse her for nine more years. As a child she began skipping school. In 1965, her mother left her stepfather and brother, Edd, and took her to live in Carlton. Brenda got a job, but her mother began spending most of the money on alcohol. Brenda took a job working on a farm, where she was happy at first, but left due to a dispute with the owner. One night her mother sent her off with one of her male friends to the pub. After taking her to a park, he raped her, telling her that her mother had allowed him to have sex with her in exchange for alcohol money. After being sent to court, she was charged with being a 'neglected child' and placed into a reformatory in Melbourne. After escaping, she was sent between mental hospitals and reformatories, until her biological father contacted her, inviting her to live with him in Brisbane. She later found out he was an alcoholic too and he pressured her into having sex with him. Soon after she ran away and was put into a mental hospital. She was eventually released into a charity worker's care. She started working in various places throughout Queensland, moving to Darwin and eventually, Western Australia. Brenda married a man named David Hodge in 1972, divorcing in 1977. She became involved with a police officer, Peter Rafferty, while working in Leonora in 1983. Their relationship was unhappy and plagued with several fights, due to his alcoholism and her depression. She decided to leave him.  The murder  On the day of the murder, Brenda was packing her belongings to leave. Peter began taunting her and yelling. She claims in her book, her memory of the incident is blurred. She claims only remembering aiming the gun at him and firing. She claims she does not know what was on her mind or why she did it and that there are moments of blackness in her memory. After being shot, Peter retreated to the shed, where Brenda followed, shooting him twice more, killing him. After the incident, she stopped at a deli and ordered a Coke. She went to a hotel and confessed the murder to a friend, who did not believe her. She later went to a lookout where she considered suicide. She then went to Kalgoorlie police station where she confessed to the crime. Sentencing In August 1984, she was found guilty of wilful murder and was sentenced to death by Justice Pidgeon. On being sentenced to hang she recalls \\"(I felt)... Numb, detached. I felt nothing. I believe I am not the only person to have had that experience. Many people thought Lindy Chamberlain was guilty simply because she 'showed no emotion' at her trial\\". After the state of Western Australia abolished the death penalty Hodge's sentence was commuted to life in prison. She recalls \\"It didn't mean anything to me at the time; I still had this vague idea my life was already over, almost as though I was already dead...\\" She was sent to Bandyup maximum security prison where she remained until 1988, when she was transferred to Greenough Regional Prison. In prison she began to study. She learnt to touch type and enrolled in English and Literature courses as well as a TAFE trade apprenticeship in cooking. Becoming a model prisoner, she became friendly with a parish priest and converted to Roman Catholicism while imprisoned. After numerous appeals, she was paroled on 20 October 1995. She was contacted by her half-sisters in 2003 for the first time ever, not knowing she had any more family. She still keeps in close contact with them to this day. She currently lives in Geraldton, Western Australia. Her autobiography, WALK ON: The remarkable true story of the last person sentenced to death in Australia was published in 2005. She appeared on Enough Rope with Andrew Denton in 2005 talking about her life for the first time in public. Shortly after Hodge's sentence, Western Australia became the last state to remove the death penalty for murder. New South Wales, however, kept it for treason until the following year.

As with other patches in each of the five oceanic gyres, the plastics in it break down to ever smaller particles, and to constituent polymers. As with the other patches, the field constitutes an elevated level of pelagic plastics, chemical sludge, and other debris; primarily particles that are invisible to the naked eye. The concentration of particle debris has been estimated to be approximately 10,000 particles per square kilometer.For a discussion of the current sampling techniques and particle size, see Peter Ryan, Charles Moore et al., Monitoring the abundance of plastic debris in the marine environment. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 27 July 2009 vol. 364 no. 1526 1999‚Äì2012, Transoceanic Trash: International and United States Strategies for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Susan L. Dautel, 3 Golden Gate U. Envtl. L.J. 181 (2009) A similar patch of floating plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean, the Great Pacific garbage patch, was predicted in 1985, and discovered in 1997 by Charles J. Moore as he passed through the North Pacific Gyre on his return from the Transpacific Yacht Race. The North Atlantic garbage patch was discovered in 2010. Discovery The existence of the Great Pacific garbage patch, the first to be discovered, was predicted in a 1988 paper published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States. The prediction was based on results obtained by several Alaska-based researchers between 1985 and 1988 that measured neustonic plastic in the North Pacific Ocean. Research studying trash washed onto beaches in and around the Indian Ocean suggested that there would be plastics found in the water column in the Indian Ocean as well. In 2010, the 5 Gyres Project set off on the first of its planned series of transoceanic voyages to determine whether the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean gyres were affected in the same way as the North Pacific and North Atlantic gyres. On the Indian Ocean leg of their trip, they travelled between Perth, Australia, and Port Louis, Mauritius (east of Madagascar); each of the water samples they collected in the between contained plastic. They found that the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean gyres were affected in the same way as the North Pacific and North Atlantic gyres. Anna Cummins, cofounder of 5 Gyres Institute called the pollution they found \\"a thin plastic soup\\". Sources Of the top 10 ocean plastic polluters (of which China is No.1 worldwide with 30%), the Indian Ocean features five: Indonesia (No. 2); Sri Lanka (No.5); Thailand (No. 6); Malaysia (No. 8), and Bangladesh (No. 10). Ten rivers carry 90% of the total plastic pollution in the oceans. Of these, two are in the Indian Ocean: the Indus (No. 2 worldwide with most plastic) and Ganges (No. 6).  Action for creating awareness  On April 11, 2013, in order to create awareness, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded the garbage patch state at UNESCO ‚Äì Paris, in front of Director General Irina Bokova, the first of a series of events under the patronage of UNESCO and of Italian Ministry of the Environment.

Dictionary of National Biography Life He was fifth son by the second wife of John Spears, foreman of an ironworks, and was born at Lemington, parish of Newburn, Northumberland. His father was a Calvinistic Presbyterian, but the family attended the parish church. Brought up as an engineering smith, his love of reading led him to leave this calling and set up a school in his native village. He joined the New Connexion Methodists; a debate (1845) at Newcastle upon Tyne between Joseph Barker and William Cooke led him to the conviction that doctrine must be expressed in ‚Äòthe language of scripture.‚Äô In 1846 he was master of the New Connexion school at Scotswood-on-Tyne, and was taken on trial as a local preacher. A lecture at Blaydon in 1848 by George Harris (1794‚Äì1859) brought him into relations with Harris, and was followed by an introduction to the unitarian body in 1849. Leaving the Methodists, he became Unitarian minister without salary at Sunderland (1852‚Äì8). There he conducted a very successful school, and originated (1856) a monthly religious magazine, the Christian Freeman'. He removed to a pastorate at Stockton-on-Tees (1858‚Äì61), where he originated (30 December 1859) the Stockton Gazette (later the North-Eastern Gazette). In 1861 Spears attracted the attention of Robert Brook Aspland, was invited to London by Sir James Clarke Lawrence, and became (1862) minister of Stamford Street chapel, Blackfriars. In 1867 he was elected co-secretary of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association with Aspland, on whose death (1869) he became general secretary, reviving it and nearly quadrupling its income. In 1874 he left Stamford Street to take charge of a new congregation at College Chapel, Stepney Green. His theological conservatism was the cause of his resigning in 1876 the denominational secretaryship.R. K. Webb He at once established (20 May 1876) a weekly paper, the Christian Life, as an organ of biblical and missionary unitarianism; in 1889 he bought up the Unitarian Herald, a Manchester organ (which he had been invited to manage at its establishment in 1861), and amalgamated it with his paper. In 1886, aided by Matilda Sharpe, younger daughter of Samuel Sharpe, he established Channing School for Girls, primarily for the daughters of Unitarian ministers. This was at Waterlow Park on Highgate Hill, north London. At this time he left Stepney to found a Unitarian chapel near the school. Among other new causes due directly to his suggestion, and largely to his aid, were those at Clerkenwell, Croydon, Forest Hill, Notting Hill, and Peckham; and outside London his influence was not felt among Unitarians as a stimulus to propagandist work. He was interested in the monotheistic movement of the Brahmo Somaj of India, and was in contact with its leaders from the visit (1870) to Britain of Keshub Chunder Sen, who was his guest. On his initiative was founded (7 June 1881) the Christian Conference, brought together representatives of all denominations, from Cardinal Manning to James Martineau. He had travelled in France, Italy, and America, and kept up a correspondence with liberal thinkers in all parts of the world. He died at his residence, Arundel House, Highgate,where Francis Bacon died in 1626, having caught cold by alighting from his carriage near Highgate to experiment of cancer, on 25 February 1899, and was buried at Nunhead cemetery on 1 March. He married, first (1846), Margaret Kirton (died 1867), by whom he had five children, of whom the youngest daughter survived him; secondly (1869), Emily Glover, who survived him with two sons and four daughters. Views He was one of the last advocates in Unitarianism of the miraculous,Webb but had doubts about the virgin birth.Spears, Robert (1883) The Unitarian handbook of scriptural illustrations & expositions: \\"The prophet uses not the Hebrew word which properly signifies a virgin, but which denotes a girl, a young woman. ... Originally and literally this seems applicable only to the birth of a child, a sign to Ahaz,\\" Works Spears was with Samuel Sharpe one of the last of the Bible-fundamentalist school of Unitarians, harking back to Theophilus Lindsey and earlier. He wrote \\"The following are the leading articles of the religion of Christian Unitarians: They believe ‚Äî Of the Holy Scriptures: \\"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\\" Psalm cxix. 105.Spears, Robert (1883) The Unitarian handbook of scriptural illustrations & expositions He published: *The Unitarian Handbook of scriptural illustrations & expositions, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1859?; 2nd edit. 1862; 1883; the later editions were revised by Russell Lant Carpenter. *Record of Unitarian Worthies [1877]; the prefixed Historical Sketch was reprinted, 1895. He prefaced Thomas Belsham's Memoirs of Lindsey (3rd edit. 1873); compiled from Joseph Priestley's works The Apostolic and Primitive Church ‚Ä¶ Unitarian (1871); and wrote the introduction and appendix to Hugh Hutton Stannus's History of the Origin of the Doctrine of the Trinity (1882). He brought out popular editions of William Ellery Channing's works, 1873, and 1884,. His Scriptural Declaration of Unitarian Principles was a widely circulated Unitarian tract.

Grantray-Lawrence Animation produced the first season, while the second and third seasons were produced by Krantz Animation, Inc. and were crafted by producer Ralph Bakshi in New York City. The show first aired on the ABC television network on September 9, 1967; but went into syndication with the start of the third season. It ran for three seasons and finished on June 14, 1970, with a total of 52 episodes. Many of the 30-minute episodes from season 1 and season 3 were divided into two 15-minute story segments. Series overview Episodes =Season 1 (1967‚Äì68)= The animation for the first season of Spider-Man was produced by Grantray-Lawrence Animation. Ray Patterson was the producer.

The boat has a fully battened mainsail, jib and an asymmetric spinnaker. The name ISO reflects a feature of the design that allows different sized crews to compete on an equal basis. This is achieved by a crew weight equalisation system consisting of removable wings. The wings may not be used if the trapezing crew weighs more than 78kg (to equalise righting moment) and must be used if the combined helm and crew weight is less than 135kg (to equalise weight in the boat). If neither of these mandatory rules apply the crew may choose whether or not to use wings but may not change this decision during a race series. Around 700 boats have been built with sail numbers starting at 501. The ISO is designed to be a relatively easy boat to sail for its performance level. It belongs to the racing skiff category.

His great uncle Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud (1134‚Äì1152) had appointed Shams ad-Din Eldiguz (1135/36‚Äì1175) as atabeg of his nephew Arslan-Shah, the son of his brother Toghrul II, and transferred Arran to his nephew‚Äôs possession as iqta in 1136. Eldiguz eventually married Mu‚Äômina Khatun, the widow of Toghril II, and his sons Nusrat al-Din Muhammad Pahlavan and Qizil Arslan Uthman were thus half-brothers of Arslan Shah, but despite close ties with the Royal Seljuk house, Eldiguz had remain aloof of the royal politics, concentrating on repelling the Georgians and consolidating his power. In 1160, Sultan Suleiman-Shah named Arslan Shah his heir and gave him governorship of Arran and Azerbaijan, fearful of the power of Eldiguz. Status of the Empire in 1160 Breakup of Great Seljuk Empire 1077-1160 The Great Seljuk Empire created by Alp Arslan, which stretched from Anatolia and Syria in the west to the Ghaznavid Empire in the east, from the Black and Caspian Sea and the Syr Darya in the North and Persian Gulf in the South had fragmented when Arslan Shah II assumed the throne in 1161. He nominally reigned over the territories in Azerbaijan, Iraq and western Persia and was dependent on the loyalty of independent Amirs like Eldiguz to enforce his authority. Atabegs like the Eldiguzids (Atabegs of Azerbaijan), Salghurids (Atabegs of Fars), Hazaraspids (Atabegs of Luristan), Atabegs of Yazd, Zengids, (Atabegs of Mosul) and Ahmadilis (Atabegs of Maragha), who were initially tutors of young Seljuk princes in their assigned iqtas, and exercised power on their behalf, ultimately took over control of the iqtas for themselves, ruled their lands independently with nominal allegiance to the Sultan, fought and allied with each other to install and depose Seljuk princes to the throne, and increased their lands at the expense of the imperial domain. Syria was lost to the Zangids, Palestine and much of Lebanon to the Crusaders, other Seljuk families controlled Anatolia, Kerman, the eastern lands were taken over by the Ghurid Empire, the Khwarazmian dynasty and the Qara Khitai after the defeat of Seljuk Sultan Ahmed Sanjar in the Battle of Qatwan in 1141 and the Oghuz rebellion in 1153. Reign of Arslan Shah II After the murder of Sultan Suleiman-Shah in 1161, Eldiguz marched on Hamadan with an army of 20,000 cavalry and installed the 28 year old Arslan Shah II(1161 ‚Äì 1176) as the Seljuk Sultan of Iraq with the support of other Atabegs, and Eldiguzid took the title ‚ÄúAtabeg Al Azam (Supreme Atabeg)‚Äù and supervised the new Sultan, who now married Khatun-i-Kirmani, the widow of Sultan Muhammad II and daughter of Muhammad b. Asrlan Shah I, the Seljuk Sultan of Kerman. The Sultan was a figurehead, Eldiguz commanded the army, controlled the treasury and awarded the iqta‚Äôs as he saw fit along with fighting the Kingdom of Georgia when needed. He also fought other Atabegs between 1161 -1175, and brought Iranian Azerbaijan, Arran, Jibal, Hamadan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan and Rey under his control. His vassals included feudal lords of Shriven, Ahlat, and Arzan-ar-Rum Arslan Shah lived in Hamadan, he was looked after by his younger half-brothers, and fathered Toghril,in 1168. Arslan Shah II did send aid to Seljuk Prince Arslan Shah b. Toghrul of Kirman to battle his brother Bahram Shah in 1174, which resulted in the Seljuk Sultanate of Kirman being split in two, with Bahran Shah retaining one-third of the territory, and Arslan Shah b. Toghrul received the remainder. After death of Eldiguz in 1175, his son Nusrat al-Din Muhammad Pahlavan continued the same policy towards his half-brother Sultan Arslan Shah II, and he shifted his capital from Nakhchivan to Hamadan in western IranHoutsma, M. T. E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, BRILL, 1987, , p. 1053. Arslan Shah resented domination of the Eldiguzids, and he raised an army with the help of discounted Amirs and marched towards Azerbaijan to confront his half-brother, but at Zinjan, he died suddenly at the age of 43, maybe a victim of poisoning, and the seven year old Toghrul III was installed as Sultan at Hamadan, Jahan Pahlvan then defeated the attempt of Muhammad, the elder brother of Arslan Shah, to dethrone his nephew. Reign as figurehead Sultan Toghrul III was seven years old when he began his reign, he was well treated by Jahan Pahlvan, who remained the effective ruler of the empire, with his brother Muzzafar Al-Din Qizil Arslan Uthman as his chief subordinate in Tabriz, who was also Atabeg of Abu Baker, one of the sons of Jahan Pahlvan. Jahan Pahlvan managed to stop the invasion of Saladin, who had advanced as far as Lake Van, but turned back when news arrived that Seyfettin Beytem√ºr (1185‚Äì1193), ruler of Akhlat had accepted the suzerainty of Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan. Problems cropped up after Jahan Pahlavan died in 1186, as he had appointed his four sons as governors, Abu Bakr ruled Azerbaijan and Arran, Ozbeg was appointed to rule Hamadan, sons of the daughter of √ènanch Sonqur, Qutlugh Inanch Muhammad and Amir Amiran Umar ruled Rey, Isphahan and parts of Wetern Persia under the supervision of their uncle Qizil Arslan. They had sworn to obey Qizil Arslan and never to rebel against Toghrul III. When Jahan Pahlvan died, Qizil Arslan assumed his position, which was contested by his brother‚Äôs widow, Innach Khatun, who wanted her son Qutlugh Inanch Muhammad to succeed his father, as she was afraid the childless Qizil Arslan would nominate his favorite Abu Bakr as his heir, Toghrul III, who resented the harsh treatment he received from Qizil Arslan, joined the rebels. This conflict possibly prevented Toghrul III and Qizil Arslan from aiding Muhammad b. Bahram Shah, the last Seljuk Sultan of Kirman, who had been driven from Kirman by Oghuz rebels driven out from Khurasan in 1186. Events between 1187 ‚Äì 1190 The rebel army consisted of the forces of the Amirs of Zenjan and Maragha, the retainers of both Kamal Ai-Aba, head of the Mamluks, and of Saif al-Din Rus, husband of Innach Khatun, while Toghrul himself received significant support from Turkmenss, and their combined army forced Qizil Arslan to leave Hamadan after some clashes. Toghrul undertook two diplomatic ventures in 1187, he journeyed to Mazandaran to request aid from Bavandid Husam al-Daula Ardashir, and received troops from him, and Toghrul also sent messages to Caliph Al-Nasir, asking him to restore the palace of the Seljuk Sultan in Baghdad for him, but the Caliph razed the palace and then sent aid to Qizil Arslan, who agreed to become the Caliph‚Äôs vassal. The Caliph sent an army numbering 15,000 under his vizier Jalal al-Din 'Ubaidallah b. Yunus, which attacked Hamadan in 1188 without waiting for Qizil Arslan‚Äôs army to arrive, he was defeated and captured, Toghrul secured victory by charging the enemy center after his right wing was battered, but this was a Pyrrhic victory, as Toghrul‚Äôs army suffered grievous losses in the battle. The Sultan next tried to reform his administration and coordinate strategy with available resources, but his rash behavior regarding a dispute over the command of the army, led to the execution of Kamal Ai-Aba, Saifuddin Rus and several of the Sultan‚Äôs opponents, and the desertion of his allies. Qizil Arslan had declared Sanjar b. Suleiman-Shah as the Seljuk Sultan of Iraq, and reinforced by troops sent by the Caliph now invaded Hamadan, Toghrul, unable to resist the invasion, first retreated to Isphahan, then to Urmia. He was joined by an army led by his brother in law Hasan Kipchiq, and Toghrul also tried to get help from the Ayyubids and the Caliph, even sent his infant son as hostage to Baghdad in a futile gesture. Toghrul invaded Azerbaijan and sacked the towns of Ushnu, Khoy, Urmiya and Salmas. Qizil Arslan reconciled with his nephews and defeated and captured Toghrul when he again invaded Azerbaijan in 1190. Qizli Arslan imprisoned Toghrul and his son Malik Shah in Kuhran fortress near Tabriz. Qizil Arslan, encouraged by the Caliph, soon declared himself Sultan, married Innach Khatun, his brother‚Äôs widow, and was poisoned by her in September, 1191. His nephews began to rule independently, and one of the Mamluks of Jahan Pahalvan, Mahmud Anas Oglu, freed Toghrul III from his prison in May 1192. Events of 1192 - 1194 Toghrul eluded the pursuers sent by Abu Bakr and quickly assembled an army from his supporters and Turkmens, then marched east and defeated the army of Qutlugh Inanch Muhammad and Amir Amiran Umar near Qazvin on June 22, 1192, and won over a large part of the enemy soldiers after his victory. Qutlug-Inach and Amiran Omar then attacked Abu Bakr in Azerbaijan and was beaten, Aimiran Umar sought refuge with his father in law Shirvanshah Akhsitan I (1160-1196), while Qutlug-Inach moved to Rey. Toghrul occupied Hamadan, secured the treasury and came to rule over Isphahan and Jibal, but did not attempt to negotiate an agreement with Abu Bakr, against Qutlug Innach. Qutlugh Innach now appealed to Khwarazmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish for aid, and Tekish invaded and captured Rey in 1192, forcing Qutlug Innach to flee the city. =Truce with Shah Tekish= Sultan Toghrul opened negotiations with Shah Tekish, and eventually agreed to become a vassal of Khwarizm, marriage of his daughter The Shah‚Äôs son Yunus Khan, and in return Shah Tekish kept Rey, garrisoned his newly acquired territory, collected taxes, then installed Tamghach as the governor, and returned home to quell the rebellion of his brother Sultan Shah. Toghrul now had the chance to negotiate with the Atabeg of Yazd, Langar ibn Wardanruz, or the Salghurid ruler of Fars, Degle ibn Zangi, both were nominally loyal to the Seljuks but no initiatives were taken to unite against their common enemy. Breaking the Truce Toghrul felt threatened with the presence of a hostile force in Rey, which was a strategic town commanding communication with Jibal and Azerbaijan was unacceptable to the Sultan. The Sultan marched towards Rey with his available forces in March 1193, defeated and killed Tamghach, captured Rey and drove out the Khrarizmian forces from the provice. Toghrul III next married Innach Khatun, mother of Qutlug Innach and Amirin Umar, as part of the peace agreement on her request, however, she was executed after the discovery of a plot to poison the Sultan. The Sultan returned to Hamadan, Qutlug Innach fled to Zanjan, from where he sent messages to Shah Tekish, and Caliph Al-Nasir also asked the Shah to move against Toghrul. Toghrul again moved east in 1194 and defeated Qutlug Innach in battle despite the presence of 7,000 Khwarazmian troops aiding Qutlug Innach. Qutlug Innach and other survivors moved east and joined up with the main Khwarizmian army led by Shah Tekish at Semnan. Battle of Rey Sultan Toghrul marched towards Rey, and on his way he received a letter from the Senior Hajib to the Khwarizm Shah Tekish, Shihab ad-Din Mas‚Äòud, advising the Sultan to march south to Sawa, return Rey to Khwarizm and allow Rey to be governed by the Shah‚Äôs son, who would be under the suzerainty of Toghrul. The Sultan discussed the proposal with his commanders, who wished to make peace, or at least wait for the reinforcements coming from Zanjan and Isphahan to bolster the army before engaging the enemy. Toghrul may have also received messages from Qutlug hinting that he may defect with his following when Toghrul arrived, which may have influenced the Sultan's decision. The Sultan disregarded his followers‚Äô advice and marched to Rey. When the Khwarazmian army reached Rey on March 19, 1194, the Sultan marched past the city walls and engaged the enemy, and charged the center of the enemy vanguard. Only sixty of his personal guard followed him, the rest of his army stood off as their commanders did not believe they could win and did wish to die for a lost cause. The Sultan was wounded in the eye by an arrow and fell from his horse, Qutlug Innach personally beheaded the 25 year old Sultan despite his please to spare him. Shah Ala ad-Din Tekish sent Toghrul's head to the Caliph Al-Nasir who displayed at the Nubi Gate in front of his palace, while his body was hanged at Rey. The Empire that had been founded by his namesake and ancestor Tughril ended with his death, the titles and domains of Seljuk Sultan of Iraq and Great Seljuk Sultan went extinct, and his domain became part of the Khwarazmian Empire. Assessment Toghrul was seven years old when he came to the throne, and being disgruntled with the harsh treatment of Qizil Arslan, availed the first opportunity at the age of 19 to break the Eldiguzid shackles and become the first Seljuk ruler after Sultan Muhammad II ibn Mahmud who tried to assert direct rule over his domain. His resources were limited to the Amirs who rallied to him, the domain Jibal was comparatively poor, and the Atabegs of Fars and Yazd, nominally loyal to the throne, never came to his aid. The Sultan faced tough odds as he literally was surrounded by enemies and the Atabegs were not willing to support a strong Sultan, having installed and deposed figurehead Sultans at will since the death of Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud. The young Sultan needed exceptional military and diplomatic skills to meet this impossible challenge, but opinion on him is divided. While some hold him as a noble, virtuous warrior, possessing the spirit of his great ancestors, struggling against impossible odds, others had painted him as ‚Äúrash, wilful, proud and bloodthirsty‚Äù. His arbitrary behavior led the desertion of his allies and imprisonment in 1190, and his disregard of subordinate Amir Nur ad-Din Qara and his fellow Amirs, who wanted the Sultan to either make peace or wait for reinforcement, led to his death. Family Toghrul and at least two sons and one daughter. Malik Shah and his brother were taken as hostages to Gurganj, and they were executed on the order of Terken Khatun, mother of Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad II in 1220 to prevent their falling in the hands of the Mongols. The daughter, Malika Khatun, first married Ozbeg, youngest son of Jahan Pahlavan and future Atabeg of Azerbaijan, then left him to marry Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu in 1226, causing Ozbeg to die of grief.

Background and early life Murphy was born in Huntington, Clonegal, County Carlow and was the youngest of the three children (and only son) of John and Julia Murphy. John Murphy (1879‚Äì1961) was farm manager at Huntington Castle, while Julia was a shop assistant in the nearby village of Clonegal. He was educated at the local national school and, later, Carnew Vocational School, before graduating to Warrenstown Agricultural College, County Meath. Throughout his twenties, Murphy helped form his local branch of Macra na Feirme and became secretary of the organisation's regional executive, during which time he won several medals for public speaking and debating. He also involved in sport, and competed at minor, junior and senior level inter-county Gaelic football for his native Carlow. He also played cricket and handball. Career Murphy was appointed National Organiser of Macra na Feirme in 1953, and played a role in the formation of the National Farmers Association in 1955. His work brought him around Ireland and he found himself being introduced as ‚Äúthe man who knew more people in the country than anyone else‚Äù and ‚Äúthe voice of rural Ireland‚Äù. This, together with a distinctive speaking voice, found him in demand as a presenter of Sponsored Radio Programmes, between 1961 and 1979, for a nine different companies including: Whelehans of Finglas, Irish Farmers Journal, ACC, Nitrogen √âireann, Bank of Ireland, Associated Livestock Marts, Farming Independent, Hygeia of Galway and Goulding Fertilisers. Throughout the 1960s Murphy began to develop a radio and television career with RT√â that would last into the 1980s. Works on radio included Country Call, Meet The People and Around The Country. However, it was through television that Murphy was to become most widely recognised. His break came on the 1960s agricultural series Land Mark. This led to the roles of question-master and question-setter (and later on as adjudicator) on the joint RT√â/BBC production of Cross Country Quiz. Between 1973 and 1988 Murphy compiled a total of 14 quiz books based on the programme - all of them best sellers in the year of their publication. Murphy formally retired in 1992, but continued to accept invites as a quizmaster all over the country for many years after and continued to compile crosswords for several newspapers, including the Sunday Independent. Personal life Murphy married Bridie McEvoy in 1967. They had four children and two grandchildren.

During the velvet season, the weather is not as hot as in mid-summer months, but is still quite warm, even at night. In North America, an analogy of \\"velvet season\\" is the Indian summer.  Origins of term  The term appeared in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries in Imperial Russia when it was fashionable to vacation in the Crimea. According to Alexander Levintov, at the beginning of the twentieth century \\"velvet season\\" referred to several weeks in April and May, when the court and the royal family moved from St. Petersburg to the Crimea. Fur clothes were replaced with velvet, as the Crimea at this time was still cool. The summer in the Crimea was called calico season and September called plys season. Although its origins relate to the nobility, the velvet season came to have a more general meaning. It is better defined by the general public‚Äòs tastes, behaviors, and morals than by those of the nobility. By the 1900s, people traveled for the velvet season because it was fashionable and they were hoping to meet people, rather than because the court was traveling. Although it has proven impossible to determine the exact point in time, at some point, the velvet season switched from referring to the spring to the fall, overlapping with the wool/silk seasons in August and September.  Literary References  Well-known Russian author Alexander Kuprin, described Velvet season in his 1914 short story \\"The Wine Barrel\\" (–í–∏–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ë–æ—á–∫–∞): > This is the golden days for Yalta, and, perhaps, for all of the Crimean > coast.

In the bitterly contested campaign of 1860, Charles W. Piercy was nominated for member of the 1st District of the California General Assembly by one party, and W. A. Conn the incumbent, by the other. Piercy was elected, but there was a claim of fraud. The accusation was that polls at Temescal, maintained by a resident named James Greenwade, kept open shop for three weeks and that whenever candidate Piercy was in need of more votes, they were furnished from this precinct. The case was taken to court, where the two opposing lawyers, H. M. Willis and Bethel Coopwood, had a fight in court wherein Coopwood sustained a slight wound, but won the case.John Brown, James Boyd, History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, p. 148-149 Later in 1861 Piercy was killed in a duel with another assemblyman, Daniel Showalter. Coopwood remained in San Bernardino until 1861, as realtor and a lawyer and with an excellent knowledge of Spanish and a number of Californio clients, most of whom were very well off.John Brown, James Boyd, History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, p. 122  Civil War  In 1861, Coopwood disposed of his interests in California and returned to Texas with his brothers Benjamin and David. He entered the Confederate Army as a captain in the cavalry and served until 1863. In 1861, he formed the San Elizario Spy Company or Coopwood Spy Company, an Independent Volunteer Company of cavalry with men that came with him from California. He commanded the Confederate forces in the Battle of Canada Alamosa, and Skirmish near Fort Thorn the largest of several small battles that occurred in Confederate Arizona along the front with Union held New Mexico Territory. He and his company served in Sibley's New Mexico Campaign. He was ill with smallpox during the Battle of Valverde but recovered in time to join the army at the Battle of Albuquerque and the Battle of Peralta. After the Battle of Peralta he and his Spy Company were responsible for saving the remnants of Sibley's army, 1800 men, from Union pursuit by finding water and a path for them through the rugged mountains west of the Rio Grande to the Mesilla Valley. He was later promoted to Major and then Lt. Colonel before ending his service in the Confederate Army in 1863.Jerry D.

Very little is known about his life and work. He was born in Paris and came from a family of organists; apparently he lived and worked in Paris all his life. From 1645 he and his brother Charles were organists to Chancellor S√©guier. In 1651 he succeeded his father as organist of the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs in Paris, working together with Nicolas Gigault. In 1652 Etienne lost both his brother and his father. The same year he succeeded the former as organist of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, and three years later, in 1655, he took his father's position at St Martin-des-Champs. His career soared by the end of the 1650s, and in 1657 he was employed as harpsichordist and teacher to the King. He also played viola and served as violist to the King's brother. Richard died in Paris in 1669, possibly in May.Higginbottom, Grove. Although he was exceptionally well regarded at the court, only a few works by Richard survive (and some could be attributed to Charles, Pierre, or another member of either of the two Richard families of musicians that were active in Paris at the time): two organ preludes, four allemandes, 3 courantes, two sarabandes and two gigues, which came to us through the Bauyn manuscript. These pieces all show Richard as an excellent composer who had thoroughly mastered counterpoint and harmony.Apel 1972, 504. The organ preludes successfully combine the older, contrapuntal style of Jean Titelouze with the special attention given to the melody‚Äîa progressive trait, since French organ music was later dominated by a melody-based approach. One of the preludes contains several sections, while the other does not. Of the dance movements, the allemandes are historically important for showing the beginnings of the ornamented style that later French composers used extensively. The gigues exhibit unusual characteristics: one is written in the typical triple metre, but closes with a refrain in 2/2 time. The other gigue is in 2/2 time throughout and is virtually indistinguishable from an allemande.Apel 1972, 508. Notes References * Apel, Willi. 1972. The History of Keyboard Music to 1700.

The church was demolished in 1928. It was the first Congregational church in Brisbane. Early Congregationalism in Brisbane It is believed that the first Congregationalists arrived on the Fortitude on 21 January 1849, being the first of three ships of free immigrants sent to this district by the Rev. Dr. John Dunmore Lang, whose advice to the immigrants was to combine for Christian fellowship and worship rather than establish separate denominations. In March 1850, the United Evangelical Church was created, combining those of Presbyterian, Baptist, and Congregational beliefs, under the ministry of the Rev. Charles Stewart (chaplain of the Fortitude). Dr Lang's United Church, William Street At first the congregation worshipped in the courthouse, but later purchased land fronting William and George Streets (in 2010 the Lands Office building occupies the site) and erected a brick church. However, while a united church served their early needs, the Baptists desired to have their own church and the united church was sold for ¬£1500 and the proceeds divided between the three denominations, providing the basis for establishing three separate churches: Wharf Street Congregational, Wharf Street Baptist and Creek Street Presbyterian.  Rev. George Wight  In 1858 the Rev. George Wight arrived at Brisbane from Edinburgh. He had been sent by the London Colonial Missionary Society to establish a Congregational Church in Brisbane. However, his immediate challenge was to find a venue for the congregation to meet for worship. He wrote of this period: \\"One of the difficulties that met us at the threshold was the impossibility of procuring, on any terms whatever, a proper place for holding meetings. There was only one place in the town (the hall of the School of Arts) where a hundred people could be comfortably accommodated and that was occupied by the Presbyterian congregation under the charge of the Rev.C. Ogg. We were therefore, fain to occupy a rickety loft‚ÄîMr. Binney called it facetiously an 'upper room' ‚Äîreached by a rickety trap ladder, and used on week days as a schoolroom. The dilapidated wood building overhung a dark, sluggish creek, which meandered through the centre of the town, and after tropical showers the approach to it was almost impassable.\\" In 1859 the Rev. T. Bell, pastor of the United Presbyterian Church, died, and the building he had occupied was rented for a time for use for Congregational meetings. Meanwhile, funds were being raised to add to the ¬£500 received from the sale of the united church property.  The church building  In May 1859 the congregation was ready to establish their own church building and proceeded to buy land on the corner of Wharf and Adelaide streets for ¬£260. Charles Tiffin, the architect, designed a brick church which was built by Joshua Jeays. The total cost (including the land) was ¬£1498 3s 7d, which was not greatly more than the funds of ¬£1429 12s 2d which had been raised or promised. Charles Tiffin was the Colonial Architect and designed many of Brisbane's important buildings, many of which were also built by Joshua Jeays, e.g. Old Government House. So, although the first church was not very large, it was considered to have an imposing structure, based on simple early English lines. The church was opened on 10 June 1860 and the first morning service in the new church was conducted by Rev. Wight.  Rev. Edward Griffith  Family reasons forced Rev. Wight's return to Scotland and in September 1860, Rev. Edward Griffith became the pastor of the church. During his 30 years ministry, the congregation grew from 48 to over 700 people. He oversaw the establishment of a number of branch churches in the suburbs. In 1872, the church building had become too small for the congregation and it was enlarged to a seating capacity of 400 people, about double its original capacity. John Petrie was architect and builder of the additions. In 1883 there were further additions: a new schoolroom, better seating accommodation, choir railings, and the replacement of the wooden floor with an asphalt floor (which defeated the white ants and kept the church much cooler in summer). Rev. Griffith resigned as pastor in February 1889 due to his failing health. Rev. William Scott briefly took up the ministry but then moved to Sydney, forcing Rev. Griffith to return to the ministry. In 1890 a new large pipe organ was installed. Rev. Griffith died in 1891 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.  Later years  The church was without a minister until 19 March 1893, when the Rev. John Routledge Wolstenholme commenced. However, he died soon after on 25 May, and was buried at Toowong Cemetery, beside the grave of the Rev. Griffith. Forty years later in September 1943, the ashes of his wife Mrs Wolstenholme were sent from England (where she had lived as a widow) to be buried with her husband in Toowong Cemetery. Subsequent ministers were: * Rev. Hugh Jones (May 1895 - April 1903) * Rev. Loyal Lincoln Wirt (May 1904Wharf-Street Congregational Church: Welcome to Rev. L.L.

In December 1924, it was agreed to sell the church property to the neighbouring St John's Cathedral to facilitate the expansion of the cathedral precinct with the condition that the Congregationalists had two years to establish a new church.Wharf Street Church Property, Brisbane Courier, Wednesday 3 December 1924, page 6 In January 1925, they purchased the property Inchcolm in Wickham Terrace with a view to demolishing it to make way for a new church building. However the Rev. Percival Watson persuaded the congregation to seek a more central site and land between Queen and Adelaide Streets (address 409 Adelaide Street) was purchased and Inchcolm was sold (and later heritage-listed). The final services in the Wharf Street Congregational Church were held on Sunday 25 September 1927 by Rev. Percival Watson. Given the new street address, it was decided in October 1927 to name the new church City Congregational Church.City Congregational Church, Brisbane Courier, Saturday 8 October 1927, page 10 In 1927, the pipe organ was sold to the Cracknell Road Congregational Church.

She married Rowley Atterbury in 1943, and had one child, Paul Atterbury, who went on to become an antiques expert and a regular on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. In about 1949 Rowley Atterbury founded the Westerham Press, and Audrey Atterbury worked with her husband in the printing business. However, during a train journey in 1950 Audrey met Freda Lingstrom, the newly appointed head of BBC Children‚Äôs Television. After striking up a conversation and establishing common interests, Lingstrom persuaded Atterbury to become a puppeteer on a new television series, to be called Andy Pandy (1950‚Äì52). It is claimed that Lingstrom based the appearance of Andy Pandy on the young Paul Atterbury. Audrey Atterbury trained under John Wright, later the founder of the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, north London.Atterbury's biography on the Telegoons website During the 1950s Atterbury continued to work as a puppeteer in such series as Flower Pot Men (1952‚Äì54),Flower Pot Men on the British Film Institute website and The Woodentops (1955‚Äì58).The Woodentops on the British Film Institute website In around 1956, after separating from her husband, Audrey Atterbury went to live in Highgate in London, near to her fellow BBC puppeteer, Molly Gibson, who was a close friend. The two worked together on Rubovian Legends and other Gordon Murray puppet plays. Atterbury also worked for the Little Angel Theatre, by then one of Britain‚Äôs leading puppet theatres. Atterbury worked on the puppet series The Telegoons (1963-4), which was based on Spike Milligan's radio show The Goon Show. During the 1960s television puppets started to be replaced by animation, which led Atterbury to leave the BBC take up a career in antiques, specialising in pottery and porcelain. She became a part-time antiques dealer, at the same time building up a large personal collection of ceramics. Later, Atterbury worked for a number of antique dealers and in 1987 she joined Christie's, becoming the longest serving and most respected member of the team of lady saleroom assistants. She was Secretary of the Morley College Ceramic Circle for about 18 years. =Death = After her divorce, Atterbury never remarried and lived in south London from about 1962 until she died in 1997 aged 75. On her death her collection of ceramics, including rare examples by Royal Doulton and Moorcroft, was sold at auction by renowned auction house Christie's.

Early life and family Lionel George Logue was born in College Town, Adelaide, South Australia, the oldest of four children. His grandfather Edward Logue, originally from Dublin, in 1856 founded Logue's Brewery, a predecessor of the South Australian Brewing Company. His parents were George Edward Logue, an accountant at his grandfather's brewery who later managed the Burnside Hotel as well as Elephant and Castle Hotel, and Lavinia Rankin.Logue and Conradi, p. 16. Although not a Catholic himself, he was reportedly related to Michael Logue, who was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Taoiseach Enda Kenny on The Late Late Show, Friday, 27 May 2011 He attended Prince Alfred College between 1889 and 1896. Unable to decide what to study, Logue came across Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha: Adelaide, 1896 The poem's rhythm inspired Logue to put his interest in voices to good use. After leaving school at sixteen, he received elocution training from Edward Reeves. Reeves had moved to Adelaide in 1878 and taught elocution to his pupils by day and gave popular recitals to audiences in Victoria Hall by night. Logue worked for Reeves as a secretary and assistant teacher from 1902, while studying music at the University of Adelaide's Elder Conservatorium. While working for Reeves, Logue began to give recitals of his own for which he was praised for his \\"clear, powerful voice.\\"Logue and Conradi, p. 18. After his father died on 17 November 1902, Logue set up his own practice as a teacher of elocution. By 1904, he had gained a good reputation and was receiving praise from the local newspapers.Logue and Conradi, p. 19. However, he decided to take a contract with an engineering firm some westward in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, installing an electricity supply at a gold mine. Professional career His professional career began in Perth, where, in addition to teaching elocution, acting, and public speaking, he put on plays and recitations, and also founded a club for public speakers. He was also involved with YMCA Perth and schools such as Methodist Ladies' College, Loreto Convent, Scotch College, Perth Technical School, and Claremont Teachers College. In 1911, Logue and his wife set out on a tour of the world to study methods of public speaking. Later he developed treatments for Australian First World War war veterans who had shell shockinduced impaired speech. In addition to physical exercises, which helped with patients' breathing, Logue's distinctive therapy emphasised humour, patience, and \\"superhuman sympathy\\". In 1924, Logue took his wife and three sons to England, ostensibly for a holiday. Once there, he took jobs teaching elocution at schools around London, and in 1926 he opened a speech-defect practice at 146 Harley Street. Logue used fees paid by wealthy clients to subsidise patients unable to pay. It was here that the Duke of Yorkthe future King George VIsought Logue's help.Logue and Conradi, p. 39. Logue became a founding fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in 1944. =Treatment of George VI= As a speech therapist, Logue was self- taught and was initially dismissed by the medical establishment as a quack, but he worked with the Duke from the late 1920s into the mid-1940s.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8203371/The-Kings-Speech- how-Lionel-Logue-cured-King-George-VIs-stammer.html, The King's Speech: how Lionel Logue cured King George VI's stammer Before ascending the throne as George VI, the Duke of York dreaded public speaking because of a severe stammer; his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925 proved an ordeal for speaker and listeners alike. The Duke resolved to find some way to manage his stammer, and engaged Logue in 1926 after being introduced to him by Lord Stamfordham.BBC, Note reveals story behind King's speech film, 1 March 2011. Diagnosing poor co-ordination between the Duke's larynx and thoracic diaphragm, Logue prescribed a daily hour of vocal exercises. Logue's treatment gave the Duke the confidence to relax and avoid tension-induced muscle spasms. As a result, he only occasionally stammered. By 1927, he was speaking confidently and managed his address at the opening of the Old Parliament House in Canberra without stammering. Logue was often called over the years when the king was expected to make a speech, and was regularly invited to the Royal Family's Christmas dinner party in order to assist with the Christmas message. Their relationship was featured in a film, a play and a book. Honours In 1944, King George VI appointed Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO), elevating him from Member of the Order (MVO), which was conferred upon Logue at the time of George VI's Coronation. King George VI died on 6 February 1952. On 26 February 1952, Logue wrote to the late king's wife, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother: The Queen Mother replied: \\"I think that I know perhaps better than anyone just how much you helped the King, not only with his speech, but through that his whole life and outlook on life. I shall always be deeply grateful to you for all you did for him.\\"The Queen Mother to Lionel Logue, 28 February 1952, The National Archives (U.K.) Personal life Logue with Myrtle Gruenert at the time of their engagement in Perth in 1906 Logue married Myrtle Gruenert, a 21-year-old clerk, at St George's Anglican Cathedral, Perth, on 20 March 1907.Logue and Conradi, p. 20.

She was the first ship of the class, but there was a gap of 5 years between her launch and the ordering of the next batch in October 1803; by 1815 a total of 105 other vessels had been ordered to her design. She had an eventful wartime career, mostly in the North Sea, English Channel and the Baltic, and captured some 15 privateers and warships, and many merchant vessels. She also participated in several actions. She was laid up in 1813 and the Commissioners of the Navy sold her for breaking in 1819. Design Cruizer was a prototype brig-rigged sloop-of-war designed in 1796 by Sir William Rule, the Surveyor of the Navy. Her hull was identical to the Snake-class ship-sloop, but she carried a pair of square-rigged masts instead of the three masts fitted in the Snake class. The original design had an armament of eighteen 6-pounder long guns but it was soon decided to replace the broadside weapons with sixteen 32-pounder carronades, leaving two 6-pounders as chase guns. The net effect was to increase the broadside weight of shot massively, at the cost of reducing her broadside's effective range.This was an innovation that the Royal Navy favoured at the turn of the 19th century for many small vessels. This mix became the pattern for all the other, later members of her class. Construction Cruizer was ordered by the Admiralty on 19 December 1796 to be built in the commercial yard of Stephen Teague at Ipswich.The use of commercial ship yards for building the smaller vessels of the Royal Navy was normal practice of the time. She was laid down in February 1797 and launched on 20 December the same year. Service history Commander Charles Wollaston commissioned her in February 1798 for the North Sea. =North Sea (1798 - 1800)= On 27 March 1798 Cruizer captured the French privateer lugger Jupiter after a three-hour chase. Jupiter had eight guns and a crew of 36 men. She was 14 days into her cruise from Boulogne. On 4 and 5 May Cruizer was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutters Fox, and Marshall Cobourg, and Jalouse, though most were much larger and included , , , , , among others. Cruizer shared with , , and the hired armed cutter Rose in the proceeds from the capture on 13 May of the Houismon, Welfart, and Ouldst Kendt. Then on 19 May, Cruizer was six or seven leagues SE by S off Lowestoff when she encountered two French privateer luggers. During the chase one lost her main and foremast and struck. Cruizer continued in chase of the other until 5pm when it became clear that the quarry was gaining, and Wollaston was losing sight of the lugger that had struck. He therefore gave up the chase and returned to the first lugger. She was Chasseur, from Honfleur, and had been out eight days without taking anything. She was armed with four 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 48 men. The lugger that escaped was Dragon, of four 6-pounder guns. The two luggers had left Honfleur together and were going to cruise the Dogger Bank. In August Cruizer captured the Dutch Greenlandsmen Fortuna, Jacob Sroertjes, master, and Endraght, Claas Boertjes, master. Cruizer shared with , , and the hired armed cutter Courier in the proceeds from the capture on 16 April 1799 of the Prussian hoy Dolphin. That same day Cruizer captured Commerce, Christiansen, master. Cruizer was a part of Admiral Lord Duncan's fleet on 21 April and shared in the proceeds of the capture of Harmonie. Cruizer shared with , and the hired armed cutters Fox and Hazard in the proceeds of the capture on 24 April 1799 of the Swedish brig Neptunus. Two days later, Scorpion and Cruizer captured Adelaide, Bose, late master. On 12 May Cruizer captured Vrow Etje, Meertens, master. Cruizer shared the proceeds with and . Four days later Cruizer captured Reformator, Scheepens, master. Also between 8 March and 12 May, Cruizer captured several other small Dutch vessels. On 21 May Cruiser was south of St Abb's Head when at 11a.m. she sighted two luggers further south. Wollaston set off after them, but the weather was too unsettled for him to keep them continually in sight. Still, by correctly estimating where they were headed he was able to catch up by 4:30, only to have a sudden gust of wind take away Cruizers main-top-gallant-mast. Cruizer was not able to catch up with them again until 9p.m. Wollaston was not able to close and lost sight of them again. However, at daylight, as Cruizer was about two or three leagues off Scarborough Castle, Wollaston again sighted one of the luggers about eight miles away. After a six-hour chase, Cruizer captured the privateer, which turned out to be Deux Freres, Captain Jacques Bellet, 14 guns (12 of which she had thrown overboard during the chase), and 50 men. She was from Calais and had been cruising since 16 April. Captain Bellet informed Wollaston that the second lugger was Tipoo Sahib, of 12 guns. Tipoo Sahib had thrown all her guns and her boat overboard during the chase and had gone either to France or Norway.Tipoo Sahib was named for Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, who was an ally of Frances and an enemy of the British. In fact, Tipu Sultan had died on 4 May, defending his fort at Srirangapatna.Wollaston decided that as 26 of his crew were away in prizes, and he had 50 prisoners on board, that he would come into Yarmouth to land the prisoners before returning to his station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.244. Cruizer continued operating in the North Sea, capturing the privateer Courageux on 13 July after a chase of three hours. Courageaux carried 14 guns and a crew of 47 men. She was six weeks out of Dunkirk. During her cruise she had captured four vessels, one of which Cruizer had recaptured the evening before.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.343. On 25 August Cruizer captured Catharina Magdalena, Ahrens, master. Cruizer captured the 14-gun French privateer Perseverant on 23 March 1800. Cruizer had been boarding two brigs when she sighted a suspicious sail to the east. Cruizer gave chase and after five hours succeeded in capturing the French privateer cutter Perseverant. Perseverant was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 47 men under the command of Captain Delattre. Wollaston described her as \\"a remarkably fine Vessel, copper-bottomed, and has captured an amazing Number of Vessels in the North Sea.\\" On this cruise, Perseverant was 20 days out of Dunkirk, having stopped at the Texel for two days, but had not captured anything. Two days later Cruizer captured the 14-gun Filibustier. Cruizer had been boarding a brig from Bremen, whose master reported that three hours earlier a French privateer steering to the NE had hailed him. Cruizer immediately set of in chase and by eight-thirty had caught up with and captured the privateer. Flibustier had a crew of 54 men under the command of Captain Cany. She was only one day out of Dunkirk and had captured nothing. Wollaston sent both Perseverant and Flibustier into Yarmouth. On 22 May Cruizer and captured Maria Charlotta, Backendorff, master. In August, Cruizer detained Elizabeth, J. M. Farrer, master. Elizabeth was bound for Amsterdam and carried 25 hogsheads of sugar. Then on 18 September Cruizer captured Vertrouwen, Simons, master. =Copenhagen (1801)= Plan of the battle of Copenhagen, showing the inner channel between Middelgrund. Cruizer (here labelled Cruiser) is shown to the south of Middelgrund In January 1801 Commander James Brisbane recommissioned Cruizer. On 23 February she recaptured Aberdeen Packet, of Aberdeen, and Harriot, of Sunderland. Cruizer was then assigned to Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's expedition to the Baltic, which had as its objective to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality. In March Cruizer sailed with Parker's fleet from Yarmouth roads for Copenhagen. On 30 March, prior to the battle, the boats and masters of and Cruizer placed buoys to mark the narrow channel between Saltholm and Middelgrund (\\"the Middle Ground\\" shoal), part of the waterway of √òresund between Copenhagen and Malm√∂. Brisbane impressed his immediate superior, Vice Admiral Nelson, with this work, and was promoted to post captain after the subsequent battle of Copenhagen.Brisbane, Sir James, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 13 July 2008 In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Copenhagen\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. In April, Commander John Hancock took command of Cruizer for the North Sea station. Cruizer, , and shared in the proceeds of the capture on 1 October of Antonius, and the capture the next day of Jonge Jacob. =Blockade of the Netherlands (1803 - 1806)= Together with Jalouse and Immortalit√©, Cruizer captured two French armed vessels, the schooner Inabordable and the brig Commode on 14 June 1803 after they had run aground under the guns of a shore battery for protection. After about an hour's firing by the batteries, the British sloops, and the French gun- vessels, the boats were able to take possession and refloat the two gun- vessels. Each of the French gun-vessels was armed with three 24-pounder guns and one 8-pounder gun. Later reports described the two French vessels as gun- brigs, and gave their names as Inabordable, and Mechant√©. The Royal Navy did not take either into service. Chiffone, , and Cruizer shared in the capture of Flore on 5 August 1803. The same three vessels shared the salvage money arising from the recapture on the same day of Margaret, Robert Lacs, master. Boats from Cruizer and Rattler cut out the 4-gun cutter Colombe from Sluis on the night of 8 March 1804. Unfortunately Colombe grounded and when the cutting-out party was unable to free her, they set her on fire to prevent her recapture.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p.345. Later that month Cruizer and Rattler were anchored off Blankenberge; 13 armed vessels carried troops from the shore with the intention of boarding, but they were beaten back until the shallow water and the guns of the Ostend batteries prevented further chase.Marshall (1827), supplement, Part 1, pp.4-31. Later in 1804 Cruizer was used as the inshore vessel in the blockade of Flushing, and as part of her duties she was required to report the movements of vessels in and around the harbour to the officer in command of the operation, Captain Sir Sidney Smith of Antelope. On 15 May 1804 Cruizer reported 22 vessels sailing from Ostend. By morning it was apparent that a flotilla of 59 vessels, comprising prams, schooners, and schuyts, had sailed from Flushing and was making its way along the shallow coastal waters to Ostend. Cruizer and Rattler attacked that afternoon, just as the wind changed and forced the Dutch vessels to turn back for Flushing. The frigates Penelope and Antelope attacked the leading vessels, and Aimable was sent to assist Cruizer and Rattler in dealing with the rearmost vessels. The British were surrounded by a host of small vessels, and operating in shallow water. The engagement lasted six hours, and Cruizer lost one man killed and three wounded. Much damage was done to the Flushing flotilla, although more sailors were killed in trying to destroy the grounded vessels over the next few days than were lost in the engagement.Age of Nelson Antelope, Rattler, and Cruizer shared in the proceeds of the capture on 16 May of Dutch schuyt No. 98. Cruizer captured the French privateer Contre Amiral Magon on 16 October 1804 after a chase of 100 miles. The gun-brig , the hired armed brig Ann, and cutter Florence were also in company but fell behind in the chase. The French brig, under the command of Captain Blauckman, surrendered without a fight after Cruizer sent three warning shots from her 32-pounder carronades. She was quite new and on her first cruise. She was pierced for 18 guns but mounted 17: fourteen 6-pounder guns, two 18-pounder carronades, and one 9-pounder gun. Her crew of 84 men consisted of Frenchmen, Danes, Swedes, and Americans. Of the 67 men aboard, 19 being away in prizes, seven of the Americans promptly joined the crew of Cruizer. Contre-Amiral Magnon had been out from Dunkirk 18 days and had captured the ship Belisarius, of Newcastle, the brig Scipio, and Content's Increase. The last two had cargoes of coal and the privateer had sent them straight into Dunkirk. A British naval brig had recaptured Belisarius within two hours of her capture. The masters of all three British vessels, together with their crews, some 20 men in all, were on Contre Amiral Magon at the time of her capture and Cruizer took them on board. Cruizer sent Contre-Amiral Magon into Yarmouth where soon afterwards she was wrecked by being driven on shore. Her crew were sent to prison, but Captain Blauckman remained aboard . He managed to escape and shortly thereafter returned to Dunkirk.United service magazine, July 1845, pp.404-8. On 23 October 1804 Cruizer and her accompanying gun-brigs were in again action off Ostend with two small praams and eighteen schuyts. Shallow water allowed the French to retreat as the tide fell and the gun-brig grounded due to the fault of her pilot. Her crew abandoned her but later returned together with men from Cruizer, the hired armed cutters Admiral Mitchell, and Griffin, and some of the other ships in the squadron to try to recapture or destroy her. The cutting-out expedition was unsuccessful, with Cruizer suffering four officers and men wounded, Conflict losing one man killed and five wounded, and Griffin having two men wounded in the attempt. The next year continued to be a busy time on blockade for Cruizer as she was in action 104 times with various enemy ships, coastal batteries and privateers. On 11 February 1805 Cruizer and Ann captured Hoop, Mailer, master. On 8 March Cruizer captured the galiot Triton and recaptured Vriendschap. Cruizer shared with Minx and Bold in the proceeds of the capture seven days later of Industria, Labea, master. Cruizers crew did a little better from the capture on 20 June of Johanna Tbolen. Earlier, on 5 June, Cruizer was in company with the hired brig Ann, , and when they captured Dogter Catherina. Cruizer was again in company with Ann on 2 August 1805 when they captured Frederick. Then on 22 August they captured Susannah Margaretha. Cruizer, , Mariner, and Minx shared in the proceeds of the detention on 5 September of Sophia Amelia. Cruizer, Minx, and Mariner were in company and shared with and in the proceeds of the recapture on 29 September of Rover, of Newcastle, Hillary, master. On 13 November Cruizer intercepted two French pirate luggers attempting to take a brig. Hancock chased them and after two hours captured Vengeur after his bow guns brought down the lugger's main topsail and main-lug sail. Vengeur was under the command of Jean Augustin Hirrel, carried a crew of 56 men, and was armed with 14 guns. She was two days out of Boulogne and had that day taken two Swedish brigs, one laden with salt, from Liverpool, the other from Boston, in Lincolnshire, in ballast. On 27-8 January 1806 captured \\"sundry Smuggling Vessels\\". Hancock decoyed a number of smugglers off shore by disguising his ship as an American. He captured one cutter, which he used as a tender. He then sailed Cruizer and the cutter in the direction he thought most of the smugglers had sailed. Next morning he found four luggers and a cutter within easy reach and proceeded to capture them too. The tender captured two luggers, each with 1000 tubs of geneva, rum, and the like. In all, the haul included 26,000 gallons of spirits and a large quantity of tobacco, plus other contraband. The proceeds amounted to ¬£2236 19s 7d, which the officers and crew shared. Despite this singular success against the smugglers, when Cruiser returned to port Hancock had to turn over command of Cruiser to Commander Pringle Stoddart. Unfortunately for Hancock, the battle of Trafalgar had taken place a few months earlier. The battle had resulted on 21 January in a great many promotions in Admiral Lord Nelson's fleet, with a number of the beneficiaries displacing Hancock in the list of candidates for promotion. =Baltic (1807-1810)= At 8a.m. on 6 January, Cruizer was eight leagues south of the Galloper when she sighted a suspicious lugger heading for the coast of Flanders. Cruiser gave chase and after four hours caught up with and captured the French privateer Iƒóna. I√©na was armed with sixteen 3 and 4-pounder guns, two of which she had thrown overboard during the chase. She was a new vessel, only 14 days out of the stocks, and was under the command of M. Morel. She had captured three English vessels on 1 and 2 January some seven leagues from Flamborough Head. A gale had separated Felicity of Yarmouth, Neptune of Sunderland, and Bee of Kikaldy from the Baltic convoy they had been part of, resulting in their vulnerability. The masters and crew of all three were aboard Iena; Stoddard thought that there was a good chance the Royal Navy would recapture the three as they and the privateer had tried to enter port at Gor√©e, only to be chased away by a frigate and a cutter. The Royal Navy took Iƒóna into service as . On her way from Walcheren towards the Galloper Shoal in the North Sea, on 26 January 1807, Cruizer spotted the 16-gun privateer lugger Braave (or Brave) and, after a long chase, drove her onto the beach three miles west of Blankenberge. The captain and much of the crew then fled ashore. Cruizers boats captured the privateer under musket fire and brought her off. Cruizer freed the masters and crew of the Tyne collier brig Leander, and of an English galiot carrying government rum, who were prisoners aboard Brave. Cruizer recaptured Leander the same afternoon, as well as Guardian, of Bridlington. Guardian was one of five vessels, including four from the Baltic, that the French privateer Revanche had captured off Flamborough Head. Around this time Cruizer captured two fishing vessels, St. Would Beloop and Fortuyn. On 2 March, Cruizer recaptured the Danish ship Familien. From August 1807 Cruizer formed part of Admiral Gambier's inshore squadron for the second battle of Copenhagen. On 23 August, Cruizer was part of the advance squadron, which took up position near the entrance to the harbour. An engagement of four hours ensued between the squadron and the Danes, who marshaled the Crown Battery, floating batteries, three praams of 20 guns each, some 30 gunboats, and block ships. The shallowness of the water prevent the Royal Navy from bringing in any large ships to support the advance squadron of brigs, sloops, and ketches. Eventually the British withdrew. Lieutenant Woodford of Cruizer was among the dead, and the only casualty from Cruizer. Commander George M'Kenzie took command later in 1807. , , and Cruizer shared the proceeds of the detention during August of the Danish merchant vessels Anne and Catherine, Anne and Margaret, and Three Brothers. , , hired armed cutter Joseph, and shared with Cruizer in the proceeds of Twee Gebruders. Cruizer and Kite shared in the capture on 20 August of the William August, Thuren, master. That same day Cruizer and Kite captured Patriot, Thomson, master. Eleven days later, Cruizer captured Mary. Two days later Cruizer captured Emanuel. Cruizer shared with and in the capture on 16 April 1808, of a Danish mail boat. The mail boat was carrying, inter alia, foreign gold, silver, copper coins, Holstein and Sleswick paper notes, and ¬£2000. Cruizer was in company with , Captain George Dundas, in the Great Belt when on 11 June they discovered several vessels at anchor close to shore at the entrance to the river Naskon. Dundas anchored at dark and sent a cutting out party in four boats from the two ships to destroy the vessels. The cutting out party burnt two large troop transports and retrieved a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The successful foray took place directly under the guns of a Danish battery of three 18-pounder guns and numerous enemy troops who lined the shore. The enemy lost seven men killed (and possibly a number drowned), and twelve wounded; the British had one man slightly wounded. In 1817 the crews of the British ships received prize money for \\"Danish gun-boat E\\". Cruizer recaptured Mary on 31 August. On 1 November, Cruizer was under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Wells (acting). She was off Gothenburg when 20 gunboats attacked her; she captured a schuyt of ten guns and 32 men, and drove off the others, which took refuge at L√¶s√∏.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.370. On 16 November Wells wrote to his wife Nancy that she should buy a weekly paper to see his letter describing his capture. His feat resulted in Well's promotion to the rank of Commander some weeks later. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Cruizer 1 Novr. 1808\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Wells was still a lieutenant and acting captain when between 1 and 9 November Cruizer captured the Danish vessels Rinaldo, Proben, Trende Brodre, and Kirstina. Cruizer shared with the bomb-vessel in the proceeds of the salvage arising from the recapture on 2 November of the Maria Elizabeth. Cruizer and shared in the proceeds of the capture on 23 November of Fier Broders, J. Eynerson, master. , Cruizer, Alexandrine [sic] (probably ), and Fury shared in the proceeds of the capture, also on 23 November, of the Danish ships Vrow Sophia and Yonge Nessa. On 6 December seven Danish vessels arrived at Yarmouth. They were prizes to Cruizer, Starling, and .Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4308. Two days later, Cruizer captured the Danish vessels Erndre, Prince Charles, Aurora, Lawrence Caroline, and Two Brothers. Apparently that same day Cruizer also captured Jonge Ness, Vrou Sophia, Johannes, and Elbe. Starling, Cruizer, Alexandrine, and Fury shared in the proceeds of the capture, also on 25 November, of the Danish ships Salskabed and St. Jorrison. Other vessels that Cruizer captured between 22 and 25 November were Fier Brodre, Maria Elizabeth, and Speculation. Cruizer shared with Hearty in the proceeds from the capture of Fier Brodre. On 25 November Cruizer also captured the Danish vessels Prince Charles, Aurora, Ernize, Lawrence Caroline, and Two Brothers. On 26 November 1808 Commander Thomas Richard Toker replaced Wells.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.195. In March and April 1809 Cruizer captured five prizes. On 13 March she captured Albion. The next day she captured Printz Frederick and Erstotning. On 21 March it was Unge Marias turn to fall prey. , , , and Cruizer shared in the proceeds of the capture on 8 April of Vergnugen and Gustaff. On 9 April Cruizer captured St. Johannes. Cruizer shared with Tartar, Superb, and Orion in the proceeds of the capture that same day of Caroline. The same four British vessels shared in the capture, two days later, of the Danish sloop Brigetta and the Prussian galiot Erwaftnung. Lastly, on 27 April Cruizer captured Lille Peder. On 7 May Cruizer was off Baltiysk (then called Pillau), with a letter for Louis Drusina (also known as Heinrich Hahn), a secret agent who had previously been British Consul. Cruizer shared with in the proceeds of the salvage of Experiment, Becker, master, on 8 May. The next day Cruizer was in company with Urgent when they captured the French privateer cutter Tilsit, of ten guns and 41 men. Cruizer captured the 6-gun Danish Christianborg on 31 May 1809. She had a crew of 37 men, but 13 were away in a boat that another British warship had captured. Of her six guns, Christianborg had throw three overboard in an unsuccessful attempt to gain speed. She was only six hours out of Earthholms () and had not captured anything. Cruizer was in company with . On 30 May 1810, Cruizer captured Hercules. Then on 19 June Cruizer captured the Danish galiot Frau Magdalena, and the Prussian sloop Jonge Laura, on 26 June. On 12 July Cruizer captured Jonge Johannes Next, on 13 July, Cruizer captured the Danish sloop Zwey Gebroeders while was in sight. Two days later Cruizer captured the hoy Elizabeth (or Jonge Elizabeth). Then a week later, on 22 July, Cruizer captured the Swedish hoy Concordia. In September and October, Cruizer brought four prizes (Schwan, Blanch, Albertina, and Byie) into Hull. She had captured the Prussian sloop Schwan on 31 July, the Dutch galiot Familiens Well on 17 September, and Albersina on 21 August. Cruizer shared the capture of Albersina with . Around this time Cruizer shared with a number of vessels in the capture of Aeolus, Zubeck, master; Jonge Pieter, Musterdt, master; Jusrow Alyda, Pottjewit, master; Ferwagting, Dirks, Master; Vinnern, Paulsen, master; and the Almindeligheden, Watzes, master; Neptunus, Hanses, master; Sen Soskende, Barnholdt, master; Bornholm, Junge, master; Fabius, Desvertiey, master; Zee Star, Muller, master; and Frou Eagle, Rotjer, master. She was in Yarmouth and the Nore in January 1811, refitted in Chatham in November 1811, and was in Portsmouth in February 1812.Naval Database Toker was appointed to post captain on 4 December 1813. Fate Cruizer was laid up in ordinary at Sheerness in November 1813. The Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy gave notice that the \\"Cruizer brig, of 384 tons\\", lying at Sheerness, would be offered for sale on 3 February 1819. Mr Job Cockshot bought Cruizer for ¬£960 on 3 February for breaking up. Notes, citations, and references =Notes= =Citations= =References= * Allen, Joseph (1852) Battles of the British navy, Vol.2.

Members of this class of locomotive were the last steam locomotives in commercial use in Australia. Background Information Hexham in July 1989 24 freshly painted & lined after completion of boiler repairs in May 1993 Pelaw Main Colliery in 1995 Pelaw Main in September 2007 Pelaw Main station, for the 20th anniversary of the Richmond Vale Railway's closure in September 2007 The East Greta Coal Company had constructed its railway empire based on a motley group of secondhand and borrowed steam locomotives, which by 1910, was fast becoming insufficient to move the great loads coming from the Greta Seam which ran right through the South Maitland coalfield. Standardised motive power was sought, and a melding of the New South Wales Government Railways' P(6) 4-6-0 and T(524) 2-8-0 designs brought about the 10 class. The locomotives were generally known as the '10' class, as the class leader was numbered as that company's 2nd No. 10. The fourteen locomotives were numbered where they could be accommodated within the East Greta Coal Company numbering system. This proved haphazard, the numbers allocated being 2nd No. 10 (later 10), 17-20, 22-28 and 30-31. In service The locomotives were delivered in knocked down form, and erected onsite at the East Greta Junction Workshops (colloquially known as the 'Red Shed'). They were primarily used to haul coal trains. This remained consistent until the 1950s, when a sharp downturn in demand for coal led to certain members of the class being set aside as boiler work was required. With an upturn in the late 1960s, and the purchase by Coal & Allied (C&A;) in 1967 of Hebburn Limited which gave C&A; 100% ownership of South Maitland Railways. As C&A; also owned the former J&A; Brown Richmond Vale Railway a study was undertaken on the costs involved in having new boilers built by outside suppliers for both the 10 class and the J&A; Brown ROD locomotives. It was determined to be of greater benefit to allow the remaining RODs to work out their economic lives, and to start a system of repairing the 10 Class as soon as possible for the revived traffic. On 21 March 1973, 23 arrived at Hexham to assist in the movement of coal from the mine at Stockrington on the former J&A; Brown railway. This would begin a 14-year association of the 10 class with this system, with each class member spending at least a few weeks in service there. All maintenance at this time was undertaken at East Greta Junction, with the locomotives being transferred dead on empty and loaded coal trains. Steam on the South Maitland Railway system ended in June 1983, with 31 bringing in the last load, and 22, with van in tow, bringing in the last steam-hauled revenue train to traverse the South Maitland Railway, with great ceremony. From then until September 1987, East Greta Junction Workshops became solely devoted to providing four 10 class at all times to Hexham, with the others in storage, except 19, which was on display at Port Waratah Coal Loader. SMR 10 class at Hexham Following the handover of operations of the SMR to the State Rail Authority, the 10 class remained in service on the truncated J&A; Brown railway between Stockrington and Hexham. As steam on all State Government systems in Australia had ended in the 1970s, this was the last commercial steam train operation in Australia, attracting much media attention. In September 1987, Coal & Allied announced that the line would soon close, with all coal haulage going to road. The last remained crews at Hexham protested and blockaded the entrance to the loader, using 30 and a rake of wagons. After a long standoff, during which the men were sacked and stripped of their entitlements, 30 hauled the last loaded coal train from Stockrington loader to Hexham Washery, and later 25, on 22 September 1987, hauled the last revenue steam-hauled train in Australia, a string of empties to be stored at Hexham.\\"vale Richmond Vale\\" Railway Digest November 1987 pages 341-343 Last Gasp The C&A; employees, however, were still not satisfied with the outcome, and protested the cancellation of the steam program. The men were dismissed, and in combination with their pleas being unheard, they lit up SMR 25, and ran it light engine over the swamp and to a location near Lenaghan's Drive, where a public protest was staged. Local farmers assisted with water supplies, and a sympathetic truck driver 'dropped' some coal nearby. This protest lasted for three weeks until the men were reinstated and their entitlements reissued, and on 15 October 1987, 25 became the last steam locomotive to cross Hexham Swamp, ending 130 years of continuous steam operation in this locale.\\"Vale Richmond Vale Addendum\\" Railway Digest December 1987 pages 389-390 Preservation The 10 Class are unique, along with 3801, in being the only steam locomotives protected by the National Trust of Australia. Moves to preserve these locomotives began in the late 1970s, with the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum and the Richmond Vale Railway Museum making approaches to Coal & Allied to preserve at least one of the locomotives upon withdrawal, however these requests were refused. The first of the class to be preserved was 19, which had been withdrawn awaiting overhaul and had its leading bogie used to repair 31 following damage in a 1982 accident at Fishery Creek. 19 was gutted and placed on display on a plinth at Port Waratah Coal Loader, with three non-air hoppers and an ex J&A; Brown brake van. In 2000 it was moved into storage to be cosmetically restored, along with the wagons, but this never eventuated. In 2009, 19 and the wagons were donated to the Richmond Vale Railway Museum, and 19 is now on static display, with a view to completing the static restoration in the near future. Following the cessation of steam services on the South Maitland Railway in 1983, those not required for Hexham workings was stored in the former loco shed at East Greta Junction. Moves were made to preserve the locomotives as a whole, unique in New South Wales. In 1989, 22, 24, 25 and 30, which were stored at Hexham, were placed in the care of the Richmond Vale Railway Museum by C & A, and were transferred there on 6 July 1989, where 24 became the first of the group to steam in preservation on 22 July 1989. 25 quickly followed after some repairs to the firebox, and the two locomotives were the mainstay of the museum's operations for many years. Both locomotives were withdrawn awaiting boiler lifts to allow for a full external boiler inspection in the late 1990s. 30 was returned to service in April 2000. In 2009 30 was retired with serious mechanical problems. It's running gear is to be replaced with that of a class mates however this is a long-term project. 22 was dismantled with a view to a return to steam in the early 1990s, however this deemed to be uneconomical, and the locomotive was reassembled and put on static display at the museum. 25 is in store underneath the former screens of Richmond Main mine. Two units 24 and 30 have been dismantled with the view to use the best of both locomotives where the boiler was inspected in 2018 due to a THNSW grant and a view in having one operational by 2025 depending on funding. In the late 1980s the Hunter Valley Training Company was granted ownership of the remaining nine locomotives. 10 and 18 were overhauled by the Friends of the South Maitland Railways, and made their public debut at the Hunter Valley Steamfest 1990, with 10 in steam and 18 on static display. The locomotives made regular appearances at this event in the ensuing years, including Steamfest 1991, which saw 10, 17 and 18 in steam together at East Greta Junction, 17 being in steam after some political pressure was laid on in order to obtain a two-day boiler certificate for 17. This was the first time three 10 class had been in steam together since 1987, and would be the last to date. The climax of these was in 1994, when 18 and 3112 hauled the first tourist trains since 1983 on the SMR, topping and tailing between Neath and East Greta Junction, and 10 and the HVTC's diesel shunter 7307 gave brakevan rides in East Greta Junction yard. In 1995, 18 was placed on permanent loan to 3801 Limited, to operate The Cockatoo Run from Wollongong to Moss Vale.\\"3801 Ltd's Illawarra Tourist Railway Commences\\" Railway Digest September 1995 page 6 After The Cockatoo Run ceased in 1998 it was stored at Eveleigh Railway Workshops.\\"Cockatoo Run to Cease in November\\" Railway Digest October 1998 page 9 The locomotive was sent to Bradken Rail's workshops at Braemar and overhauled, and transferred to Hunter Valley Railway Works at Rothbury in early 2007. 18 was significantly modified whilst under 3801 Limited's care, including but not limited to an extended self-cleaning smokebox, replacement welded tanks, a complete mechanical ash pan and hopper release, and an enlarged bunker, all of which (Excluding the bunker) it still carries. 10 was retired to the shed in the late 1990s, and was dismantled by apprentices in 2002, but the project stalled. 10 was then transferred to Hunter Valley Railway Works, Rothbury, where it was reassembled using 27's boiler and tanks, and made its return to steam in September 2005, double-heading a train to Newcastle and return with 3801. The locomotive made three more public appearances following this tour - Steamfest 2006, on display at East Greta Junction, Great Northern Railway 150, March 2007, shuttle trips from Newcastle to Broadmeadow, and Steamfest 2007, a one-off tour to Newcastle with 18. On 5 November 2010, 10 and 18 steamed back into their original home at East Greta Junction for preservation. On 5 August 2011, 10 and 18 top and tailed a special passenger train along their old stomping ground to Neath and back to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Hunter Valley Training Company, 125 years since the discovery of the Greta coal seam and the 100th Anniversary of the delivery of 10 to the East Greta Coal Company. In 2012, after discussions between 3801 Limited, the Hunter Valley Training Company and the Friends of the South Maitland Railway, a series of tours around the Sydney suburban network using 18 were announced.Member's letter February 2012 Australian Railway Historical Society After a trial on 22 February 2012, 18 was deemed to have issues with at least one driving wheel bearing and was declared to be unfit for the tours. On 23 February 2012, a decision was made to prepare and trial 10 for these tours. Unfortunately the trials conducted the following day revealed a similar problem, and the movement of one or both locos to Sydney, and the tour schedule, was cancelled. Both locomotives were disposed and securely stored in the 'Red Shed' under tarpaulins. In late 2012 the 'Red Shed' was leased to Bradken Rail as a storage/maintenance centre for their two BK class diesel-electric locomotives. This left 10 and 18 exposed to the elements, until HVTC constructed a small, non-serviced single road storage shed with 10 and 18 moved in late 2012. They were used in 2014 but then stored again. As of August 2018 both units underwent boiler inspections and washouts and being prepared for late 2018 or within the next 2 years. The remainder of the locomotives - 17, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28 and 31 - were sold to Chris Richards in 1990, and transferred to Hunter Valley Railway Works, Rothbury.\\"SMR 10 Class\\" Railway Digest January 1991 page 27 17 was pressed into sporadic service on the former Ayrfield Colliery branch hauling tour trains, however this ceased in the late 1990s. 23 was overhauled by the Friends of South Maitland Railways and Hunter Valley Training Company in 1998, and was painted in a powder blue livery and had a Pyle National headlight fitted. In 2002, 23 was posed in the refuge at Branxton, in steam for that year's Steamfest, however has not made any public appearances since. The remainder of the locomotives are stored in as-withdrawn condition. In April 2013 these seven locomotives were sold to the Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum.New home for historic engines Maitland Mercury 18 April 2013 The 10 Class in the Media Being the last steam locomotives in Australia, the 10 Class have had more than their fair share of media attention. The documentaries 'Destiny of Steam', 'The Richmond Vale Railway', 'Hearts of Fire', 'Return to Steam' and 'Farewell to Steam', all rating well on major television networks, all feature the 10 class in a large proportion. The 10 Class, and the stories of their final days at Hexham, were featured in major articles in Woman's Day and National Geographic magazines. thumb Modelling A Lloyd's/FSM HO Scale 10 Class, modelled on SMR 10 as preserved in 1990, running on Coalfields Model Railway Club's layout 'Ashlington'. A HO scale whitemetal kit of the SMR 10 Class was produced in the 1970s by FSM (Fine Scale Models), and the moulds were later sold to Casula Hobbies. Under an arrangement with Casula Hobbies, Lloyds Model Railways designed an etched brass chassis for the kit and, together with Casula Hobbies, sold the model as a complete kit. In 2009 Ezi-Kits sold a small number of kits which had been acquired from Lloyds Model Railways. In 2016, Southern Rail Models announced their intention to produce a ready-to-run (RTR) proprietary model of the 10 class. This model was released for general sale in October 2017, and covers all variants from 10 as originally delivered, to the ultimate in 25, as withdrawn in October 1987.

He rode in many steeple chases but was never a cross-country jockey > as we understand the phrase. He bought and sold many horses, but was never a > professional dealer. He was paid for giving opinions upon the merits or > demerits of many horses, but he was never a veterinary surgeon. He was ‚Äúhail > fellow well met‚Äù with everybody from George IV to an earthstopper, and could > hardly write his own name. Among the famous races in which Dick Christian took part was the 1826 steeplechase between Horatio Ross‚Äôs horse Clinker and George Osbaldeston‚Äôs Clasher. Christian rode Clinker and was narrowly defeated by Osbaldeston on Clasher. William Blew's history of the Quorn Hunt recorded that: > Dick Christian's forte was making hunters. From all accounts he was not a > first-class steeplechase rider; but up to a certain point in his life he had > a wonderfully good nerve, and he was constantly put on rough horses with > orders to turn aside from nothing, and he certainly carried out his > directions. He jumped over a whole flock of sheep, and rode the mare > Marigold over a most extraordinary drop fence, Marigold being a mare which > had given a succession of breakers no little trouble.William C. A. Blew, The > Quorn hunt and its masters, J.C. Nimmo, London, 1899 Christian also took part in the first ever running of the Grand Liverpool Steeplechase at Aintree, later renamed the Grand National. Up until the time of his death this was still considered to have been the first official running of the race. Christian also played a prominent, if comical role in the famous set of prints of the Quorn Hunt made by Rudolph Ackermann in 1835: > \\"Who is that under his horse in the brook?\\" enquires that good sportsman & > fine rider, Mr Green of Rolleston, whose noted old mare had just skimmed > over the water like a swallow on a summer's evening. \\"Only Dick Christian,\\" > answers Lord Forester, \\"& it is nothing new to him.\\" \\"But he'll be drowned\\", > exclaims Lord Kinnaird. \\"I shouldn't wonder\\", observes Mr Coke. But the pace > is too good to enquire. Christian also featured in The Druid's Post and Paddock and Silk and Scarlet. In the former book, \\"Dick Christian's Lecture\\" is a vivid account of horsemanship and foxhunting in Leicestershire in the early 19th century, while the latter starts with \\"Dick Christian Again\\" , an early example of a writer willing to risk life and limb for a good story.

Practically nothing is known about Jacques Hardel's life. He was a pupil of Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res and achieved a very high reputation at the court, at one point giving concerts for the King every week, performing together with the lutenist Porion. For several years he lived together with a pupil, a \\"Gautier\\" who remains unidentified today. The two men shared a close friendship, and Hardel bequeathed all of his works to Gautier. Only eight pieces by Hardel are extant today. These are a courante for lute, a six-movement harpsichord suite in D minor, and a harpsichord gavotte. All of the harpsichord works are of the highest quality, displaying Hardel's perfect grasp of his teacher's techniques, particularly Chambonni√®res's strong sense of the melodic line, which in Hardel's works is augmented with advanced bass writing, tightening the harmony and working towards a more progressive sound. The suite, which consists of an allemande, three courantes, a sarabande, and a gigue, is one of the earliest examples of a complete \\"classical\\" French suite. The lute courante may be a transcription of a lost harpsichord piece.

The complex consists of the railroad station, the freight house, round house, turntable, and horse barn. The station was built in 1874 and is a simple, rectangular, gable roofed building with a broad, overhanging strut-supported roof in the Stick-Eastlake style. Its exterior is covered with vertical boards. The original station was built in 1871 as the new northern terminus of the Adirondack Railway, soon after the line had been purchased by the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad served the garnet mining and tanning industries in North Creek. The railroad's vice president originally intended to extend the line to Ogdensburg, but the line was not extended beyond North Creek until 1944, when the line was extended for freight service to Tahawus. In 1889, the line was purchased by the Delaware and Hudson Railway, becoming its Adirondack Branch. Ski trains ran to the station from 1934 until the outbreak of World War II. It is notable as the place where Theodore Roosevelt learned of the assassination of President William McKinley and of his accession to the Presidency of the United States. See also: The station served as the northern terminus of the Saratoga and North Creek Railway from 2011‚Äì2018, when the railroad ceased operation. The Saratoga and North Creek revived both the ski trains and summer service south to Saratoga Springs. The railway occupied both the freight house and engine house. Another part of the complex continues to serve as the North Creek Depot Museum. The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 as the North Creek Railroad Station Complex.

It is now the oldest African-American object in the British Museum and possibly the oldest surviving anywhere. The drum is a reminder of all three continents' involvement in the estimated twelve million people transported across the Atlantic as part of the slave trade. The drum is normally displayed in room 26.British Museum, The drummer is calling me display. Description The drum is made from two species of wood that are native to sub-Saharan Africa, Baphia and Cordia africana. The latter fine-grained hardwood is known for its ability to be carved and its resonance, which makes it suited to musical instruments. The drumskin came from a deer hide and was stretched over the wooden structure using vegetable fibre. Provenance The drum was made in the Ghana region of West Africa between 1700 and 1745, and is presumed to have travelled to America on board a slave ship. As all the slaves left with nothing it is presumed that the drum was either brought by a member of the crew or possibly by a son of the African chief who had sold the slaves for transportation. To exercise their captives, the slave traders would \\"dance the slaves\\". It is supposed that this was why the drum was transported. The word Akan refers to the culture in what is today Ghana and includes the Fante, Asante and Akuapem people. The Old Plantation - a late 18th-century painting showing slaves dancing with banjo and drum. This particular drum was obtained in Virginia by the Rev. Clerk on behalf of the British collector Sir Hans Sloane. Sloane had travelled through Jamaica and had observed at first hand slaves playing instruments including those that were to evolve into the banjo. Sloane gathered examples of the tools of slavery and other artifacts which included this drum. Clerk and Sloane thought erroneously that this drum was made by American Indians, however their trip to Jamaica confirmed that it indeed not only \\"African\\" but from the Akan people of Ghana, where the instrument was in abundance amongst others of the Akan such as the Seperewa harp. Sloane used his collection to found the British Museum in 1753, and the drum is still displayed there as part of the \\"Sloane collection\\". Sloane's catalogue records this item as \\"drum made of a hollowed tree carved the top being brac'd wt. peggs & thongs wt. the bottom hollow from Virginia\\". In 1906, curators at the British Museum realised that the drum could not have been created by Native Americans, but must have been made in Africa. In the 1970s, it became possible to use expertise from Kew Gardens to determine that the wood was grown in Africa. The drum is thought to have originally been made for a musician in an African chief's orchestra.

After a fierce exchange of fire, Foote, seriously damaged, was forced to withdraw. The engagement was the first battle of the war, as well as the first naval Spanish success. Background Spanish 3rd class gunboat Ligera. At the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the US Navy detached a force of two protected cruisers, 16 auxiliary cruisers, 12 torpedo boats and many other units including armed tugboats, yachts and colliers to blockade the Cuban coasts with the aim of cutting off the supplies of the Spanish Army. It proved to be a difficult task due to the large number of inlets, keys and natural ports of that coasts that allowed the much inferior Spanish vessels to break the blockade many times. One of that ports was C√°rdenas. The naval units based there were the gunboats Alerta, Ligera and Antonio L√≥pez, the last a former tugboat operated by the Spanish Line, which had ceded it to the navy. The port was supposedly defended by two shore-batteries, but the Spanish accounts didn't mention their presence prior to their installation on 12 May. The entrances to the bay were covered by 20 Bustamante mines, most of them defective, and a 70-men company of marines had been detached to garrison the town. The gunboats belonged to the Spanish Caribbean squadron under Admiral Vicente Manterola, and most of its units had been described as \\"unhelpful even to the coastal police\\". Antonio L√≥pez, nevertheless, had captured the filibuster ship Genoveva and the schooner William Todd few years before. Battle Antonio P√©rez Rend√≥n. On 25 April, the Ligera patrolled the entrance of C√°rdenas' port. Her commander was Lieutenant Antonio P√©rez Rend√≥n y S√°nchez, an experienced C√°diz-born officer who had seen action against the Cuban insurgents many times during the war. The American torpedo boat Foote, a 142-ton warship armed with three 1-pounder guns and three 457 mm torpedo tubes, was sighted off Cayo Diana. Both ships soon opened fire on each other. The American fired more rapidly, but less accurately. Foote fired about 70 shots, of which only one hit Ligera, while Ligera only managed 10. The damage and casualties aboard the Spanish ship were minimal. Foote, meanwhile, took several hits that caused heavy damage. Foote left the combat enveloped in smoke with its boilers badly damaged. At the time the Spanish believed that the U.S. torpedo boat was the USS Cushing. Aftermath Antonio Rend√≥n was awarded with the Naval Cross of Maria Cristina for his success, which was met with public acclaim. Subsequently, the American and Spanish navies fought several more engagements near C√°rdenas. On 8 May, the three Spanish gunboats under Rend√≥n surprised the American torpedo boat USS Winslow, which was part of a small flotilla led by the gunboat USS Machias. The most important of the battles around C√°rdenas, the Battle of C√°rdenas, took place on 11 May, when Rend√≥n and his ships repulsed an attack against the port. Spanish naval successes of the war were mainly due to the actions of their small coastguard vessels. Besides the actions off C√°rdenas they faced the American Mosquito Squadron with some success in Manzanillo, Cienfuegos and even in Philippine waters. There the gunboat Elcano captured the American bark Saranac on 26 April 1898.New York Times, 28 April 1898 Saranac, under Captain Bartaby, was carrying 1,640 tons of coal from Newcastle, New South Wales, to Iloilo, for Admiral Dewey's fleet.

Dao√≠z's surname is derived from the town of Aoiz in Navarre and he was descended from a long line of Spanish gentry with soldiering associations dating to the Reconquista. Dao√≠z's great grandfather married the daughter of the Count of Miraflores de los Angeles and Dao√≠z spent much of his early life in palaces owned by the family. He was born in Seville and, after receiving a Catholic education, trained at the Royal School of Artillery in Segovia. Dao√≠z saw action against the Moors in Spanish North Africa, where he was commended for his bravery and promoted to lieutenant. He also served against the French in the short-lived War of the Roussillon where he was captured. After refusing to serve in the French army, he was imprisoned. After his release he served on secondment to the Spanish Navy during the Anglo-Spanish War, participating in the Defence of Cadiz and on convoy duty to the Americas, for which he was rewarded with promotion to captain. He tired of the sea and rejoined his artillery regiment. His subsequent duties included assisting in the manufacture of new guns for the horse artillery, attending the signing of the Treaty of Fontainebleau with France and participating in the 1807 invasion of Portugal. He returned to Madrid in 1808 and was a leader of the Dos de Mayo Uprising in which he assisted civilians resisting French efforts to remove the royal family from Spain. His defence of the barracks at Montele√≥n was the only action that day in which the Spanish army fought the French and, although ultimately unsuccessful, it inspired the Spanish War of Independence. He died in the fighting and has been commemorated as a national hero.  Ancestry  Luis's oldest known ancestor is Don Berenguer D'Aoiz, who was named for the town of Aoiz in Navarre and fought in the Reconquista of Spain from the Moors. Members of the family subsequently served in the militia, including Don Garc√≠a Garc√©s D¬¥Aoiz who fought at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, a decisive Christian victory and a turning point in the Reconquista. Other ancestors fought in the 15th century Granada War, the 16th century conquest of Naples and in 17th century Flanders. Luis's great grandfather, Joaqu√≠n D¬¥Aoiz, was sheriff of Gibraltar in the mid-17th century when he was forced to hand the territory over to the British, the family subsequently moving to El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a and changing their surname to Dao√≠z. Joaqu√≠n's grandson Martin married Francisca Torres Ponce de Le√≥n, daughter of the Count of Miraflores de los Angeles, in 1766 and their son Luis was born in a palace owned by the Miraflores family in Calle del Horno, Seville.  Early life  Luis Dao√≠z was born on 10 February 1767 and baptised the same day as \\"Luis Gonzaga Guillermo Escol√°stica Manuel Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Ana y Juan de la Soledad Dao√≠z Torres\\". Dao√≠z lived for much of his childhood at the palace in Calle del Horno, spending some of his summers at a house in Calle Iglesia (now renamed Calle de Dao√≠z) in Mairena del Alcor. He was educated at the Colegio de San Hermenegildo Jesuit college in Seville up to the age of 15, when his parents decided that he would become an officer in the Spanish Army, which their families considered a career suitable for a gentleman. Dao√≠z's father was able to arrange the necessary paperwork for him to enter the elitist artillery corps which only permitted noblemen to take commissions. The Alc√°zar of Segovia, home of the Royal School of Artillery Dao√≠z entered the Royal School of Artillery at Segovia as a cadet on 10 February 1782 and graduated as an ensign on 9 February 1787. According to his entrance report he had a dark complexion, brown hair, large eyes and a small stature, being less than five feet tall. At the school Dao√≠z excelled at mathematics and sports, in particular saber fencing and was able to speak French, English, Italian and Latin in addition to his native Spanish. After graduation Dao√≠z was assigned to the Real Regimiento de Artiller√≠a (Royal Regiment of Artillery) at Puerto de Santa Maria. He was able to use a considerable private income from property and farms owned by his family around Gibraltar to supplement his official salary.  Army career  Dao√≠z volunteered to help defend Ceuta against the Moors in 1790 and was given command of an artillery battery. He remained in North Africa to assist with the defence of Oran in 1791, spending part of the time with a unit of miners. Dao√≠z was commended by his superiors, including artillery Brigadier Andres Aznar, for his courage and zeal in the battles and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1792. After Spain joined the First Coalition against Revolutionary France, Dao√≠z participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured in a French counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Dao√≠z was released and made his way back to El Puerto de Santa Maria. The British blockading squadron at Cadiz Spain signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796, allying itself with France against Great Britain and beginning the Anglo-Spanish War. On 11 July 1797 Dao√≠z was placed in charge of a gunboat in the Defence of Cadiz, commanded by Admiral Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar, against the British blockading squadron. During the defence his gunboat, No. 5, was involved in an attack on the British third-rate HMS Powerful. Later that year he was seconded to the Spanish Navy, which was short of trained officers, for service aboard the 74 gun ship San Ildefonso. Dao√≠z sailed twice with the vessel to the Americas, escorting galleons. During this time he assisted the ship's captain, Jose de Iriarte, by acting as a translator during negotiations with foreign officials and found time to write a short treatise on the instruction of soldiers and sailors. Whilst with the ship in Havana, Cuba, in November 1800 Dao√≠z was reading back issues of a gazette and was surprised to find that he had been promoted to captain on 4 March 1800, whilst at sea. He did not enjoy the long trips away from Spain and requested a land based posting, serving initially as a lieutenant in the infantry before joining the newly formed 3rd Artillery Regiment of Seville on 7 July 1802. Had he stayed aboard the San Ildefonso Dao√≠z may have seen action with the ship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. On 2 December 1803 Dao√≠z was ordered by General Godoy to be seconded to the Royal Bronze Foundry. There he sat on a committee, headed by Brigadier Maria Vicente Maturana, to decide the design and oversee the production of new light guns for the horse artillery. Dao√≠z agreed to wed a noblewoman from Utrera in 1807, the marriage ceremony taking place in spring the next year. In 1807 Dao√≠z was commander of the Spanish artillerymen that attended the signing of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, an agreement between Spain and France to split up Portugal into three smaller states, and was part of the Franco-Spanish force that invaded Portugal to enforce that treaty. He moved with his regiment to Madrid in 1808 and took command of a battery of the 2nd company (some sources say 3rd company) at the former palace of the Duke of Montele√≥n. He became known to the men under his command as \\"el Abuelo\\" (\\"the grandfather\\") due to his relative age and good temperament.  Dos de Mayo  thumb As part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, French troops began to arrive in Spain and occupy strategic points. Marshal Joachim Murat was ordered to Madrid with 30,000 troops and began taking control of the main palaces and barracks of the city, which had just 2-4,000 Spanish troops in its garrison. The presence of a French garrison was resented by much of the populace and Dao√≠z himself had to be restrained from fighting a duel with a French soldier he overheard insulting Spain in a tavern. On 2 May a crowd, hearing of French plans to send members of the Spanish royal family away to France, gathered outside the Royal Palace in Madrid to protest. It is not known how the fighting started, but the British consul, John Hunter, recorded that by 11 am French troops were firing musket volleys into the crowded square and fighting had spread across Madrid. French troops were dispatched to take possession of the Spanish barracks to secure their arms and ammunition. Dao√≠z, the highest-ranking officer at the Montele√≥n barracks found himself in command of just 4 officers, 3 NCOs and 10 men. He sought reinforcements at his regimental headquarters and returned with the 3rd company of the 2nd Battalion, a further 33 men and 2 officers. Dao√≠z's orders from the local junta were to remain in the barracks and co-operate with French forces but, after conferring with Captain Pedro Velarde y Santill√°n, he decided that the French troops were hostile to Spain and that they would defend the barracks against any French interference. By this time a large crowd of civilians had gathered at the barracks, requesting weapons with which to oppose the French, and Dao√≠z ordered the armoury opened to them. With 9 cannon, and 120 soldiers and armed civilians under his command, Dao√≠z now made arrangements for the defence of the barracks. A battery of 24 pounder guns were placed at the main gate facing into the street and were loaded with canister shot by their military and civilian crews. A small detachment of French stationed near the barracks were captured by Verlarde and their weapons and ammunition distributed to civilians. Manuel Castellano's 1862 painting of Dao√≠z (centre) receiving his fatal wound According to Hunter, when the first French troops advanced up the street to take possession of the barracks they were fired upon and several were killed before they halted to await reinforcements and occupy neighbouring buildings. Soon the French commanding officer, General Joseph Lagrange, had around 2,000 men in the area. French battalions, including a unit of Imperial Grenadiers, made two assaults on the guns, but both were repulsed, and the Spaniards captured a French colonel. A third wave of French troops reached the artillery lines and fired into the barracks, killing many of the defenders including Velarde, before charging with fixed bayonets. Hunter claimed that Dao√≠z, who had been shot in the hip, continued to issue orders despite his wound and was wounded twice more whilst fighting the French with his sabre. Dao√≠z is said to have been stabbed in the back with a bayonet and killed whilst approaching a French officer waving a white flag of truce. The dying Dao√≠z was dragged away by his men, who continued to fight within the barracks buildings before surrendering at the request of Spanish Captain-General the Marquis de San Sim√≥n. The Spanish at Montele√≥n had held out against superior French numbers for around three hours. Dao√≠z was 41 years old when he died, and had over 26 years of continuous service in the Spanish Army.  Aftermath  Goya's The Third of May 1808 The French surgeon is said to have insisted on treating Dao√≠z before tending to his own men, but his efforts were in vain and Dao√≠z was buried in the Church of St Martin alongside his men. Velarde, who spearheaded the uprising alongside Dao√≠z, was also killed, but another artillery officer, Lieutenant Ruiz, managed to escape. Members of the Junta went around the city asking for resistance to stop, and by 2am the next morning calm had been restored. Marshal Murat convened a military tribunal, chaired by General Emmanuel Grouchy, that morning to summarily try and sentence anyone found in possession of a potential weapon. Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, who witnessed the aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Dao√≠z's death his wife entered a convent in Seville.  Legacy  The Monumento a los Caidos por Espa√±a which holds Dao√≠z's remains Dao√≠z is commemorated as a leader of the initial resistance against French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Dao√≠z and Velarde, with those of others involved in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por Espa√±a in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost their lives on the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. One of the lions outside of the Congress of Deputies In 1852 a plaque was erected on the spot where Dao√≠z's house stood in Seville, being replaced in 1869 by a twice lifesize statue depicting the pivotal moment of the Dos de Mayo when Dao√≠z decided to disobey his orders and resist the French. A monument commemorating the \\"Martyrs of Liberty\\" who died on 2 and 3 May stands on the spot of Murat's executions and contains representations of both Dao√≠z and Velarde. A monument to Dao√≠z also stands in Segovia, where he studied at the artillery academy and in Madrid the two statues of lions that stand outside of the Spanish Congress of Deputies building are popularly known as Dao√≠z and Velarde. The Premio Dao√≠z military honour is awarded once every five years to an artillery officer in the Spanish Army. The award in memory of Dao√≠z is for services to the nation in the preceding five years and the honorary sabre is presented by the monarch in a ceremony held at the Alc√°zar of Segovia on 2 May.

He had a brother, Nicol√°s de Junco y Espriela, Knight of Calatrava. He was a knight of the Order of Santiago. He joined the Spanish Army in his youth, attaining the position of colonel. In 1716, he traveled to modern Mexico as a knight of the Viceroy, Baltasar de Z√∫√±iga. After this, he returned to Spain, and, in 1724, he returned to Mexico as Governor of Marquezado Valley. In 1740, the Spanish Crown appointed him the governor the Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n. He finished this term in 1746. Two years later, on June 3, 1748, he was appointed the interim governor of Texas. He unsuccessfully opposed the location chosen by the friars for Mission San Xavier del Bac. However, In June 1749, Junco y Espriella spoke with Juan Galv√°n, an explorer who led the Mission San Xavier del Bac, to devise a plan to organize an expedition in the valley of San Javier (San Gabriel). He personally investigated the valley to decide how to conduct the expedition. On August 28, after returning from his expedition, Barrio decided to elect Lieutenant Galv√°n to lead a new group of soldiers to San Javier. His government was arbitrary and, at some point, he imprisoned the first ruler of San Antonio, but this imprisonment lasted a short time. In 1750, a French soldier, the son of deceased explorer and soldier Louis Juchereau, asked Junco y Espriella for a license for direct trade with the Caddo people. Junco y Espriella refused this license, so the soldier carried French troops to the towns and took many goods to try to convince the indigenous people that the Spanish were not their friends since they had tried to stop the French from giving them the goods.Clayton Anderson, Gary (August 3, 2009). The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention. University of Oklahoma Press. Page 156. He was dismissed from the office of governor in late 1750 because he chose to ignore a royal decree banning French trade in New Mexico and the existence of gambling. The charges against him were investigated. He was appointed governor of Nuevo Le√≥n for the second time, between 1752 and 1757, and he developed many campaigns against Amerindian peoples.Phares, Ross (1976). The Governors of Texas. Firebird Press. Page 29. Later, he served as provincial mayor of the Santa Hermandad (Brotherhood) of New Spain. On March 27, 1765, he was named the captain of the Presidio of El Paso del Norte, Mexico, which seems to have been his last appointment. His place and date of death are not known.

At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s he became a pioneer in discovering and promoting ornament as a unique individual phenomenon. He also significantly contributed to the acceptance of aesthetic qualities of visual art. Since 1995 he has undertaken commissions for architecture-related projects in which he has collaborated with a number of leading architects both from the Czech Republic and abroad. He has been a lecturer at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Brno University of Technology, where he is in charge of a painting studio, since 1994. His works are represented in public and private collections.  Life  Installation in Plasy convent, 1993 Petr Kv√≠ƒçala was born in Svitavy in 1960. A serious interest in fine arts he developed during his studies at the Secondary Technical School of Chemistry, led to the attempt to transfer to a school with an artistic focus, that he was denied. A major impuls of Kv√≠ƒçala‚Äôs artistic development came in the course of his compulsory military service in Janovice nad √öhlavou, where he met graduates of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts and began to draw portraits of other soldiers. After finishing his military service, Kv√≠ƒçala started Secondary School of Arts and Crafts in Brno, where he received a number of recommendations for his further study at the Academy. However, he was not permitted to enrol for ideological reasons. At the same time in 1982 he started working as a stoker (what he did until 1990) and began to engage in the underground movement. A milestone in his artistic career was his participation in an exhibition in The Youth Gallery in 1985. There started author‚Äôs closer co-operation with Petr Vesel√Ω and Vladimir Kokolia, which subsequently led to creation of an art group called Tovary≈°stvo mal√≠≈ôske (Society of Painting). Since the second half of the 1980s Kv√≠ƒçala‚Äôs work was supported by theoreticians Petr Nedoma and Ji≈ô√≠ Valoch and he started to be repeatedly invited to participate in exhibitions of professional artists. In 1986 Kv√≠ƒçala entered the underground music scene with his band called Kvƒõten (May), working on the basis of minimalism and musical and political irony, what are themes which correlate with author‚Äôs painterly work of that time. In 1989 he became a member of the art group Mƒõkkohlav√≠, which was formed in response to the emergence of various artistic groups, lacking a common program, whose main objective was to promote commercially. In 1989 Kv√≠ƒçala founded, along with Marian Palla and Milan Magni, a musically-performative group called Flori√°n ‚Äì Group of Haze and Kine. After 1989 Petr Kv√≠ƒçala started to be represented in state and public collections and his work was regularly reflected in professional journals. Since 1994 he has been working on the Faculty of Fine Arts in Brno, initially in the studios of conceptual tendencies and intermedia, and later as a head of one of the painting studios (his students were e.g. Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω prize laureate Barbora Kl√≠mov√°, Pavel Ry≈°ka, Matƒõj Smetana, Ane≈æka Ho≈°kov√°, Petr Dub, Jana Babincov√° or V√°clav Koƒç√≠). In 2001 he received a Degree of an Assistant Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. In 1995 Kv√≠ƒçala made his first painterly intervention into architecture (in the apartement of architect Ivan Koleƒçek in Lausanne) and so started a long series of art projects in architecture, which has been one of the main themes of his work until now.  Painting  Mural for Rischart building, Marienplatz, Munich, 2007, arch. Marcus Link Petr Kv√≠ƒçala has been dealing with ornament since the mid 1980s. Both through his work and as a creative artist he confirmed the significance and importance of painting in the era when new media were violently trying to replace other forms of visual art. He works with the simplest ornament, consisting of wavy lines, broken arches or loops. His source of inspiration- landscape ‚Äì was transformed into an extremely reduced visual vernacular, the basic elements of which are ornamental lines.Tom√°≈° Pospiszyl: ARTLIST ‚Äì datab√°ze souƒçasn√©ho umƒõn√≠, Centrum pro souƒçasn√© umƒõn√≠, His beginnings were punctuated by attempts to express nature‚Äôs principles using the medium of visual art but it the second half of the 1980s the artistic means employed became extremely unorthodox. His creative aspirations from that period were typified by the limitless merging of various disciplines: he created texts inspired by what he had experienced in the landscape and drew simple sketches of fields. At the same time, he was a member of several ensembles dabbing in minimalist music and musique concr√®te whose productions crossed the boundary between theatrical and performance and animated sculptural installation.Tom√°≈° Pospiszyl - \\"Nejen pro oƒçi\\", Petr Kv√≠ƒçala, ƒçervenec 1984 a≈æ 28. 2. 2006, str. 240 - 242 Apartment of Ivan Koleƒçek, Lausanne At the turn of 1980s and 1990s, Petr Kv√≠ƒçala‚Äôs work seemed to display an affinity with the broad stream of post-modernist Czech painting as hinted at by the clear colours of the paintings, which enclosed colour surfaces within boundaries and used archetypal-geometric elements. Today, such a general classification is less justifiable. Obviously, rather than making post-modernist quotations and providing a symbolic content to the paintings, so characteristic for the painters from the circle of the Tvrdohlav√≠ group, Kv√≠ƒçala was more interested in probing the possibilities of the painting medium itself. The orderly inner arrangements of Kv√≠ƒçala‚Äôs work is determined by employing lines approached as ornaments. Of these, the undulating line ‚Äì a rhythmic painterly gesture in time ‚Äì if featured most often. The lines are combined and composed according to clear pre-determined rules of algorithms which nevertheless may produce unexpected results. Attention was drawn to the similarities between his works and ornamental paintings in folk architecture (the Waves 1991) or to the affinity to the abstract cave paintings. Kv√≠ƒçala indicates his inspiration from ‚Äûlow‚Äú culture by using elements from artistic crafts or industrial manufacturing. In the Wallpapers (1987‚Äì1988) and Festive Tablecloths for Everyday (1992‚Äì1994) cycles he balanced on the hard-to-define line between ornaments on utility objects and artistic expression. He also emphasized manual, and therefore imperfect, reproduction of the ornamental rhythm. However, at the initial level, Kv√≠ƒçala is not concerned with a post- modern game of aligning various languages, but rather he wishes to rehabilitate ornament as such. He values its visual effectiveness, rational order and its possibility of continuous variation. Kv√≠ƒçala showed great invention and desire to experiment within his intentionally abridged vocabulary. Among his works we can find procedural paintings, where the surface of the painting can be looked upon as a relic of the time spent on the execution (60 Days of Red, Blue and Yellow, 1996, Monochromes). Work on sketches for ceiling painting ‚ÄûWatermelon-Cut Ceiling Dance‚Äú, 2004 In Memory cycle (2001‚Äì2003) Kv√≠ƒçala works with a negative definition of lines, delineating them with a surrounding red surface, a memory of lines and fragments of ornaments, their imprint in the mind. Working with broad lines led author to an opposite extreme: using white paint he reduced ornamental lines to the very extreme of technical possibilities of traditional painting (Fine Stripes ‚Äì Coded Ornaments 2008). The recent works by Petr Kv√≠ƒçala implement the artist‚Äôs accustomed repertoire of line ornaments, combining waves, broken lines and loops. The special optical effect is achieved by a multiple repetition of thin parallel lines of the two basic ornaments and an intentionally limited colour palette, relying on a simple rhythm of two to three colours. Special prominence is given to minuscule deviations and ‚Äúflaws‚Äù in the applied order. These serve as another, improvised, level of rhythmicizing the paintings although they can also be perceived as a generalization of the natural and human responses to environmental changes (cycles Dogon 2007, Pacific 2008, Flow 2009).; Tom√°≈° Pospiszyl: texty pro v√Ωstavu Vlny / Waves v Wanniek Gallery v Brnƒõ, 2008.  Installation  Since 1993 Petr Kv√≠ƒçala has created a number of ephemeral installations ‚Äì mostly on the floors of galleries and in public space. Major installations are e.g. send lines in Plasy convent (1993), the red pigment installation in Beh√©mot gallery in Prague (1994) or contemporary Zig Zag street art in Brno (2009).  Architectonic Interventions  Since the second half of 1990s painterly interventions into architecture are one of the main topics of Kv√≠ƒçala‚Äôs work. He uses principles and themes from his paintings, which he strives to transfer to the specific architectural space. Kv√≠ƒçala is also a coordinator of international educational and research project 2B2A, dealing with cooperation between art and architecture, its theoretical reflection and practical implementation.Petr Kv√≠ƒçala, ƒçervenec 1984 a≈æ 28. 2. 2006. s. 76 Mural for sportshall, Litomy≈°l, 2001 The very first painterly intervention into architecture Kv√≠ƒçala made, was in the apartment of architect Ivan Koleƒçek in Lausanne. ‚ÄûSouthern part of the apartment, with windows facing the lake, contains the living space and the adjoining studies, while the northern part faces the town. I noticed that the southern exterior ‚Äûpervades‚Äú the house to such an extend that any change in weather and the continual play of light are reflected, by the great mirror of the lake surface, in the living space and becomes ts integral component. As a result, I decided to underline the opposing role of the dividing role relative to the view.‚ÄúPetr Kv√≠ƒçala, ƒçervenec 1984 a≈æ 28. 2. 2006. s. 76 Major international project Kv√≠ƒçala worked on in 2004, was new Deutsche Bundesbank building in Chemnitz (architect Josep Lu√≠s Mateo), where he realized the ceiling painting ‚ÄûWatermelon Cut ‚Äì Ceiling Dance‚Äú. The painting on the entrance hall ceiling (exceeding 150 m¬≤ in area) is both a counterpoint and to the overall logic of the building and its complement. The paint application technique left the brush strokes visible as a sign of a human, yet artificial intervention in stark contrast to the abstraction of the organic construction materials, free of any trace of craftsmanship. Retaining the brushwork proved to be of importance in integrating the work within the architectural space, both as a nod to the process of making the painting and an element evoking the organic nature of the painting ‚Äì a cut through the living tissue of a solid architectural form. thumb|Ceiling painting \\" Watermelon Cut - Ceiling Dance\\", 2004, new building of Deutsche Bundesbank, Chemnitz In numerous sketches prepared for the painting I first examined the rhythm of the division relative to the format as well as the harmonization of colours with regards to the materials within the space. I continued by producing two cardboard paintings at the actual scale in order to be able to precisely determine the density of the network of lines, the magnitude of the waves and their thickness. While working on the cardboards I concluded that waves of this magnitude cannot be drawn using a standard method, as their dimensions surpass the physical capability of human being. I resorted to attaching the charcoal that I used for drawing on a long pole and, by standing on tip-toe and gyrating the whole body including carefully thought-out legwork, I negotiated smooth curves. I performed something short of a dance during which the body movement is transmitted into the lines drawn.Petr Kv√≠ƒçala, ƒçervenec 1984 a≈æ 28. 2. 2006, s. 213 University of Technology EPFL, Lausanne In 2005 Petr Kv√≠ƒçala cooperated, with architects A. Nov√°k and P. Valenta, on the reconstruction of the historical building of Reduta theatre in Brno. He is author of the mural ‚Äû40 Days of Red‚Äú in Reduta ballroom hall, atrium floor and ceiling arches of the theatre caf√©. The mural consists of layers of red undulating lines laid next to one another. on a red background. In each of the superimposed layer the undulating lines have a different direction. The monochrome effect of the red paint, together with the colour of the parquet flooring arranged into historical patterns conjures up a solemn ambience nurtured by the rare occurrence of the colour red in the nature patterns, and even more so by its endorsement of the cultural and historical tradition. ‚Äû The regular layers of repeatedly painted undulating lines impregnates the walls with aspects of time, exertion and sumptuousness. No celebration can take place without show and splendor as, in essence, a ‚Äûpurposeless‚Äú celebration is the most natural human response to the mystery of life.‚ÄúPetr Kv√≠ƒçala, ƒçervenec 1984 a≈æ 28. 2. 2006, s. 218. The motive of Memory cycle was used for wall paintings in Rischart building in Munich (2007). The target to achieve was to create environment which is not only positive but also outstanding and which makes it possible for the employees to identify with. Those paintings are repeated in the areas of central communications: in the corridors of the cloakrooms located in the basement, in the high lit part of the staircase leading from the second to the fifth floor, as well as in the central area in front of the offices of the owners and in the meeting room of the fifth floor, around the staircase leading to the caf√© for the employees on the sixth floor.. ‚Äû Restricting the lines by surrounding red areas, the memory of the line and fragments of the ornaments is a sort of an imprint on one's mind. I thought of the ancient concept of Crete in which unlike in the Greek one everything is floating, everything is shown in non-existence and does not manifest its achievement and the drama of the fight. It is a world of gardens determined for solitary confinement, for rest and meditation, for the world I sometimes long for and which I can relate to.‚ÄúSee  Other  Since 1980s Kv√≠ƒçala has also created number of painted objects, since 1990s he has been applying his motives to utility items, especially to textiles (e.g. his cooperation with Denisa Nov√°, DNB) or China.

Within six month of its relaunch as an online magazine, sister-hood won Espoke Living Best Website at the 2016 Asian Media Awards for highlighting female equality as well as creating awareness of issues affecting Muslim women. sister-hood magazine ambassadors include Farida Shaheed from Pakistan, Egyptian Mona Eltahawy, Palestinian Rula Jebreal, Leyla Hussein of Somali heritage and Algerian Marieme Helie Lucas.  Goals  The goals of sister-hood are to promote known and unknown women of Muslim heritage working for human rights, gender equality, freedom of expression, peace and social justice And to highlight women from history and today who have fought for personal rights and bodily integrity, who extended solidarity to women and other downtrodden people, and who improved their societies as scholars, artists, saints and activists.  History  Sister-hood originally started in 2007 as an Online Mixtape, featuring the unreleased songs by young female rappers, singers and poets of Muslim heritage from Europe and the United States, to promote the creativity of women who often faced barriers in expressing themselves creatively. Khan stated that ‚Äòmany of them have been actively discouraged, even by their own communities, from expressing their thoughts and dreams through music,‚Äô a situation which she had faced herself in her early career as a musician. The young women‚Äôs tracks dealt with a variety of issues, from war, racism, love, romance, living in a post-9/11 world, women's rights issues, identity, sexuality, a sense of belonging, faith, and the personal experiences of being young, socially conscious Muslim women in the West.  Projects  * Sisterhood Online Mixtape (2008) is the first project presented by Sisterhood. * In 2015 Deeyah and Fuuse produced World Woman, a two-day conference in Oslo which brought together feminists like Nawal El Saadawi, Hina Jilani, Mona Eltahawy, Shirin Ebadi, Farida Shaheed, Yanar Mohammed, Leyla Hussein and others. The positive reactions from the women inspired Deeyah to reignite sister-hood as a much larger project taking the form of a sister-hood magazine and a series of sister-hood live events as platforms for known and unknown voices of women of Muslim heritage. * The online magazine sister-hood was launched on 16 May 2016, announced on BBC Woman‚Äôs Hour. In an interview with Al Jazeera , Khan described the magazine as shattering stereotypes around women of Muslim heritage, and providing an outlet for women‚Äôs rights activists who challenge the status quo both within and outside the Muslim world. She expressed a determination to use the platform as a means to develop activism and increase the representation of women of Muslim origin in the public sphere. The launch edition included articles from Nawal el-Sadaawi , Karima Bennouce, Rula Jebreal and Sanam Naraghi-Anderlini . With art and multimedia content as well as written articles, the magazine aims to reflect the diversity of women of Muslim heritage, with a broad characterisation of what it means to have a Muslim identity. Deeyah said to Al Jazeera: ‚Äòsister-hood is for all women and girls of Muslim heritage, regardless of age, ethnicity or sexuality. Former Muslims, cultural Muslims, and agnostics are just as welcome to contribute and participate as the devout; all sects and denominations are welcome.‚Äô The magazine is funded by Khan herself, with a small grant from Norwegian Freedom of Expression foundation Fritt Ord. sister-hood magazine founder and editor in chief is Deeyah Khan.

He is the head coach of Danish Superliga club Br√∏ndby IF. Frederiksen began his career as a head coach at Lyngby Boldklub in 2009, after having spent almost two decades as a youth coach in B 1913, B.93 and Lyngby. He remained in the post as head coach, and later manager, for the club for nearly four years. He then coached Esbjerg, leading them to a fifth place in the domestic league as well as their best European result ever; the Europa League round of 32 where the club was knocked out by Fiorentina. He was relieved of his duties in 2015. He was later put in charge of the Denmark national under-21 team, before being appointed head coach of Br√∏ndby in June 2019, replacing Alexander Zorniger. Frederiksen is noted for his exceptional work with young talents, developing players such as Andreas Christensen, Andreas Bjelland, Yussuf Poulsen and Christian N√∏rgaard in Lyngby, and Martin Braithwaite at Esbjerg. He has furthermore shown flexibility in regards to formations, employing a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation at Denmark U21, but also utilising a classic 4‚Äì4‚Äì2. In Br√∏ndby, Frederiksen started out employing a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3, but since adjusted this to a dynamic 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 with attacking wingbacks, Andreas Maxs√∏ as the anchor in defense and a fast and more stationary centre forward as the main forwards. Frederiksen is a proponent of pressing, in what he has called a balanced press. This implies striking a balance between immediately attempting to win back possession high up the pitch, and falling back and regrouping in defence. Frederiksen has cited his main influences inside football as Jos√© Mourinho \\"for his arrogance\\", Sir Alex Ferguson \\"for his long time success\\" and J√ºrgen Klopp, due to his development of young players and his tactics. Outside football, he has been inspired by Socrates and the 2011 film Moneyball starring Brad Pitt. Coaching career Frederiksen started coaching at age 20, coaching youth teams at B 1913 in his hometown Odense. = B.93 = Frederiksen's arrived in B.93 from √òsterbro, Copenhagen in 1997, where he was put in charge of some youth divisions. Between 2000 and 2002, he was appointed coach of the under-16 team and followed the players as coach when these reached the under-18 team in 2003-04. In 2005, Frederiksen was put in charge of the entire youth department of B.93, while he also worked as assistant coach to the first team which competed in the Danish 2nd Division (third highest division). In November 2005, he signed a contract as under-19 coach for Lyngby Boldklub, and he left B.93 in late 2005. = Lyngby = Frederiksen began coaching the Lyngby Boldklub under-17 and under-19 sides beginning 1 January 2006. During his first season, he led the under-19 team to a second place in the table in the national championship, while they reached third place in 2007. In February 2008, Frederiksen was promoted to the position of head of talent in Lyngby - the club's first since 2004 where Birger J√∏rgensen held the position. He also joined the board of the Lyngby Boldklub aktieselskab. Lyngby Boldklub's first team competed in the Danish 1st Division (second highest division) in 2009, where the club's objective was promotion to the Danish Superliga. After a poor start to the season, head coach Henrik Larsen was sacked on 23 March 2009. On the same day, Frederiksen was promoted from head of talent to head coach for the first team. Lyngby ended the 2008‚Äì09 season in sixth place, 21 and 19 points, respectively, behind Herf√∏lge Boldklub and Silkeborg IF who reached promotion. He continued coaching the first team during the 2009‚Äì10 season while managing an HR unit within Danske Bank where he had also become chief operating officer. Frederiksen and Lyngby Boldklub reached promotion during that season, after reaching second place in the table, only behind AC Horsens and ahead of FC Fredericia in third place. After reaching promotion to the Superliga, Frederiksen signed a one-year contract extension with Lyngby on 1 July 2010. While working as head coach at the highest level, he took leave as COO in Danske Bank and would only do consulting assignments. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Lyngby was engaged in a relegation battle but managed to avoid this in the final fixture of the season, on 29 May 2011 in a 2-0 home win over OB. The club ended in eighth place in the league table. In early June 2011, Frederiksen became a full-time permanent employee in Lyngby. This happened after he signed a three-year contract extension, keeping him part of the club until June 2014. By 1 September 2011, Frederiksen was released from his employment obligations in the Danske Bank Group, and the following week he was appointed manager of Lyngby, where he was also put in charge of transfers. The same year, he received his UEFA Pro Licence. = Esbjerg fB = On 2 May 2013, Esbjerg fB announced that Frederiksen would succeed Jess Thorup as the club's head coach from the start of the 2013‚Äì14 Danish Superliga season. In his first season, he led Esbjerg to the round of 32 in the Europa League, where they lost 2-4 over two legs to Italian side Fiorentina. This came after advancing from the group stage in second place by beating Standard Li√®ge (2-1; 2-1) and Elfsborg (2-1; 1-0), and losing two matches to group winners, Red Bull Salzburg (1-2; 0-3). Esbjerg had qualified to the group stage after winning 5-3 on aggregate over French club Saint-√âtienne. In the domestic league, his first season was also successful, ending in a fifth-placed finish which qualified the club for contention in the 2014‚Äì15 Europa League second round. In the following season, Esbjerg knocked out Kazakh side Kairat Almaty 2-1 on aggregate in the second qualifying round, before facing Polish club Ruch Chorz√≥w in the third round. In the first leg, Esbjerg drew 0‚Äì0 away. However in the second leg, a last- minute goal by ≈Åukasz Surma for Ruch Chorz√≥w to make it 2‚Äì2 to win on away goals, ended Esbjerg's hopes of advancing in the tournament. In the domestic league, Esbjerg had sold some profiles such as Jakob Ankersen, Eddi Gomes and Martin Pu≈°iƒá during the winter transfer window, and partly due to this the club struggled against relegation. In the last fixture of the season, Esbjerg avoided relegation after a 2-1 win over relegation rivals, FC Vestsj√¶lland. On 10 August 2015, Frederiksen was dismissed by Esbjerg with the side placed last in the Danish Superliga table after four matches into the 2015‚Äì16 season, with chairman S√∏ren Poulsen citing \\"lacking\\" domestic results as the reason behind the dismissal. Frederiksen was succeeded by Jonas Dal. = Denmark U21 = In August 2015, Frederiksen was named manager of the Denmark under-21 team, signing a two-year contract. In his first game in charge, they lost 1‚Äì2 to Germany in a friendly at Stadion Lohm√ºhle in L√ºbeck, Schleswig-Holstein. Under Frederiksen, Denmark qualified for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 2017 and 2019, where they were knocked out in the group stages, finishing third and second, respectively. = Br√∏ndby =  2019‚Äì20 season  Frederiksen returned to club management at the beginning of the 2019‚Äì20 season with Br√∏ndby IF, when the club announced him as their new head coach on 1 June. However, Frederiksen would have to lead the Denmark under-21 team through the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship before starting in his new position.Br√∏ndby announce new manager, brondby.com, 1 June 2019 In Br√∏ndby, he had a mixed start and the club suffered a string of poor results in September. This saw him change the formation from a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 to a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 in early October, which resulted in a derby win over FC Copenhagen. Frederiksen's defense consisted of Hj√∂rtur Hermannsson, Andreas Maxs√∏ and Sigurd Rosted, which neutralised Copenhagen-strikers Nicklas Bendtner and Michael Santos. After winning the subsequent league match 3-0 over Frederiksen's former club, Lyngby, he stated that the 3-5-2 was a system suited for his team's abilities. In January 2020, sporting director Carsten V. Jensen sold key players Kamil Wilczek and Dominik Kaiser to G√∂ztepe and Hannover 96, respectively, which brought forward Frederiksen's key strengths; the development of young players. The altering of the first-team meant that talents such as Morten Frendrup and Anis Ben Slimane began to play a larger role for the club in the spring of 2020.  2020‚Äì21 season  Frederiksen had a strong start to the 2020‚Äì21 season, winning the first four matches including stoppage time wins over Nordsj√¶lland and main rivals FC Copenhagen.  Personal life  During his tenure as coach and head of talent in Lyngby Boldklub, Frederiksen received his UEFA Pro Licence in 2011, and has since functioned as a coaching instructor in the Danish Football Union. Frederiksen has a master's degree in economics from University of Southern Denmark, and worked in Danske Bank for several years, while having a part time job as youth coach at B.93 and Lyngby Boldklub.Niels Frederiksen indtr√¶der i A/S-bestyrelsen His favourite club is Borussia Dortmund, who he started supporting in 2011.

The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony.John North, Roman Religion (Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp. 4ff. The study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Rome's protohistory, and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors. In matters of theology, the Romans were curiously eager to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), and to reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts.North, Roman Religion, pp. 4‚Äì5. Rome's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with Etruscan religion, less documented than that of the Greeks. While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature,North, Roman Religion, p. 4. Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse.T. P. Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. xiii. Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of \\"classical mythology\\" than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in Ovid's Metamorphoses, written during the reign of Augustus, came to be regarded as canonical. Nature of Roman myth In this wall painting from Pompeii, Venus looks on while the physician Iapyx tends to the wound of her son, Aeneas; the tearful boy is her grandson Ascanius, also known as Iulus, legendary ancestor of Julius Caesar and the Julio-Claudian dynasty Because ritual played the central role in Roman religion that myth did for the Greeks, it is sometimes doubted that the Romans had much of a native mythology. This perception is a product of Romanticism and the classical scholarship of the 19th century, which valued Greek civilization as more \\"authentically creative.\\"T. P. Wiseman, The Myths of Rome (University of Exeter Press, 2004), preface (n.p.). From the Renaissance to the 18th century, however, Roman myths were an inspiration particularly for European painting.Wiseman, The Myths of Rome, preface. The Roman tradition is rich in historical myths, or legends, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. In Rome's earliest period, history and myth have a mutual and complementary relationship.Alexandre Grandazzi, The Foundation of Rome: Myth and History (Cornell University Press, 1997), pp. 45‚Äì46. As T. P. Wiseman notes: > The Roman stories still matter, as they mattered to Dante in 1300 and > Shakespeare in 1600 and the founding fathers of the United States in 1776. > What does it take to be a free citizen? Can a superpower still be a > republic? How does well-meaning authority turn into murderous tyranny? Major sources for Roman myth include the Aeneid of Virgil and the first few books of Livy's history as well as Dionysius's Roman Antiquities. Other important sources are the Fasti of Ovid, a six-book poem structured by the Roman religious calendar, and the fourth book of elegies by Propertius. Scenes from Roman myth also appear in Roman wall painting, coins, and sculpture, particularly reliefs. =Founding myths= The Aeneid and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for Rome's founding myths. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date. The Trojan prince Aeneas was cast as husband of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, patronymical ancestor of the Latini, and therefore through a convoluted revisionist genealogy as forebear of Romulus and Remus. By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.See also Lusus Troiae. =Other myths= Mucius Scaevola in the Presence of Lars Porsenna (early 1640s) by Matthias Stom Polyphemus hears of the arrival of Galatea; ancient Roman fresco painted in the \\"Fourth Style\\" of Pompeii (45‚Äì79 AD) The characteristic myths of Rome are often political or moral, that is, they deal with the development of Roman government in accordance with divine law, as expressed by Roman religion, and with demonstrations of the individual's adherence to moral expectations (mos maiorum) or failures to do so. * Rape of the Sabine women, explaining the importance of the Sabines in the formation of Roman culture, and the growth of Rome through conflict and alliance. * Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome who consorted with the nymph Egeria and established many of Rome's legal and religious institutions. * Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, whose mysterious origins were freely mythologized and who was said to have been the lover of the goddess Fortuna. * The Tarpeian Rock, and why it was used for the execution of traitors. * Lucretia, whose self-sacrifice prompted the overthrow of the early Roman monarchy and led to the establishment of the Republic. * Cloelia, a Roman woman taken hostage by Lars Porsena.

Religion and myth Narratives of divine activity played a more important role in the system of Greek religious belief than among the Romans, for whom ritual and cult were primary. Although Roman religion did not have a basis in scriptures and exegesis, priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of Latin prose. The books (libri) and commentaries (commentarii) of the College of Pontiffs and of the augurs contained religious procedures, prayers, and rulings and opinions on points of religious law. Although at least some of this archived material was available for consultation by the Roman senate, it was often occultum genus litterarum,Cicero, De domo sua 138. an arcane form of literature to which by definition only priests had access.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985) 207‚Äì234. Prophecies pertaining to world history and to Rome's destiny turn up fortuitously at critical junctures in history, discovered suddenly in the nebulous Sibylline books, which Tarquin the Proud (according to legend) purchased in the late 6th century BC from the Cumaean Sibyl. Some aspects of archaic Roman religion survived in the lost theological works of the 1st- century BC scholar Varro, known through other classical and Christian authors. Capitoline Triad The earliest pantheon included Janus, Vesta, and a leading so-called Archaic Triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, whose flamens were of the highest order. According to tradition, Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome, founded Roman religion; Numa was believed to have had as his consort and adviser a Roman goddess or nymph of fountains and of prophecy, Egeria. The Etruscan-influenced Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva later became central to official religion, replacing the Archaic Triad ‚Äì an unusual example within Indo-European religion of a supreme triad formed of two female deities and only one male. The cult of Diana became established on the Aventine Hill, but the most famous Roman manifestation of this goddess may be Diana Nemorensis, owing to the attention paid to her cult by J.G. Frazer in the mythographical classic The Golden Bough. Punishment of Ixion: in the center stands Mercury holding the caduceus, and on the right Juno sits on her throne.

The gods represented distinctly the practical needs of daily life, and Ancient Romans scrupulously accorded them the appropriate rites and offerings. Early Roman divinities included a host of \\"specialist gods\\" whose names were invoked in the carrying out of various specific activities. Fragments of old ritual accompanying such acts as plowing or sowing reveal that at every stage of the operation a separate deity was invoked, the name of each deity being regularly derived from the verb for the operation. Tutelary deities were particularly important in ancient Rome. Thus, Janus and Vesta guarded the door and hearth, the Lares protected the field and house, Pales the pasture, Saturn the sowing, Ceres the growth of the grain, Pomona the fruit, and Consus and Ops the harvest. Even the majestic Jupiter, the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity. Due to his widespread domain, the Romans regarded him as their protector in their military activities beyond the borders of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods Mars and Quirinus, who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Modern scholars see Quirinus as the patron of the armed community in time of peace. The 19th-century scholar Georg WissowaGeorg Wissowa, De dis Romanorum indigetibus et novensidibus disputatio (1892), full text (in Latin) online. thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the di indigetes and the di novensides or novensiles: the indigetes were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the novensides were later divinities whose cults were introduced to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. Arnaldo Momigliano and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained.Arnaldo Momigliano, \\"From Bachofen to Cumont,\\" in A.D. Momigliano: Studies on Modern Scholarship (University of California Press, 1994), p. 319; Franz Altheim, A History of Roman Religion, as translated by Harold Mattingly (London, 1938), pp. 110‚Äì112; Mary Beard, J.A. North and S.R.F. Price. Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 158, note 7. During the war with Hannibal, any distinction between \\"indigenous\\" and \\"immigrant\\" gods begins to fade, and the Romans embraced diverse gods from various cultures as a sign of strength and universal divine favor.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922) pp. 157 and 319; J.S. Wacher, The Roman World (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 751. =Foreign gods= Mithras in a Roman wall painting The absorption of neighboring local gods took place as the Roman state conquered neighboring territories. The Romans commonly granted the local gods of a conquered territory the same honors as the earlier gods of the Roman state religion. In addition to Castor and Pollux, the conquered settlements in Italy seem to have contributed to the Roman pantheon Diana, Minerva, Hercules, Venus, and deities of lesser rank, some of whom were Italic divinities, others originally derived from the Greek culture of Magna Graecia. In 203 BC, Rome imported the cult object embodying Cybele from Pessinus in Phrygia and welcomed its arrival with due ceremony. Both Lucretius and Catullus, poets contemporary in the mid-1st century BC, offer disapproving glimpses of Cybele's wildly ecstatic cult. In some instances, deities of an enemy power were formally invited through the ritual of evocatio to take up their abode in new sanctuaries at Rome. Communities of foreigners (peregrini) and former slaves (libertini) continued their own religious practices within the city. In this way Mithras came to Rome and his popularity within the Roman army spread his cult as far afield as Roman Britain. The important Roman deities were eventually identified with the more anthropomorphic Greek gods and goddesses, and assumed many of their attributes and myths.

As part of this mission, Dr. Wanless founded India's first missionary medical school in 1897, and helped to establish a leprosy sanatorium as well as a tuberculosis hospital, now known as the Wanless Chest Hospital. His medical mission turned the once-small village of Miraj into a major medical center in India. By the time he retired in 1928, the clinic he started had become a 250-bed hospital with several important adjuncts. He is considered by many to be India's most famous surgeon of the 19th century, and was known throughout Asia, personally treating princes, rajahs and Mahatma Gandhi.Gandhi, M.K. Letter to Sir William Wanless, M.K. Gandhi, June 2, 1931. Retrieved from the MKGandhi.org website, October 6, 2010. In 1928, he was knighted by King George V, who appointed him Knight Bachelor of the British Empire, for treating 1,000,000 patients and restoring sight to 12,000 of them. The Wanless Hospital in Miraj bears his name, and is now a modern 550-bed teaching hospital.  Early life and education  William James Wanless was born on May 1, 1865 to Elizabeth and John Wanless in the then-community of Charleston, Province of Canada (now \\"Caledon Village\\", part of Caledon, Ontario, Canada.) He was the sixth of 14 children, including two elder brothers who died in childhood. His father, born in Barrow, Alwinton, Northumberland, England (or possibly Jedboro, Scotland) on December 30, 1832, emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of 17, later emigrating to Canada where he variously became a railroader, a hardware store owner (John Wanless & Sons), and a home heating furnace manufacturer in Toronto (where Wanless Park and several streets are named after one of their distant relations, also a John Wanless, a municipal alderman and educator). John Wanless, 1832‚Äì1911, Wanless Web genealogical website. Retrieved October 3, 2010. During his childhood and adolescence, William was educated in the schools of Charleston, Mount Forrest and Guelph, Ontario. He graduated from the New York University School of Medicine in 1889. He married Mary Elizabeth Marshall on September 5, 1889 in Canada, and sailed for India the same year. Mary gave birth to Ethel at Miraj on Dec 2, 1891. Mary died on August 12, 1906. On December 5, 1907, Dr William married again at Kodoli to Lillian Emery Havens, who survived him. Lillian gave birth to 3 children: Harold L. Wanless on October 2, 1908, at Miraj; Robert Emery Wanless who became a Pan Am Boeing pilot and Margaret Elizabeth Wanless on August 24, 1917 in Toronto. Lillian later wrote his biography. The Ontario Register. Vol 11, page 99. Wanless was a delegate to the 1910 World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was president of the Missionary Medical Association of India from 1911 to 1928. In 1918 he was made a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. He was erroneously reported as dead in 1922; the incorrect report and its subsequent retraction made headlines in the United States.  Mission in India  William Wanless, age 23, at the New York University School of Medicine, ca.1888. The Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church, of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, sent Dr. Wanless to India in 1889. In 1891, he selected the rustic town of Miraj in Maharashtra State for the mission hospital. The Mission was started as a one-room dispensary in a very small rented place at a busy bazaar, and he was assisted by his wife, Mary, a trained nurse. The Rajah of Miraj, Rajah Sir Gangadharrao Ganesh (Bala Saheb) Patwardhan, provided him with land for a hospital which was formally opened in 1894, in a part of the city now known as Wanlesswadi. Kunte, G.J. Miraj Senior (Princely State): Predecessor Rulers and Short History, CHARITRA OF ADYA SANSTHAPAK CHINTAMANRAO APPASAHEB PATWARDHAN, 1972. Retrieved from University of Queensland, Australia, Genealogical Gleanings website, October 6, 2010. With the establishment of a hospital, the need for higher quality medical care was increasingly felt, and towards that end a School of Nursing was founded in 1897 under the superintendence of Miss Elizabeth Foster. It has since steadily developed into one of the best nursing schools in Maharashtra. The Mary Wanless Hospital was founded in memory of Wanless's first wife Mary after her death in 1906. Now called the Mary Wanless Hospital / Miraj Medical Centre, it still attracts hundreds of poor and needy patients from across India and abroad. He established the Miraj Christian Medical School in 1907, which later graduated its first group of 17 students, with its only qualified teacher being Wanless himself. In 1917 the medical school was recognized for a Diploma of Licentiate by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Mumbai (LCPS), similar to the LRCP of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) of England. Wanless established a Tuberculosis Sanatorium in 1920. At the time of his retirement in 1928, money was raised by citizens and his friends to erect a new building called the Wanless Tuberculosis Sanatorium, now known as Wanless Chest Hospital. It is one of the premier institutions in the country. The Vail Memorial Cancer Institute, named after Dr. Charles E. Vail who joined Wanless three years later, and the Goheen Psychiatric Clinic were started in 1937 and 1955 respectively. The Goheen Clinic was named after Dr. Robert H. H. Goheen, father of Robert Francis Goheen, These facilities have effectively served the purposes for which they were established, that is in providing quality health care to all irrespective of caste, creed, religion or financial means. Additionally, Wanless established five outpost stations attached to the hospital, and paid the hospital's staff of 125, living only on his missionary's salary sent by the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church, while donating his personal staff salary to the mission. =Retirement and legacy= In 1928, after almost forty years of medical missionary service in India, Wanless retired to live in the United States. He wrote a book, Medicine in India, on his life as a doctor in India. He died at his home, 1016 Matillja Street, Glendale, California on March 3, 1933, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the same city. His wife Lillian died in 1973 at the age of 99 years at their home in Glendale, California. Wanless's son Harold later carried on his father's tradition by studying medicine at the University of Toronto. Since its inception over 115 years ago his medical mission has grown into an institution consisting of a 550-bed teaching hospital affiliated with India's Government Medical College, a College of Nursing, an Institute of Pharmacy and various paramedical programmes. The Wanless Hospital and Wanless Chest Hospital are now located in the township of 'Wanlesswadi', that is 'Wanless town', made notable for its medical institutions. The name was given it by its citizens in that part of India and is recognized by the federal government of India. Wanlesswadi has its own Postal Index Number, 416414, and the Indian Railways also has a station named 'Wanlesswadi' on its Miraj‚ÄìSangli Route, which opened on April 1, 1907 for the use by ill or needy patients from across India and from abroad. As a secondary and tertiary care centre, Wanless Hospital serves a large part of western Maharashtra and North Karnataka. The Wanless Hospital reputedly provides the best possible medical care to all its patients; an institution for comprehensive and dedicated health care.  Honours  The badge of a Knight Bachelor Dr. Wanless received official honors from Great Britain on three occasions: * He first received the silver Kaisar- i-Hind (Emperor in India) medal of second class in 1912. * The same order of gold medal of first class in 1920, in recognition of his philanthropic and humanitarian work for India. * The third honor was bestowed upon him on January 2, 1928 by His Majesty, George V of the United Kingdom, was a knighthood of the British Empire, conferring upon him the degree and honor.

Biography Euson formed his first band aging just twelve years. After winning a number of amateur talent contests on Aruba he tried his luck and emigrated to the Netherlands in 1962. Besides accepting a job at he joined the beat groups The Scarlets from The Hague, changing to the Rotterdam garage rock band Kreole Kats which renamed to Julio [Euson] & the Kreole Kats. Meeting jazz musicians Chris Hinze, flute player, and Cees Schrama, keyboardist and some former members of The Lords, formerly the supporting group of singer Rob de Nijs in 1967 resulted in cooperating as Stax, the supporting group of J.B. Euson. In 1970 however Hinze opted for a solo career, while Schrama started organizing Sesjun jazz sessions and festivals in Loosdrecht, radio presentation work, and his own instrumental jazzrock group Casey & the Pressure Group, leaving Euson no other choice than going solo. Euson then became famous in the early 1970s in the Netherlands and in Latin America. In 1971 he represented, together with Ben Cramer, the Netherlands at the Golden Orpheus song contest in Bulgaria.The content of the compilation album Stars Of The Golden Orpheus from 1971 showing his contribution: the song You'll Never Be Old.

Euson was the winner of the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival in Chile in 1972 where he represented the Netherlands with the song 'Julie' written and composed by himself. In 1973 together with Oscar Harris, he represented the Netherlands again at the Golden Orpheus song contest in Bulgaria.The content of the compilation album Golden Orpheus '73 - Awarded Songs And Singers from 1973 showing his contribution: the song Hope.

It inhabits the Middle Asian plains, approximately south of latitude of Ustyurt and the Aral Sea, as well as contiguous parts of Iran and Afghanistan. Physical description Mivart's A monograph of the Canid√¶ Compared to its northern cousins, the skull of the Turkmenian fox has a relatively large cranium with a weakly developed sagittal crest. Overall, the skull is much more paedomorphic than that of northern foxes. It is the smallest subspecies of red fox inhabiting Eurasia; adults attain a body length of , a tail length of , an ear length of and a weight of . Unlike most other red fox subspecies, the Turkmenian fox either completely lacks reddish colour tones, or has in their place only light, sandy yellow tones. Generally, dull- yellowish or grey tones predominate. The head is sandy or yellowish-creamy in colour, with a whitish muzzle. A dark grey, reddish-brown or blackish-brown band is present in front of the eyes. The outer surface of the ears are either pure black or brownish-black. A cross-like figure is formed by overlapping yellow or brownish tones on the upper neck, back and shoulders. The flanks are usually grey, and are typically more brightly coloured than the back. The throat, chest and belly are whitish or grey. The feet are grey with dark stripes. It is not overly exploited by the fur trade, its fur being ten times cheaper than that of northern foxes. Behaviour It primarily feeds on Afghan voles. When these are scarce, it will target invertebrates such as termites, beetles and grasshoppers. Plant food eaten by the Turkmenian fox includes pistachios, capers, watermelon, various grasses and seeds. Unlike most other red fox subspecies, the Turkmenian fox often hunts during the day, thus coinciding with the activity patterns of great gerbils. It may build temporary burrows in its desert environment, dug with an entrance facing south in order to shield itself from northerly winds. Turkmenian fox burrows have 3‚Äì5 entrances, but those located in appropriated gerbil colonies may have up to 15. Its reproduction is much more prolonged than that of northern foxes; pairs are formed in November, and begin mating throughout December and January. Kits are born in February‚ÄìMarch.

Beginnings Younes Megri started singing and playing guitar at a very young age and came from a family of artists. His father played the lute and practiced painting, his mother sang in a religious music band, his brothers played the guitar and his sister was a singer. In 1960 the family moved to Rabat. He studied music at the Moroccan National Conservatory of Music in Rabat, as well as at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Malesherbe in Paris. As part of Les Fr√®res M√©gri He became part of Les Fr√®res M√©gri (the Megri Brothers) singing group, made up of the three brothers, Hassan, Mahmoud and Youn√®s M√©gri, and their sister Jalila M√©gri. Youn√®s was their youngest member.

It is a composed song in a slow metre. As is true of other forms of musical composition, most tasnifs are of relatively recent origin and by known composers. A large number of tasnifs were composed during the first two decades of the twentieth century. Many of them are based on patriotic themes reflecting the spirit of the constitutional movement of that period. Tasnifs composed during the twenties and the thirties are more concerned with amorous topics and the poetry used is generally from the works of classical poets. In the post-World War II period, the poetic context has gradually become light and the music of the tasnif has been affected by western popular songs. This more 'modern' type of tasnif is generally called tarƒÅne.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Benton Grange is located in the village center of the town, at the northeast corner of River Road and School Drive. It is a long rectangular two story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and a concrete block foundation. The narrow front facade is three bays wide, with a hip-roofed single-story porch extending across it, supported by bracketed turned posts in the Queen Anne style. Above the porch three sash windows are symmetrically placed, and there is a hip-roof dormer projecting from the roof above, adorned with a wooden panel identifying the building and its year of construction. The interior houses a lobby, with restrooms, cloakroom, and ticket booth, with a dining room behind, and a large auditorium on the second floor. The Benton Grange was organized in 1906, and its early meetings were held in the local school, but had by 1910 decided to build a dedicated meeting hall. The present hall was built in 1915 to a design by Fairfield architect Frank M. Gifford. The hall continues to be a meeting and social venue for the community, and its Grange chapter continues to be active, despite a general decline in agricultural activities in the community.

Historically, Indians played a major role in disseminating Buddhism in China. In modern times, there is a large long-standing community of Indians living in Hong Kong, often for descendants with several generations of roots and a growing population of students, traders and employees in Mainland China. History =Antiquity and Middle Ages= In the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC) and Sima Qian (145-90 BC) make references to \\"Shendu Ë∫´ÊØí\\", which may have been referring to the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as \\"Sindhu\\" in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han Dynasty in the first century, Chinese authorities reported an Indian \\"Shendu\\" community living there.Tan Chung (1998). A Sino-Indian Perspective for India-China Understanding. After the transmission of Buddhism from India to China from the first century onwards, many Indian scholars and monks travelled to China, such as Batuo (fl. 464-495 AD)--founder of the Shaolin Monastery--and Bodhidharma--founder of Chan/Zen Buddhism. There was also a large Tamil Indian community in Quanzhou city and Jinjiang district who built more than a dozen Hindu temples or shrines, including two grand big temples in Quanzhou city. In 1271, a visiting Italian merchant recorded that the Indians ‚Äúwere recognised easily.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese rich Indian men and women mainly live on vegetables, milk and rice,‚Äù he wrote. The mass foreign influx forced all locals of Quanzhou to immigrate to Fuzhou or Ningde to get away from the indians and other foreginers, while only Quanzhou's Tanka untouchables remained. As retribution for supporting the Ispah rebellion, Chen's provincial armies exterminated most of the Tamil Indians, the small remainder of them who survived were deported to other parts of the Quanzhou region like Jinjiang or Nan'an or further south of Fujian. Many Indians gave their children to local farmers to save them from slaughter where they were raised up as Hokkiens. These have created north and south culture differences, Fuzhou and Putian northerners are stereotyped as stingy, intelligent and reserved while Hokkien southerners are stereotyped as vulgar, tolerant and friendly =Colonial Era= Indians (as well as people from elsewhere in the Portuguese colonial empire) were among the crew of the Portuguese ships trading on the Chinese coast beginning in the sixteenth century. For example, Galeote Pereira, one of the Portuguese smugglers captured off the Fujian coast in 1549 and exiled to Guangxi, mentions Gujarati servants among his companions. In the same century Indians from former Portuguese Indian Colonies (notably Goa) settled in Macau in small numbers. and Their Cultures. The history of the Indians in Hong Kong could be drawn back since the day of British occupation.

In 1952, business leaders of the Indian community have founded The Indian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong (ICCHK). It aimed at promoting and improving the image of India trade in Hong Kong and southern China. People's Republic of China (Mainland China) The number in the Mainland is growing rapidly with the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China recording 15,051 Indian nationals living in mainland China as of 2010. Other sources report more with a columnist for the Economic Times stating that the number of Indians in China was 45-48,000 in 2015. Many Indians in China are students, traders and professionals employed with MNCs, Indian companies and banks. There are three Indian community associations in the country. =Medical Students= There are a total 23,000 Indian students in China in 2019 and among them 21,000 study medicine. Students from Andhra Pradesh are particularly well represented with 5,000 medical students in China reported in 2011. The growth of Indian medical students at Chinese medical universities started in 2003 after the Medical Council of India (MCI) accepted Chinese medical degrees for qualification in India. For the academic year 2019-20, MCI recognised English language degrees from 45 universities and colleges in China. Chinese medical schools are attractive because of better infrastructure, labs and equipment, and lower cost with annual tuition around $4,000 in 2020, about half of the cost of private medical schools in India.

(2003).Co-Prosperity in Cross-Culturalism: Indians in Hong Kong.P.60 The banking and financial sector had the strongest presence of Indian professionals. Information technology and telecommunications have also interested highly qualified Indians.

Coe, 81, Advocate for Native American Art, Is Dead\\", New York Times (obituary), 2010/09/26. \\"He was kind of the beginning player, enormously significant in the growth of appreciation of Native American art in the 20th century\\", noted a curator from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Biography Coe grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where his parents and sister were also involved in the art world, with his father an art collector specializing in Impressionist art as a trustee of the Cleveland Museum of Art. He earned a bachelor's degree at Oberlin College, and a master's at Yale University, both in art history. At Yale he worked for John Pope Hennessy as a research assistant. He worked at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and then at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. He was hired by what was then the Nelson Gallery of Art as curator of painting and sculpture in 1959. His lifelong interest in Native American art was sparked serendipitously in 1955, when he happened upon a Northwest coast totem pole standing in a shop on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. This chance encounter led to an interest in collecting Native American art, over the years amassing a collection of more than 1,000 pieces that dated from prehistoric times to the 20th century. Included in Coe's collection were kachina dolls, war bonnets, ceramic pieces and beaded garments. The material he found was located by crisscrossing the country to visit Indian reservations across the United States, where he acquired pieces and learned about the history and significance of the articles he collected. In 1976, an exhibition based on his work titled Sacred Circles: 2,000 Years of North American Indian Art opened at the Hayward Gallery in London. The exhibit was relocated to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1977, where Coe served as the museum's director until 1982. After leaving his position as museum director, Coe said he felt liberated, exchanging \\"a pinstripe suit for a pair of jeans\\" and having \\"the Indian world became the real world\\" to him, \\"a beguiling world of color and visual excitement, of pungent and humorous people\\". A 1986 exhibition that debuted at the American Museum of Natural History was titled Lost and Found Traditions: Native American Art, 1965-1985, focusing on works of contemporary artists, which Coe developed as part of what The New York Times called \\"his determination to show that Indian art is a living tradition\\". An exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that included some 200 items from his collection opened in 2003, titled The Responsive Eye: Ralph T. Coe and the Collecting of American Indian Art. Coe donated significant portions of his collection to the Met in 2003. Coe also influenced the work of other collectors, including Marion and Henry W.

Aug 31, 1857, Camden, South Carolina; d. Aug 14, 1950, Clifton Springs, New York) was a Methodist missionary in China. He was the Chief of the Fortifications Committee in the Siege of the Legations during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and was acclaimed as one of the heroes of the siege. Early life Frank Gamewell was the son of an inventor and he inherited the aptitude of his father for tinkering and building. During the American Civil War the family moved from Camden to New Barbadoes Township, New Jersey. Gamewell aspired to become a civil engineer and studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Cornell University. Due to illness he was unable to complete his studies, but instead attained a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Dickinson College. In June 1880 he was an instructor at a school in Norfolk, Connecticut.Source Year: 1880; Census Place: Norwalk, Fairfield, Connecticut; Roll: 96; Family History Film: 1254096; Page: 153D; Enumeration District: 146; Image: 0307. 1880 United States Federal Census (database on-line).

After graduation he joined the American Methodist Episcopal Mission and was assigned to Beijing, China ‚Äì called Peking at that time ‚Äì as a missionary and the principal of a boys' school. He arrived in Beijing in October 1881 and in June 1882 he married Mary Q. Porter, also a Methodist missionary. She was 33 years old with 11 years experience in China. He was 24. The couple never had any children.Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co, 2009, pp. 87-88 In 1884, he was reassigned to Chongqing as superintendent of the West China Mission. In 1886 a mob attacked the missionary compound, destroyed most of the buildings, and held the missionaries hostage for 16 days. The Gamewell's and other missionaries finally escaped, returned to the China coast, and subsequently the United States.\\"A Beautiful Life.\\" Woman's Mission Friend, Feb 1907, p. 46 During his stay in the US, Gamewell received a doctorate degree from Columbia University. In 1889 the couple returned to Beijing and Gamewell became a physics professor at Yenching University. Over the next several years he supervised construction of churches and other buildings on the Methodist compound, the largest of the Protestant missionary compounds in Beijing The Boxer Rebellion In early 1900 an anti-foreign, anti-Christian peasant movement spread northward from Shandong Province taking over control of much of the countryside, burning churches and killing Chinese Christians. The Boxers, as the participants in the movement were called, had substantial support within the Qing dynasty government and from the Empress Dowager Cixi in Beijing. The Gamewells were planning to leave Beijing by train on June 5, 1900 en route to a furlough in the United States. But the train did not arrive that day or on subsequent days. The Boxers had cut the railroad line to the port of Tianjin.Tuttle, A.H. Mary Porter Gamewell and her Story of the Siege in Peking. New York: Eaton and Mains, 1907, p. 185 The Gamewells were isolated in Beijing with more than 70 American missionaries. Conditions inside the walls of the city itself became increasingly unsafe for foreigners as Boxers entered the city and menaced foreign establishments. On June 8, all the Protestant American missionaries in Beijing decided to gather in the Methodist compound at which Gamewell was the senior missionary. The Methodist compound was the largest and most defensible of the missionary establishments. It was also near the Legation Quarter where several hundred foreign diplomats and businessmen lived and worked.Thompson, p. 45-46 The Semi-Siege The period between June 8 and June 20 is called the \\"semi-siege\\" as foreigners in Peking came increasingly under attack by the Boxers. Gamewell organized the defenses for American and British missionaries and several hundred Chinese Christians in the Methodist compound. He asked for and received 20 Marines from American Minister (Ambassador) Edwin H. Conger to assist him in the defense. The Church was converted into a fortress‚Ä¶\\"the altar was fenced around with a barricade of boxes of condensed milk, biscuit tins, baskets of household silver, etc\\" .Mateer, Ada Haven. Siege Days: Personal Experiences of American Women and Children during the Peking Siege. Chicago: Fleming H. Revell, 1903, pp. 77-78 The missionaries organized themselves into committees. Chinese Christians were conscripted to dig trenches and build stone and barbed wire barricades. It was good training for the siege to come. While the missionaries were fortifying their compound the Boxers were raging through Peking destroying foreign establishments and executing Chinese Christians. Foreign soldiers in the Legation Quarter exacerbated the situation by firing on Chinese demonstrators and mobs and killing many people.Fleming, Peter The Siege at Peking New York: Dorset Press, 1959, p. 95; Thompson, pp.55-58 Frank Gamewell (second from left, standing) and the \\"Fighting Parsons\\" among their fortifications at the British Legation in Beijing The Siege of the Legations On June 19, the already ominous situation in Beijing took a turn for the worse when the Chinese government ordered all foreigners to leave the city within 24 hours. Fearing they would be massacred if they left the Legation Quarter, the foreigners decided to defy the order. The next morning the German Minister Baron Clemens von Ketteler was murdered in the streets. Conger ordered all the American missionaries to take refuge in the Legation Quarter and that afternoon they and their Chinese converts abandoned the Methodist Compound and walked to the British Legation where all the foreigners in Beijing were offered sanctuary. The Chinese converts were housed elsewhere in the Legation Quarter. When all had gathered there were about 900 foreigners in all, one half being civilians and the other half soldiers from eight different countries, and about 2,800 Chinese Christians.Thompson, pp. 83-84 The next morning, amidst the chaos of hundreds of people milling around the British Legation, the British Minister Claude Maxwell MacDonald appointed Frank Gamewell as Chief of Staff of the Committee for Fortifications. He gave Gamewell absolute authority to organize the fortification of the British Legation against an anticipated attack by Boxers and the Chinese Army. Gamewell took to the job with alacrity. A British author described him, \\"G[amewell] is the man of the hour ‚Ä¶ Already the British Legation, which at the commencement of the siege was utterly undefended by any entrenchments or sandbags, is rapidly being hustled into order by the masterful hand of this missionary ‚Ä¶ the hard worked man always finds time for everything. It is a wonder.\\"Weale, B.L. (Bertram Lenox Simpson). Indiscreet Letters from Peking. New York: Dodd, Meade, 1907, pp. 142-143 The members of Gamewell's fortification committee, missionaries all, were called \\"the fighting parsons.\\"Thompson, p. 89 Gamewell wanted thousands of sandbags and American missionary women scoured the Legation Quarter for sewing machines and cloth. Curtains, silks, satins, damasks, and expensive cloth of every kind was cut and sewed by missionary women into bags, filled with dirt, and placed on Gamewell's barricades.Mateer, p. 117 Gamewell spent his days \\"superintending the filling of sand-bags, the tearing down of houses adjoining our walls that might serve as cover for the enemy, the building of barricades and strengthening of walls from the timbers and bricks so obtained, [and] making loopholes at the proper places for firing through.Coltman, Robert Jr., M.D. Beleaguered in Peking: The Boxer's War Against the Foreigner. Philadelphia: F. A. Davies, 1901, p. 79 Gamewell's fortifications were needed. Chinese attacks on the Legation Quarter began on June 22 and would continue throughout the 55 days of the siege. He insisted on powerful barricades. At one strong point he had a barricade built eight feet thick, consisting of brick and rubble and earth and capable of withstanding cannon fire.Smith, Arthur H. China in Convulsion. 2 Vols. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1901, p. 468 The defensive lines of the Legation Quarter. Gamewell was responsible for the defenses of the British Legation where most of the foreigners took refuge Gamewell had a new challenge on July 13 when two underground mines exploded beneath the French Legation killing several French soldiers. Gamewell set about digging counter mine trenches ten to twelve feet deep to surround the British Legation. In preparation for the last extremity he had bombproof shelters built, trenches six feet deep and covered with timbers and two to four feet of sandbags and earth.\\"The Fortification of Peking During the Siege.\\" The Gospel in All Lands, Feb 1902, p.83 Gamewell's fortifications proved effective. Not a single civilian was killed in the British Legation (although several were killed defending the Legation Quarter) and the siege became less of a battle than a stalemate with only sporadic Chinese attacks. Gamewell was still strengthening his fortifications when an allied expeditionary force raised the siege and rescued the foreigners and Chinese Christians within the Legation Quarter on August 14, 1900. After the Siege On August 21, 1900, the Gamewells and other missionaries departed Beijing to return to the United States. Gamewell's wife, Mary, suffered from anemia and needed medical treatment. Gamewell had with him a letter from Minister Conger which said: \\"Dear Mr. Gamewell ‚Ä¶ to your intelligence and untiring effort, more than to any other man, do we owe our preservation.\\"Brown, Rev. Frederick. From Tientsin to Peking with the Allied Forces. London: C.H. Kelly, 1902, p. 120 Later life Gamewell was feted in the United States as a hero of the Boxer Rebellion with honorary degrees from Columbia and Syracuse. He was appointed by the Methodist Church as Field Secretary and later Executive Secretary of the Open Door Commission. His wife, Mary, died in 1906. He married again to Mary Ninde (1858‚Äì1947) and the couple returned to China as missionaries in 1909. He served 15 years in the position of Secretary of Education of the Methodist Church in China and 12 years as the General Secretary of the China Christian Education Association. He retired to the United States. Assessment Frank Gamewell was described during the Siege as \\"the mildest of men ‚Ä¶ a stooping figure, very quiet, and rarely speaks.\\"Hooker, Mary (Polly Condit Smith), Behind the Scenes in Peking. New York: Columbia U Press, 1911, pp.112-113 All the numerous eye-witness accounts of the Boxer Rebellion describe him favorably. He exemplifies what was called \\"American ingenuity,\\" willing to get his hands dirty‚Äîas many were not‚Äîin achieving a vital task. He was a master builder and organizer and a quiet but obviously effective leader. He appears never to have had any great success in the missionary endeavor of converting Chinese to Christianity, but rather focused on education, especially science education.

Gameplay The core genre of Social City is city building where players build their own cities with a range of buildings ranging from leisure (which makes citizens happy), factory (which produce goods for money) and residential buildings (which the player can \\"move\\" citizens into to increase their cities population. The player must balance population growth with leisure in order to move in more citizens.http://www.gamezebo.com/facebook-games/social-city/walkthrough =Newspaper= The game gives your city a newspaper which will be called The (Name of City) Gazette. The news paper comes in 3 parts, Part A, B and C. At the top of each page, there is the date and what edition the paper it is (Morning, Afternoon or Evening). Part A Part A (The Front Page) has ‚Äò‚ÄôReal Estate‚Äô‚Äô which is new buildings or limited edition buildings. It also has Neighbour events and an advertising box, which has adverts to other Playdom Games and things that are coming soon.

He was scheduled to die by lethal injection at 9 p.m. on September 30, 2010, in California's first use of capital punishment since the lifting of a court-ordered moratorium. The use of lethal injection had been suspended in the state since February 2006 because of objections of cruel and unusual punishment for shortcomings of the facilities and procedures previously in use at San Quentin State Prison. Brown's lawyers appealed to block their client's execution, with the execution initially planned to be carried out in a new facility at the prison that is certified to use either a single or three-drug protocol. The US Ninth Court of Appeals ordered US District Judge Jeremy D. Fogel to review the case and noted that the execution date may have been influenced by the fact that the prison's inventory of sodium thiopental, one of the drugs required for lethal injection, would expire on October 1, 2010. Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections. On September 29, 2010, the Supreme Court of California unanimously denied an appeal by the state to proceed by the end of the month. Brown's execution was then delayed because the prison's supply of the lethal injection drug had expired. The manufacturer of sodium thiopental stated that new supplies would not be available until 2011. As of 2019, Brown remains on death row as a result of the continuing state-wide suspension of the death penalty in California. Early life Brown grew up in Tulare, California, with his father's family that reportedly saw to it that \\"every kid went to college.\\" According to a Tulare Western High School yearbook, he was to be part of the class of 1972. However, he was expelled from school after he accidentally fired a gun that he had brought on campus and grazed another student in the head. He joined the US Marine Corps, but was brought to court-martial and discharged in 1975 for being absent without leave. Early criminal history He moved to Riverside, California, to live with his divorced mother and was soon charged with brutally raping and impregnating an 11-year-old girl. She said that Brown told her since he was a black man and she was a black girl, she was \\"in need of a feeding.\\" She was forced to perform oral sex, and Brown then violently raped and choked her and finally sodomized her. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation. On an early morning in 1976, Brown broke into a home in Riverside and hid in a closet until all of the residents had left. When a 14-year-old girl returned from a paper route to go to school, he choked her unconscious and brutally raped her in her mother's room. Brown pleaded guilty to charges of First Degree with Force on May 4, 1978, and was sentenced to state prison. He was paroled on June 14, 1980, and found work cleaning and preparing new cars for sale at Rubidoux Motors in Riverside County. Death of Susan Louise Jordan On the morning of October 28, 1980, Brown abducted 15-year-old Susan Louise Jordan while she was on her way to Arlington High School in Riverside. He had been posing as a jogger on the route. After dragging her to an orange grove, Brown brutally raped and sodomized her and strangled her to death with her own shoelace; he also took her identification cards and school books. Susan's mother, Angelina Jordan, who had coincidentally left her car to be serviced at Brown's workplace, Rubidoux Motors, went to the school to search for Susan after her younger sister, Karen, and younger brother, James, returned home without her. After finding the family's number in a phone book, Brown called Angelina Jordan from a payphone at around 7:30 p.m. to tell her where he left her daughter's body. According to court documents, he said, \\"Hello, Mrs. Jordan, Susie isn't home from school yet, is she? You will never see your daughter again. You can find her body on the corner of Victoria and Gibson.\\" Susan's body was found after Brown repeatedly made calls to the Riverside Police Department and the Jordan residence. One of Brown's subsequent calls was recorded by a police officer. Arrest and investigation Brown was arrested on November 6, 1980, after three witnesses came forward to identify him and his Pontiac Trans Am with a Rubidoux Motors paper plate near the site of the murder. Susan's identification cards were found in a phone booth at a nearby Texaco service station. During a search of Brown's home on November 7, police found Susan's books, a newspaper article about the case, and a Riverside telephone directory in which the page opposite the listing for the Jordan family was folded. Brown was discovered to have been late to work on the day she disappeared. A jogging suit stained with blood and sperm was found in his locker at the employee coffee shop. Brown's shoes were matched to footprints from the crime scene. Trial and appeals Brown was placed on death row at San Quentin State Prison. On February 4, 1982, a Riverside County jury convicted Brown of first- degree murder with the special circumstances of first-degree kidnapping and first-degree rape, oral copulation, and first-degree sodomy. During sentencing hearings, his defense attorney argued that Brown was remorseful and presented evidence of psychiatric problems, including sexual dysfunction. Brown claimed that he had been physically abused by his aunt as a child and spanked by his mother. His mother denied abusing Brown but claimed that her son was out buying milk at the time of the murder. The surviving victim of the 1976 rape case testified against him. The jury deliberated for less than three hours on February 19 and sentenced Brown to death. On March 2, 1982, he was placed on death row at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin, California. In 1985, Brown's sentence was overturned by the California Supreme Court and reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1987. Brown's defense filed a motion of habeas corpus to the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that he received ineffective counsel at his trial and that his sentence was a cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution. On September 19, 2007, Judge Michael Daly Hawkins denied Brown's appeal and upheld lower court rulings. Execution proceedings Warden Vince Cullen met with Brown to read his death warrant. On August 29, 2010, a California court lifted a statewide injunction against capital punishment with the certification of new lethal injection procedures. On the next day, Riverside County District Attorney Rod Pacheco sought a death warrant for Brown. Riverside County Judge Roger Luebs initially set Brown's execution for 12:01 a.m. on September 29, 2010. On August 31, prison warden Vince Cullen personally walked to Brown's cell to read the death warrant to him. Brown's execution at San Quentin State Prison's new lethal injection facility was halted days before it was scheduled to proceed on September 30, 2010. Brown was the first inmate scheduled to be executed in a newly built facility at San Quentin State Prison. It had undergone a $853,000 renovation that quadrupled its size after U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Fogel blocked the February 2006 execution of convicted murderer Michael Morales because of complaints about lethal injection procedures within the previous chamber. Four separate phones were installed with individual red warning lights in the event of a call from the Governor of California, the California Attorney General, the warden, or the US Supreme Court. The facility has been set up to use a protocol of a three-drug combination of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride or a single injection of sodium thiopental in which the dose is increased from 3 to 5 g to make it lethal by itself. Brown was examined by the prison staff to check that his veins were healthy enough for the injection process. He ordered a last meal of steak and onion rings. The premises were also wired with speakers so that his last words could be broadcast. =Last-minute appeals= Judge Fogel's ruling halted executions in California for over four years. Judge Fogel, whose 2006 ruling had halted executions in California, gave Brown until September 26 to decide on a method of execution, including the new lethal injection protocols. Brown refused to make a selection. Defense attorney John Grele described Brown as \\"a simple man with obvious neuropsychological deficits\\" who is unprepared to make such a decision. Arguing that forcing him to decide on the manner of his death is \\"unconstitutionally medieval,\\" Brown's defense team asked the judge to reconsider allowing the execution to proceed. Fogel declined to issue a stay of execution, which he stated would have been considered if Brown had selected a single injection and the prison had refused to carry it out. In the absence of a decision, the prison defaulted to preparing the three-drug protocol. On September 27, Marin County Judge Verna Adams denied a defense request to stop the execution. An appeal for clemency was forwarded to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco wrote to Schwarzenegger urging him not to intervene. The governor refused Brown's request to commute the sentence to life imprisonment without parole, but he delayed the execution to 9 p.m. on September 30 to provide appeals courts more time to review the case. Brown alleged that he suffered child abuse that should have been brought up at his trial. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Fogel to revisit the case because California law specified that the inmate had to choose between the gas chamber and lethal injection, not the drugs themselves. Fogel admitted his offer to Brown was \\"ill-advised\\" and halted the execution to permit time to determine whether the new injection procedures addressed defense arguments of cruel and unusual punishment. The appeals court also noted that the prison's supply of sodium thiopental, a drug required for lethal injection, was expiring on October 1. A state appeal to resume the execution by 7 p.m. on September 30 was unanimously denied by the California Supreme Court. California and other states had run short of the drug because the manufacturer Hospira was unable to meet demand at least until January 2011 because of raw material supply issues. State Attorney General Jerry Brown (no relation) recommended halting execution proceedings until necessary supplies were secured. His office stated that a new date would be scheduled as soon as legally possible. On October 6, 2010, the state attorney general's office notified Judge Fogel in a court filing that the state had obtained enough sodium thiopental for up to four more executions. Scott Kernan of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation called the Arizona Department of Corrections \\"life savers\\" for providing 12 grams of the drug after the Texas Department of Criminal Justice denied a similar request. The state of California spent $36,415 to acquire an additional 521 g of sodium thiopental from Archimedes Pharma of Great Britain to last until 2014. Fogel stated that he understood the state would request a new execution date no earlier than 30 days after court hearings, which were expected in 2011. Susan Louise Jordan's sister, Karen, criticized the distress to her family caused by the delays: \\"The appeals process in California has proven to be nothing more than a never-ending war of attrition against justice and the rights of victims and their families.\\" =Politicization of execution= Brown's lawyers blamed the move to execute their client on the tight race between Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman for the 2010 California gubernatorial election to succeed retiring Governor Schwarzenegger. The office of State Attorney General Jerry Brown pushed to resume capital punishment after the adoption of new regulations in California. Republican nominee Whitman claimed, \\"None of this squares with Jerry Brown's record.\\" The Democratic campaign of Jerry Brown, who pledged to \\"enforce the laws\\" of California, denied any connection between the case and the election. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco, who supported Whitman, said that it would be unfair to accuse Jerry Brown of using the execution for political gain, as they had never discussed the case. Jerry Brown was quoted as saying, \\"Albert Greenwood Brown Jr. deserves everything that he has coming to him in regards to due process. I have no doubt that his execution will be carried out fastidiously and in a timely manner.\\" Jerry Brown won the election in November 2010.

The air base hosts General Staff controlled units, General Directorate of Mapping's aviation unit, Army Aviation School, 1st Army Aviation Regiment and Ankara Gendarmerie Aviation Group. The airport is open to general aviation for civil domestic flights with permission. History With the foundation of the Turkish State Airlines Enterprise () (DHY), the predecessor of the Turkish Airlines (THY), in 1933, regular domestic passenger flights started the same year between Ankara and Istanbul via a stopover in Eski≈üehir. The airport in G√ºvercinlik became the first airport of Ankara. In 1935, a training and a maintenance service center were established by the Turkish Aeronautical Association () at the airport. The center, called T√ºrkku≈üu (for \\"Turkish Bird\\"), carried out revision services to the DHY in two hangars until its relocation to the nearby airport in Etimesgut in 1945. On February 13, 1947, the first international passenger flight of the DHY departed from the G√ºvercinlik Airport for Athens via Istanbul. G√ºvercinlik Airport served for the city of Ankara 22 years until 1955 when the civil flights were transferred to the newly completed Esenboƒüa Airport. Maintenance facilities were relocated to Istanbul Ye≈üilk√∂y Airport the same year. The Army Aviation School (Kara Havacƒ±lƒ±k Okulu), which was established in 1948 at the Turkish Army's Artillery School in Polatlƒ± to train pilots and flight equipment technicians for reconnaissance aircraft and helicopters of the army and the gendarmerie, was deployed in 1958 to G√ºvercinlik Airport. Following the re-establishment of the aviation branch of the Turkish Navy in 1968, the first naval helicopter pilots were trained by the Army Aviation Command's flight school at the G√ºvercinlik Army Air Base. Legal status Currently, the air base is owned and operated by the Turkish Army. However, the military airport is open to general aviation for non-scheduled civil domestic flights only with permission according to a \\"Protocol on the Use of Military Airports by Civil Aviation\\" signed on July 22, 2002, between the Turkish General Staff and the Ministry of Transport. Civil aircraft, foreign flagged or Turkish, may make use of the maintenance facilities at the base with permission. Aircraft with any foreigner crew member, however, need to obtain a special permission to use the facilities. No staying overnight is allowed at the airport.

Built in 1905, it has served as a major community meeting space since then, notably surviving a 1907 fire that destroyed part of the town's center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Lakeside Grange is located in the village of Harrison, on the southwest side of Main Street (Maine State Routes 35 and 117), at its junction with Lincoln Street. It is a large rectangular 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. It is essentially vernacular in style, with ornament limited to the brackets support the hip-roofed hood extending across the front. The first floor has an irregular and asymmetrical arrangement, with a pair of display windows to the left of the off-center entrance, and a single sash window to its right. On the second level there is a centered pair of narrow windows, with sash windows in the outer bays. A Palladian-shaped sign is mounted in the gable. The interior was historically divided into a commercial space in the front, with meeting spaces behind, with a large auditorium space on the second floor. The auditorium has a balcony, and raised stage with backstage area. The Lakeside Grange was organized in 1874, a time when Harrison was a largely agricultural community, and originally met in the town's Odd Fellows hall. It was one of several agriculturally-oriented organizations in the town (including an older Grange chapter in another village), and the chapter folded in the 1890s. It was revived in 1901, and had by 1905 outgrown all of the available community spaces. This hall was built in 1905, providing among other features the town's first performance venue with stage. It served as the town's primary community venue until the construction of larger spaces (the VFW hall and the Deertrees Theater). In 1907 a conflagration destroyed all of the larger buildings in the town, except for this one. It continues to be used as a community resource.

Before her marriage, she was often referred to on playbills, reviews and correspondence as Mlle Milder, sometimes as Nanny Milder. After her marriage, many documents refer to her as Madame Milder. (13 December 1785 ‚Äì 29 May 1838) was an operatic soprano. Early life Milder was born in Constantinople where her father, Felix Milder from Salzburg, was employed by the Austrian ambassador Baron Herbert von Rathkeal as pastry chef; her mother was lady-in-waiting to the ambassador's wife. When Anna was five years old the family left for Bucharest, where Felix worked as translator until they had to leave because of the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1791). After he had briefly worked for the ambassador again, the family returned to Bucharest, only to be forced to flee again when pestilence broke out there. After quarantine in Herrmannstadt, the family settled in Vienna. Here Anna, now aged 10, received her first formal education which included the German language she had not spoken before despite being fluent in French, Italian, modern Greek and Romanian. She became exposed to opera and church music, and begged her parents to let her receive a musical education. After some initial, and inadequate, teaching by the local schoolmaster, Sigismund von Neukomm heard her and began teaching the 16-year-old for two years.\\"Neukomm, Sigismund Ritter von.\\" by Rudolph Angerm√ºller in Grove Music Online On Schikaneder's advice, she also studied with Salieri. Early career As Malvina in √âtienne M√©hul's opera Uthal, painting by Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow Schikaneder had opened the Theater an der Wien in 1801 and Josepha Weber, Mozart's sister-in-law, negotiated on Neukomm's behalf for a position for Anna in that theatre. Milder was engaged for 500 gulden, and made her stage debut there as Juno in S√º√ümayr's opera Der Spiegel von Arkadien on 9 April 1803, aged 19. Soon she gained major roles and changed to the Theater am K√§rntnertor for a contract worth 2,000 gulden. In 1805, she sang the title role in the first performance of Beethoven's Leonore, and again in the second and third versions in 1806 and 1814, when in the final revision its title was permanently changed to Fidelio.\\"Fidelio\\" by Douglas Johnson in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, edited by Stanley Sadie Luigi Cherubini wrote his German opera Faniska for her in 1806. She was intended to sing Beethoven's concert aria ', Op. 65, at his momentous Academy Concert on 22 December 1808 (when the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, Fourth Piano Concerto and Choral Fantasia were heard for the first time under the composer's direction), but following a quarrel between Beethoven and Peter Hauptmann, Milder's soon-to-be husband, she refused and was replaced by a Dem. Josephine Killitschky.E. Forbes, ed.: Thayer's Life of Beethoven, Princeton, New Jersey, 1964, p. 447 1809‚Äì1813 In 1809, Napoleon was so impressed by her performance in Martin's opera Una cosa rara and other works that he invited her to Paris, but she refused due to her impending marriage to Viennese jeweler Peter Hauptmann in 1810. The couple had a daughter in 1811. She contributed to the success of Joseph Weigl's Das Waisenhaus (1808) and, as Emmeline, Die Schweizer Familie (1809).\\"Milder- Hauptmann, (Pauline) Anna\\" by Elizabeth Forbes in Grove Music Online Her performance in Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride in 1812 was largely responsible for the Gluck revival in Vienna and Berlin.

Accompanied by her sister Jeanette Antonie B√ºrde (b. 1799), an accomplished composer and pianist, she travelled to Berlin in May 1815 where she would stay for the next 14 years. Gaspare Spontini was music director at the Berlin Court Opera, and she sang the role of Statira in the first Berlin performance of his highly underrated opera Olimpie in 1821 as well as in the premieres of his operas Nurmahal (as Namouna) in 1822 and Agnes von Hohenstaufen (as Irmengard) in 1827. She again sang in operas by Gluck and Weigl in Berlin, was appointed prima donna assoluta and became a member of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin in 1821. On 11 March 1829, she sang in Mendelssohn's momentous revival of Bach's St Matthew Passion. Mendelssohn wrote the concert aria Tutto √® silenzio in 1829 for her.\\"Mendelssohn, Felix.\\", ¬ß12: Operas and other dramatic music, by R. Larry Todd in Grove Music Online Following a quarrel with Spontini, she left Berlin in 1829 and visited Russia, Sweden and Denmark. She then returned to Berlin, where she made her last public appearance in 1836. She died in Berlin, and is buried on the Alter Domfriedhof St. Hedwig. Other dedications Joseph Haydn, whose pupil Neukomm was, remarked on Milder's voice, \\"it's like a house\\",Obituary by J. P.

Similarly, after a successful production of Gluck's Alceste, the composer's nephew presented Milder with a miniature painting of Gluck and the score of Alceste. Milder was however criticised for a lack of vocal agility. Schubert said: \\"her voice is the best, her trills are the worst.\\"Andreas Mayer: \\"'Gluck'sches Gest√∂hn' and 'welsches Larifari': Anna Milder, Franz Schubert und der deutsch-italienische Opernkrieg\\", in Archiv f√ºr Musikwissenschaft LII (1995), Generally, her performances of works by Rossini were disliked by critics. Many composers dedicated works to Milder-Hauptmann, including Bernhard Klein, Neukomm, Carl Blum, Conradin Kreutzer, Joseph Wolfram, .Milder-Hauptmann as dedicatee, Beethoven House, Bonn Among the more notable works are: Kreutzer wrote his monodrama Adele von Budoy (1821, in 1823 revived as Cordelia with Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient) for Milder.\\"Kreutzer, Conradin.\\" by Peter Branscombe in Grove Music Online Franz Schubert wrote the lied \\"Der Hirt auf dem Felsen\\", D. 965, for Milder-Hauptmann which she premiered in Riga on 10 February 1830 and later that year also sang in Berlin. Milder had previously premiered Schubert's song \\"Die Forelle\\" and he had in 1824 dedicated the lied \\"Suleika II\\", D. 717, to her; the role of Estrella in his opera Alfonso und Estrella was designed for her, but the opera was never performed during Schubert's lifetime.\\"Alfonso und Estrella.\\" by Elizabeth Norman McKay in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, edited by Stanley Sadie The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (XVI, 1814, col. 315) wrote: \\"Happy those for whom works are written!\\" (\\"Wohl denen, f√ºr die eigens componiert wird!\\").

Oxford, Oxford University Press , pp. 183 (religion), 202, 204‚Äì8. Like other Iron Age Europeans, the early Celts maintained a polytheistic mythology and religious structure. For Celts in close contact with Ancient Rome, such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, their mythology did not survive the Roman Empire, their subsequent conversion to Christianity and the loss of their Celtic languages. It is mostly through contemporary Roman and Christian sources that their mythology has been preserved. The Celtic peoples who maintained either political or linguistic identities (such as the Gaels in Ireland and Scotland, the Welsh in Wales, and the Celtic Britons of southern Great Britain and Brittany) left vestigial remnants of their ancestral mythologies that were put into written form during the Middle Ages. Overview The Celtic god Sucellus Although the Celtic world at its height covered much of western and central Europe, it was not politically unified nor was there any substantial central source of cultural influence or homogeneity; as a result, there was a great deal of variation in local practices of Celtic religion (although certain motifs, for example the god Lugh, appear to have diffused throughout the Celtic world). Inscriptions of more than three hundred deities, often equated with their Roman counterparts, have survived, but of these most appear to have been genii locorum, local or tribal gods, and few were widely worshiped. However, from what has survived of Celtic mythology, it is possible to discern commonalities which hint at a more unified pantheon than is often given credit. The nature and functions of these ancient gods can be deduced from their names, the location of their inscriptions, their iconography, the Roman gods they are equated with, and similar figures from later bodies of Celtic mythology. Celtic mythology is found in a number of distinct, if related, subgroups, largely corresponding to the branches of the Celtic languages: * Ancient Celtic religion (known primarily through archaeological sources rather than through written mythology) * mythology in Goidelic languages, represented chiefly by Irish mythology (also shared with Scottish Gaelic mythology) ** Mythological Cycle ** Ulster Cycle ** Fenian Cycle ** Cycles of the Kings * mythology in Brittonic languages **Welsh mythology **Cornish mythology **Breton mythology Historical sources Votive Celtic wheels thought to correspond to the cult of Taranis. Thousands of such wheels have been found in sanctuaries in Gallia Belgica, dating from 50 BCE to 50 CE. National Archaeological Museum, France As a result of the scarcity of surviving materials bearing written Gaulish, it is surmised that the most of the Celtic writings were destroyed by the Romans, although a written form of Gaulish using Greek, Latin and North Italic alphabets was used (as evidenced by votive items bearing inscriptions in Gaulish and the Coligny calendar). Julius Caesar attests to the literacy of the Gauls, but also wrote that their priests, the druids, were forbidden to use writing to record certain verses of religious significance (Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 6.14) while also noting that the Helvetii had a written census (Caesar, De Bello Gallico 1.29). Rome introduced a more widespread habit of public inscriptions, and broke the power of the druids in the areas it conquered; in fact, most inscriptions to deities discovered in Gaul (modern France and Northern Italy), Britain and other formerly (or presently) Celtic-speaking areas post-date the Roman conquest. Although early Gaels in Ireland and parts of modern Wales used the Ogham script to record short inscriptions (largely personal names), more sophisticated literacy was not introduced to Celtic areas that had not been conquered by Rome until the advent of Christianity. Indeed, many Gaelic myths were first recorded by Christian monks, albeit without most of their original religious meanings. Irish mythology Cuchulainn carries Ferdiad across the river The oldest body of myths stemming from the Heroic Age is found only from the early medieval period of Ireland. As Christianity began to take over, the gods and goddesses were slowly eliminated as such from the culture. What has survived includes material dealing with the Tuatha D√© Danann and the Fomorians, which forms the basis for the text Cath Maige Tuired \\"The Battle of Mag Tuireadh\\", as well as portions of the history-focused Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (\\"The Book of Invasions\\"). The Tuatha D√© represent the functions of human society such as kingship, crafts and war, while the Fomorians represent chaos and wild nature. =The Dagda= The leader of the gods for the Irish pantheon appears to have been the Dagda. The Dagda was the figure on which male humans and other gods were based because he embodied ideal Irish traits. Celtic gods were also considered to be a clan due to their lack of specialization and unknown origins. The particular character of the Dagda was as a figure of burlesque lampoonery in Irish mythology, and some authors even conclude that he was trusted to be benevolent enough to tolerate jokes at his own expense. Irish tales depict the Dagda as a figure of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the chalky soil. While this was probably produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long thought to be a representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show that there may have been a representation of what looks like a large drapery hanging from the horizontal arm of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup. =The Morr√≠gan= The Morr√≠gan was a tripartite battle goddess of the Celts of Ancient Ireland. She was known as the Morr√≠gan, but the different sections she was divided into were also referred to as Nemain, Macha, and Badb (among other, less common names), with each representing different aspects of combat. She is most commonly known for her involvement in the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge. =Lugh/Lug= Lugh's Magic Spear; illustration by H. R. Millar The god appearing most frequently in the tales is Lugh. He is evidently a residual of the earlier, more widespread god Lugus, whose diffusion in Celtic religion is apparent from the number of place names in which his name appears, occurring across the Celtic world. The most famous of these are the cities of Lugdunum (the modern French city of Lyon), Lugdunum Batavorum (Brittenburg, 10 kilometers west of Leiden in the Netherlands) and Lucus Augusti (, the modern Galician city of Lugo). Lug is described in the Celtic myths as the last to be added to the list of deities. In Ireland a festival called the Lughnasadh ( \\"August\\") was held in his honor. =Others= Other important goddesses include Brigid (or Brigit), the Dagda's daughter; Aibell, √Åine, Macha, and the sovereign goddess, √âriu. Notable is Epona, the horse goddess, celebrated with horse races at the summer festival. Significant Irish gods include Nuada Airgetl√°m, the first king of the Tuatha D√© Danann; Goibniu, the smith and brewer; Dian Cecht, the patron of healing; and the sea god Manann√°n mac Lir. Welsh mythology An illustration of Ll≈∑r and the swans by H. R. Millar Less is known about the pre-Christian mythologies of Britain than those of Ireland. Important reflexes of British mythology appear in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, especially in the names of several characters, such as Rhiannon, Teyrnon, and Br√¢n the Blessed (Bendigeidfran, \\"Bran [Crow] the Blessed\\"). Other characters, in all likelihood, derive from mythological sources, and various episodes, such as the appearance of Arawn, a king of the Otherworld seeking the aid of a mortal in his own feuds, and the tale of the hero who cannot be killed except under seemingly contradictory circumstances, can be traced throughout Indo-European myth and legend. The children of Ll≈∑r (\\"Sea\\" = Irish Ler) in the Second and Third Branches, and the children of D√¥n (Danu in Irish and earlier Indo-European tradition) in the Fourth Branch are major figures, but the tales themselves are not primary mythology. While further mythological names and references appear elsewhere in Welsh narrative and tradition, especially in the tale of Culhwch and Olwen, where we find, for example, Mabon ap Modron (\\"Divine Son of the Divine Mother\\"), and in the collected Welsh Triads, not enough is known of the British mythological background to reconstruct either a narrative of creation or a coherent pantheon of British deities. Indeed, though there is much in common with Irish myth, there may have been no unified British mythological tradition per se. Whatever its ultimate origins, the surviving material has been put to good use in the service of literary masterpieces that address the cultural concerns of Wales in the early and later Middle Ages. Remnants of Gaulish and other mythology Taranis (with Celtic wheel and thunderbolt), Le Chatelet, Gourzon, Haute-Marne, France The Celts also worshiped a number of deities of which little more is known than their names. Classical writers preserve a few fragments of legends or myths that may possibly be Celtic. According to the Syrian rhetorician Lucian, Ogmios was supposed to lead a band of men chained by their ears to his tongue as a symbol of the strength of his eloquence. The first-century Roman poet Lucan mentions the gods Taranis, Teutates and Esus, but there is little Celtic evidence that these were important deities. A number of objets d'art, coins, and altars may depict scenes from lost myths, such as the representations of Tarvos Trigaranus or of an equestrian ‚ÄòJupiter‚Äô surmounting the Anguiped (a snake-legged human-like figure). The Gundestrup cauldron has been also interpreted mythically. Along with dedications giving us god names, there are also deity representations to which no name has yet been attached. Among these are images of a three-headed or three-faced god, a squatting god, a god with a snake, a god with a wheel, and a horseman with a kneeling giant. Some of these images can be found in Late Bronze Age peat bogs in Britain, indicating the symbols were both pre-Roman and widely spread across Celtic culture. The distribution of some of the images has been mapped and shows a pattern of central concentration of an image along with a wide scatter indicating these images were most likely attached to specific tribes and were distributed from some central point of tribal concentration outward along lines of trade. The image of the three-headed god has a central concentration among the Belgae, between the Oise, Marne and Moselle rivers. The horseman with the kneeling giant is centered on either side of the Rhine. These examples seem to indicate regional preferences of a common image stock. =Julius Caesar on Celtic gods and their significance= Golden Celtic wheel with symbols, Balesme, Haute-Marne. National Archaeological Museum The classic entry about the Celtic gods of Gaul is by Julius Caesar's history of his war in Gaul. In this he names the five principal gods worshiped in Gaul (according to the practice of his time, he gives the names of the closest equivalent Roman gods) and describes their roles: Mercury was the most venerated of all the deities and numerous representations of him were to be discovered. Mercury was seen as the originator of all the arts (and is often taken to refer to Lugus for this reason), the supporter of adventurers and of traders, and the mightiest power concerning trade and profit. Next the Gauls revered Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Among these divinities Caesar described the Celts as holding roughly equal views as did other populations: Apollo dispels sickness, Minerva encourages skills, Jupiter governs the skies, and Mars influences warfare. MacBain argues that Apollo corresponds to Irish Lugh, Mercury to Manannan mac Lir, Jupiter to the Dagda, Mars to Neit, and Minerva to Brigit. In addition to these five, Caesar mentions that the Gauls traced their ancestry to Dƒ´s Pater (possibly Irish Donn).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Tranquility Grange Hall stands on the south side of Maine State Route 52, about one mile northeast of Lincolnville Center. It stands on a sloping lot, presenting a single story to the street, and a fully exposed basement to the side and rear. It is topped by a hip roof with a front-facing hipped dormer, and its walls are clad in wooden shingles. The front is symmetrical, with a recessed entrance in the center and paired sash windows to either side, each grouping topped by an entablature and shallow cornice. There are narrow corner boards at the building corners, rising to a broad entablature that extends to the sides. The interior of the main floor has an entrance vestibule, cloakroom, and a small kitchen at the front, with the main hall taking up most of the rear. It has a stage at the far end, and has hardwood flooring and wainscoting, with the upper walls and ceiling finished in pressed tin. The downstairs has the dining room, a larger kitchen, and restrooms. Access to the lower level is gained by either stairs beside the stage, or via a secondary entrance on the exposed west side of the building. The Grange hall was built in 1908, and was the third built by the organization, which was founded in 1898. The first two halls were both destroyed by fire, and this one was built on the site of the second one. The building has, since its construction, been a civic and social meeting point for the rural community, and played host to its town meetings until the 1950s.

A radical feminist, Dines specializes in the study of pornography. Described in 2010 as the world's leading anti-pornography campaigner, she is a founding member of Stop Porn Culture and founder of Culture Reframed, created to address pornography as a public-health crisis. Dines is co-author of Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality (1997) and author of Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality (2010). Dines writes that boys and men are exposed online to pornography that is increasingly cruel and violent toward women; she argues that pornography is \\"the perfect propaganda piece for patriarchy\\". The exposure of teenage girls to the images affects their sense of sexual identity, with the result, Dines writes, that women are \\"held captive\\" by images that lie about them. Femininity is reduced to the \\"hypersexualized, young, thin, toned, hairless, and, in many cases, surgically enhanced woman with a come-hither look on her face\\".Dines, Gail (2010). Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality, Boston: Beacon Press, p. 102. Early life and education Dines was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Manchester, England, and attended King David School. When she was 18, after reading Robin Morgan's book Sisterhood is Powerful (1970), she abandoned Orthodox Judaism and became a radical feminist, later calling her relationship to feminism \\"a passionate love affair\\".Dines, Gail (2005). \\"This Sisterhood is Powerful\\". The Workmen's Circle. She spoke in 2011 about the appeal of radical feminism: \\"After teaching women for 20-odd years, if I go in and I teach liberal feminism, I get looked [at] blank ... I go in and teach radical feminism, bang, the room explodes. ... I remember what happened to me the first time I read radical feminism. I remember thinking: 'I have been waiting for this my entire life, and I didn't even know I was waiting for it.\\"Also see She obtained her BSc from Salford University, where she met her husband, David Levy, who was studying at the University of Manchester.Aucoin, Don (27 July 2010). \\"The Shaping of Things\\", The Boston Globe. She embraced Marxism but became disillusioned with the British left when the students' unions voted to support that Zionism is racism, following United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which meant Jewish student groups were denied funding. The atmosphere in the UK led to increased antisemitism. Swastikas were painted on Jewish homes; in a pub with Jewish friends, Dines heard a nearby group say they could \\"smell gas\\". As a result, in 1980 when she was 22, Dines and Levy moved to Israel. While there she co-founded a feminist group, Isha L'isha (\\"Woman to Woman\\"), which described itself in 2018 as \\"the oldest grassroots feminist organization in Israel\\",\\"Isha L‚ÄôIsha‚ÄîHaifa Feminist Center\\", isha2isha.com. and engaged in research at the University of Haifa into violence against women. She started her PhD thesis while volunteering in a rape crisis centre, after encountering pornography during a meeting in Haifa arranged by Women Against Pornography. The following day, she told her thesis advisor she wanted to write her dissertation on pornography: \\"I literally couldn't believe the images. I couldn't believe that men created such images, and that other men wanted to watch them.\\" The couple had a son, who was born while Levy was in Lebanon with the Israel Defence Forces, although both he and Dines opposed the war in Lebanon.

Career and research Dines worked at Wheelock College in Boston from 1986 for around 30 years; she became professor of sociology and women's studies there and chair of its American studies department.

The author of two books, including Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked our Sexuality (2010), Dines has also written for a variety of journals and newspapers, including The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, and The Guardian. She is a founding member of Stop Porn Culture, co-founder of the National Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement, and founder of Culture Reframed, which aims to have pornography recognized as a public-health crisis. Dines's view of pornography is that it distorts men's view of sexuality, and makes it more difficult for them to establish intimate relationships with women. The violence and cruelty found in modern pornography is unlike earlier forms of soft-core pornography with which the general public may be familiar, Dines writes, and it degrades the position of women in society. She also views the prevalence of hardcore pornography as a contributing factor in increasing \\"demand\\" for sex trafficking. Dines speaking at the Cambridge Union, 2 February 2011, from 00:11:57. In February 2011, Dines was invited, with fellow anti-pornography activist Shelley Lubben, to debate Anna Span, a pornographic film director, at the Cambridge Union, when it proposed the motion: \\"This house believes that pornography does a good public service.\\" Dines did not sway the house, which decided 231 in favour to 187 against, with 197 abstentions. Dines said her opponents won because the chamber consisted mostly of \\"18‚Äì22 year old males who are using pornography on a regular basis\\". Dines expressed opposition to the academic journal Porn Studies when it was founded, arguing that the \\"editors come from a pro-porn background where they deny the tons and tons of research that has been done into the negative effects of porn,\\" and that they're \\"cheerleaders\\" for the porn industry. =Reception= Dines' book Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked our Sexuality (2010) received mixed reviews, with some critics citing what they saw as her use of inflammatory language. Her writing has been criticized by other academics, including Ronald Weitzer of George Washington University. In an essay, \\"Pornography: the need for solid evidence\\" (2011), Weitzer alleged that Dines' work (specifically Pornland) is poorly researched and in strong opposition to the existing body of research on pornography. In \\"A Feminist Response to Weitzer\\" in the same journal, Dines wrote that her book had used theories and methods of cultural studies developed by, among others, Stuart Hall and Antonio Gramsci. Also in 2011, after Dines wrote about the porn industry in The Guardian,Dines, Gail (4 January 2011). \\"Porn: a multibillion- dollar industry that renders all authentic desire plastic\\". The Guardian. Lynn Comella, women's studies professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, accused her of failing \\"to address counterevidence\\". In 2007, Dines wrote an article on the Duke lacrosse case in which she suggested \\"we should put some of the focus back on the men in this case\\". Writer Cathy Young criticised what she saw as Dines' double-standards, stating \\"the same feminists who rightly tell us that a rape victim should not have to be an angel to deserve support apply such a different standard to men who may be falsely accused of rape\\". Lawsuit In 2016, Dines and two other Jewish professors filed discrimination complaints against Wheelock College with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in relation to claims that the college's diversity efforts were not inclusive enough of Jewish students.Krantz, Laura (15 February 2016). \\"Professors file complaints claiming bias at Wheelock\\".

Early life and family Bowman was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the son of Samuel Bowman, a captain in the Continental Army, and his wife, Eleanor Ledlie.Bond, 699 He was educated at the Academy of Wilkes-Barre and, while he was initially inclined toward the practice of law, Bowman soon changed his studies toward the church.Mombert, 390 His theological instruction was conducted by Bishop William White.Perry, 137 White ordained Bowman deacon in 1823, and he was ordained priest the following year, also by White. After his ordination to the priesthood, Bowman took charge of two parishes in Lancaster County.Batterson, 185 In 1825, he became rector of Trinity Church in Easton, Pennsylvania. He returned to Lancaster in 1827 to serve at St. James Church in that town, assisting the rector there until his death in 1830, at which time Bowman became rector. While there, Bowman earned a doctorate in divinity from his Geneva College (now Hobart and William Smith Colleges). Bowman married twice. He was first married to Susan Sitgreaves of Easton, with whom he had three children, one of whom died young. His son, Samuel Sitgreaves Bowman, graduated from Yale University in 1845 and studied law in Philadelphia, but died unmarried, predeceasing his father in 1848. Bowman's daughter, Ellen Ledlie Bowman, survived her father and died in 1894 in Topeka, Kansas, having married Thomas H. Vail, the Episcopal Bishop of Kansas, in 1867.Thompson-Stahr, 475 After Susan died in 1831, Bowman remarried to Harriet Clarkson, the daughter of the previous rector of St. James, Lancaster. Bowman's brother, Alexander Hamilton Bowman, was Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York during the American Civil War. Coadjutor bishop In 1845, the clergy elected him Bishop of Pennsylvania, but when the laity refused to concur, Bowman acquiesced in the nomination of Alonzo Potter, who was eventually chosen. In 1847, Bowman was elected Bishop of Indiana, but he declined the appointment, preferring to remain in Lancaster. Bowman was consecrated a suffragan Bishop of Pennsylvania in 1858, and this appointment he accepted. He was the 64th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated in Christ Church, Philadelphia, by Bishops Jackson Kemper, William Heathcote DeLancey, and Alfred Lee. Bowman threw himself immediately into his work, but his episcopate was brief. While visiting the western part of Pennsylvania in 1861 on the Allegheny Valley Railroad, a landslide wrecked a railroad bridge, causing the passengers, including Bowman, to walk several miles. Bowman lingered behind, and was later found dead along the tracks, either of apoplexy or a heart attack. He was buried in St. James churchyard in Lancaster.

It is part of the Berlin State Museums, and is located in the Kulturforum on Potsdamer Platz. It is the largest museum of graphic art in Germany,Museum of Prints and Drawings with more than 500,000 prints and around 110,000 individual works on paper (drawings, pastels, watercolours, oil sketches).Kupferstichkabinett und Kunstbibliothek Kulturforum. History The Kupferstichkabinett was officially founded in 1831, with a collection of drawings and watercolours acquired by Frederick William I in 1652 at its core.Kupferstichkabinett State of Berlin. It was first housed in the Altes Museum beside the collections of Old Master paintings and Classical sculpture from ancient Greece and Rome, as exemplars of \\"High Art\\". The collection grew throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with the addition of Medieval, Renaissance and later works, including drawings by Albrecht D√ºrer and Matthias Gr√ºnewald, Sandro Botticelli's illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy (purchased in 1882), and the estate of Adolph Menzel. Prominent members of former staff include Max Lehrs. In 1986 the Kupferstichkabinett took over the graphics collection of the National Gallery of Berlin, whose emphasis was on 20th-century prints, including Expressionist works that the Nazis had classified as \\"degenerate\\" and confiscated. In 1994 it opened in a new building in the Kulturforum, reuniting the parts of the collection that had been split between East and West Berlin together with the National Gallery's collection. Collection Drawing by Matthias Gr√ºnewald in the Kupferstichkabinett. The emphasis is on European drawings and printed graphics from the Middle Ages to the present, as well as illuminated manuscripts, sketchbooks, topographical drawings and printing plates. The older artists include D√ºrer, Gr√ºnewald, Botticelli and Menzel, as well as Altdorfer, Bosch, Bruegel, Chodowiecki, Friedrich, Mantegna, Rembrandt, Schinkel, and Tiepolo. More recent artists include Kirchner, Munch and Picasso, Pop Artists (Warhol, Hamilton, Johns, Stella) conceptual artists, minimalists, and contemporary artists working in Berlin. Some of the works on paper are stored in other Berlin collections that have a relevant theme, such as the Ethnological and Asian Art Museums, the Art Library, and the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection. The works in the Kupferstichkabinett cannot be permanently displayed, due to the size of the collection and the air- and light-sensitivity of works on paper; however, the museum holds regular temporary exhibitions. Other activities The Kupferstichkabinett carries out research and conservation activities and has its own Conservation Advisory Council. Particular candidates for preservation include the bound handwritten works from the Middle Ages and Renaissance, large 19th-century cartoons (e.g. by Peter von Cornelius), and technically complex contemporary works. Other subjects of research include silverpoint drawings and drawings by Gr√ºnewald. There is also a continually updated index of watermarks to assist in the dating of works on paper.Collection - Conservation  See also  *Divine Comedy illustrated by Botticelli Notes Further reading *Alexander D√ºckers (editor): Das Berliner Kupferstichkabinett.

A stand-alone sequel to Cronos (1993), the film is about a family who, after the death of the father, try to continue on with a disturbing, ritualistic tradition. The film stars Paulina Gait√°n and Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho, the latter of whom reprises his role from Cronos. Plot In the opening scene, the father dies on the sidewalk at a local shopping mall. At home, his family is wondering what has become of him. Dad is a watchmaker who repairs watches at the local street market, and the family's sole means of support. As Dad has not appeared for the day's work, Alfredo and Juli√°n head to the market. Juli√°n gets into a fight with a customer who claims that his watch is three weeks overdue. The woman who runs the market appears and tells the boys to get out; the rent for their booth at the market is three weeks in arrears. When the boys arrive at home, their sister Sabina enters in a state of shock and announces that their father has died. Their mother, Patricia, locks herself in her room; the children wonder who is going to provide for the family now‚Äîspecifically, their meals: this family performs cannibalistic rituals. In a local morgue, Tito the coroner and the director of the funeral home bring in Octavio and Owen, two police detectives. The coroner shows them a finger in a jar: it was pulled from Dad's stomach. The detectives are asked to solve this cold case. Initially, they resist, but as the film continues, they become more interested in the fame that will come with solving it. Alfredo and Juli√°n attempt to kidnap a homeless child from under a local bridge, but are chased off by the other children. Next, they attempt to kidnap a prostitute, who also resists; Juli√°n punches and stuffs her into the back seat of their car. Back at home, the boys tie the prostitute to the kitchen table. Patricia comes in and beats the woman to death with a shovel, claiming that Alfredo doesn't know what he's doing, and that prostitutes are not appropriate for the ritual. Alfredo runs out while Juli√°n and Sabina wrap the dead woman in a sheet. Juli√°n and Patricia take the prostitute back to the corner where the boys picked her up and dump her in front of the other street workers. Patricia tells the women to leave her sons alone. The prostitutes report the incident to detectives Octavio and Owen. Alfredo goes looking for another potential meal; he finds one in a gay bar. Alfredo brings the young man home with him, but Juli√°n says he won't eat a homosexual. As Alfredo and Juli√°n argue the point, an older man comes down from their mother's room. Alfredo's prey escapes while Patricia beats the older man over the head with a shovel and the family later kills him. As Sabina and Patricia prepare the man for eating, Alfredo and Juli√°n chase after the gay boy. The boy runs to a fast food stand and asks the police to protect him. Detectives Octavio and Owen hear the call over their police radio and head to the scene. They decline to call for backup, as they want to keep the glory of the collar for themselves. Detective Octavio stops Alfredo and Juli√°n in an alley, but is shot by a beat cop who mistakes Octavio for one of the cannibals. Detective Owen discovers Sabina and Patricia preparing their meal in a ritualistic fashion, but the women kill him. Alfredo and Juli√°n arrive home; Patricia insists on completing the ritual, but Alfredo drags her away to escape over the rooftops. The police break into the family's home and Juli√°n shoots several of them before the family manages to hide upstairs. Their mother says that one must survive to carry on the ritual and flees to the rooftop. The prostitutes earlier in the film see her escaping and pursue her. Meanwhile, Alfredo bites Sabina's neck. Juli√°n, thinking Alfredo's attempting to eat Sabina, shoots Alfredo. The police kill Juli√°n and take Sabina away in an ambulance, believing that she is a surviving victim. The next morning Patricia's body is discovered in a playground, beaten to death. At the end of the film, Sabina escapes from the hospital and is seen watching a young man in the local market, intent on her next meal.

The church was built of limestone and malmstone rubble in the 12th century, but has undergone several major refurbishments since.

At twelve years of age he was student number eleven on the handwritten roll.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Sydney, 1999) pp121 According to the second Headmaster of the school, Thomas Johnstone, Love was \\"one of the best conducted, most perseveringly diligent, and most thoroughly amiable pupils that I have ever taught.‚Äô\\" He left Newington in September 1866 \\"in consequence of business depression\\".Newington News Spring 2013 Retrieved 19 February 2014.

He was Grand Prince of Tver from February 10, 1461 to 1485. He married Sophia Olelkovich, princess of Slutsk of Lithuanian originhttp://www.genealogia.okiem.pl/gastold.htm in 1471 (d. February 6, 1483), then a granddaughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon, and eventually lost the title when Ivan III of Moscow conquered Tver in 1485. Ivan the Younger, son of Ivan III the Great, is by some sources counted as prince of Tver from 1485 to 1490, but may have been without real ruling power.http://www.jmarcussen.dk/historie/reference/rusland.html#tver  The Fall of Tver  Death of princess of Tver, wife of Michael III The prominent Russian historian Nikolay Karamzin described the Principality of Tver in the middle of the 15th century as a state, equal to Moscow in glory and rights. Though it was already surrounded by Muscovy lands, it still has its independence. As far back as in 1427 Mikhail's father Boris I of Tver tried to unite forces with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but after the death of Vytautas the feudal wars weakened Lithuania and thus gave no power against Moscow. In 1463 Ivan III conquered the Principality of Yaroslavl, in 1478 he annexed Novgorod, so Lithuania remained the only possible ally of Tver against Moscow. Widowed in 1483, Mikhail III tried to marry the granddaughter of Lithuanian ruler Casimir IV Jagiellon. Ivan III used this move as a reason to declare war to Tver. In 1485 Mikhail III \\"acknowledged himself as a lesser brother\\" and signed a peace treaty, sworn to fight on side of Moscow in any wars. The treaty also restricted Tver diplomatic relations and freedom. The Muscovites oppressed the boyars of Tver, but all the disputes Ivan III settled to the good of Muscovites. Seeing Mikhail's inability to protect them, many Tver noblemen swore allegiance to Moscow. Mikhail decided to flee to Lithuania, but the messenger with his private letter to king Kazimir was stopped by Ivan's people. The letter broke earlier treaty and was considered treason. Mikhail sent Tver's archbishop to Ivan III with apologies, but they weren't accepted. On the 21st of August, 1485, Ivan III moved his army to Tver. On the 8th of September he seized the city and set fire to the posad. In 10 days all the boyars and noblemen fled, leaving Mikhail alone. He has only two opportunities left - to flee to Lithuania or to yield to Ivan's mercy. Mikhail decided to escape, on the next morning the only left noblemen archbishop Vassian and prince Mikhail Khomsky opened the city gates to Ivan III, acknowledging him as the monarch of all Rus'.  The Exile  Mikhail of Tver went to exile to Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, trying to regain the throne of Tver. In Krak√≥w he asked for help of King Kazimir, but he refused and even sent a message to Ivan III, stating no intentions to interfere. However, Kazimir gave Mikhail two small estates (in Slonim and Volhynia).http://www.azpolonia.com/index.php?sitelg=pl&p;=article&aid;=404  Marriages and Children  Mikhail's first wife Sophia (died 1483) was the daughter of Simeon Olelkovich, the last prince of Kiev. His second wife was the granddaughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon. Neither marriage had sons, so after the death of Mikhail III ended the line of Princes of Tver.

The mine is located in Richland Township, in Aurora in Beaufort County, North Carolina. The mine which is owned since 1995 by PotashCorp, the world's largest potash producer and the second and third largest producer of nitrogen and phosphate, has an annual production capacity of over six million tonnes of phosphate ore. In 2008 the mine produced 6.6 million tonnes of phosphate ore from which 1.3 million tonnes of phosphoric acid was produced. History The phosphates of the Aurora mine are the result of a recession experienced by the sea coast of Aurora. Phosphates were deposited into the sea about 15 million years ago. The result was a phosphate ore zone with of low- grade phosphate sand blanketed by sand silt. The ore zone is estimated to be about thick, consisting of phosphate sand, fine quartz, clay and silt. PotashCorp bought the Aurora mine in 1995 from the Texasgulf company as its first phosphate operation, and purchased the agricultural products division of Occidental Chemicals six months later. As of 2005 the Aurora mine had estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 356 million tonnes of phosphate rock at an average grade of 30.7% P2O5. PotashCorp has rights to exploit an area of of phosphate-bearing reserves, sufficient to support the mines operations for around 75 years. In 2009 the mine produced 4.2 million tonnes of phosphate rock and 0.93 million tonnes of phosphoric acid and had a number of 1,093 employees. In June 2009, PotashCorp received permission from the US Army Corps of Engineers to mine reserves within the extraterritorial jurisdiction boundaries for a period of 30 years. The phosphate rock is transported by waterway to the deep water port of Morehead City and a railroad links the mining complex to the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation rail networks.

It stars Stephen Quadros and Traci Lords in one of her first post-adult film roles. The film is a thriller with a music comedy twist, a self-aware take on metal guitarists from the 80's, and is also notable for featuring Nitro guitarist Michael Angelo Batio as a guitar double. It was Aldo Ray's last film.  Synopsis Angel Martin (Stephen Quadros) has just made the deal of a lifetime. Fame, fortune and beautiful women will all be his - for a price. To become a rock star Martin must give his soul, and to survive he must feed on the souls of others. But Angel wants to possess more than just the soul of the woman of his dreams. Lindsay Roberts (Traci Lords) is the manager of a rising rock band that has a talented new band member. When Angel Martin joined the band she suddenly had her hands full with concerts, contracts --and private meetings with Angel. But success isn't the only new thing in her life: their recent concerts have been marred by a series of brutal killings, which remain unsolved. As Angel lures Lindsay further into his dark mysterious world, the lines are drawn for a terrifying black magic battle against the ultimate evil.

Supplementary solos were pre-recorded and performed live on film by David Celentano. The band cues (except for Purple Haze) were written by Mark Freed and Robert Decker. There was no back-up guitar on the recorded tracks or rhythm guitarist in the film. The lead vocalist on the band tracks is Rick Livingston. = Michael Angelo Batio's participation = 1990 Studio Soundtrack Session Director Mark Freed recalled: \\"When we finished writing the script, it was obvious that the movie was going to need more than just an average guitar player to emulate the role of Angel Martin. This ‚Äòcharacter double‚Äô needed to be a heavy metal, highly skillful guitar player with a dynamic stage presence. The producers and myself agreed that the best man for the job would be Michael Angelo Batio. Two years earlier, I produced Michael in a Star Licks Productions instructional guitar video ‚Äì hence, I knew of his incredible style and technique\\". \\"I called Michael to see if he'd be interested in reading the script; he said his schedule was busy but he‚Äôd make time for it. Soon afterwards, he said he‚Äôd love to get involved ‚Äì e.g., doubling the guitar shots on film, playing the role of the demon in Martin's dream sequence and overdubbing the guitar tracks for the film‚Äôs concert scenes in advance of principal photography\\". \\"Many fans have asked me if Michael's guitar parts were sped up in the film. The answer is no, what you see in the film is in fact Michael playing with no special effects\\". Producer Robert Decker also recalled: \\"I recorded the band tracks in my Santa Monica studio utilizing a Korg 01/W workstation, Emax 8-bit sampler, and a Roland R-8 rhythm composer ‚Äì recorded on a Otari MX one-inch 16-track\\". \\"For the session, Michael showed up with a Dean, twin-necked guitar, which I plugged into a Rockman then direct into the board. Preferring a bit more distortion, I patched in a stomp box that Michael brought as well. I don‚Äôt believe that he had heard the band tracks prior to the session ‚Äì so, as a result, Michael took time to work out the main solo and harmony on a single-neck but would refer to the double-neck to verify that the two parts could be performed in a dual- necked fashion. In our quest to get precision solos in one short studio evening, Michael performed his parts on a single-neck for instant accuracy. Overdubs were added for a fatter sound\\".

It received protection as a Registered Tangible Cultural Property in 2017. History The Shiriyazaki Lighthouse was one of the 26 lighthouses built in Meiji period Japan by British engineer Richard Henry Brunton. The lighthouse was completed on October 20, 1876 (after Brunton had departed from Japan), and was the first western-style lighthouse in the T≈çhoku region. On November 20, 1877, a fog bell was installed due to the high incidence of fogs and days of poor visibility in the area. This was the first fog bell in Japan, but the sound proved to be too weak, so on December 20, 1879 it was replaced by the first fog horn in Japan.Historical Lighthouses of Japan Other noteworthy events include the installation of the first electric power generator for a lighthouse in Japan in 1901. In 1945, during World War II, Shiriyazaki Lighthouse was bombarded by United States Navy warships, cracking its Fresnel lens and causing severe damage to its structure, killing its attendant. However, the following year, on several occasions, fishermen reported being able to see a light in the ruined lighthouse, which enabled them to land safely despite a deep fog. However, when authorities investigated, they found that the stairs were blocked with rubble and the light room was completely destroyed. A temporary light was installed in the ruined structure from August 1946, and the rumors ceased.Anecdotes related to Aids to Navigation The lighthouse was repaired and went back into operation in 1951.

The AFNet replaces the Indian Air Force's (IAF) old communication network set-up using the tropo-scatter technology of the 1950s making it a true net-centric combat force. The IAF project is part of the overall mission to network all three services, that is The Indian Army, The Indian Navy and The Indian Air Force. The former Defence Minister AK Antony inaugurated the IAF's the AFNET on 14 September 2010 dedicating it to the people of India, for their direct or indirect participation in the communication revolution. Background Armed Forces in India has been using troposcatters as primary means of military communications since the 1950s, thereby occupying huge and expensive 2G and 3G spectrums which otherwise could have been used for expanding and de-clogging the civilian wireless communication network. The rapid expansion of civilian mobile telephony leading to need for larger bandwidth for wireless communication and commercial need to operate the 3G network necessitated the Government of India to have the Indian Armed Forces vacate the spectrum occupied by them. Thus the government of India through Department of Telecommunication (DoT) started a project called \\"Network for Spectrum\\" to set up a fiber optics network for the exclusive use of Indian Armed Forces in exchange for spectrum being released by the Defence Forces. The aim of 'Network for Spectrum' being twofold - to facilitate the growth of national tele-density on the one hand, and ensuring modernization of defence communications with the state-of-the-art communication infrastructure, and to support net-centric military operations. The Department of Telecom and the Ministry of Defence signed the memorandum of understanding for vacating the spectrum and setting up dedicated network for the use of defence forces. In this MoU, DoT agreed to laying of 40,000 route kilometres of optical fibre cable connecting 219 Army stations, 33 Navy stations and 162 points for the Air Force. It further agreed to setting up an exclusive defence band and Defence Interest Zone along 100 km of the international border, where spectrum will be reserved only for use by the Armed Forces. The total cost of implementing \\"Network for Spectrum\\" project is estimated to be 10,000 crores. AFNet is Indian Air Force component of Digital Information Grid under \\"Network for Spectrum\\" project and the AFNet is likely to be extended and connected to the Digital Information Grid Project under implementation for the Indian Navy and the Indian Army by 2015. Project Origin The Air Force Network (AFNet) has been developed by the Indian Air Force at a cost of 1,077 crore in collaboration with HCL Technologies and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.IAF digitizes information network with Afnet It will replace the Air Force's more than half-a-century-old telecom network. This project is part of the defence ministry's initiative to digitize the communication systems of the three armed forces under \\"Network for Spectrum\\" initiative to improve coordination among themselves and other Military and Strategic Institution. IAF was the first to complete this gigabyte digital information grid implemented under the AFNet project. AFnet was inaugurated and dedicated to people of India on 14 September 2010 by the Defence Minister Shri AK Antony in presence of Union Minister of Communication & IT Shri A Raja, Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh, Chief of the Air Staff, Chief of the Army Staff and other officials from the three services and members of the Industry. AFNet will be connected and extended to a Unified Digital Grid encompassing all the legs of Indian Armed Forces. Technology, Design & Structure AFNet incorporates the latest traffic transportation technology in form of IP (Internet Protocol) packets over the network using Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). A large VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) layer with stringent quality of service enforcement will facilitate robust, high quality voice, video and conferencing solutions.IAF's AFNET NCW Backbone Goes Live Next Week Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated command and control system for Air Defence (AD) operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating all ground-based and airborne sensors, AD weapon systems and C2 nodes. Subsequent integration with other services networks and civil radars will provide an integrated Air Situation Picture to operators to carry out Air Defence role. AFNet will prove to be an effective force multiplier for intelligence analysis, mission planning and control, post-mission feedback and related activities like maintenance, logistics and administration. A comprehensive design with multi-layer security precautions for ‚ÄúDefence in Depth‚Äù have been planned by incorporating encryption technologies, Intrusion Prevention Systems to ensure the resistance of the IT system against information manipulation and eavesdropping. The network is secured with a host of advanced state-of-the-art encryption technologies. It is designed for high reliability with redundancy built into the network design itself. The AFNet is also capable of transmitting video from unmanned surveillance aircraft (UAV), pictures from airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) to decision makers on the ground and providing intelligence inputs from remote areas. The AFNet is also expected to facilitate accelerated economic growth by providing radio frequency spectrum for telecommunication purposes. AFNET will be the largest Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network in the defence segment. Demonstration At the AFNet launch, the IAF showcased a practice interception of simulated enemy targets by a pair of Mig-29 fighter aircraft airborne from an advanced airbase in the Punjab sector using the gigabyte digital information grid. During the AFNet-assisted operations, the Indian fighter jets neutralised intruding targets in the western sector, which was played out live on the giant screens at the Air Force auditorium offering a glimpse of the harnessed potential of the system. The final orders for engaging the enemy targets were issued live by Antony, whose queries about how the operation went was responded to by the pilot as \\"excellent\\".Outlook India: IAF Kick Starts AFNET Enabling Network Centric Warfare Various other functionalities contributing towards Network Centric Warfare were also showcased. These consisted of facilitating video from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), pictures from an AWACS aircraft to the decision-makers on ground sitting hundreds of kilometres away, providing intelligence inputs from far- flung areas at central locations seamlessly. This was possible mainly with the robust networking platform provided by AFNet. Integrated Air Command and Control System Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) is an automated command and control system for AD planned by the Indian Air Force. IACCS operations will ride the AFNET backbone integrating all ground-based and airborne sensors, air defense (AD) weapon systems and command and control (C2) nodes. Subsequent integration with other services networks and civil radars will provide an integrated Air Situation Picture to operators to carry out AD role.AFNET to Herald Network Centric Operations in Indian Air Force Through the IACCS, IAF will connect all of its space, air and ground assets quickly, for total awareness of a region. This will offer connectivity for all the ground platforms and airborne platforms, as a part of the network centricity of IAF. The IACCS also facilitates real-time transport of images, data and voice, amongst satellites, aircraft and ground stations.times of India: IAF to get more flying machines  References  Indian Air Force Military equipment of India Military technology Military communications Computer networks ","title":"Air Force Network"},{"id":"28958728","text":"Frank Moore, also known as Tiger Moore, was a leading jockey for four decades and achieved the rider premiership in Western Australia eight times in his career.

He was the Fortune Hunter whose mission it was to plunder the Island of its legendary treasure. He took on the Island Challenges and succeeded, winning all of the treasure. However, he failed in his final escape. The Island, furious over the fact he tried to defeat it, took its revenge and mischievously captured the Fortune Hunter's soul and locked it away in a treasure chest. Now, ten other adventurers from modern time must follow the path that he created, their mission - to escape from Scorpion Island and free the fortune hunters soul. Contestants There are 10 adventurers on the island; 6 from the UK, 4 from Australia. The Australian adventurers are Dilhan, Lizzie, Natty and Peter. =Starting Teams= Girls (Green) (Tree Camp) *Eleanor Yearsley, 11 *Jeremy Koshy, 11 (Captured by the Island on Day 3) (Won back by the Girls on Day 4) *Khadie Fall, 12 *Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Mackinnon, 13 *Natanya \\"Natty\\" Elizabeth, 12 Boys (Navy) (River Camp) *Dilhan Otay, 13 *James Jones, 13 *Jordan Hendy, 11 *Peter Ngo, 12 *Zachary \\"Zach\\" Tong, 12 (Captured by the Island on Day 3) (Won back by the Boys on Day 4) =Final Teams= Sting (Red) (Tree Camp) Winners *Natty (Silver Crab- Won in The Divider & Vampire Bat- Won in the Jig Zag; first team captain of Sting) *Peter (Scorpion- Won in Vanishing Point & Clam- Won in Tower Of Stones) *Jordan (Cactus- Won in Under Fire & Coral Sponge- Won in Hard Wired) *Khadie (Butterfly- Won in Flight of Fear) *Jeremy (Venus Flytrap- Won in Double Crossing) Claw (Yellow) (River Camp) *James (no treasure; first team captain of Claw) *Zach (Silver Eagle- Won in Chasm of Chaos) *Dilhan (Conch Shell- Won in Sinking Swamp) *Lizzie (Silver Pit Viper- Won in Moving Target) *Eleanor (no treasure) Gaming Elements *The Memory Trial - This only happens during Day 2-5 on the island. The first part involves piecing together the broken symbol ring. Whichever two contestants who piece the pieces together in the quickest time proceeds into the next round. Here, the contestants have a set time limit to remember as many symbols as possible. After this time, the adventurers look away, and a puzzle awaits them. It is either identifying the incorrect symbols, finding a symbol which has changed, returning missing symbols and more. If successful, they will have the advantage, which is usually a choice of going first or second. *The Code Cracker - Every day, the fortune hunter attempts to help the teams, but the island is furious, and smashes his symbol ring into pieces. The first part of the challenge is to piece together the parts of the symbol ring, same as part 1 of memory trial. The two contestants who do this in the fastest time get to proceed into the second round. Here, the fortune hunter's symbol ring is placed on a rotating wheel, and the task is to decipher the message that the fortune hunter gives by spinning the symbol ring and aligning a letter with a symbol. If successful, their team receives an advantage. If unsuccessful, the opposing team receives the advantage. *Island Challenge - When the teams were separated into Boys and Girls, the advantage earned from The Memory Trial was used in the Island Challenge. They worked as a team, and they faced each other. After they were separated into Sting and Claw, the advantage from The Code Cracker went to the successful team's captain. In the First Round, the captains face each other and go head to head in a bid to win an advantage for their teammates who play against the other team in the second round. Winning the second round means that one adventurer from the triumphant team receives the latest Island Treasure, and is named the most valuable adventurer on the island for that day. Each day, the adventurers have to face different challenges, and this is the most important one ‚Äì the more Island Treasures the teams win, the bigger advantage they have in the final race to escape from Scorpion Island. *Island Fire - This is where the island communicates with the adventurers. Every night, the teams are summoned to the Island Fire, and everything is revealed there. The Island chooses two Adventurers to captain their teams. Also, the winning team is revealed, and only one adventurer from the winning team gets the island treasure, which is a huge advantage for the teams. The advantage of the island treasure is revealed towards the end of the series. Episodes =Day 1 (Episodes 1 & 2)= *Captains - Zach (Boys) & Lizzie (Girls) *Island Challenge - Chasm of Chaos *Island Treasure - Silver Eagle (Freedom from the island) 10 adventurers made their way to Scorpion Island by Rescue Speed Boats. Once they arrived, they were given the task to pick a bottle with their name on in the sand. Each bottle contained a parchment which had a number 1 or 2 on it, as well as a mysterious symbol. All girls were on team 1, and the boys were on team 2. The symbols on the parchments were going to be important for each Individual Adventurer. Johny then drew a symbol out of a bag, and that was the same symbol that Peter had, and the boys decided to let the Girls do the Island Challenge first. The two teams then chose their captains, Lizzie for the girls and Zach for the boys. Island Challenge - In the heart of the Island, there was a huge ravine with 2 crossings. Lower down was a flimsy bridge which 4 team members will stand holding coloured nets. More than 3 storeys high is a precarious cable, and the captains will have to make their way across this with hoops and monkey bars for balance. Strapped to edge of the wobbly platform are 4 coloured cogs which the captains have to detach one at a time and drop them to the matching coloured net as quickly as possible. If a cog misses a net or otherwise lost, the captain has to go back to the end platform where there are 2 spares of each colour. The team that catches the right cogs in all four of their nets, and then gets their captain to the end the quickest, wins. In the first round of the Island Challenge, captain Lizzie untied the first cog and got herself above Khadie's net. She dropped it, but missed. Lizzie then got the closet cog, which was for Natty and dropped that one, but also missed the net. Lizzie followed Elanor's advice, got another nearby cog and got it in Jeremy's net. Lizzie then went for one of the spare cogs, but as she was untieing one, she knocked off another. As she made her way to the other side of the rope, Lizzie missed Natty's net. Meanwhile, the boys were discussing tactics and realised that they should hold the nets far out from them. Carefully, Lizzie collected another spare cog and got it into Eleanor's net. Using the same method, she got another into Khadie's net. As she had used up all her available cogs, Lizzie got confused and wasted time stopping before taking Eleanor's advice again and made her way back to the starting platform. The girls time was 7:40, and managed three out of four cogs. The Boys team started Chasm of Chaos, and Zach started with the Red Cog straight away, but it missed James's net when the cog got detached from Zach's elbow and bounced off Dilhan's head to the ravine. Zach went straight to the Blue Cog and got it into Peter's net. He then got the Green Cog into Dilhan's net. Zach then collected the Yellow Cog and got it into Jordan's net. Finally, Zach collected another Red Cog to get into James' net, but he missed again. Zach then got the last red cog into James's net. Camps - Both teams went to look at the Fortune Hunter's Base Camps which he used for shelter and protection, made by his own hands. Since then, they have been left untouched. The first camp was Tree Camp hidden in the dense Jungle, where the Fortune Hunter built machines, in which to plunder the Island. Peter liked it but the Girls did not. On the sunny side of the creek there was River Camp with cool hammocks and a luxurious lagoon. This is where the Fortune Hunter devised his master plans against the Island's defences. The Girls liked River Camp but the Boys also liked it and thought it was 100 times better than Tree Camp. Island Fire - The adventurers were then summoned to the Island Fire. The Island revealed the Boys had won and chose Zach as their most valuable member. Zach was awarded the first Island Treasure, the Silver Eagle. Therefore, the Boys were leading 1‚Äì0 in terms of who had the most Island Treasures .Along with this the boys then got to choose which camp they would like and chose River Camp, leaving the Girls with Tree Camp. =Day 2 (Episode 3 & 4)= *Captains - Jordan (Boys) & Jeremy (Girls) *Island challenge - Under fire *Island Treasure - Cactus (Survival from Extreme Conditions) Memory Trial - This is the first time that the memory trial was played on Scorpion Island. First the symbol ring has to be rebuilt. Whichever team manages to build their ring the quickest then moves onto the second stage, the memory trial where they can earn an advantage for the Island Challenge. In total, the symbol ring has 26 symbols. The adventurers have 20 seconds to memorize the ring. They will then be presented a group of symbols, but 3 are not on the symbol ring. If they can correctly identify the 3 rouge symbols, they will get an advantage from the Fortune Hunter in the Island Challenge. In the Memory Trial, both teams start to piece the Fortune Hunter's symbol ring together. Jeremy and Natty were playing for the girls against Jordan and Peter from the Boys. There was not much communication from the Girls, however the Boys communicated well which led them to victory and through to the second round of the trial. In the second round of the trial, Peter and Jordan memorized the symbol ring. There was a lot of communication between the 2 and they managed to gain the Fortune Hunter's advantage. Therefore, the Boys chose the Girls to go first in the island challenge so they could observe the girls and learn from their mistakes. Island challenge - Tumbling off the edge of a lake, in the heart of the Island are the Venom Cascades, 1 member of each team is suspended above the terrifyingly high wall of water, armed with a net. They will have to use this to catch tennis balls launched to them from a mighty cannon, by 2 of their teammates way below. If a ball is caught, the remaining 2 members of the team will have to haul the suspended adventurer as quickly as possible to the side of the Cascades, so they can try to throw the ball into the collection tub. Each team has 10 minutes to do this, and whichever team has the most balls in their tub at the end of their turn, wins. The Girls went first due to the Boys advantage. Jeremy was above the Cascades, Lizzie & Khadie on the ropes, and Eleanor & Natty at the cannon. Lizzie & Khadie put Jeremy into place, but the girls' first shot was way too high, however Eleanor & Natty's second shot counted as they scored into the net and dropped it into the tub. Eleanor & Natty started to miss a lot of throws, wasting precious time. The Girls got their second ball in the net, but unfortunately it bounced off and out of the tub. However they got another one in the net, but again Jeremy threw the ball with to much force and bounced off again, meaning Jeremy hadn't learnt from her last mistake. The Girls got another ball in the net and Jeremy got it in the tub. Then the Girls got 3 more balls into the tub and gave the Girls a final score of 5. The Boys then played 'Under Fire'. Jordan was above the Cascades, Peter & Dilhan on the ropes, and James & Zach at the cannon. The Boys were like the Girls, missing the net & a ball bouncing off the net. However, some balls went in the net and in to the collection tub, matching the Girls score of 5, but the Boys dropped the 5th ball in the tub quicker than the Girls. Island Fire - The Island Fire announced that the overall winner was the Boys and they chose Jordan as their most valuable adventurer. He was therefore awarded the cactus. The Boys now have a total of 2 Island Treasures and the girls have none. =Day 3 (Episode 5 & 6)= *Captains - Khadie (Girls) and Dilhan (Boys) *Island Challenge - Moving Target *Island Treasure - Silver Pit Viper (Danger) Memory Trial - In the memory trial Khadie chose Eleanor and Dilhan chose Jordan. The Boys hade a bit of trouble finding the pieces that go together because Jordan thought the ring was the same as last time, so the girls won for the first time. In the memory trial today they had 20 seconds to memorize the symbols on the ring, they were then shown a board with 6 symbols on it, but only 2 were missing off the ring. The missing symbols were the monkey and the sun. The girls recognized these symbols quickly and put them back onto the ring in the right spots. This won them the fortune hunters advantage. The advantage was to choose to go first or second, they chose second. Island Challenge - In this round colored balls fall down the face of Skeleton Falls every two minutes, at every ball drop one of the suspended adventurers gets raised 1 metre. Another adventurer is on another swing 4 metres away from them throwing the balls into their suspended adventurers net. The other 3 team members are gathering the balls as they drop and putting them into the throwing team members‚Äô bag. The team with the most balls in the net at the end of the game wins. The boys went first due to the girl's advantage, it was James catching the balls, Peter throwing, and Zach, Jordan and Dilhan gathering the balls. The boys started well, but just before the second drop Peter said his arm was getting tired and it showed. As the game went on Peters throwing was getting worse and worse and after the 3rd ball drop he got barely any balls into James‚Äô net. They ended on 37, but because James hit 1 in with his hand they ended on 36. The girls then went with Eleanor catching the balls, Lizzie throwing, and Jeremy, Natty and Khadie gathering the balls. The girls started extremely well with Lizzie getting nearly all of them in and got their score up while they were both at even height. As the game progressed Eleanor motivated her team to keep going by cheering them on and Lizzie showed no signs of tiredness, unlike Peter and at the end of the game it was revealed that she had a strong ball playing background from playing baseball and softball. The girls did great with an end score of 78, more than doubling the boys score. Island Fire - At the island fire, because the girls won they had to choose their most valuable player, they chose Lizzie and she received the silver pit viper. The island decided to unleash a twist into the adventurers' path and it was revealed that the two people who had their symbols vanish from the symbol ring must vanish from their team. It turned out that Jeremy had the sun and Zach had the monkey. Jeremy and Zach stepped away from their teams and the island kidnapped them. =Day 4 (Episode 7 & 8)= *Captains - Eleanor (Girls) and Peter (Boys) *Island Challenge - Vanishing Point *Island Treasure - Scorpion (Devious) Memory Trial - In the Memory Trial Eleanor chose Khadie and Peter chose Jordan. The boys seemed to have a bit of trouble finding the last piece that made it complete so the girls won this challenge again. In the memory trial today they had 20 seconds to memorize the symbols on the ring, they were then shown a board with 5 symbols on it, but only 1 was wrong. Eleanor recognized the wrong symbol and quickly and put them back onto the ring in the right spots. This won them the fortune hunters advantage. The advantage was to choose to go first or second, they chose second. Island Challenge - In this round, two team members are sitting in a trolley balanced on wires five storeys above the ground. They have to pull themselves to the other end of the wires and on their way collect cogs. The remaining two team member then had to winch them back to the other side of the wires where they had to place them onto scales. For every cog they get to the scales lowers their captured team member. They then have to repeat this trying to get all of their cogs onto the scales before time runs out, under 10 minutes, to get their team member back. Whichever team did it the quickest then won the next island treasure. The boys went first due to the girls advantage, it was Jordan and Peter in the trolley and Dilhan and James winching them back. The boys got to their first cog quite quickly and Zach was encouraging them as he wanted to get out of the cage. They got very tired very quickly but pushed on to set a quick final time of 8:07 and won Zach back. The girls then went with Natty and Khadie in the trolley and Lizzie and Eleanor winching them back. The girls also started quickly but kept looking more and more tired. By the end they looked absolutely shattered but they powered on, and with only seconds left on their time they finished and won Jeremy back. Island Fire - At the Island Fire, because the boys put their 5th cog on the scales quicker than the girls the boys won. They then chose Peter as their most valuable team member and he was awarded the scorpion. This brought the Boys Island Treasures to 3 against the girls' 1. Then a twist was unleashed. Myleene said ‚ÄúI can now tell you that the scorpion represents the devious side of the island, he has a vicious, vicious sting and also two claws. Legend has it incidentally that only one team can escape from Scorpion Island, and that team can only be either team Sting or team Claw. So there will no longer be girls against boys, tomorrow you will play a challenge and then the new team captains will choose their teams.\\" =Day 5 (Episode 9 & 10)= *Captains - Natty and James *Island challenge - The Divider *Island Treasure - Silver Crab (Guarded Nature of the Island) Memory Trial - In the Memory Trial, Natty chose Khadie, and James chose Zach. The girls put the symbol ring together before the boys and won the right to play for the advantage. Today they had 10 seconds to memorize the symbols to then identify the one that changes. After arguing about it Natty made the captains decision and chose the sun, it was wrong so the advantage then went to the boys. As the boys won the fortune hunters advantage by default they were quite happy about going into the challenge, the advantage was one extra shot in the next challenge, but for only one person. Island Challenge - For the first time since arriving on the island all adventurers were competing as individuals. In the heart of Scorpion Island a massive target is suspended 7 metres high and the adventurers must launch themselves across to it using a giant rope swing. Each adventurer then has 3 throws at the board trying to get as close as possible using paint filled rocks. But if the rocks don't smash then that throw is not counted, and the adventurer from each team that's gets the closest will become the first captain for either sting or claw. Also out of them two captain winning throws the one who got the closest to the bulls eye wins the next Island Treasure, The Silver Crab. In the first round the girls went with Natty swinging first, and with her third swing she threw her rock with enough force to smash and got it right in the middle. Next was Eleanor but with not enough force as none of her rocks smashed. It was then Lizzie and with her strong ball background was a great contender, but still couldn't beat Natty's best throw. Jeremy was next but didn't manage to get any in the target circle. Last was Khadie but she couldn't beat Natty either, so with no one beating Natty's bulls eye she was awarded captain. Next were the boys and with winning the fortune hunters advantage had to choose one team member to award one extra shot to. They chose Jordan so when it came to his turn he had 4 shots at the target instead of 3. The first adventurer swinging for the boys was James, but his rocks didn't smash even though he threw his rock quite close to the centre of the target. Next was Zach and with his second throw he got quite close to the target centre, he then said to James that he crushed the rocks in his hand so they would easily smash. It was then Peter and with all his rocks smashing he was lucky but none of them were as close as Zach's. Dilhan was next and only threw his rocks near the bottom. Last was Jordan with his 4 shots, but when he was preparing to throw his third rock he put his finger in the rock, and with all his throws barely managed to hit the board. Island Fire - The Island Fire the island decided that because Zach and Jordan crushed their rocks they had an advantage over the others, so only where the rock hit was counted instead of the splats. So with this in play the captains were changed, it should have been Natty and Zach, but it was awarded to Natty and James. And because Natty hit closest, she was awarded the silver crab and choice of teams where she wanted to be Captain of Sting with James awarded Captain of Claw. =Day 6 (Episode 11 & 12)= *Captains - Natty (Sting) & James (Claw) *Island Challenge - Flight of fear *Island Treasure - Silver Butterfly (Change) At yesterday's Island Fire, Natty & James won the honour of being the first team captains, but also had task to choose their teammates due to their position as first captains of Sting and Claw. The Adventurers came up 2 at a time in order of who hit closest to the centre of the target in The Divider(Island Challenge on day 5). Natty had the first choice between Zach & Peter, she struggled but eventually chose Peter meaning that Zach joined James. Then James chose between Dilhan & Jordan, choosing Dilhan so Jordan joined Natty. It was then Natty's choice between Lizzie & Khadie, Natty decided to pick Khadie so Lizzie joined James. James then had the last choice between Eleanor & Jeremy, he struggled and ended up choosing Eleanor meaning that Natty got Jeremy. *Team Sting: Natty (Silver Crab); Peter (Scorpion); Jordan (Cactus); Khadie and Jeremy. *Team Claw: James; Zach (Silver Eagle); Dilhan; Lizzie (Silver Pit Viper) and Eleanor. Sting now has 3 Island Treasures compared to Claws' 2. The adventurers who won treasures while in Boys or Girls took them to their new teams. After the teams were chosen the 2 captains had to decide who got which camp. Both of them wanted the camps where they had been so Sting got Tree camp and Claw got River camp. Code Cracker - Natty chose a familiar member, Khadie while James chose Lizzie. Natty & Khadie had solved the puzzle quicker and went through to the second round. Adventurers will only be given 1 letter that relates to 1 symbol. It is then up to them, to use the rest of the wheel to spell out a message from the Fortune Hunter that contains a 3-digit code. The Adventurers have 5 minutes to work out the message and win an advantage in the First Round of Flight of Fear. Natty was at the ring and Khadie was at the board describing the symbols to Natty. One by one Natty described the symbol to Khadie who told Natty the corresponding letter. Minutes later they swapped positions. Khadie accidentally spun the wheel but she got it back in line. Both of them solved the code 377 from the Fortune Hunters Message \\"First enter one three followed by two sevens\\". Therefore, Sting won a 10-second time advantage in the Island Challenge. Island challenge - In the First Round, the captains will have to climb up the fixed ladders attached to one of the trees, before swinging across to angle cable ladders to collect Giant Cogs. They then have to deliver these cogs into collection tubs at the base of the tree, and the captain who gets all 8 Cogs in their collection tubs first, wins. In the Second Round, one team member will have to climb up an angled cable ladder, collecting Giant Cogs one at a time, before passing them to their teammate who is climbing a matching cable ladder on the other side of the Forest Clearing. To make these passes, they have to swing towards each other. Once the cogs have been passed across, the second team member has to deliver it in the collection tub at the base of their angled ladder. If the Cog hits the ground it is out of play, and if an adventurer completely loses momentum and can not reach either ladder, they will be lowered right back to the ground. Both teams have 8 minutes to deliver as many cogs as possible, and whichever team has the most cogs in their collection tub when the time runs out wins. In the First Round of Flight of Fear, Natty was ahead of James due to Team Sting's 10 second head start. Natty was in the lead for a third of the challenge, but James caught up with and taken the lead. However, James' couldn't reach the cable ladder, meaning Natty was back in the lead, but James finally reaches the cable ladder. James then struggled to keep hold of the cable ladder while trying to untie a cog. Natty then struggled to reach the fixed ladder and James lost momentum and was lowered back down. Natty again can't reach the fixed ladder, pushing James into the lead again, meaning James zoomed down the ladder and threw his cog into the tub, and James won the advantage for Claw in the Second Round. In the Second Round, Claw went first with Lizzie and Zach, and their technique was to get the top cog first. Lizzie & Zach weren't communicating. Zach struggled to pass the first cog to Lizzie, so he threw it and Lizzie missed it. Zach decided to throw the second cog and Lizzie made a successful catch. However Lizzie & Zach weren't listening to the rest of Claw, when they shouted 'Don't throw it!' and the pair decide to keep on throwing the cogs. Another cog was wasted by Team Claw because Zach thrown the cog too early. Lizzie started to struggle after she dropped the second cog into the tub, as her fingers were hurting, and the last cog bounced off the tub. Claw ended up with a total of 2. Next was Sting, and unlike Claw, Khadie & Peter started at the bottom cog. Peter then threw the first cog but Khadie missed and it went between her legs. Peter's next swing was late, however Khadie caught the cog. This streak started to continue before Khadie lost momentum and lowered back down. In last seconds of the challenge, Khadie managed to drop a cog into the cog from a long distance. Sting had 4 cogs at the end of the challenge, doubling Claw's score. Island Fire - In the Island Fire, it was revealed that Sting won, and Sting chose Khadie as their most valuable member. Khadie was awarded the Silver Butterfly. This brought the Island Treasure count to 4‚Äì2 to Sting. =Day 7 (Episode 13 and 14)= *Captains - Jeremy and Eleanor *Island Challenge - Double Crossing *Island Treasure - Venus Flytrap (Trickery of the Island) Code Cracker ‚Äì In the code cracker today, Jeremy chose Khadie and Eleanor chose Dilhan. Today was closer with both teams only having the last piece to place, but sting found it and first and put the ring together quicker than claw. Today they had 5 minutes to crack the code, but with everything going on Jeremy accidentally turns the wheel out of place, luckily Khadie quickly spotted this so none of the letters were written wrong otherwise they would have had the wrong letters and finished with the wrong code. After this little slip up they quickly worked together and ended up with the winning code radar and this won them the fortune hunters advantage. The advantage was for their team captain Jeremy to start with 1 rusty cog already tied on ahead of claws captain Eleanor. Island Challenge ‚Äì In the first round, one captain is on the sturdier platform pounding boulders with cogs tied on them to the other team's captain, who is on the less sturdy platform trying to get all of the rusty cogs off the boulders and to the end to tie them onto the rope. If a captain is knocked off the platform then the other team scores 3 points or if the cog is knocked out of their hands then that cog is out of play and that is 1 less point they can score. Whichever captain gets all of their cogs tied on the rope or as many as they can in the quickest time wins an advantage for their team. In the second round one team must run across the less sturdy platform carrying rusty cogs one at a time while the other team swings boulders at them trying to push them off during the 10-minute time limit. For each cog taken across a point is earned, but if one falls off, the team is deducted 3 points from their total. The team that earns the most points wins the next island treasure. In the first round Eleanor went first and started well. She soon realized that it was harder for Jeremy to knock her off if she crawled along the platform, so she was quite slow to get from one end of the runway to the other but she quickly got the hang of it. She got the cogs easily and quickly and was not shaken by the boulders being thrown at her by Jeremy. After she got the first cog on the rope Jeremy threw a boulder at her and she caught it, so she had 2 rusty cogs on the rope in a very short amount of time. As the game went on Eleanor never looked tired, worked well and finished with over 1 minute to spare. Jeremy then went and started like Eleanor by crawling and started well, but quickly slowed down. When she was taking a rusty cog to the end she did what Eleanor did and caught the boulder thrown on the end which saved her time. By the end she looked tired and was slower than Eleanor but because of the fortune hunters advantage, she had an extra cog tied on already so she won with only seconds left on the clock. So Jeremy won the advantage for team sting in the second round. In the second round, because Jeremy won the advantage she got to choose if team sting ran the cogs or threw the boulders; she chose running the cogs because that was the easiest way to gain points. With everyone from each team playing apart from the captains, everyone wanted to win even more than normal. Sting started well and quickly earned 2 points, then Dilhan threw a boulder at Peter and he lost his balance and went smashing into the water, so the scores were then 2-3. As the game went on sting kept their balance and were going well until Zach hit Jordan right at the very end of the runway, earning claw another 3 points. The score was now 8‚Äì6, so the whole game come down to the last run because if claw knocked Khadie down then they would have 9 points and win the game, but if Khadie was able to run the cog to the other end without getting knocked down then sting would win with 9 points. Khadie succeeded, of course as she is a strong competitor, so sting won 9‚Äì6. Island Fire ‚Äì In the Island Fire, Sting won, because Jeremy was captain and the only person in Sting without an Island Treasure, they all chose her, so Jeremy was awarded with the Venus Flytrap. This helped extend Sting's lead to 5‚Äì2 in terms of Island Treasures. =Day 8 (Episode 15 & 16)= *Captains - Peter and Lizzie *Island Challenge - Jig Zag, *Island Treasure - Vampire Bat (Be Alert) Code Cracker- In the Code Cracker, Peter chose Khadie and Lizzie chose Eleanor. Lizzie bought controversy when she picked Eleanor over Zach, because he wanted to attempt as he hasn't tried and he isn't playing the island challenge. Lizzie and Eleanor were arguing, with the rest of their team, which gave Sting the advantage. Today they had 5 minutes to crack the code with the clue of 3 sea birds, but there were only 3 symbols on the wheel, so with them symbols they had to figure out the first word, then with them letters it would spell out the next 2 words. They were quickly stuck and Khadie did not know what to do, and even when Peter figured out the first word of seagull, she was still confused and didn't write it in the right spot. Even when Peter knew what the word was he did not take control, so sting failed the code cracker so the fortune hunters advantage was given to claw by default, and if they had of worked together properly and Peter have taken the captaincy seriously the code would have been seagull, pelican and penguin. So claw won the fortune hunters advantage, the advantage was for Lizzie to start 10 seconds before Peter when they go head to head. Island challenge - In the first round, the team captain must get large puzzle pieces and make their way up a ladder and fit them onto a grid inside the puzzle that the other team members would be putting together. The captain that completes the puzzle first wins. In the second round, two team members must pass large puzzle pieces to the other on a ladder and fit them onto a grid. The team that completes the puzzle first wins. The team that does this quicker wins the next island treasure. In the first round Lizzie had the 10 second head start and started by putting the puzzle together at ground level. Then when Peter started he did the same thing, and after a minute or so the captains looked confused and didn't look like they were getting anywhere. Then finally Peter started putting his puzzle on the board before Lizzie, but she caught back up fast because she had longer legs than him. Peter did very well but just not enough to beat Lizzie, so she won the advantage for team claw in round 2. In the second round, because Lizzie won the first round team claw started with a piece of the puzzle already in place on the board. Neither of the teams did what their captains did and started on the ground, they both started putting pieces on the board straight away and this started confusion later on. Team claw was in the lead most of the way, but in the dying seconds of the game team sting overtook them and finished only seconds before claw, they were shattered. Island Fire - At the Island Fire, Team Sting won and chose Natty as their most valuable adventurer. Natty was awarded her second island treasure, The Vampire Bat. This further extended Sting's Island Treasure lead to 6‚Äì2. =Day 9 (Episode 17 & 18)= *Captains - Jordan (Sting) & Zach (Claw) *Island challenge - Hard Wired *Island Treasure - Coral Sponge (Knowledge) Code Cracker - Jordan chose Khadie and Zach chose Dilhan. Sting managed to once again complete the ring first and then managed to complete the code. This earned Jordan the advantage of one fuse already in the storage container for the island challenge, therefore giving him an advantage over Zach Island challenge - In the first round the captains had to remove fuses from a board. They were suspended on elastic ropes and had to use ropes to climb down and retrieve the fuses. Once they had a fuse they then had to throw them into a storage container, in order for a fuse to count the whole of it had to enter the box. As soon as they let go of the rope they got flung back to the top. In the first round of the Island challenge Jordan from Sting was against Zach from Claw. Jordan started with 1 fuse in his storage container as he had won this advantage in the code cracker. In the second round of the Island challenge Jeremy, Natty & Peter from Sting were against James, Lizzie & Eleanor from Claw. Island Fire - Sting won this challenge and awarded the coral sponge to Jordan as they thought that he was their most valuable player. This made the Island Treasure count 7‚Äì2 to Sting. =Day 10 (Episode 19 & 20)= *Captains - Khadie (Sting) & Dilhan (Claw) *Island challenges - Rings of Steel, Waterfall and Tower of Stones (main challenge) *Island Treasure - Clam (Scheming) Code Cracker - Khadie & Natty from Sting vs. Dilhan & Eleanor from Claw. Claw earned the 5 second advantage for the final Island Challenge by default as Khadie and Natty were unsuccessful in solving code cracker Island Challenges - Today the Island decided to turn up the heat and pressure on the adventurers. Therefore, instead of the usual code cracker followed by the captain's island challenge and then the teams' Island Challenge there were multiple challenges. The first challenge was the Rings of Steel. The chosen adventurers had to hold 2 rings that each weigh the size of 10 fizzy cans, holding them horizontally. Whoever can hold the rings longest wins. The Island chose the 2 captains to take part and go head to head in this challenge. Khadie struggled from the start of this challenge and although she tried her best Dilhan proved that he had better strength and stamina by not letting his arms drop down. Therefore, Dilhan won his teammates a 5-second advantage in the final Island Challenge of the day, Tower of Stones. The second Island Challenge Waterfall then took place. Up for grabs was a 5-second time advantage in Tower of Stones. There were 3 holes in a wall and 1 adventurer sat 1 side and the other had 3 chances to soak the other player with a bucket of water. After each bucket was emptied the seated adventurer could choose to stay in the same place or move. Jordan from Sting played against James from Claw. To start with James was pouring and Jordan was seated. James soaked Jordan with his second bucket. When the 2 adventurers switched round Jordan managed to get James twice, therefore earning Sting a 5-second advantage in the next Island Challenge. For the final, and main, Island Challenge of the day Peter took on Eleanor at the Tower of Stones. There were three tables and on the end one was a stack of 4 different sized circles, largest on bottom to smallest on top. The adventurers had to transfer the wooden circles onto the other end table while moving only one at a time and only allowed to put a smaller circle on top of a larger one. The adventurer that did this in the quickest time would win the challenge. Due to the earlier challenges Claw, Eleanor, had a 10-second advantage meaning that 10 seconds would be taken of her final time. Sting only had a 5-second advantage so Peter had 5 seconds taken off his final time. Eleanor went first and started at a really fast pace and managed to complete the puzzle fairly quickly but in a large number of moves. Peter then went, he had not been allowed to watch Eleanor, he started at a really fast pace then stopped mid game to think. This helped him a lot and enabled him to finish in fewer moves then Eleanor. Even with the time advantages deducted Peter still won, although it was very close. Island Fire - This mean that Sting won the Island Challenge and Island Treasure. Sting then awarded the Treasure, clam, to Peter due to his performance in the Tower of Stones. This made the Island Treasure count 8‚Äì2 in Sting's favour. The 2 teams chose their final team captains, Natty for Sting and Dilhan for Claw. These captains led the team on the final 2 days. =Day 11 (Episode 21 & 22)= *Captains - Natty (Sting) and Dilhan (Claw) *Island Challenge - Sinking Swamp *Island Treasure - Conch Shell (Communication) Code Cracker - Natty chose Jordan and Dilhan chose James to take part in the last code cracker. As this was the last code cracker it was the hardest ring to solve. Claw managed to finish the puzzle first and go on to win the challenge. Therefore, in the first round of the Island Challenge Dilhan started with 3 balls, meaning 3 points, in his basket giving him a 3-point head start over Natty. Island challenge - 1 adventurer is trying to throw balls into a basket while the other is defending the basket with a bat. The attacking player has ball sticks at 3 different lily pads and can move between them at any stage of the game. The defending player has 2 lily pads that are further apart but closer to the basket. For every ball that goes into the basket 1 point is given. If the attacking player falls in 3 points are subtracted from their score, if the defending player falls in 3 points are added to the opponents score. For the first Stage it was Natty against Dilhan with Dilhan on 3 points at the start. Natty was attacking first. Dilhan was second and proved to be better at aiming and at bluffing which earned him the win. Neither adventurer fell in so no penalty points were enforced. Dilhan therefore won his teammates a 3-point head start in the second part of the Island Challenge. For the second part it was Khadie and Jeremy of Sting against James and Zach of Claw. For this round there were 3 piles of balls: 1 for Sting, 1 for Claw and 1 mixed. These were attached to Lily pads. James and Jeremy were using these lily pads to throw balls to Zach and Khadie who were on a choice of 3 other lily pads. They then had to throw their balls into their buckets. Whoever got the most points at the end of the game would win. The same penalties as the first round were implemented, minus 3 points for falling in. Claw worked much better in this task and Khadie had trouble staying balanced and on the pads. Claw therefore won and in doing so earned their first Island Treasure since becoming a team. They decided to award the Conch Shell to Dilhan as they thought that he was their most valuable player. This changed the Island Treasure count to 8‚Äì3 to Sting. Although the score was vastly in Sting's favour this win helped Claw bond as a team and start working brilliantly as a unit as they realised they could win while having fun at the same time. Island Fire - At the Island fire the importance and role of the Island treasures was revealed. For the first round of the Final escape the teams would have to carry and transport each other's treasures. This meant that Claw had to transport 8 whereas Sting only had 3. =Day 12 (Episode 23, 24, 25 & 26)= *Captains - Natty (Sting) & Dilhan (Claw) *Island Challenge - The Escape, rounds 1 - 4 *The Escape, Round 1 - The final escape was split into 4 rounds, or stages. The winner of each round earns an advantage for the next. The first round was the Descent. This was a head to head battle between 1 adventurer from each team. The pairs of adventurers were drawn from a bag and each adventurer was represented by their symbols that they were first given when they arrived on the island. The captains had to transport one of the other teams treasures. For this challenge the adventurers had to abseil a cliff face to the beach below. As soon as one adventurer finished the time it took for the other adventurer to get down was then used as a headstart for the next. The first pair of adventurers were Natty from Sting against Lizzie from Claw. Natty had to transport an Island treasure and her dislike of heights was clear, therefore Lizzie won this challenge. The next pairing was Peter from Sting against James from Claw, Lizzie's win meant that James had a 32-second headstart. This enabled James to nearly reach the bottom before Peter could even start. Therefore, James won, however Peter cut the headstart down to 28 seconds. The third race saw Khadie take on the Claw team captain Dilhan. Dilhan won this and passed on a time advantage to the next member Zach who was against Sting member Jeremy. Zach won this which meant that it was Down top Jordan of Sting and Eleanor from Claw to see who would win this stage of the escape. Instead of this being a straight race the last pair of adventurers had to tie the opposing team's treasures onto a rope and send them down to their other team members one at a time. Eleanor started this round first due to her time advantage. However Jordan only had to pass down 2 treasures compared to Eleanor's 7. Therefore, Jordan finished this very quickly and it took Eleanor about 2 minutes 30 seconds longer. This was then Jordan's head start for the descent. Jordan chose to take his time and approach the descent with caution, however due to the time advantage he managed to still finish before Eleanor started. Eleanor then descended quickly as Claw could not continue without all of its members. As Sting won this round they then earned a head start in round 2. *The Escape, Round 2 - This involved all members of both teams. It was now time for the Treasures to be returned to the Island. Each team was given a metal detector to find the metal cases for each treasure that were buried at the beach. Although Sting had the time advantage they worked very badly as a team and were constantly arguing while looking completely demotivated. However Claw were desperate to win and gave this challenge their all. Claw started with a vast disadvantage as they had to return 8 treasures compared to Sting's 3. Due to their strong teamwork they managed to bury 5 and accidentally located one of Sting's enabling Sting to return one of their treasures. This made the final score 3‚Äì2 with Claw still having 3 treasures compared to Sting's 2. Therefore, even though Claw returned more treasures Sting won this round as they had less treasures remaining. Sting therefore earned a 10-second advantage for the third round of the final escape. *The Escape, Round 3 - A long length of rope was wound round 4 poles in a figure of 8. The adventurers had to untie this and then retrieve the key that was at the end. Sting started this round 10 seconds ahead of Claw due to the advantage that they won in the previous round. However Claw unwound their rope first due to better teamwork, method and communication. But both teams got their key at exactly the same moment. Therefore, the Island decided that it was a draw. Therefore, for the final round of the escape both teams would start at the same time giving both teams an equal chance to escape. *The Escape, Round 4 - Once again it was the whole of Team Claw against Team Sting. Using the keys that they won in the last round a member of each team unlocked a chest that was floating on the sea. In the chest was a bucket. Each adventurer had a bucket, with holes in the bottom, and formed a relay within their team. The last adventurer in the team poured the water into 1 of their 3 containers. Each team had 3 containers each containing a key. One of these three keys would open the chest that contains the fortune hunter's diary, whichever team achieved this would win and escape from Scorpion Island. Team Sting had Khadie in the sea starting the relay followed by, Peter, Jeremy, Jordan and Natty pouring water into their containers. Team Claw had Zach in the water then Dilhan, Eleanor, James and Lizzie filling up the container. Both teams really struggled to pass water along the line and into the container due to the hole in the bucket. However both teams were determined and worked really well together. Claw managed to fill up 1 of their containers first. Lizzie then rushed over to the chest and tried her key in the lock. Unfortunately for Lizzie and Claw the key did not open the chest. Claw then started filling up their next container and managed to get halfway until Sting filled their first. Natty then rushed to the chest and tried the key in the lock. Fortunately for Sting their key worked. Therefore, Team Sting won the final round and escaped. For the first time in Scorpion Island history it is Sting who won and escaped, whilst for Claw they realised that one team had to lose and knew that it was all about having fun on the day.

Andrew, son of Rev. Matthew Andrew and his wife Louisa, n√©e Job, was born at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England. He was educated at several English and Continental schools, and after his arrival in Victoria in 1857, at the Church of England grammar school, Melbourne, under the Rev. Dr. Bromby.

The Sami Sun-deity is usually depicted as female, but sometimes as male. In S√°pmi, north of the Polar circle, where the sun does not even reach the horizon in winter, the sun was widely venerated and played a major role in the cultic coherence. Beaivi is goddess of the sun, spring, and sanity, associated with the fertility of plants and animals, particularly reindeer. She made the plants grow so that the reindeer flourished and reproduced, and brought wealth and prosperity to the humans. On the winter solstice, a white female animal or animals, usually reindeer, were sacrificed in honor of Beivve, to ensure that she returned to the world and put an end to the long winter season. The sacrificed animals' meat would be threaded onto sticks, which were then bent into rings and tied with bright ribbons. This is called the Festival of Beaivi. At the time of the year when the sun was returning, butter (which melts in the sunshine) was smeared on the doorposts, as a sacrifice to Beivve, so that she could gain strength during her convalescence and go higher and higher in the sky. At the summer solstice, people made sun-rings out of leaves and pinned them up in her honor. On these occasions, they also ate butter as a sacral meal. At the time of the year when Beivve returned, prayers were made for the people who were mentally ill. The Sami believed that madness (in the shape of psychoses and depression) were provoked by the lack of sunshine and light during the long, dark winter. In Sami myth, she travels with her daughter, Beaivi-nieida, through the sky in an enclosure covered by reindeer bones or antlers, bringing spring with them.

Soul Pattinson from 1906‚Äì1929. Early years and background Thomas Hughes was born in Sydney, Colony of New South Wales, on 19 April 1863, the third son of wealthy Irish immigrants, John Hughes, of Kincoppal, and Susan Sharkey. His elder brother was future Sydney Alderman and NSW politician, John Francis Hughes. Hughes, along with his brother, was sent to England to be educated as Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, and he matriculated for the University of London in 1880. After undertaking a tour of Europe, Hughes then returned to Sydney and in 1882 entered the legal profession, being articled to T. M. Slattery and was admitted as a solicitor on 28 May 1887. Thereafter he entered practice with his brother. On 19 October 1887, he married Louisa Gilhooley, the daughter of physician James Gilhooley. They had two sons: Geoffrey Forrest Hughes, who became a solicitor and was a flying ace of the First World War, and Roger Forrest Hughes, who became a doctor, signed up in March 1916 to the Army Medical Corps and was killed in action during the Battle of the Somme on 11 December 1916.NAA: B2455, HUGHES R F CAPTAIN Political and business career Hughes entered public life in New South Wales when he openly supported Australian Federation in 1898 and became secretary to his brother John who was at the time serving as Representative of Government in Legislative Council for George Reid's Free Trade Party. In January 1899 he accompanied Reid, as his secretary, to the Federal Conference of Premiers in Melbourne which involved placing the colony's interests in the draft constitution. When Reid resigned his seat to stand for the newly formed Federal Parliament, Hughes stood as the Liberal Reform Party candidate (The Liberals had been formed out of the old Free Trade Party and were affiliated with Reid's federal Free Traders) for Reid's state seat of Sydney-King but was defeated by the Progressive Party candidate Ernest Broughton by a margin of eighteen votes. Hughes instead found success in his role as Alderman on Sydney City Council for Bourke Ward, which he had been elected to on 5 September 1898. An advocate of municipal reform, Hughes instituted an investigation into the city's finances, which would eventually result in the formation of the Civic Reform Association in 1920. With James Graham, he helped to organise the Citizens' Vigilante Committee which assisted in controlling the first plague outbreak in 1900. Hughes was elected as the last Mayor in January 1902, and was the first Lord Mayor of Sydney with the issuing of the Letters Patent from Edward VII granting the title to the City. Hughes also became a supporter for the concept of a unified 'Greater Sydney', with a single municipal body owning and controlling key public services in the Sydney basin. He was re-elected for another two terms as Lord Mayor from 1907 to 1908. In July 1908, Hughes was given a life appointment to the New South Wales Legislative Council. Taylor supported successive conservative parties in NSW, sitting in the Council for the Liberal Reform and Nationalist parties respectively during his time on the council. From 1908 to 1909 he chaired the Royal Commission for the improvement of the city of Sydney and its suburbs. Hughes would serve on Sydney City Council until he resigned on 1 December 1912. Hughes became highly proficient in business circles and was appointed Chairman of directors of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, Tooheys Limited and Washington H. Soul Pattinson (1906‚Äì1929). He also served as a director of Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (1915-1919, 1920-1928), and the Australia Hotel Company. A firm catholic and prominent member of the Sydney Catholic community, Hughes served as secretary to the first and third Sydney Catholic Congresses in 1900 and 1909. He was awarded the rank of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KCSG) by Pope Benedict XV in 1915. He was appointed as a Knight Bachelor in George V's 1915 Birthday Honours. During the First World War, Hughes and his wife were a foundation executive-members of the Universal Service League and were part of a small group of upper-class Catholics who opposed the anti-conscription stance of the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix and other Catholics. Although he remained a firm opponent of the influence of sectarianism and its position in society at that time. Later life and legacy In his later years, Hughes was a member of the Australian Club and of the council of The Women's College, University of Sydney. Suffering from chronic nephritis and arteriosclerosis, he died on 15 April 1930 in St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney and was buried in Waverley Cemetery after a service at St Canice's Church, Darlinghurst. On his death, the Premier Thomas Bavin noted: \\"The name of Sir Thomas Hughes has for many years been prominently associated with the public life of New South Wales, and both the Commonwealth, and the State will be the poorer because of his death. He will be particularly missed in the Legislative Council, where his counsels and mature judgment on problems of the day were of the greatest value. Sir Thomas rendered equally distinguished service to the State in the municipal and commercial spheres of activity. He held the distinction of being the first Lord Mayor of Sydney, and during his year of office following his elevation to that position, as well as during the three subsequent occasions on which he held that responsible post, he conducted the affairs of the City Council with outstanding dignity and ability.\\" Hughes Street in Potts Point is named after him.

He held the positions of Attorney-General for Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Lord Justice of Ireland and Secretary of State and War for Ireland under King James II.Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, p 324. He fled to France in 1691, joining James II at Saint Germain, where he resumed his duties as nominal Secretary of State and War. He later served as Commissioner of the Household.Corp, p 360. Richard was born into an Old English family at Carrigacunna Castle, in County Cork, the son of James Nagle of Annakissy, and James' wife, Honora Nugent. This was his family's seat. His brother Pierce was a future High Sheriff of Cork.Gibson, p 472. Although Richard was initially destined to join the clergy, he was educated in law at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in Dublin.Seward, p 67.Cruise O' Brien, p 16. \\"Active and skillful\\", he had a successful career as a lawyer. The Earl of Tyrconnell brought Richard to England with him in 1685 to meet James II.D'Alton, p 147. James created him Attorney-General for Ireland and knighted him in 1686. He also appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland.D'Alton, p 443. As an MP for Cork, Nagle was elected Speaker by the Irish House of Commons in 1689. This parliament is known to posterity as the \\"Patriot Parliament\\". It spurned the outcome of the Glorious Revolution, recognising King James's divine right to the Irish crown over William of Orange's parliamentary one. William, made King of England during the revolution, was set on conquering Ireland from James, and to achieve that end he launched the Williamite War. Richard was diametrically opposed to the Act of Settlement 1662 (he was the author of A Letter from Coventry, an anti-settlement pamphletMurray, p 64.), which had punished royalists and Catholics who had fought against parliament in the Civil Wars; he unsuccessfully advocated its repeal in this session.D'Alton, p 149. James's Irish Army forces were routed by William's at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690; King James retreated to Dublin. It was here he convened a council that advised him to flee to France. Nagle was one of its members. They reasoned that if he did not leave \\"he would run a great risk of being taken by the enemy\\". James followed their advice. Nagle, accompanied by Tyrconnell, visited him at his court-in-exile, Saint Germain, at the end of 1690.D'Alton, p 150. In Nagle's absence, his duties as Secretary of State were executed by the Baron Nugent of Riverston. Upon the death of Tyrconnell, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Nagle became one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. The others were Francis Plowden and Baron Fitton of Gawsworth. They administered what remained of Jacobite Ireland in the place of the Lord Lieutenant, though they did not assume command of the armed forces.Murray, p 223. Sir Richard Nagle married Jane (Joan) O'Kearney on September 19, 1669 at Clonbrogan, Ireland. Jane's sister, Mary O'Kearney, married Sir Richard's brother, Pierce Nagle of Annakissy, the high sheriff of County Cork in 1689.

The painterly print: Monotypes from the seventeenth to the twentieth century [exhibition], p. 84. The work is unusual, as it is a literal illustration of a double simile from Macbeth, found in the lines: :And pity, like a naked new-born babe, :Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd :Upon the sightless couriers of the air. :- Macbeth (1.7.21‚Äì23) p. 106. Like other members of the group it is a monotype produced by printing from a matrix consisting of paint on gessoed millboard, with each impression then finished by hand. By this unusual means Blake could obtain up to three impressions from a single painting. Three such impressions survive of Pity. A fourth, in the British Museum, was an early trial of the design from a different matrix, as it is smaller than the others.Blake Archive.org, \\"The Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795 and c. 1805\\" Interpretations Martin Butlin wrote that this colour print is one of the most inspired of all 'literal' illustrations of a text in the history of art.Blutin, Martin.

In fact, \\"pity and air\\", two words of the Shakespeare's verses, are also two motifs used by Blake in this picture: a female cherub leans down to snatch the baby from its mother. According to Blake biographer Alexander Gilchrist, the print \\"is on a tolerably large scale, a woman bending down to succour a man stretched out at length, as if given over to death.\\"Gilchrist wrote \\"a man\\" because he looked a version of the print without color. Gilchrist, Alexander (1863). Life of William Blake, \\"Pictor ignotus\\": With selections from his poems and other writings Macmillan and Co., p. 253. Pity is seen as in opposition to Blake's print The Night of Enitharmon's Joy (c. 1795) ‚Äî which shows a Hecate surrounded by fantastic creatures and macabre elements of a nightmare ‚Äî because it provides a \\"possibility of salvation\\" in the fallen world through pity.Butlin, Martin (1990). William Blake 1757-1827. Tate Gallery Collections, V, London Both prints refer to Macbeth. As Nicholas Rawlinson has noted, the play was undergoing a major revival in popularity at the time, being performed nine times in 1795.Rawlinson, p. 48. It is a personification p. 479 of a Christian element p. 118 that some critics argue was a negative virtue for Blake, since pity is associated with \\"the failure of inspiration and a further dividing\\" p. 56 and also \\"linked by alliteration and capitalization\\".Rawlinson, p. 171. It is also a part of Blake's mythology, in which a sexually frustrated Tharmas becomes \\"a terror to all living things\\", although the emotion inherent in him is pity. p. 78 Other Blake characters have this feeling, and his mythology is developed between the confrontation of a feminine \\"Pity\\" and a masculine fiery, as happens in the brutal suppression of desire in Urizen. Some critics see a connection between Pity and the \\"hypnotic and helpless state\\" of William Butler Yeats' The Wind Among the Reeds (1899). p. 1708. Versions The slightly retouched version at the Yale Center for British Art The print exists in four versions from two different matrices. The most elaborate and best- known version of the print is in the Tate Gallery, London, sometimes described as the only finished one. It was presented by W. Graham Robertson to the gallery in 1939, and is catalogued as \\"Butlin 310\\".All Butlin numbers from the Blake Archive pages on each work A unique \\"proof print\\" is in the British Museum (Butlin 313). It is \\"significantly smaller than the final version of the design\\" and depicts the supine figure \\"partially covered in vegetation\\" in the form of sweeping fronds of long grass.The British Museum The Large Colour Prints / Pity. Another version of the image is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is not as elaborately worked as the Tate print. It was donated by Mrs. Robert W.

Boken played for the Washington Senators (1933‚Äì34) and the Chicago White Sox (1934). Biography Boken (of Lithuanian descent) was born in Maryville, Illinois and played youth ball in the Maryville Little League. He was on the Senators rosters for the 1933 World Series but did not appear in any of its games. The Senators were the surprise team of 1933, breaking a seven-year monopoly on the AL title jointly held by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Athletics from 1926 to 1932. Led by future Hall of Famer Joe Cronin, the Senators amassed a 99-53 record and theIr first pennant in eight years, besting the Babe Ruth- and Lou Gehrig-led New York Yankees by seven games. Boken‚Äôs first game on April 25, 1933 had him coming in to relieve Joe Cronin at SS, in a home game against the New York Yankees. Boken had one AB and didn‚Äôt reach the bases in a game where Ruth and Gehrig combined with 4 hits and 5 RBIs to trounce the Senators 16 to 0. Boken next appeared on April 29, 1933 in Yankee Stadium in relief of John Kerr at 2B. This time, he produced 1 H w 1 RBI in his two AB, contributing to a 6-3 win where Ruth and Gehrig were held to 3 hits and no RBIs on 8 combined AB. Boken followed that performance on April 30 at Home (Griffith Field) vs Philadelphia, again in relief of Kerr at 2B, and again producing 1 H with 1 RBI in 2 AB. His first start was at 2B on May 7 in a 9-10 loss to the Tigers in Detroit, going .500 on 6 AB. In 147 games over two seasons in the major leagues, Boken posted a .247 batting average (113-for-457) with 54 runs, 6 home runs and 72 RBI. Defensively, he recorded an overall .931 fielding percentage. In addition to his time in the major leagues, Boken had an extensive minor league career, playing from 1929-1947. His lifetime production was notable, amassing 1,787 hits, 149 HRs and 232 RBIs across 1,710 games and 5,969 at bats. He achieved a .299 lifetime average and .452 slugging percentage. Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, one of the game‚Äôs premier power hitters, referenced Boken in his HOF induction speech in 1975: \\"Going back to my early days, I have to mention a fellow by the name of Bob Boken who is the man who got me started playing baseball. And his son was about four years older than I, and he used to pitch to his son across the street and I‚Äôd go out in the outfield and shag the balls. This went on for about a year and I finally got a chance to bat and I realized what a great game this was.\\" Maryville Little League renamed Khoury League Field No. 2 in Boken‚Äôs honor on opening day, May 3, 2012.

Bangladeshi citizenship was formed in 1971, when the permanent residents of the former East Pakistan were transformed into citizens of a new republic. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous nation. The vast majority of Bangladeshis are ethnolingustically Bengalis, an Indo-Aryan people who are predominantly Muslim. The population of Bangladesh is concentrated in the fertile Bengal delta, which has been the center of urban and agrarian civilizations for millennia. The country's highlands, including the Chittagong Hill Tracts and parts of the Sylhet Division, are home to various tribal minorities. Bengali Muslims are the predominant ethnoreligious group of Bangladesh with a population of 146 million , which makes up 90.39% of the country's population. The minority Bengali Hindu population made up approximately 8.54% of the population of the country in 2015. Non-Bengali Muslims make up the largest immigrant community; while the Tibeto-Burman Chakmas, who speak the Indo-Aryan Chakma language, are the largest indigenous ethnic group after Indo-Aryan Bengalis. The Austroasiatic Santhals are the largest aboriginal community. The Bangladeshi diaspora is concentrated in the Arab world, North America and the United Kingdom. A significant number of Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) have dual citizenship in different countries. Terminology Bangladesh in Asia After Independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangladeshis, as a nationality, have been referred to by various terms: * Bangladeshis, the most widely used term to refer to the citizens of Bangladesh, comes from Bangladesh (meaning \\"Country of Bengal\\"), and can be traced to the early 20th century. Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo, by Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy, by Rabindranath Tagore. * Bangalees, an exonym for Bengalis, was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President Ziaur Rahman, the constitutional term was changed to Bangladeshi, as part of efforts to promote Bangladeshi nationalism. The term \\"Bangalee\\" is still used to denote people of Bangladesh as a nation. * East Bengalis, a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the Partition of Bengal. The territory was known as East Bengal twice in the 20th century. It was used for Eastern Bengal and Assam in the British Raj between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the Dominion of Pakistan's province of East Bengal between 1947 and 1955, before the region was renamed to East Pakistan, after which its Bengali inhabitants became known as East Pakistanis or simply Pakistanis. None of these terms should be conflated with Bengalis, the name of the predominant ethnic group in the country who make up the bulk of all Bangladeshis. Demographics The region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP. =Bengalis= Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show. Approximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are Bengalis. East Bengal was a prosperous melting pot for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of dialects. Over 90.39% of the population are Bengali Muslims (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest Muslim majority country after Indonesia and Pakistan. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after Arab Muslims. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the Sunni branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the Shia and Ahmadiya branches. Bengali Hindus are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 12.5 million as per 2011 census report comprising 8.5% of the country's population. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after India and Nepal. There are an estimated 400,000 Bengali Christians and 500,000 Bengali Buddhists. The Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division. =Non-Bengali Muslims= An estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali Muslim immigrants from different parts of South Asia. They include affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class, particularly Nizari Ismailism adherents. They also include former Stranded Pakistanis and their descendants. Bangladesh's non-Bengali Muslims are usually fluent in both Bengali and Hindustani. =Tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts= In southeastern Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts frontier has a district history. It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto- Burman tribes in Bengal during the British Raj. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several indigenous ethnic groups in the three hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari. The three largest communities in the region have a Raja as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh. * The Chakma people are the largest tribe of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the second largest indigenous ethnic group of Bangladesh after Bengalis. A Tibeto-Burman community, they have been greatly influenced by Bengali culture, including in their native Chakma language, a branch of the Bengali-Assamese languages. Most Chakmas are concentrated in Rangamati District. The community is headed by the Chakma Raja. The majority of Chakmas are Therevada Buddhists, with a minority being Hindu. * The Marma people are second largest community in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. They have a Raja and are concentrated in the districts of Bandarban and Khagrachari. The Marmas are originally Arakanese people who moved to the territory in the 17th century in order to escape Burmese persecution. * The Mro people are the third largest community in the region and have a Raja. Buddhism, Christianity and animist beliefs are among the chief faiths of the Mros. Their population is concentrated in Bandarban District. Mros are originally related to the Chin people of Myanmar. * The Tanchangya people are among the oldest native indigenous tribes of the region. They speak the Indo- Aryan Tanchangya language and adhere to Therevada Buddhism. * The Bawm people are a Tibeto-Burman Christian community. They are among the oldest inhabitants of the region. * The Tripuri people inhabit much of Khagrachari District. Their population is divided between Bangladesh and their larger indigenous homeland in the Indian state of Tripura. * The Khumi people are one of the poorest and smallest tribes of the region. They originate from Arakan. * The Kuki people are the Bangladeshi counterparts of Chins in northern Myanmar and Mizos in northeast India. =Tribes of North and Northeast Bangladesh= There are several Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-Aryan tribes which inhabit parts of northern and northeastern Bangladesh. * The Santhal people are the largest aboriginal community of the country. They speak the Austroasiatic Santhali language. Their culture is noted for martial dance traditions. Their population is most concentrated in Rajshahi Division and Rangpur Division. The Santhals have been the focal point of land rights controversies as the Bangladeshi government seeks to develop open pit coal mining in their tribal hinterlands. * The Garo people inhabit the Haluaghat Upazila of Mymensingh District. They have high literacy rates and are adherents of Christianity. * The Bisnupriya Manipuri people are the second largest ethnic group in Sylhet Division. They are adherents of Hinduism and the speak the Indo-Aryan Bishnupriya Manipuri language. Their classical Manipuri dance tradition is a key part of Bangladesh's national culture. * A negligible small minority of Marwari people live in various cities and towns of the country such as Dinajpur, Kushtia and Narayanganj. Although many of them have been assimilated into the larger Hindu Bengali demographics, they still use the marwari surnames such as Agarwal, Singhania etc. They are among the affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class. =Tribes of Southern Bangladesh= * An Arakanese Rakhine community has resided in Barisal Division for three centuries. They arrived by the sea after escaping Burmese conquests in the 17th century. Rural society The basic social unit in a village is the family (poribar or gushti), generally consisting of a complete or incomplete patrilineally extended household (chula) and residing in a homestead (bari). The individual nuclear family often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (ghor). Above the bari level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.Rahim, Enayetur. \\"Rural Society\\". In Heitzman & Worden. A significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \\"the society\\" (shomaj or milat). Among the functions of a shomaj might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a mullah. An informal council of shomaj elders (matabdars or shordars) settles village disputes. Factional competition between the motobdars is a major dynamic of social and political interaction. Groups of homes in a village are called Paras, and each para has its own name. Several paras constitute a mauza, the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common thatched bamboo huts. Although farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly. Urban society View of downtown Dhaka, the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities In 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities. Dhaka is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous megacities. Other important cities include Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Jessore, Barisal, Comilla, Narayanganj and Mymensingh. Most urban centers are rural administrative towns. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of upazilas.Rahim, Enayetur. \\"Urban Society\\". In Heitzman & Worden. Identity Bangladesh is noted for cultural pluralism within a Bengali Muslim majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The Bengali language is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The Bengali Language Movement sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced socialism under a secular parliamentary system. Military coups ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the free market and promoted moderate Islamism. In 1988, Islam was made the state religion. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of separation of mosque and state in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion. The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities. Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a peace treaty in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect adivasi land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of Bangalee as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society. Culture Culture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religions are Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, which have played a critical part in influencing the country's culture. = Languages = Bengali script The official language of Bangladesh is Bengali, which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. Bengali dialects vary between different regions of Bangladesh. The oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at Mahasthangarh and is written in the Brahmi script. The language is Magadhi Prakrit. The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from Apabhramsa, between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern Indo-Aryan language with Assamese and Odia, but later became distinct. It became an official language of the Sultanate of Bengal, where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit. Bengali is the 10th most spoken language in the world. The language was modernized during the Bengali Renaissance in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including Chakma, Rohingya, Assamese, Odia and Nepali. The indigenous Bengali alphabets descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script. The Bengali Language Movement in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by UNESCO as International Mother Language Day, as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage. Bangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including Santhali, Garo, Marma, Chakma and Bisnupriya Manipuri. = Surnames = Bangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have Arabic and Persian origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.

Jay Fox (August 20, 1870 ‚Äì March 8, 1961) was an American journalist, trade unionist, and political activist. The political trajectory of his life ran through anarchism, syndicalism, and communism, and he played a significant role in each of these political movements. Fox is best remembered as a leading figure in a radical collective located in Home, Washington, near Tacoma, where he was editor of one of the leading English-language anarchist newspapers of the day, The Agitator. He became embroiled in legal difficulties related to the 1910 Los Angeles Times bombing and after 1913 made his home in Chicago, Illinois, where he was a close political associate of future Communist Party leader William Z. Foster. Biography = Early life = Jay Fox was born in New Jersey of Irish Catholic parents who had just immigrated to America. The family soon moved to Chicago, where he grew up in poor, immigrant neighborhoods near the stock yards. Quitting school at an early age he went to work growing cabbage for the stockyards, and later at Malleable Iron Works in fall 1885. He joined the Knights of Labor in 1886 and was present at the famous strikes for the eight-hour day on May 1 and 3 of that year, as well as at the Haymarket Square incident.Carr, Mary M. \\"Jay Fox: Anarchist of Home.\\" Columbia Magazine. 4.1 (Spring 1990): 3-4. Later, in 1893, while working for Illinois Central Railroad, he was a charter member of the first local of the American Railway Union and delegate at its first convention in June 1894. After the virtual collapse of that movement following the Pullman Strike, he seems to have campaigned in several eastern US cities for William Jennings Bryan and visited England after his loss in the presidential election of 1896.Carr, p. 4. Returning to Chicago by November 1897, he became associated with the group around the periodical Free Society that included Emma Goldman. He apparently conspired with her to attempt to break Alexander Berkman out of jail by tunneling into the prison, without success.William Z. Foster More Pages from a Workers Life New York: American Institute for Marxist Studies 1979 p. 12 After the assassination of President McKinley he was arrested and thrown into jail with all the other associates of the periodical, but released soon thereafter. Fox continued his writing and speech making career in New York and Chicago for the next few years, marrying Esther Abramowitz sometime in the middle of the decade.Carr, pp. 4-5. After the Free Society moved to New York and then folded in 1904, the Chicago anarchists began to gather funds for the creation of a new anarchist paper. But a rift soon developed between Lucy Parsons and Jay Fox. Parsons still wanted to publish the paper in Chicago, whereas Fox wanted to adopt the already existing Demonstrator which was in difficult financial straits. Fox took the money already raised and sent it to Home without Parsons permission‚Äîessentially purchasing it‚Äîand promised to come to the colony to edit it personally. However health problems prevented him from coming to the colony until 1908, by which time Demonstrator had already folded. Even without Foxs personal supervision, however, the focus of Demonstrator began to shift away from the colony and more towards an anarcho- communist viewpoint focusing on the militant labor movement and the Industrial Workers of the World. This focus seems to have contrasted with the individualist anarchist views of most of the colony members.Carr, p.5.Charles Pierce LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885-1915. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1975; pp. 206-207. = Knights of Labor and the Haymarket Riots = Labor unions were used to unite workers in fighting for better treatment and working conditions for themselves. The members of the unions were tired of the way things were and decided to do something about it. They began organizing meetings and started to plan strikes and picket lines at their factories. One of the largest of these groups was the Knights of Labor (KOL). This group is important to our topic because Fox became a member of this union in 1886 when he was sixteen years old. Upon joining the KOL, Fox agreed to participate in the strike because factory workers wanted the workday brought to consist of a set number of eight hours. People were tired of working the almost half day shifts for small amounts of pay which had become the standard of the time. Fox and other protesters lined up in front of Malleable Iron Works, where Fox worked, and others at McCormick Reaper Works where things got violent. Fox experienced the violence of the McCormick workers where he wandered for a time to see the protestors throwing stones and then the arrival of the police who began shooting people in the crowd; some were injured and even killed. Fox described it as \\"a reign of terror,\\" where police \\"brutally attacked workers' meetings with clubs and pistols.\\" People later gathered at Haymarket square, among these people was Fox. The rioters met here to discuss what had happened at the previous strike and the police brutality that had occurred. During this gathering a pipe bomb was thrown into the audience, which caused chaos and added to the number of dead.Fox, Jay. \\"I was at Haymarket\\" by Jay Fox, Our World [supplement to People's World] April 27, 1951. Folder 12 MASC. These events known as the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad impression of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. It made them start to realize that they were going to have to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted.Fox, Jay. \\"History of the Eight-Hour Day\\" by Jay Fox, Chicago Labor News, September 15, 1916. Folder 11 MASC. Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event \\"I Was At Haymarket.\\" Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation. = Home, Washington = Fox described Home as \\"a community of free spirits, who came out into the woods to escape the polluted atmosphere of priest-ridden, conventional society.\\"Fox, Jay. \\"The nude and the prudes\\" by J. F.[Clipping from Home Agitator, 1910, which lead to Fox's arrest] Folder 8 MASC. Home, also known as the Mutual Home Colony Association or the Home Colony, was a perfect example of Fox's individualistic ideals. Fox supported freethinking and being yourself even if it clashed with mainstream society. Fox felt people should be free to express themselves in any way they wanted. Home was set up in response to similar ideas from men before Fox. Three anarchists established the tiny town, located on the Key Peninsula in the middle of the Puget Sound, which became a focal point for like-minded individuals who were outcast by society. In February 1896, George H. Allen, L.F. Odell, and Oliver A Verity left the small experimental commune of Glennis, with what was left of the failed town's treasury, and purchased a tract of land where Home was established.Lewarne, Charles P. Arizona and the West. 14. 1972. 158-160. Soon the small multitudinous community grew as it attracted more and more settlers with the same ideals. By 1901, the permanent, as some came and went, population of the Home Colony had reached close to 100 and was attracting attention from their neighbors. In 1901, the printer of the local Home newsletter was fined for distributing an article deemed obscene by the Pierce County Superior Court. Later the same year, several Home colonists traveled to nearby Anderson Island and lectured about anarchy. The Tacoma Evening News denounced the lecture and many in Tacoma believed two of the Home colonists garnered government pensions. This caused a stir among people along the Puget Sound, as it was widely spread that the government was in a roundabout way supporting anarchy. These events were lost in the wake of McKinley's assassination and the hatred that was aimed at anarchists and the Home colonists. Numerous articles proclaimed the indecency of anarchists and in turn the Home colonists. Religious leaders spoke out against the groups as well, saying they were wicked, sinful people. Outlaws, vipers, and damnable people were all used by local newspapers to describe the colonists of Home. James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., the colony's editor at the time, admitted opposition to President William McKinley's policies but that the colony mourned the death of the President, and saying the assassination was \\"useless\\" . Morton wrote that Leon Czolgosz was not a true anarchist and therefore his actions did not reflect on the anarchist society. Morton wrote two letters to the Tacoma Ledger pleading for justice but both went unpublished. After these tumultuous years, Home continued to grow where a free atmosphere and diverse thoughts and ideas appealed to people. Atheists, religious, free love practitioners, communists, socialists, and much more mingled together until after World War I. The Great War came and brought with it a pressure to conform and unite against an outside enemy. Couple this with quarrelling among the colonists on the wellbeing of their community brought an end to Home in the late 1910s. While residing in the libertarian colony of Home, Washington, Fox headed up duties as editor and author of Home's surrogate newspaper, The Agitator. In this publication the views of the colony were made known through what Fox described as a position of \\"freedom first, last and all the time\\".Carr, Mary M. \\"Jay Fox: Anarchist of Home.\\" Columbia Magazine. 4.1 (Spring 1990): 3-10. Date accessed Nov. 17, 2010 http://columbia.washingtonhistory.org/anthology/yearsofgrowth/jayFox.aspx. The Agitator presented readers a taste of Fox's renowned views on industrial unionism and the individual empowerment he felt that early 20th century society was lacking. = The Agitator = The debut issue of Fox's newspaper, The Agitator. The very first issue of the publication dispersed on November 18, 1910 paid homage to those who had been sentenced to death as a result of their involvement in the Hay Market riots in Chicago around 23 years prior. In an article Fox wrote for this issue, entitled \\"The Chicago Martyrs\\", he shares his sentiment about the workers push for an eight-hour work day. He accounts that \\"The eight hour day did not become an actuality, but a victory of far more importance was achieved by that strike. The workers learned the rudiments of social action upon which future success must be founded.\\"Gorgura, Heather. \\"The Agitator.\\" 2001. http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/laborpress/Agitator.htm (accessed 9/27/2010). Motivated by his reflection of these transgressions, Fox further elaborated on the happenings of the Haymarket riots by writing articles in later issues encouraging these types of measures to be taken in the future, in order to uphold an anarchist environment in Home. Many of the radical rights that Fox fought for were documented in The Agitator and welcomed by the people of the colony. Home facilitated the vigorous Jay Fox in becoming an author of great respectability to those willing to lend an ear to his views and a pesky enemy to those who would not stand for his temperament. The ability of Fox to sway public opinion and feed the fire of anarchy was in part strengthened by his role as author and editor of Home's newspaper The Agitator. = Legal problems = While publisher of The Agitator at Home Fox became involved in two legal controversies. The first involved the sensational Los Angeles Times bombing of 1910, in which 21 people had been killed.LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, pg. 203. Private detective William J. Burns sought the arrest of a former resident of Home Colony, David Caplin, and his associate Matt Schmidt in connection with the case, believing the two to have been conspirators. Burns established headquarters in Tacoma early in October 1911 and began staking out the house of Jay Fox and searching his mail, convinced that as editor of The Agitator he knew the whereabouts of the two fugitives. An undercover spy named Donald Vose was employed by Burns and he managed to locate Caplan in Seattle, and he was placed under surveillance.LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, pg. 204. Vose was then dispatched to New York City, where he met anarchist writer Emma Goldman and borrowed her apartment briefly, and managed to make contact with Schmidt on the pretext that he was in possession of a letter for him. With Schmidt's living location identified, Vose returned to Washington and the pair of fugitives were arrested. Although innocent of connection with the bombing, as part of the October 1911 investigation Jay Fox was arrested on a charge of sedition, being released before trial on $2,000 bail.\\"Accuse Tacoma Anarchist: Caplan, For Whom Reward is Offered, Recently in North,\\" Newport [WA] Miner, vol. 11, no. 22 (Oct. 12, 1911), pg. 7. Charges were levied that with his friend Caplan, Fox had attempted to obtain dynamite in 1910 and had studied the art of bomb-making with him at the Home Colony.\\"Plotters Trailed to Home Colony: Sect is Said to Have Kept Dynamiters Who Blew Up Los Angeles Times,\\" Lynden [WA] Tribune, vol. 4, no. 26 (Dec. 21, 1911), pg. 5. Fox was more directly involved in a subsequent free speech case involving one of his articles, \\"The nudes and the prudes\\" in the July 1, 1911 issue of the Agitator. After several residents had been arrested for nude bathing, the colony began to divide into radical and more conservative factions. A bitter and personal antagonism developed between the two camps. Fox article labeled the groups the nudes and the prudes and editorialized in favor of the former. Seven weeks later he was arrested for violating a law that made it a misdemeanor to \\"encourage or advocate disrespect for the law or any court or courts of justice.\\" The case went to trial in January 1912 and the jury found Fox guilty of the offense, but recommend a lenient punishment. Fox reported for jail to serve a two-month sentence on February 6 of that year, but was quickly out on bond. =Move to Chicago= Fox decided to leave Home Colony in favor of a new start in Chicago, where syndicalist leader William Z. Foster had moved in order to establish a new organization called the Syndicalist League of North America.Edward P. Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism: The Life of William Z. Foster. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994; pg. 69. Fox brought with him his publication The Agitator, previously produced at Home Colony, and renamed it The Syndicalist, making it the official organ of the new organization.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pp. 69. The organization's total membership never exceeded 2,000 members, although it did manage to establish local groups in Kansas City, St. Louis, San Diego, Omaha, and in Chicago.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 71. The group attracted several important activists to its ranks, including Samuel Hammersmark and Foster's future son-in-law, Joseph Manley. In February 1913 the state supreme court denied a rehearing and the case was appealed the United States Supreme Court. The high court handed down its ruling upholding the original judgment on May 13, 1915. By the time Fox had returned from Chicago and was a vice-president of the International Union of Timber Workers. Appeals from his lawyer and by an official of the union convinced Gov. Ernest Lister to pardon Fox on September 11, 1915, twelve days before the sentence would have ended.LeWarne pp. 214-220.FOX v. WASHINGTON, 236 U.S. 273 (1915) = Later years = By 1914 Fox had returned to the Northwest. He worked with J. C. Brown to expand the Shingle Weavers' Union into the International Union of Timber Workers; he became a vice-president of the new group, and got Foster a job as an organizer. The ITWU planned on conducting a general strike on May 1 to get the eight-hour day, but called the project off when the Socialists got an eight-hour proposal on the ballot for that November. The proposal failed and the union disintegrated.Foner, Philip Sheldon History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9 The T. U. E. L. to the death of Gompers New York, International Publishers Co, 1991 p. 85‚Äì86 It was also during this period that his common law wife, Esther, separated from him. She would marry William Z. Foster in 1918. It was evidently an amicable separation and the three remained friends.Carr, p. 49. Fox joined the National Non-Partisan League for a while in Chicago in 1918, but soon quit because he did not want to be transferred to Bismarck. He returned to Seattle and participated in the Seattle general strike of 1919. In June 1919 he married his third and final wife, Cora Peterson, a Danish immigrant. Fox continued to participate in community politics, being elected president of the Mutual Home Association by one faction of the group in 1917. However, the Association was put in receivership in September 1919 and finally dissolved in 1921.LeWarne pp. 221‚Äì222  Footnotes   Works  * Roosevelt, Czolgosz, and Anarchy.

His works deal with revolutions, cultures of socialism, architectural history, and diplomatic history in the contexts of East Asia and modern Korea, with a focus on North Korea. His 2013 book, Tyranny of the Weak, won the John K. Fairbank Prize, but he returned the prize in 2017 after issues with the citations, including plagiarism and source fabrication, were raised. A Columbia University investigation later determined that he had committed plagiarism. On leave for the 2020 academic year, he is expected to retire from his post at the end of 2020. Early life Armstrong earned his B.A. at Yale University in 1984, and continued his studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, earning a diploma in Korean language in 1986. He received an M.Sc. at the London School of Economics in 1988, and his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1994.Columbia University, faculty bio notes Career Charles Armstrong is a specialist in the modern history of Korea and East Asia, and has written or edited numerous books on modern and contemporary Korea as well as the wider East Asia region, including Japan. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1996 and before his retirement was announced in 2019, taught courses on Korean history, U.S.-East Asian relations, the Vietnam War, and approaches to international and global history. His book The North Korean Revolution, 1945‚Äì1950, published in 2003, was based largely on captured North Korean documents in the U.S. National Archives, and was a step forward for efforts to understand North Korea more at the local level and beyond more conventional Cold War or Korean War-centered approaches. He has published articles in peer-reviewed journals on such subjects as Kim Il Sung's Manchurian guerrilla heritage, the \\"cultural Cold War\\" in Korea, and assessments of North Korean studies as a whole. He was a Visiting Professor in 2008 at the Graduate School of International Studies at Seoul National University, has given keynote lectures at major Asian studies conferences, and is a regular fixture in US media coverage of the Korean peninsula, including documentary film and television.Stanford University, Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, North Korea in The Cold War International System,\\" April 10, 2009. Plagiarism and source fabrication in Tyranny of the Weak In 2013, Charles Armstrong's book Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950‚Äì1992 was published by Cornell University Press. The book sought to reassess North Korean foreign policy in the Cold War. The book received positive reviews, particularly because it appeared to draw from so many foreign archives and materials in multiple languages including Russian, Chinese, German, and Korean. The book was the 2014 winner of the John K. Fairbank Prize, given to the best book in East Asian History by the American Historical Association. Beginning in September 2016, the book was severely criticized by a number of North Korea scholars (Andrei Lankov, Bal√°zs Szalontai, Brian Myers, Fyodor Tertitskiy and others) for deceptive scholarship. Szalontai asserted that many parts of the text closely resemble text in Szalontai's Kim Il Sung in the Khrushchev Era and were supported by documents that either did not exist or were completely unrelated to the subject. Szalontai compiled a table of 76 problematic cases and later expanded the table to include 90 of such cases. Soon after the allegations were made public, Armstrong responded to NK News that he \\"did not comment on any specific issues critics have raised with the book\\". On December 30, 2016, Armstrong directly addressed the issues raised by the critics, stating: \\"For those who find the book flawed, inaccurate or insufficiently researched, the answer is simple: write a better book.\\" Armstrong stated that he had submitted 52 corrections to Tyranny of the Weak to the publisher Cornell University Press and these would be included in the next printing of the book. The press confirmed this with a single tweet on January 11, 2017, saying \\"Charles Armstrong responds to critics, issues corrections to Tyranny of the Weak\\" and linking to Armstrong's blog post. However, Armstrong later deleted the post and his entire blog. In June 2017, Armstrong returned the John King Fairbank Prize to the American Historical Association in response to critical queries made by the association. In its press release, the association stated that they had \\"identified a set of citations that did not meet professional standards\\" and that \\"Dr. Armstrong has corrected the citation errors and, out of respect for the AHA, has returned the Fairbank Prize.\\" Columbia University made no statement at this time, but did announce on June 1 that Armstrong had been awarded a 2017 President's Global Innovation Fund Grant for work with Joseph Terwilliger on exchanges with North Korean physicians. The return of the prize prompted the head of Cornell University Press to state in early July 2017 that the press would imminently issue a revised edition of the book. The new edition of the book appeared in the summer of 2017, without any formal announcement from the press. The new text contained few changes to the prose, but did feature changes to dozens of footnotes now citing Szalontai's Kim Il Sung in the Khrushchev Era rather than archival documents. It also included two new sentences from Armstrong in the front matter of the text: \\"I would like to add a special note of thanks to Dr. Bal√°zs Szalontai, whose pioneering research was insufficiently acknowledged in the prior printing of this book and who pointed out to me numerous attribution errors in chapters 2 and 3. I apologize for my previous oversights and gratefully acknowledge Dr. Szalontai's assistance in correcting these errors.\\" A short review of the controversy was published in a collective blog Retraction Watch. It was also covered by South Korean, Chinese media, and the New York Post. In an extensive interview in December 2019, Szalontai revealed that Armstrong had not worked in any Russian archives at all, and said \\"some of the East German sources [in Tyranny of the Weak] are fake, some are not fake,\\" and further discussed some of the efforts by Andrei Lankov and other scholars to methodically check Armstrong's suspicious sources. In February 2020, Armstrong's 2005 article: ‚Äò‚ÄúFraternal Socialism‚Äù: The International Reconstruction of North Korea, 1953-62‚Äô, published in the journal Cold War History, was retracted for plagiarism from Szalontai's book. =Columbia University's investigation= On September 10, 2019, Columbia University released a letter to faculty explaining that it had concluded a multi-part formal investigation of Armstrong's research conduct and determined that he had committed plagiarism. It further announced that Armstrong will retire at the end of 2020. According to documents obtained by journalists Khadija Hussein and Karen Xia, Columbia's investigation concluded in January 2019 and its scope extended back to Armstrong's tenure file submitted in 2003. That tenure file included draft chapters of what would ultimately become Armstrong's book Tyranny of the Weak. According to Bal√°zs Szalontai, who obtained a copy of the investigation's draft report in 2018, the investigation found evidence in the tenure file that Armstrong had plagiarized Szalontai's dissertation. A partial copy of an earlier draft of Columbia's investigation report was made public by the Retraction Watch website on September 20, 2019.

He was born in County Cork and educated at Trinity College, later becoming a lecturer and then professor at that institution. During World War I he served in Malta with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Early life and education Dr. Alex O'Sullivan was born in County Cork in May 1858, the son of the Rev. Denis Mitchell O'Sullivan, Rector of Macroom, and Lucia Maria n√©e Swete, as the oldest of four children.O'Sullivan family papers. He was educated at Tipperary Grammar School and went to Trinity College, Dublin. Having studied classics in his first years he suddenly turned to mathematics, and obtained a scholarship in that subject in 1879. In 1881 he was first senior moderator in mathematics and also in ethics and logic. The British Medical Journal noted that the first mathematical scholar in 1879 was Dr. Bernard, later a Provost of Trinity College, and the senior classical scholar was Professor J. B. Bury, the distinguished historian; Dr. Bernard obtained his Fellowship in 1884, Dr. Bury in 1885, and Dr. O'Sullivan in 1886. Having taken his Fellowship, Dr. O'Sullivan, under the influence and advice of Professor Samuel Haughton, turned to the study of medicine, and took his M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O. degrees in 1894. He also took a special course of bacteriology in Vienna. Later life and career Returning to Dublin in 1895, Dr. O'Sullivan was appointed lecturer in pathology in Trinity College. When the chair of pathology was founded he was again reappointed as lecturer, and a couple of years later he was confirmed in that position as professor. Dr. O'Sullivan may be regarded as the father of the modern school of Dublin physicians. Dr. O'Sullivan held examinerships in the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, and Belfast, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, for which he wrote many papers. During the last three years of his life he held the position of registrar of the medical school (dean of the medical faculty). He came into contact with two generations of medical students, and helped to shape the policy of the College. In 1903 he was Vice- President of the Pathology Section at the meeting of the British Medical Association at Swansea. War record In the autumn of 1915 Dr. O'Sullivan volunteered for service and went out as a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps to Malta, where his work in malaria and dysentery obtained widespread recognition. He was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became Director of Laboratories, Malta.RAMC Officers of the Malta Garrison, 1916 At the close of World War I he was placed in charge of the Central Military Laboratory for Ireland. Death Dr. O'Sullivan died on 18 February 1924 at his residence, Ailesbury Road, Dublin, after an illness of only a few days. The cause of his death was blood poisoning contracted on 13 February, whilst performing a post-mortem examination. He left a widow and four children.Obituary: Alexander Charles O'Sullivan British Medical Journal. 1. London: BMJ Group. Wikisource. 1 March 1924. 409. Character In his youth he was an accomplished athlete, and he rowed in the College eights and fours. He was a keen yachtsman and golfer, and loved a game of billiards. The British Medical Journal's obituary described Dr. O'Sullivan as \\"a man of the most lovable character: with simplicity he combined manly courage, as had frequently been displayed in his mountaineering adventures.\\" Dr. O'Sullivan was a fine classical scholar, and always kept in close touch with the progress of modern mathematics; many men holding chairs in that subject to-day would acknowledge him to be their master. His interest in the development of mathematical research did not interfere with his devotion to philosophy and the classics, and he probably had few equals in his knowledge of cellular pathology. He was an inspiring teacher; his laboratory was a rallying point for medical students and newly qualified physicians in search of advice and guidance.

Biography  Rohatyn of Boris Tverskoy = Domestic and foreign politics = The year 1425 was devastating for the Principality of Tver. After the sudden death of Vasily I of Moscow, in the same year plague killed three Grand Dukes of Tver: Ivan Mikhailovich, Boris' father Aleksander Ivanovich and brother Jury Aleksandrovich. Thus Boris Aleksandrovich became the ruler of the principality. At the beginning of his reign the muscovite Grand Prince Vasily II was very young, so the power was concentrated in hands of his warden Vytautas. That was the last chance for Tver to prevent Moscow from complete dominance. In 1427 Boris I came to service of Vytautas together with Ivan III of Ryazan, still staying the ruler of Tver. However, in 1430 Vytautas died and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania immensed in the internal strife. Meanwhile in Rus' started the Muscovite Civil War, that weakened the Moscow princes and let the Principality of Tver more independence. In 1454 with the death of Dmitry Shemyaka the war was ended, and both Boris I and Ivan III of Ryazan swore their allegiance to Moscow. To tie this alliance, in 1454 Boris married his daughter Maria to Ivan, the future Grand Prince of Moscow. With the help of Saint Jonah, Boris promised Vasily to always support their children and Moscow's interests. During his reign, the story of Third Rome (\\"the second Constantinople\\") started in Tver, when the monk Foma (Thomas) of Tver had written The Eulogy of the Pious Grand Prince Boris Alexandrovich in 1453.Robert Auty, Dimitri Obolensky (Ed.), An Introduction to Russian Language and Literature, p.94, Cambridge University Press 1997, The Kremlin Armoury keeps one of the Boris's hunting artefacts - the Bear spear. Marriages and family He first married to Anastasia Andreevna of Mozhaysk, Dmitry Donskoy granddaughter. They had a daughter Maria of Tver (future wife of Ivan III of Moscow). The second marriage was to Anastasia Alexandrovna of Suzdal, daughter of Aleksander Vasilyevich Shuysky. She gave Boris two sons - Mikhail III of Tver and Alexander (died between 1454-1455). In 1485 she tried to hide Mikhail's treasury and sentenced to exile in Pereslavl-Zalessky.

She is an artist specializing in relief sculpture, mixed media, and fiber art including handmade cast paper. Her work is best known for its unusual focus on the theme of manhole covers and water covers, grates and drains. Her art has been exhibited widely throughout the United States and is in the collections in several museums. Biography Bobbi Mastrangelo was not originally trained as an artist, but instead graduated with a degree in Elementary Education from SUNY in Buffalo, New York, where she met her future husband Alfred. After a career as a teacher and while raising her children, she enrolled in art classes in New York state and studied printmaking and papermaking under the tutelage of professors including Dan Welden, Gail Cohen Edelman, Clare Romano and John Ross (authors of \\"The Complete Printmaker\\"). Mastrangelo's art theme developed during her studies with Master Printer Dan Welden, who advised her to focus on a theme or a style for her identity as an artist. After viewing photographs of previous sketches and paintings, her art history professor, Lawrence Alloway, pointed out that circular themes dominated. When she discovered photographs of manhole covers in an art history book, Mastrangelo realized that she had found the perfect theme. Using manhole cover rubbings and photos for reference, Mastrangelo developed a technique for creating trompe l‚Äôoeil relief works called \\"Grate Works\\" The realistic street and sidewalk scenes using manhole covers or water covers have been created in many media: collagraph prints on handmade paper, fiber art, foam relief works, assemblages and installations. Named by news reporters as Cover Girl or The Grate Lady, Mastrangelo continues to create art work for exhibitions, solo shows and commissions. Style and social statement Bobbi Mastrangelo's activities as a community leader against littering, environmental pollution, and in promotion of water conservation are themes reflected in her art. Manhole-themed collages made from handmade paper may incorporate found objects or impressions of street litter, bottle caps and discarded cigarette butts. Eco-conscious messages are sometimes written on the work itself. She created assemblages and an outdoor installation titled \\"Hazardous Waste Site\\" warning of the dangers of toxic and medical waste at Islip Art Museum‚Äôs \\"Outdoor Sculpture Now\\" exhibit on Long Island, New York in July 1989. Mastrangelo's body of work includes using diverse materials such as metal, wood, paint, paper, fiber, canvas, cement, builders‚Äô foam sheets and spray foam. Larger works measure up to 60 inches long, and may be framed or unframed wall pieces or three-dimensional sculpture. The artist submits one of her pieces or \\"art happenings\\" to be reproduced in color as a post card for National Postcard Week each year. These include themes of conservation, American Pride, anti- terrorism, the history of cover designs, roads and infrastructure.

June 29, 884?Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.According to the Zizhi Tongjian, Gao Renhou reported Yang's death on June 29, so it is not completely clear whether that was the date of Yang's death or Yang had died shortly before.) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who came to control Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) as its military governor (Jiedushi) due to his association with the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi. He later had a fall out with Tian and Tian's brother Chen Jingxuan, however, and in a subsequent military confrontation, Chen's forces, under the command of Gao Renhou, defeated his. When his own army turned against him in light of its defeat, he committed suicide.  Background and commission as military governor of Dongchuan  It is not known when Yang Shili was born or where he was from. It is known that he was a general of the eunuch-commanded Left Shence Army as of 880. That year, the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi, who was in command of the Shence Armies, faced with the prospects that the court of Emperor Xizong would face threats from the ever-growing agrarian rebellions, began to prepare a contingency flight plan from the capital Chang'an to the Shu (ËúÄ, i.e., modern Sichuan and Chongqing) region. Tian thus recommended four close associates‚ÄîYang, Tian's brother Chen Jingxuan, Niu Xu (ÁâõÂãó), and Luo Yuangao (ÁæÖÂÖÉÊù≤)‚Äîto be candidates to be military governors of the three circuits covering the region‚ÄîXichuan (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), Dongchuan, and Shannan West (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Emperor Xizong held a polo game for the four of them, with the stakes being that the best player would receive Xichuan. Chen did the best during that game, and therefore was given the most important of the three circuits, Xichuan. Later in the year, Yang was made the military governor of Dongchuan and Niu the military governor of Shannan West.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Around the new year 881, the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee toward Xichuan's capital Chengdu. He issued orders to Chen, Yang, and Niu, to keep the way to Chengdu open for him. Subsequently, when Emperor Xizong went through Mian Prefecture (Á∂øÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang) toward Chengdu, Yang paid homage to him there.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. In spring 883, while Emperor Xizong was still at Chengdu, he bestowed on Yang the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. At some point, he was also created the Duke of Zhongshan.Edict Against Yang Shili.  Break with Tian Lingzi and Chen Jingxuan  However, although Yang Shili was a close associate of Tian Lingzi's earlier, he eventually became resentful of the tight control that Tian and Chen Jingxuan had of Emperor Xizong. In particular, he had heard rumors that when Chen sent the officer Gao Renhou against the agrarian rebel Han Xiusheng (ÈüìÁßÄÂçá), Chen promised Dongchuan to Gao, and thus became angry that Chen promised his circuits to someone else without consulting with him. In spring 884, Tian, fearing that Yang would rise against him, decided to recall him to the imperial government to serve as You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), a highly honored position carrying little actual power. When Yang received the order, he was incensed and refused to follow the order; he executed the eunuch delivering the order as well as the eunuch monitor of Dongchuan, and rose, declaring that he was waging a campaign against Chen and declaring 10 crimes of Chen's. He advanced to Fucheng (Ê∂™Âüé, in modern Mianyang) and sent his officer Hao Juan (ÈÉùË†≤) to try to capture Mian Prefecture, but was unable to do so. Emperor Xizong stripped him of his posts and commissioned Gao to be the acting military governor of Dongchuan to attack him. Gao soon advanced to Deyang (Âæ∑ÈôΩ, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). Yang sent his officers Zheng Junxiong (ÈÑ≠ÂêõÈõÑ) and Zhang Shi'an (ÂºµÂ£´ÂÆâ) to defend Lutou Pass (ÈπøÈ†≠Èóú, in modern Deyang) to defend against Gao. Zheng and Zhang launched a night surprise attack against Gao's forces, initially having some successes and causing Gao's deputy, Yang Maoyan (Ê•äËåÇË®Ä), to flee in panic. However, Gao launched his counterattack and crushed Dongchuan forces. He chased them to Lutou Pass, and defeated them again there. They fled back to Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (Ê¢ìÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang), which Gao put under siege. Gao made initial attempts to capture the city, but could not do so. He then made a declaration to the people in the city that he would stop attacking for 10 days, and that he would resume his attack in 10 days if Yang Shili's head were not delivered. Several days later, Zheng launched a mutiny against Yang and attacked his headquarters. Yang committed suicide; Zheng cut off his head, delivered it to Gao, and surrendered. Gao arrested Yang's family members and delivered them to Chengdu. Chen nailed Yang's son to the city wall. When Chen's sons came out to view him, he yelled, \\"This will soon happen to you. Be prepared to receive it!\\" Gao was given Dongchuan Circuit to succeed Yang.

Cantor (born January 2, 1966) is a Canadian clinical psychologist and sexologist, specializing in hypersexuality and atypical sexual interests. He is a former editor of the journal Sexual Abuse and an expert on paraphilias. His neuroscience research on brain differences in pedophiles has been cited as evidence that pedophilia is something unchangeable and that people are likely born with it. Cantor is an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine, and the Head of the Law and Mental Health Research Section of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. He is former editor-in-chief of Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, and a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Sexual Aggression, the Journal of Sex Research, and Archives of Sexual Behavior.  *  Education and personal life Cantor grew up on Long Island, New York and attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, with a concentration in computer science and minors in mathematics and physics. During his studies at RPI, Cantor was a resident adviser in the student dormitories, where he provided peer counseling to students dealing with academic or personal issues. \\"I discovered that those activities were the highlight of my day more than the technology-based parts of my day,\\" he stated. He decided to pursue a doctorate in psychology at McGill University, which is where he found his research passion: the neurological underpinnings of sexual behavior. He obtained his MA in psychology from Boston University and PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University with a thesis on \\"Reversal of fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction in male rats.\\"  * He completed his postdoctoral training at CAMH, where he continued on staff. Cantor gave a speech about his personal experience of being a gay graduate student at the 1991 annual convention of the American Psychological Association. Research Cantor's research centers on the development of sexual interests, including sexual orientation and paraphilias. He has published on sex addiction, and atypical sexualities, including masochism, furries, vorarephilia, and others. Using magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brains of male pedophiles, Cantor reported biological differences from the brains of non-pedophile offenders.   He found a significant decrease in the amount of white matter in their brains compared to control subjects, in addition to having lower IQ, and being shorter than average. This was interpreted as suggesting a link to early brain development. Cantor insists, however, that these findings do not imply that pedophiles should not be held legally responsible for their actions.  According to Laura Kane, writing in the Toronto Star, Cantor's work has \\"greatly influenced the view among researchers that pedophilia has a biological basis.\\" Cantor is one of the co-authors of a 2008 paper by Ray Blanchard, which shaped the DSM-5 proposal of replacing the pedophilia diagnosis with pedohebophilic disorder, adding hebephilia as part of the definition of this disorder but at the same time differentiating it into three subtypes: pedophilic type (attracted to children younger than 11), hebephilic (attracted to children between 11‚Äì14), and pedohebephilic type (attracted to both age groups mentioned). The main argument in the paper for this addition is that the DSM-IV-TR definition of pedophilia is not sufficient to cover attraction to \\"physically immature persons\\". The proposal was criticized by Richard Green and Karen Franklin, mainly on the grounds that it pathologizes reproductively valid behavior in order to uphold current social and legal standards. It was not added to the DSM-5. Cantor's research suggests that sex addiction represents a variety of distinct problems, rather than a single unitary phenomenon. His typology of people seeking help for sex addiction includes paraphilic hypersexuals, avoidant masturbators, chronic adulterers, people with sexual guilt, and others. Views =Pedophilia and child sexual abuse = On CNN, Cantor expressed the opinion that society should make it easier for persons who are sexually attracted to children but have never committed any sexual offenses to receive support and assistance in staying offense free. In his view, it is the sexual offenses (child molestation) and not the sexual attractions (pedophilia) that merit social sanctions. \\"One cannot choose to not be a pedophile, but one can choose to not be a child molester.\\" Cantor has stated that, in his experience, pedophiles who commit sexual offenses against children \\"do so when they feel the most desperate‚Äîwhen they have nothing to lose, nothing in their lives worth protecting.\\" He recommends that therapists use cognitive behavioral therapy and other techniques to reduce feelings of isolation and hopelessness so that pedophiles can lead \\"productive, offense-free lives.\\" \\"We can't seem to be able to change [pedophilia],\\" Cantor said in an interview. \\"The only logical thing left to us is to help these people lead as productive and healthy a life as possible. For some people, that's life basics: a regular job, a place to live, having a secure life worth protecting and worth obeying the law for... When we make it impossible for them to find a job or a place to live, they have a life that isn't worth protecting.\\" Cantor stated that the online group Virtuous Pedophiles‚Äîa group for pedophiles who acknowledge having a sexual interest in children, and whose members share the belief that sexual activity between adults and children is wrong and always will be‚Äîcould help prevent child sexual abuse. He said such sites work by providing support to people who cannot seek help through traditional means for fear of being demonized‚Äîand reported to the police. He states that pedophiles \\"experience desire, affection, and heartbreak as strongly as anybody else. It is a deep, dark, long-lasting ache, and they can‚Äôt tell a soul.\\" Cantor has rejected any linkage between homosexuality and pedophilia, saying, \\"It's quite solidly shown in the scientific literature that there is absolutely no association between being a gay man and being a pedophile\\". He vocally opposed the boy scout bans on openly gay participants: \\"Indeed, if history has taught us anything, it's an environment that fosters shame and secrecy that facilitates instances of abuse.\\" =Sex addiction= In an interview about sex addiction and hypersexuality, Cantor expressed mixed views. When asked if he believed sex addiction should be considered a mental illness, he said yes, but added that \\"I've seen a lot of people use the term 'sex addiction' for a lot of different reasons. It's very easy to imagine that someone would use the term to curry favour with the public, with the media or during a divorce, but this is hardly the only diagnosis that this happens to. People blame many different kinds of moral failings on many different things. But we also want to be very careful and not make the opposite mistake. Just because there are people who abuse the term and the concept, doesn't mean that there's no such thing.\\"/ Cantor has expressed dislike for labels being used to describe sexual addiction. He has said, \\"Because we know so little about people wanting to reduce their sexual behavior, it's important to avoid terms that assume one or another theory. The term 'sex addiction' implies that it works like substance addictions, even though we have no evidence for that. The term 'compulsive sexual behavior' implies that it's related to obsessive-compulsive disorder, even though we have no evidence for that either. I typically use the term 'hypersexuality' because it does not imply any theory or treatment, but that term isn't perfect either: there are people who refer themselves as 'hyper-' sexual, even though they engage in less (sometimes even much less) sexual activity than most other people.\\" =Transsexuality= Cantor has written that transsexuality is a phenomenon of the brain, stating that MRI research has verified the Blanchard theory of there being two different kinds of male-to- female transsexuals. One of these types (called \\"homosexual transsexuals\\") have brains like gay men, which are mostly male with some features more common among women, and another type (called \\"autogynephilic transsexuals\\" or \\"heterosexual transsexuals\\") which also have brains that differ from typical, but not with features like those of women. In a subsequent article, Anton Guillamon, another neuroscientist studying transsexuality said, \\"Cantor seems to be right.\\" Cantor wrote that transsexuals deserve a \\"bill of transsexual rights,\\" saying that expressions of such rights are overdue. \\"People choose whether to transition, but one does not choose to be dysphoric about the sex they were born into.\\" =BDSM= Referring to research comparing BDSM practitioners with non-BDSM counterparts, Cantor said what was interesting was \\"how few differences and how small the differences were between these groups.\\" He added, \\"Overall, it doesn't look like there is anything special that makes a person curious about BSDM. Instead, it seems that people who are extroverted and open to experience in general will experiment with all kinds of things‚Äîsex being just one of them.\\" When asked by columnist Dan Savage to respond to a mother concerned about her son developing into a sexual sadist, Cantor wrote, \\"It is true that psychopathic sex killers have violent sexual fantasies, but it doesn't work the other way around: Having violent sexual fantasies doesn't mean anyone is likely developing into a psychopathic sex killer. The great majority of people who enjoy violent (or violent-looking) porn are into healthy BDSM. Going just by the numbers, this is (by far) the most likely outcome‚Ä¶.Healthy members of BDSM/kink communities are essentially the opposite of psychopaths. Although they are sexually aroused by violent (or violent- looking) images, they are very highly attuned to the feelings of their partners and very much want to take extreme care never to hurt them. Their arousal includes the idea that what they're doing is providing pleasure, even though it might not look pleasurable to vanilla folks.\\" Public engagement Cantor has been quoted concerning several high-profile cases of unusual sexual behavior. Such cases have included politician Anthony Weiner, entertainers Bill Cosbyhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/health/when-rapists-weapon-is-a- drug.html and Mark Salling, former Subway spokesperson Jared Fogle, and incel attacker Alek Minassian. Cantor delivered the keynote address at the founding of the Netherlands Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers in 2015. In 2016, Cantor and his research were the subject of a documentary, I, Pedophile, which featured Cantor alongside interviews with pedophilic men. The program followed Cantor to the Prevention Project Dunkelfeld in Berlin, the other only centre in the world conducting research on the brain basis of pedophilia. In 2017, it was nominated for but did not win the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television award for best social/political documentary.2017 winners Cantor maintains a blog about sex research issues, Sexology Today.

Life A Sentimental Journey by Laurence Sterne Newton was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the twelfth child and youngest son of Henry Newton, a customs official, and Ann, his wife, daughter of Gilbert Stuart, snuff manufacturer at Boston, Massachusetts, of Scottish descent, and sister to Gilbert Stuart the portrait painter. His parents left Boston in 1776 as the British withdrew; but on the death of his father in 1803 his mother returned with her family to Charleston, near Boston. Newton was intended for a commercial career, but was taken on as a pupil by his uncle, Gilbert Stuart. Newton came to Europe with an elder brother, and studied painting at Florence. In 1817 he visited Paris on his way to England and there met Charles Robert Leslie, as well as Washington Allston and David Wilkie. After visiting the Netherlands Newton went with Leslie to London, and entered as a student at the Royal Academy. He revisited America for a short time and there married Sarah Williams Sullivan, granddaughter of James Swan (financier), Hepzibah Swan and James Sullivan (governor), returning to England with his wife. In 1827 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1829 and an academician in 1832. Soon after his election to the Academy he started suffering from mental illness, and was placed in an asylum at Chelsea. He continued to paint there, where he died suffering from consumption, at Chelsea on 5 August 1835. He was buried in St Mary's Church Wimbledon. His grave is clear to see in the north end of the churchyard. His wife Sarah had returned to America with their daughter Annie Stewart Newton a few months before, and subsequently remarried. Works Portrait of Washington Irving Newton first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818, sending portraits in that and the five following years, including one of Washington Irving, with whom he had become acquainted through Leslie. In 1823 he exhibited at the royal academy Don Quixote in his Study, the first of the subject-pictures drawn from poetry or romance with which his name was subsequently identified. It was followed by M. de Pourceaugnac, or the Patient in Spite of Himself (1824), The Dull Lecture (1825), and Captain Macheath upbraided by Polly and Lucy (1826); this last picture was purchased by the Marquis of Lansdowne, who also collected at Bowood The Vicar of Wakefield reconciling his Wife to Olivia (1828) and Polly Peachum. Two pictures, The Forsaken and The Lover's Quarrel, were engraved in The Literary Souvenir for 1826; the first with verses by Letitia Elizabeth Landon and the second with an accompanying unsigned story, later attributed to Maria Jane Jewsbury; this latter was in the Dover House collection, and, with The Adieu and another picture by Newton, was sold at Christie's on 6 May 1893. The Prince of Spain's Visit to Catalina (1827) was purchased by the Duke of Bedford and engraved in The Literary Souvenir for 1831. Two pictures by Newton, Yorick and the Grisette (1830) and The Window or the Dutch Girl (1829), were purchased by Mr. Vernon and passed with his collection to the National Gallery; a third, Portia and Bassanio (1831), forms part of the Sheepshanks collection in the South Kensington Museum. Newton painted numerous other pictures, which found immediate purchasers, and were nearly all engraved. Among them were: Lear, Cordelia, and the Physician (Lord Ashburton), Abbot Boniface (Earl of Essex), The Duenna (royal collection), and The Importunate Author. He painted several portraits, including those of Thomas Moore, Sir Walter Scott, and Lady Theresa Lister. In 1842 a collection of engravings from his pictures was published with notices by Henry Murray, F.S.A., entitled The Gems of Stuart Newton, R.A. A portrait of his mother, Anne Stuart Newton, resides at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Literary connections Newton's picture of A Girl at her Devotions is twice poetically examined by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, firstly in her Poetical Catalogue of Pictures in The Literary Gazette (1823), as Different Thoughts; Suggested by a Picture by G. S. Newton, No. 16, in the British Gallery, and representing a Girl looking at her Lover's Miniature., and again in her Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures in The Troubadour (1826), as A Girl at her Devotions. A similar rendition of his painting The Disconsolate appeared in the Literary Gazette, 1829, with her poem Lines on Newton‚Äôs Picture of the Disconsolate. In addition to the picture illustrated by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in The Literary Souvenir mentioned above, she wrote a further poetic illustration to The Gentle Student in The Amulet, 1833.

She was born Pearl Eleanor Weiss on October 26, 1910 and at age three, was recognized as a child prodigy on the keyboard. At age four, she sang, danced and played concert grand at Chicago's Majestic (Shubert) Theatre. As a child, she studied piano with Rudolph Gantz and Florence LeClare. At age eleven she studied with Robert Bing at Glen Dillard Gunn School in Chicago's Fine Arts Building and Jessica Wiley at the Bush Conservatory of Music on the North Side. Her early studies on organ were with Edward Benedict in the Kimball building and Dean Fossler at the Gunn School. Miss White first played organ professionally at age 13 at the Virginia Theatre and later at the Echo Theater in Des Plaines. Al Carny, organist for station WCFL, recommended her for her next position‚Äîcutting master piano rolls in Chicago for the Capitol Music Roll Company. From 1925-32, White cut more than 100 rolls () which appeared on labels such as Capitol, Imperial, Supertone, American and Columbia. As the Capitol company also made rolls for many coin- operated nickelodeon and orchestrion type instruments, many of her performance also survive in this format, with added orchestration from instruments built into these coin-operated instruments (such as drums, pipes, etc.) She also worked as substitute organist at the Uptown, Tivoli, Granada, Belmont and Embassy Theatres around this time. White played the North Center Theatre from 1928 to 1932 and also had a six-week run at the Chicago Theatre. As the need for organists in theaters diminished with the arrival of sound pictures, Pearl White began to perform on radio, first appearing on WBBM in 1929. In 1944 she joined the full-time staff of WIND providing background music and was also heard on WCFL. She was also considered to be an accomplished musical arranger and provided arrangements to the Phil Harris orchestra among others. The hallmark of her hard-driving jazz style is interlocking chords alternating between the right and left hands which she dubbed \\"double stuff\\". White enjoyed a renaissance late in her career when theatre organs were removed from failing, aged theatres and installed in alternate venues. She performed with Al Melgard at Chicago Stadium on the giant Barton organ in 1962 and was featured artist at the in Shea's Theatre in Buffalo. She also played for the Chicago Area Organ Enthusiasts' conventions of 1965 and 1969 and provided organ accompaniment at silent film revival showings and made guest appearances at the Elm Skating Rink. Despite a long and successful musical career, Pearl White made only one commercial recording showcasing the blazingly fast jazz technique for which she earned the nickname, \\"The Fireball\\". Entitled \\"Pearl White in Nostalgia and Flame\\", it was made at the Patio Theatre in Chicago in 1968 on her own label. Pearl White died on May 11, 1978.

It tells the story of Evan Evans, who owns and manages a ballet company in the Principality of Monaco with an iron fist.  Summary  The film opens in the contemporary dance company of Evan Evans (Louis de Fun√®s). To him, weight gain and personal lives are forbidden; the dancers must dedicate themselves body and soul to the dance. One of the dancers decides to leave the troupe to get married, so Evans enlists the help of his nephew Philippe, (Olivier de Fun√®s), and his assistant Fran√ßoise (No√´lle Adam) to conduct auditions and to find a new star. He falls under the spell of newcomer Endrika's (Puck Adams) talent, and enthusiastically welcomes her into the troupe. Like the other members, Endrika is asked to end all romantic engagements, even as Fran√ßoise is enjoying a secret affair. Upon learning of her relationship, Evans ends the romance by taking a recording of a conversation between Philippe and Fran√ßoise wherein Philippe is rebuked. Evans is able to break up Fran√ßoise and her lover Franco Buzzini (Franco Fabrizi) by playing the tapes over a phone call to him. During a tour in Italy, Endrika is forced to pick up her secret son from his foster family, which she has concealed from the rest of the troupe. Unable to find a nanny quickly, she decides, on Fran√ßoise's advice, to make Evans believe, by means of a letter, that the child was his nephew's from one of his previous tours in Italy. Evan Evans then asks Philippe for an account, in order to confirm the story and to find out the mother. Philippe believes that the story is true, and tells Evans that the child must be his and that the mother must be a young Sicilian woman (Paola Tedesco) with whom he had an affair. Evans decides to go and meet the girl's parents, in order to clarify matters. When he arrived in Italy, he discovers with horror that the baby boy is not hers, but that she had indeed had a little girl with Philippe, whom he inherits and is obliged to take back to the hotel. Evan Evans asks his nephew again to find out who else the little boy's mother might be. Philippe decides the mother must be must be the maid of a Roman marquis (Franco Volpi). Evans goes to visit the Marquis, and learns that he has married his maid himself, and that the maid has never had a child. Confused, he returns to the hotel.

It is mostly found on sand-hills or in the broad sandy beds of semi-dry rivers, and only very rarely in fields, and then in the vicinity of sandy tracts.  Description  Like the Turkmenian fox, the white-footed fox has a primitive, infantile skull compared to those of its northern cousins. It is smaller than the Afghan red and hill foxes, and never exhibits a red phase in its winter coat, nor the silvery, hoary phase of the Afghan red fox. It closely resembles the unrelated Bengal fox in size, but is distinguished by its longer tail and hind feet. As adults, their pelts are easily distinguished from other subspecies by the presence of a very distinct pale patch on each sides of the back behind the shoulders, which is overlapped by a dark, transverse stripe over the shoulders in front of the light patches. The colour on the back varies from brownish yellow to rusty red with slight admixture of white, while the flanks are whitish or greyish. The outer surface of the limbs are iron- grey or rufous, while the inner side of the forelegs and the whole front of the hind legs are white. The face is rufous, with dark markings around the eyes. The underparts are slaty in hue. The chin and the centre of the chest is white. The ear-tips are black or dark brown and paler at the base, lined with whitish hairs. The tail is almost the same colour as the back, but is less rufous on the sides and beneath. Most of the tail's hairs are black, and may form a dark ring at the end of the tail. The tip is white.  Behavior  It is similar in habits to the hill fox, but its diet is more carnivorous than that of other subspecies, and its prey is more restricted to gerbils and sand rats, due to the more barren habitat it occupies.

Early life Samuel Goldstein, as he is most commonly known, was born May 10, 1966, in, Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, into a traditional Jewish immigrant family from Egypt and Lebanon. He was educated at Col√©gio GIMK (Grupo Integrado Magdalena Khan). Goldstein spent his early youth between Colombia, Uruguay and Brazil, where his father Sami Goldstein relocated as an IBM executive. Later, in his high school years, they lived in Wellesley, MA and White Plains, NY. He then returned to Brazil and began a four-year Bachelor of Business Administration program at Universidade Santa √örsula. There, he also attended two years of Electrical Engineering Studies. He graduated with honors from USU in 1988. He holds a specialization in Finance from the prestigious Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas and has completed a Harvard Business School LNV course with a specialization in entrepreneurship. He is a Brazilian Citizen and speaks fluent English and Spanish and can communicate fairly in French. Career While still at USU he founded Microfix; the first combined PC and Apple maintenance and support center in Rio de Janeiro, which he later sold to one of the largest IBM resellers in Brazil, SPE DATA. He has also branched into several areas of business, including civil construction, Internet-based services, general contracting, food and beverage importing and distribution and wholesale construction materials. He brought to Rio de Janeiro and was the exclusive distributor of RENNER / Du Pont paints, where he introduced the brand to the construction market and created the concept stores CENTRO DE PINTURAS, later widely spread by RENNER all over Latin America. During the height of the \\"dot com\\" bubble burst, he founded Construbid.com (online marketplace for civil construction supplies), later joining forces with a few important Brazilian groups, with initial investments from IDEIASNET, the first Brazilian internet fund to go public in BOVESPA, and, CEMEX, (the world's largest cement and concrete company) which invested in the business valuating it at $18 Million. The marketplace was later acquired by some of the investors and evolved into a buying portal development company for the construction industry, which has been building these services for the main companies in this market. He was the co-founder of Trump Realty Brazil together with Brazilian entrepreneur Ricardo Bellino and real-estate mogul Donald Trump in his first venture in Latin America, a $200 Million development called Villa Trump in S√£o Paulo; all of which was fully funded by two Brazilian venture groups, Ventura, owned by founders of Ach√® Laboratories and Aktiv, from the founders of Chocolates Garoto (acquired by Nestl√®). In 2006 left his executive duties as the CFO of Trump Realty Brazil, but remained on the board of directors and as a major shareholder. Later that year he teamed up with Ernst & Young and international businessman Ricardo Bellino to create The Entrepreneurs Institute (INEMP); to promote entrepreneurship in Brazil and the Entrepreneurs of the Year Awards. He and his partners successfully sold Trump Realty Brazil to a large Brazilian investment consortium that same year. Between 2006 and 2009, he and Mr. Bellino, under the umbrella of their consulting company Gold&Bell;, developed and launched the School of Life project, an entrepreneurship educational and motivational program that was taught on over 700 schools of the Microlins chain, the largest network of professional training franchises in Brazil. The project has spun off and is currently and independent education platform, on and offline, with partnerships with entrepreneurial groups in Spain and Silicon Valley. In this same period, they have also developed a project called Casas Brasileiras, a partnership with wholesaler giant Ponto Frio, building company Tenda and TV Record television network, promoting the sales of homes, appliances and financial services for Brazilian expatriates in the USA. In 2007, he co- founded with the legendary inventor of the super models, John Casablancas, creator of Elite Models, the StarSystem project, that came to be one of the most active and successful model scouting projects in the world. He also managed the business during its startup period of almost one year. In 2009 he launched in Brazil the first anti-hangover drink, developed by French scientists in 1996 and commercialized under the name Security Feel Better. In January 2010, he launched Security Feel Better in the United States of America and also in LATAM. In the beginning of 2012, he advised a group of investors in the acquisition and re-structuring of Loosho.com, the first Brazilian makeup e-commerce, and, later in that same year, joined the company as a partner, jointly heading the operation with designer and cosmetics market expert Suzana Rosenfeld, re-vamping platform, ERP, logistics, digital marketing and expanding from make-up to a diversity of products, positioning the company to be one of the leading e-tailers in the country. In 2014, he advised an important family office, the Mega Group, and was invited to join the group as a partner and Chief of Business Development. In 2015, he was given the mission of managing MEGA/Transreta, the heavy equipments rental operation of the Mega Group and Lorentzen Group, which is undergoing a massive restructuring and turnaround process due to adversities in the economy and specially on its main client base, the construction, oil&gas; and infra- structure sectors. In 2018, after finishing a complete turnaround of MEGA/Transreta, was invited by one of its former shareholders (Grupo LORINVEST) to structure a distressed assets fund, and, to oversee new investment opportunities.

The locomotive was designed by Tekhnologii Relsovogo Transporta (TRTrans), a joint venture between Transmashholding and Alstom. An order for 200 locomotives was placed in 2010, and the first production unit formally presented in 2012. Design The EP20 was developed by an Alstom-TMH joint venture \\"TRTrans\\", established in Novocherkassk, by French, Belgian, and Russia based engineers. One specification for the design was the ability to haul 24 coaches at 160 km/h or 17 coaches at 200 km/h on straight level track. The EP20 has a modular design. The locomotive body consisted of an underframe and sidewalls, with removable roof segments, and separately manufactured cab units. The driving cab modules were sourced from PKPP MDC (Ukraine); the cab design included a progressive deformation steel cage for impact absorption, and incorporated heating and air-conditioning. Access was via side doors in the main bodyshell, accessed via cab unit rear doors. PKPP MDC also supplied washrooms (2 per unit), incorporating a retention toilet system supplied by EVAC. The locomotive body had a central corridor connecting the end cabs, with equipment located on either side. The electrical system included four pantographs (2 for DC, 2 for AC). For AC drive a body mounted 9.3 MW transformer outputs 6 separate traction outputs at 1650 V, and a separate heating winding. The 1650V output is rectified to 3000 V DC; under 3 kV operation the input is connected directly through an intermediate diode four quadrant chopper. DC smoothing is via 8.550 MW rated inductances located under the locomotive. The DC link supplies six IGBT three phase inverters (grouped in three sets of two, one set per bogie), each driving a traction motor. The system allows individual axle control including anti-slip, as well as electrical dynamic braking. The traction motors are three phase asynchronous machines (DTA-1200 model, developed by NEVZ). They are suspended in the bogies and decoupled from the non-rotational motions of the driving wheels. The connection between motor and reduction gear is via a diaphragm coupling, and the gearbox output drives a hollow shaft connected to the axle via a flexible coupling. The bogie suspension system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods connected to a low lying connection at the bogie pivot centre. Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking. The locomotives are designed to operate in winter conditions down to , and incorporates underframe snowplows. The locomotive design was proposed as the base for a number of design variants: a single unit dual voltage freight variant E20, and dual unit dual voltage freight variant 2ES20, as well as single voltage DC and AC machines. Additional variants with a design derived from the EP20 are freight and passenger 4 axle Bo'Bo' based machines. History By 2007 Russian Railways had identified a need for 230 units of a series of new electric locomotive, designated EP20; at that time Transmashholding (TMH) was seeking a foreign partner to form a joint venture for the production of the locomotives. In late 2007 TMH entered into a joint venture with Alstom; the cooperation between the two companies was later extended, leading to Alstom taking a 25% stake in TMH in 2009.See article Transmashholding, section Alstom joint venture In May 2010, RZD placed an order for 200 EP20 locomotives, to be supplied in the period 2011 to 2020. The first locomotive was presented at Expo 1520 in Moscow in September 2011. In February 2013, Transmashholding and Russian Railways signed a 40-year contract for maintenance of the EP20. =Production= The first of the production series of the EP20 was official handed over in late 2012, at a ceremony attended by Dmitry Medvedev, and high officials of Alstom, Transmashholding, RZD and V. Golubev, Governor of the Rostov region. The delivery rate to Russian Railways is expected to be of the order of 3 per month. The locomotives were expected to be used on for the 2014 Winter Olympic games on Moscow-Sochi trains. The first 36 units had much of the electrical equipment (some auxiliary units, circuit breakers, transformer, and electronic control for the traction system) supplied by Alstom from, and integrated into new standardized locomotive platform developed by Transmashholding, the remainder also will be supplied by TMH, and the locomotives assembled at TMH's Novocherkassk plant. The initial batch of locomotives had pantograghs from Faiveley, transformer and DC inductors from ABB, disc brakes from Knorr Bremse, and mechanical drive (gear, hollow shaft) from Henschel Antriebstechnik. A joint venture between Alstom and TMH, \\"RailComp\\" will establish a production site at Novocherkassk to supply traction drives for the remaining 164 units of the order. In 2013 Voith was awarded a contract to supply the mechanical part of the traction drives (SEH-525 single stage helical gear to hollow shaft drive) for 164 units (804 drives). =Testing= EP20-001 began testing at VELNII's test track at Novocherkassk in April 2011 and later at the Shcherbinka test track. In April 2012 certification testing began on the Belorechenskaya to Maykop line (see North Caucasus Railway). A second prototype EP20-002 began testing in October 2011.

Located throughout Imerina, the central area of the highlands of Madagascar, the sites were often ancient capitals, the birthplaces of key public figures, or the tomb sites of esteemed political or spiritual leaders. The first set of sacred sites was designated by early 17th-century king Andrianjaka. The notion was re- sanctified under late 18th-century king Andrianampoinimerina, who replaced several of the earlier sites with new ones. More than 12 sites were thus designated as sacred over time, although the notion of twelve sacred hills was perpetuated because of the significance of the number 12 in Malagasy cosmology. Today, little concrete evidence of the former importance of many of these sites remains, but the significant archeological and cultural heritage of several of the sites has been preserved. The historic significance of the sites is best represented by the Rova of Antananarivo at Analamanga, the ancient fortified city at Alasora, the houses and tombs of the andriana (noble class) at Antsahadinta and the ancient fortifications and palaces at Ambohimanga, protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001. History According to popular legend, King Andrianjaka (1610‚Äì1630) declared twelve hills in Imerina (the central region of the Highlands of Madagascar) to be sacred due to their historical, political or spiritual significance to the Merina people. King Andrianampoinimerina (1787‚Äì1810) designated twelve hills in his turn, including several of those first identified by Andrianjaka. Most of these hills served as locations of the capitals of rival kingdoms conquered by Andrianampoinimerina and united under his rule, and many are also the seat of power of historic kings and queens of the Merina dynasty. Key sites Twelve is a sacred number in Merina cosmology and it is commonly said that Andrianampoinimerina had twelve wives and installed one on each of the twelve sacred hills throughout his kingdom.Administration coloniale. Notes, reconnaissances et explorations, Volume 4 Imprimerie officielle de Tananarive, 1898. In reality, he had more than twelve wives, and there are more than twelve hills surrounding Antananarivo that claim sacred status.Labourdette, Jean-Paul and Auzias, Dominique. Madagascar.

Ruling from Imerimanjaka, vazimba Queen Rangita (1500‚Äì1520) and her brother Andrianamponga gave the site its current name. Under Rangita's daughter, Queen Rafohy (1520‚Äì1540), the capital of the region was moved from Imerimanjaka to Alasora. Some of the monumental features of the site were added upon the orders of her son, King Andriamanelo (1540‚Äì1575), including the hadivory and hadifetsy (defensive trenches around the town), as well as the vavahady, a town gate protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier and shaded by aviavy (fig trees), symbolic of royalty.

A mixed-race Qu√©b√©cois with a Haitian background, he witnessed his mother's death at his father's hands when he was eight years old, an event that scarred him for life.

They invite him to join their gang, promising him money and power, everything he's dreamed of but that he knows polite society will never offer him. For a teenager with few hopes for the future, one highly susceptible to influence, it's not an offer to refuse. Even if it means bending to the will of a violent and domineering gang leader. Even if his initiation is to kill a stranger. Several years later, crime and violence have brought Jecko to the pinnacle of an underworld empire. In this world where riches and respect are earned with a gun, he feels perfectly at home. A number of events have him reconsidering the path before him. With the option of pulling one final crime, his father due out of prison shortly and hopes of building his own family, it's time for Jecko to grab the steering wheel of his destiny.

The advowson was held by the abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries after which is passed to Thomas Wriothesley and his descendants. The mediaeval parish church was demolished in 1814 and the present Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was consecrated on a site about northwest of it. The present church was designed by the architect John Morlidge in a Georgian Gothic Revival style for Sir Francis Dugdale Astley. The church is built of Bath stone. It consists of a nave with the south porch attached, chancel with a south chapel, and a west tower. The nave is by , while the chancel is long and wide. The tower holds six bells cast by James Wells of Aldbourne. The interior contains the bowl of the Norman font from the old church, on a later base and shaft. The bowl is decorated with scallop shaped decorations separated by inverted \\"V\\" shapes. There are many memorials to the Astley family. There is a large gallery above the west end of the nave, which when it was built held a barrel organ. The organ was replaced by one in the vestry in 1879.

There exists the MHEG international standards for transmission of basic still images but these do not have universal receiver compatibility and are usually tied to and configured around a particular transmission operator's specific receivers (or a design of set-top box). In theory, it should not be a problem to create graphic images using the DVB television standards in order to allow text and graphics to accompany audio. However those who have attempted to do this discovered that the minimum bandwidth required for all set-top boxes to display graphics is not a great deal less than that needed for normal television (i.e. about 1.5 Mbit/s). This makes its use uneconomic for radio. Software developers thus devised proprietary ways in which low bandwidth images can be transmitted and yet still be received on all standard DVB receivers. Since 2002, such systems have been employed for transmission of still images on satellite services where it is the image that is of primary importance and the sound is secondary. The UK company WRN Broadcast adapted the systems so they can provide images that better support radio broadcasts and named the system \\"Radio with Pictures\\".

A coalition was formed that focused on promoting and implementing science education into the region. At one of the first meetings, John Rosenburg proposed an ambitious plan: to build a science center and planetarium similar to the one in Gastonia, North Carolina, his hometown. Rosenburg had already created the proposal for the East Kentucky Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology, which gained support of State Representative Greg Stumbo.Attractions Floyd County Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved on 2010-09-27 After outreach education operations in 1997 proved that the majority of population within the region had difficulty in understanding mathematics and science, the organization began developing hands-on programs that would help overcome these issues. In 1998, the Kentucky General Assembly appropriated $1.6 million for the construction of the building and another $1 million for the centers equipment. The awarded funds were based on figures provided by a consulting architect working under the assumption that costs were significantly lower than those required for a project built on the campus of a community college. The centers board of directors noticed this mistake and was forced to downsize the building plan. The new revised plans called for a facility, with an 85-seat, . planetarium, . exhibit area, . science classroom, gift shop and offices. In 2000, the organization received an additional $1 million for the construction of the building. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on November 9, 2001 and construction began in September 2002. Finally in March 2004, the East Kentucky Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology, which was shortened to the Eastern Kentucky Science Center, opened to the public.

Established in 1851 by Redding Blount, the city has gone from being a small frontier outpost vulnerable to Seminole Indian attack to being the county seat of Polk County, a county with more than half a million people. Located near the geographic centers of both peninsular Florida and Polk County, Bartow has always been in the middle of the big changes which have taken place in Florida even though the city has always tried to maintain the status quo; located at the headwaters of the Peace River less than an hour from the bustling metropolises of Tampa and Orlando, Bartow has remained a small city in spite of the rapid growth around it. Ironically, Bartow may be on the verge of growing just as the rest of Florida's growth is starting to slow down. With the annexation of over 18,000 acres of former phosphate land owned by the Clear Creek Development Company, Bartow has more than quadrupled in size and is projected to triple in population within the next twenty years. There is an old Bartow saying that no town has produced more prominent people per capita since Jamestown. That may be a point which is open to debate, but there is no doubt that Bartow has produced its share of prominent people in a myriad number of ways; Former Florida governor and U.S. senator Spessard Holland, controversial Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, Playboy Playmate Jaime Faith Edmondson, Tony-winning actress Karen Olivo, Winston Cup Stock Car Driver Rick Wilson, iconoclast Marshall Ledbetter, Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis, motorcross legend Bubba Stewart, and three United States generals are among the people who were born in, raised in, or in some way have a connection with the City of Oaks and Azaleas. Pre-Columbian era to statehood  The physiographic history of the Florida peninsula is one of constant expansion and contraction. At various times in its history, the Florida peninsula has been a series of small island with only small slivers such as the ridges in Polk County above water, and other times a much wider peninsula than it is today. It was during a time when Florida was at its widest that the first paleo-indians probably arrived in the Bartow area as they followed big game such as woolly mammoth southward. At the time, the climate of the area was much different than it is today; cooler, drier- probably similar to that found in the British Isles today. The first Paleo- indians reached the central Florida area near the end of the last ice age, as they followed big game south. These first Floridians were hunters and small gatherers and left little impact on the area. As the ice melted and sea levels rose, these Indians gave way to the first Indians which set up permanent residence. These Indians thrived on the Florida peninsula for thousands of years and it is estimated that by the time the first Spanish conquistadors arrived, there were 250,000 Native Americans living on the Florida peninsula. Some of these first early tribes were the Tocobago, Timucua and the Calusa. In 1527, a Spanish map showed a settlement near the Rio de la Paz. The arrival of the Spanish turned out to be disastrous to these Native American tribes. Within 150 years, the majority of the pre-Columbian Native American peoples of Florida had been wiped out. Those who had not succumbed to diseases such as Small Pox or Yellow Fever were either killed or enslaved. Little is left of these first Native Americans cultures in Polk County except for scant archeological records including a few personal artifacts and shell mounds. Eventually the remnants of these tribes would merge with Creek Indians who arrived from the north and become the Seminole Indian tribe. Meanwhile, European powers were struggling to establish themselves on the Florida peninsula. The Spanish, French and British all gained and lost control over Florida before the United States finally gained permanent control of the peninsula in 1819. By this time, the Seminoles had established themselves on the peninsula and proved to be an impediment to white settlement of Florida. At first, the United States attempted to force the Seminoles onto a large reservation covering much of Central Florida, which included the land now part of present-day Bartow. At the conclusion of the First Seminole War, the United States passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which attempted to remove most of the Seminoles to Oklahoma. Antebellum beginnings In 1845 Florida became the 27th state and the time seemed right for the part of Florida south of Gainesville to grow. This growth was slow at first: heat and humidity, dangerous wildlife, and uncharted swampland made a comfortable life in southern Florida problematic. A bigger potential threat were those Seminoles who had decided to stay instead of going to Oklahoma. These Indians were, for the most part, peaceful; but many white settlers felt uneasy about the continued Seminole presence around the Peace River and stories were told of attacks \\"not far away.\\" As a result, many of these early settlements were built as forts to discourage any Indian aggression. The Armed Occupation Act of 1842 prohibited settlement near the Peace River as that was considered Seminole land; however cattlemen eventually moved in from Tampa Bay and into the area surrounding the Peace River anyway. In 1851, the settlement of Fort Blount was founded by Redding Blount just west of current downtown Bartow. This settlement was eventually renamed Peace Creek or Peas Creek. As settlement grew, the residents began to plant citrus trees and build one room school houses and churches. Civil War About a month after Florida seceded from the Union, Polk County was formed from the eastern portion of Brevard County with a small sliver of Brevard County added. Records of the time indicate that there were three voting precincts at the time- Ft. Meade, Fort Fraser (near present-day Highland City), and Socrum (north of Lakeland). The first site chosen for the county seat was actually near present-day Highland City, but the war meant that the plans for building the seat would be delayed. At the time there were still few families living in Polk County. Like much of the south, the Civil War was a disaster for everyday life in Polk County. Commerce and education were nearly nonexistent near the end of the war. At war's end, there was only one school open in the entire county located in Bartow. Fort Meade, the largest city in the county at the time, was burned to the ground in May 1864. Reconstruction and the Gilded Age After the war, the county commission decided to rename the town Bartow after the first Confederate officer to die in the war. At this time, a wealthy cattleman named Jacob Summerlin donated a large part of the old Blount homestead. This land would be used to build the first Polk County courthouse, the first high school in the county, and two churches. This proved to be the crucial event in the development of both Bartow and Polk County. Although growth was slow at first and Bartow had less than 4 00 permanent residents by 1880, the town would grow exponentially in the last two decades of the 19th Century. In 1887 the first brick schoolhouse south of Jacksonville was built. This school named Summerlin Institute (now Bartow High School) would eventually become one of the most respected high schools in the south. Around the same time, the first library in central Florida would be built. By the turn of the century, Bartow would become the third most populous city in central Florida and the fifteenth most populous in the state. 20th century to present During the 20th century, Bartow grew slowly as the rest of the state experienced a huge population boom. In 1909, a new courthouse was built on the corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue. This courthouse is still standing and is the current site of the Polk County Historical Museum. As the city grew, a number of industries moved into the Bartow area. In the first few decades of the 1900s, thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the phosphate industry and Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States. After a succession of freezes north of Polk County, the county eventually became the leading citrus county in the United States and much of the agriculture of areas surrounding Bartow is citrus based. In 1941, the city built an airport northeast of town. This airport was taken over by the federal government during World War II. This airport would be the training location for many Army Air Corps pilots. This airport would eventually be returned to the city in 1967. In 2004, Bartow was severely impacted by three hurricanes which hit the area within a space of 44 days. The eye of all three hurricanes, Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, passed within of town. The damage from the three storms, especially Charley, was extensive. Every school in the county sustained some damage from the storm and were closed down for two weeks. For many months afterwards, blue tarps covering rooftops were a common site throughout the city. For most of the 20th century, Bartow's growth was modest, especially in comparison to the rest of the county and state. While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach. This has changed in the past decade after Connecticut financier Stanford Phelps had purchased the former Clear Springs phosphate land. When buildout of the Clear Springs development is completed by 2030, it is expected that the population of Bartow could nearly triple to over 45,000 residents. African Americans in Bartow According to the United States Census Bureau, the African American population of Bartow was 28% in 2000. As a city which has been an ideal representation of life in the Deep South for much of its history, the life experiences of whites and blacks in Bartow have differed over the years. The three iconic figures of Bartow history ‚Äì Francis Bartow the confederate general, Jacob Summerlin the slave-owning cattle king, and Spessard Holland the segregationist governor and senator ‚Äì have not only been white, but whites who seemed in opposition to the goal of civil rights for blacks. So the history of Bartow as told in historical records often omits the black history of the city of Bartow and its surrounding areas. A little known fact usually not found in books about the history of the area is that the first non-Indians to settle in the Bartow area was not the settlement which became Fort Blount. In 1818, a small group of escaped slaves from other states moved into the area south of Lake Hancock and founded a settlement called Minatti. This settlement was thirty years before the first white settlers arrived in the area and the people of this settlement were called Black Seminoles either because they were culturally Indian or had intermarried with them. Later, the first white settlers came and brought slaves into Peas Creek. The area on the west side of town in which the African American slaves dwelt was called the \\"Negro Quarters\\" or simply \\"The Quarters\\" by whites and \\"Over the Branch\\" by blacks. This area was geographically separated from the rest of Bartow by the McKinney Branch, a small creek which separated the wooded area west of town from the rest of the town. In 1901, Fred Rochelle a 16-year-old African-American, was lynched in a carnival-like atmosphere, allegedly for rape. In 1906, two African-Americans, John Black and Sam Hagin were lynched for attempting to quit a job.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004 then opened in a limited release on October 29, 2004 in New York CityNY Times Review and Los Angeles before widening to over 25 theaters across the US and Canada. A Silent Love is the first Canadian release made by Atopia, although it was shortly followed by another Hidalgo film, Imitation. The film is quasi-silent but when dialogue is used, it is substantially Spanish despite the film's Canadian production. Synopsis The protagonist, Norman Green, is a middle-aged film studies professor in Montreal. In an attempt to form a meaningful relationship, Norman joins an online dating website which allows him to woo a young Mexican woman with a passionate email. He then travels to Mexico to meet her. The dating website calculates that Norman has a 61% chance of success in this anticipated relationship. Upon meeting, Norman gives flowers to object of his affection, in a traditional attempt to woo her. However, he finds that the woman he'd been speaking to, Gladys, is strong, independent, and does not fit the role of the international bride which he was expecting. Norman also finds that Gladys is living with her widowed mother, Fernanda. While Gladys somewhat reluctantly agrees to marry Norman, she insists that her mother live with them for the first few months. Despite their best intentions, Gladys and Norman never settle into their marriage. Gladys is overwhelmed by the new culture around her, the language barrier and is always reminded that she was brought from a less affluent country to marry an older man. The implication being that Norman wanted a submissive wife. Their substantial age gap also causes disagreements within the relationship. Meanwhile, Norman develops romantic feelings for Fernanda, with whom he is more in tune and much closer in age, which the latter reciprocates. Ashamed of her feelings, which she deems inappropriate considering the circumstance, Fernanda returns to Mexico to put distance between them. Shortly thereafter, Norman joins her, where he confesses his love for her and desire to live life by her side. Amidst this, Gladys, who is newly divorced, chooses to stay in Montreal where she will start a new life.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/arts/movies/film-in- review-a-silent- love.html?sq=a+silent+love&scp;=2&st;=csehttp://www.filmsquebec.com/films/silent- love-federico-hidalgo/ Cast * Noel Burton as Norman * Vanessa Bauche as Gladys * Susana Salazar as Fernanada * Maka Kotto as Andre * Regina Orozco as Ana Fransisca * Jorge Zarate as Valdivia * Carmen Salinas as Georgina * Paula Jean Hixson as Molly Awards A Silent Love was nominated for 6 awards, and won 3: * nominated for best film at the Bogota Film Festival * nominated for best screenplay and best actress in a supporting role at the Genie Awards * win for best screenplay at the Brooklyn International Film Festival * win for best screenplay at the Miami Latin Film Festival * nominated for Best Canadian Film at the Vancouver Film Critics Circle https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344337/awards?ref_=tt_awd Reception Critical Response A Silent Love has been praised as a twist on the notorious \\"mail- order bride\\" trope.

Development William Bushnell Stout started in aviation working for Packard on the Liberty engine during World War I. He promoted early innovative designs, based on the 1915 innovations of German aviation engineer Hugo Junkers, such as a blended wing concept, and pioneered all-metal aircraft construction in America using Junkers-devised concepts. The 2-AT was a more conventional layout using the familiar and plentiful Liberty engine of the time. The first use of the nickname \\"Tin Goose\\" was applied to this aircraft by the news media. The name was later attributed to the Ford Trimotor.http://www.aerofiles.com/_ford.html Design The 2-AT was a high- wing conventional gear monoplane. The original design featured an open cockpit for the pilots, followed by an enclosed cockpit with opening side windows. The aircraft featured wallpaper, padded seats, semi-circular opening windows, and a bathroom. It was the first all-metal aircraft certified in America. It was eventually redesigned to accommodate three engines, becoming the Stout 3-AT trimotor, and again redesigned to become the more well-known Ford Trimotor. The aircraft was under development as a Stout aircraft when Ford bought all controlling interests, creating the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company. Development hastened with the infusion of resources from Ford. Stout's chief engineer, George H. Prudden, was credited for the new wing design using principles from Stout's earlier \\"thick wing\\" aircraft. Each 2-AT was powered by a Liberty engine, one example was tested with a Pratt and Whitney Wasp radial engine. Operational history The first flight was performed by Walter Edwin Lees at Selfridge Field. The windshield blew in locking the controls, forcing a landing on a frozen lake. In 1925 the 2-AT was demonstrated at the Ford National Reliability Air Tour by E.G. Hamilton. While just completing the event would have won an award, the 2-AT completed it with a perfect score.Flight - The Aircraft Engineer and Airships, \\"The Ford Reliability Tour\\" November 26, 1925 At the Air Tour, the first aircraft sale was announced. It was sold to John Wanamaker & Co. to haul passengers and freight between Philadelphia and New York. Wanamaker's was an early seller of Ford products, and in turn became the first reseller of Ford aircraft, displaying the aircraft in their New York showroom. The 2-AT was listed in their lineup for $25,000. The United States Postal Office ordered one model for airmail service. The aircraft was modified with a 500 hp Packard engine. Letter from first CAM flight in a 2-AT Florida Airways Stout 2-AT's. State Library and Archives of Florida The aircraft were put into service for the newly formed Ford Air Transport Service in 1925. The first 2-AT was built at the Stout factory in Dearborn and called the \\"Maiden Detroit\\". The aircraft was outfitted with a nickel-plated Liberty engine bought from a trophy case at the Marmon assembly plant. The other aircraft in the fleet were also 2-AT's, named \\"Maiden Dearborn I, II, III and IV\\". Initially the aircraft were for Ford's company use. The first scheduled commercial flights in America were begun when The \\"Maiden Detroit\\" flew 1,000 lbs. of freight between factories in Detroit and Chicago on April 14, 1925. Ford Air Transport served routes between Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland. The \\"Maiden Detroit\\" entered Contract Air Mail service on February 15, 1926. The aircraft flew from Detroit to Cleveland with the first commercial transport of air mail. The routes would be known as CAM-6 (Detroit to Cleveland), and CAM-7 (Detroit to Chicago). Four aircraft were sold to Florida Airways. The first three were given in exchange for a stake in the airline by Henry Ford. One was used on CAM-10 (Atlanta to Jacksonville). On May 18, 1926 at Argo, Illinois, a Ford Air Transport 2-AT Maiden Deaborn I was involved in the first fatal accident for a commercial US aircraft. The Contract Air Mail pilot crashed and was killed due to flight into poor weather conditions. In 1928, U.S. Commerce department declared the wings to be structurally unsafe. All remaining 2-AT's were scrapped. Variants * Stout 3-AT - A trimotor 2-AT powered with Wright J-4 engines.

He wrote two autobiographies, first The Heir of Slaves, in 1911 and second Bursting Bonds in 1923, in which he mentioned race-motivated attacks on African Americans, both in the urban riots of 1919 and by lynching in 1921. Biography Pickens, the son of freed slaves, was born on January 15, 1881 in South Carolina but mostly raised in Arkansas. He studied at multiple schools. He received bachelor's degrees from Talladega College (1902) and Yale University (1904), where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and awarded the Henry James Ten Eyck Prize;Okocha, Victor.

William Pickens (1881-1954) at Who‚Äôs Who in Colored America He married the former Minnie Cooper McAlpin(e), and they had three children. Pickens was a Methodist. He was buried at sea while vacationing with his wife on the RMS Mauretania. Career =Educational career= Pickens was fluent in and instructed several languages, including Latin, Greek, German, and Esperanto. He taught at his first alma mater, Talladega College, then at Wiley College. He was also a professor of sociology and a college dean at Morgan State College. =NAACP= Pickens was also an active and vocal member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Pickens was initially considered for the position of field secretary by the association, but instead it was given to James Weldon Johnson in December 1916. On January 12, 1920, Pickens was given the opportunity for the position of assistant field secretary by the NAACP executive secretary, John R. Shillady. Pickens finished teaching for the academic year at Morgan College, while concurrently accepting the position, which provided a $3,000 salary. He also served as a director of branches, 1920 ‚Äì 1940. January 15, 1923, Pickens joined the eight people group and sent the ‚Äú Garvey Must Go‚Äù letter to the U. S. August, 1927, Pickens wrote a letter to the New Republic that called for Garvey‚Äôs release from prison. Pickens once said, ‚ÄúColor had been made the mark of enslavement and was taken to be also the mark of inferiority; for prejudice does not reason, or it would not be prejudice‚Ä¶ If prejudice could reason, it would dispel itself.‚Äù =U.S. Treasury= Pickens was the director of the interracial section of the Treasury Department‚Äôs Saving Bonds Division from 1941 to 1950 where he was a travelling spokesperson for investing in WWII war bonds. In this role, he is said to have had more direct contact with the Negro masses than any other African American leaders in his time, but also spoke to European-American and mixed audiences. = Other = His address \\"Misrule in Hayti\\" won him the Ten Eyck Prize for oratory, but he would renounce its ideas ten years later. The address led to a conflict between him, Monroe Trotter, and Booker T. Washington. On February 1, 1943, Pickens was one of the 39 men named by Martin Dies as affiliates of \\"Communist front organizations\\" and urged Congress to refuse \\"to appropriate money for their salaries.\\" An amendment was quickly offered to the Treasury and Post Office Appropriations Bill in the House Appropriations Committee to remove funding for the salary of these 39 government employees. After it was discovered that Pickens was the only employee that would be covered by the appropriations bill, the initial amendment failed and a separate action proceeded to withhold solely the salary of Pickens. A few days later it became known that Pickens was the only black person in the list of 39; the appearance of racism along with a public push to give the named men a \\"day in court\\" persuaded the committee to instead create a sub-committee (the Kerr Committee) to investigate the Dies allegations. Pickens wrote to and met with people investigating the allegations. The Kerr committee did not name Pickens as being subversive or unfit. In 2002, Yale created the William Pickens Prize, named after Pickens Sr. for his contributions to the university.

This went part way to helping the Seasiders win promotion to Division One after securing second place at the end of the season. He made thirteen League appearances in 1970‚Äì71 as the club returned whence they had come twelve months earlier, after finishing bottom of the table. In 1971‚Äì72, during which he was loaned out to Halifax Town, Johnston made three substitute appearances, the last of these in a 4‚Äì2 victory over Burnley at Bloomfield Road on 1 April.

As in the previous book, The Snow Queen, characters from earlier books are either mentioned or appear as secondary characters Background The Sleeping Beauty was written by Mercedes Lackey as the fifth installment in her Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms series. Plot summary Lily is the godmother to the Kingdom of Eltaria, which is quite wealthy due to its vast number of mines. After its queen dies, Lily takes on the appearance of an evil sorceress, with the name \\"Sable\\", and marries its king in name only, so that he won't be trapped into marrying a real evil sorceress and Princess Rosamund won't have a wicked stepmother. However, this doesn't stop the Tradition from focusing on Eltaria, particularly on Rosa, who ends up with two Traditional paths tangled up and directed at her‚Äîthe Beauty Asleep and Snowskin. While her outer appearance is that of a Sleeping Beauty, Rosa ends up being attacked by the Huntsman and is captured by seven dwarves. However, unlike the ones in the Traditional tale, these dwarves are renegade ones, who shackle a chain about her ankle and turn her into their slave. Godmother Lily locates Rosa, and donning the disguise of an old bee-woman named Maggie, goes to help the Princess. Since there is no way to remove the chain from Rosa short of cutting her foot off or having the dwarves do it, Lily reveals herself and gives Rosa a potion that will simulate death. Meanwhile, Prince Siegfried of the Kingdom of Drachenthal arrives in Eltaria, with his companion, a Wise Bird. Siegfried is a Hero, but unlike most from his land, he is intelligent and listens to the good advice of the Bird. Siegfried encounters Rosa and plans to awaken her with a kiss, just as Godmother Lily is in the middle of performing an awakening spell. At the same time, another prince, Leopold of Falkenreid also encounters Rosa. The two princes get into a minor fight over who will kiss her, in which time Lily manages to complete the spell right before Leopold wins and tries to kiss Rosa. Rosa recovers from her ordeal and begins training as a Godmother, partly to relieve her boredom. Unfortunately, King Thurmand dies shortly after, leaving \\"Queen Sable\\" as Regent until Rosa turns of age at twenty-one. This means that their enemies will descend on Eltaria, intent on taking over, unless measures can be taken to prevent it. Godmother Lily, however, comes with a plan: for one hundred princes to come and take part in trials to see which one of them will win the hand of the princess. Adventurers are also allowed to take part, however, they are not housed at the castle like the princes. Siegfried and Leopold decide to stay and take part in the trials, and they strike a bargain to help each other through the trials until the last task. The first trial consists of a race on horseback, in full armor, with a break in the middle to herd three sheep into a pen (either doing it yourself, with or without magic, or hiring a shepherd) and line up a dozen eggs without breaking them. Siegfried, who understands the speech of animals, finds out that sheep love clover and bean plants, and gathers some for him and Leopold to use to herd the sheep, while Leopold buys them each a small dustpan and a wooden spoon to deal the eggs. The second test involves each prince being given a gold item that is mildly cursed‚Äîthey can only be free of it by adding the item to the hoard of a dragon that guards a mountain pass without harming him. Siegfried is cursed by having amphibians appear to fall from his mouth every time he speaks, while Leopold ends up with a curse that turns him to one of those morose poet-princes, who desire only to wear black, stay up at night, and write (usually bad) poetry and songs. Those two curses amuse the dragon immensely, which convince him to take the cursed items from them. The third trial involves the remaining princes answering a series of riddles. Meanwhile, another prince named Desmond has also been doing quite well at the trials, and has managed to attract the attention of Rosa, up until the time they eventually kiss and she finds out that there is no spark between them. By this point, Rosa and Siegfried have fallen in love. The final trial is announced, in which the remaining ten princes have to come up with a way to protect Eltaria for the present and future, and marriage is not a solution. The prince with the best answer will be declared the winner and receive Rosa's hand in marriage. The Huntsman turns out to be working for Desmond, and the two kidnap Rosa, invoking the Tradition by locking her in a tower with thorns surrounding it. The unicorn Luna drives the thorns away, while the Bird‚Äînow a Firebird‚Äîburns it. After a fight, Desmond is killed, the Huntsman and Jimson end up switching places, so that the former is trapped in the mirror world and the latter becomes human, Rosa is rescued. Siegfried, who had thought up of a solution to the final test just before Rosa being kidnapped, wins her hand in marriage by proposing they have good dragons guard the borders. \\"Queen Sable\\" steps down and proclaims Rosa and Siegfried to be Queen and King of Eltaria, after which she returns to her godmother's castle with Jimson, whom she realizes she has fallen in love with. In return for what Leopold has done, he is sent to wake the sleeping Shieldmaiden (Brunnhilde), with the two falling in love, marrying, and deciding to spend their life traveling and having adventures. Sequel in the Harvest Moon anthology In the Harvest Moon anthology, published in 2010, the story of Prince Leopold and Brunhilde continues. While doing their travels they end up in a country resembling ancient Greece. While they are resting a man in a black chariot comes up out of the ground and kidnaps Brunhilde, thinking she is Persephone. At the same time Hades is revealing himself to Persephone, who already knew who he was and agreed to go and be his consort. When they arrive in Hades's kingdom, they encounter a furious Brunhilde and the perplexing problem of how to get her back to the world of the living. Meanwhile, Leopold has taken one of the flying horses he and his wife received at the start of their adventures and goes off to confront the Gods. They inform him that Demeter has left and Leopold immediately takes action to make sure the people of the land are taken care of. While he is taking care of that, Persephone and Brunhilde are tasked with making a pomegranate grow in the Elysian Fields, the only place in Hades's kingdom where something edible has grown. In the end Persephone and Brunhilde successfully get one pomegranate to ripen and she earns the right to stay with Hades for part of the year. The solution to Brunhilde and Leopold's problem is found in a journey back to the world of the living, with Leopold in front being tempted and dealing with his own personal demons while not being able to turn around and look at Brunhilde, and Brunhilde behind having to work out her own internal problems without interfering in any way. They successfully complete the tasks and are reunited, with an added bonus: Brunhilde had demanded Leopold get some form of lasting immortality that did not backfire (such as making him grow old and live forever) and at the end of the story they are making it happen, even though it involves not being able to touch each other for a very long time.

Originating in the north-east of Lowland Scotland, he probably came from a family associated with the burgh of Aberdeen. Like many of his relatives, he flourished in the 15th-century Scottish church. After just over a decade at the University of Paris, Crannach became a servant of the then Dauphin (later king) Charles (VII). During his period in France he received provision as bishop of Caithness, but within four years was translated and consecrated bishop of Brechin. He was a prominent ambassador of James I and travelled abroad frequently during the 1430s and early 1440s. In the diocese of Brechin Crannach was usually absent until 1445, but was embroiled in a dispute with the archdeacon of Brechin Gilbert Forrester. Early years He was born around 1386 (or soon before), which is known because he was a Master of Arts in 1406, a requirement of which was being at least 20 years old.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 118 The name \\"de Crannach\\" comes from the former sheriffdom of Banff, either Crannach in Grange parish or Cranna in Marnoch parish. John's father was probably Laurence de Crannach (fl. 1398), burgess of Aberdeen, whose wife was named Christiana.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 118-19 Three of his brothers are known; one, William, was a prominent Augustinian canon who became abbot of Inchaffray (1430-1433 or 1435), while another, David de Crannach, was sub-dean of Dunkeld and dean of Brechin.Dowden, Bishops, p. 185; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 118; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 59, 151; Watt and Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 103 His third brother, Robert de Crannach, was precentor of Brechin from 1440 to sometime between 1453 and 1457, as well as dean of Dunblane (1430-1439 or 1440).Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 62, 107 His uncle, Adam de Crannach (also \\"de Aberdeen\\"), was also a prominent Augustistian, serving as abbot of Scone between 1418 and 1432.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 118; Watt and Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 200 A student of the University of Paris in the early 15th century, he was Bachelor of Arts in February 1405, and a Licentiate and Master of Arts in May 1406.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 119 He was regent of the Arts between 1406 and his departure from the university in 1417. The famous archdeacon of Aberdeen and poet, John Barbour, stood surety for him in 1406 and 1407. For some time, John was a student of theology, having become a Bachelor of Theology by autumn of 1416. He was also a participant in student and school affairs, being variously a key holder of the University of Paris' \\"English nation\\" (the nation at the university for all non-Romance speakers) and head of the Scottish province therein. He served as representative of the university at a Paris ecclesiastical council, 30 November 1413, which debated and denounced the arguments of theologian Jean Petit. During the same period, Crannach was a popular teacher of Scottish and other students at the university, but did not return there after January 1418 when he left for the papal court at Constance.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 120 Diplomat and churchman Paris in the following years was subject to occupation and incursions from both Burgundians and English, both enemies of the Franco- Scottish alliance. In this era Crannach served the Dauphin Charles as a diplomat, counsellor and \\"household master of requests\\" [Watt]. He headed an embassy to Scotland in 1419 that resulted in a Scottish army being brought to France. He was still in the service of Charles, now king, when Pope Martin V provided Crannach bishop of Caithness on 4 December 1422.Dowden, Bishops, p. 245; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 119, 120; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 80 He travelled to Scotland again soon after this provision, along with John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, and is recorded at Edinburgh in November 1423. Crannach was in Rome in 1424, probably in relation to his bishopric, provision to which was renewed in Crannach's presence on 11 December 1424.Dowden, Bishops, p. 245; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 119; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 80 Although his kinsmen and other agents were drawing revenue from the see by May 1425, he remained unconsecrated and probably had yet to visit the diocese even in June 1426. Historian and bishop John Dowden believed that he had held the position of Dean of Fortrose Cathedral, but the John in question was not Crannach but John Innes, future bishop of Moray.Dowden, Bishops, p. 245; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 119, note; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 353 By 1424 at the latest Crannach was a priest and rector of Chantenay (in Sarthe department) in the diocese of Le Mans, a canonry gained either through the university of through service to the Dauphin.Dowden, Bishops, p. 245; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 119, 120 It was on 7 June 1426 that Crannach was translated from Caithness to the apparently more appealing see of Brechin, vacant by the death of Walter Forrester. Crannach was consecrated at some point between October 1426 and October 1427.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 119, note; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 55 He was in Rome in 1426 as part of an embassy sent by the king of the Scots, James I, who wished, among other things, to secure the appointment of John Cameron as bishop of Glasgow. Bishop of Brechin Crannach's activities immediately following his translation to Brechin are not clear, but he did not appear again in Scotland until May 1429. In December that year he departed to the papal court via Bruges on a mission to reverse a papal citation of Bishop Cameron, and while at the papal court in 1430 he and Cameron's other proctor, Thomas de Merton, were excommunicated due to Cameron's failure to pay the money due for confirmation of the bishopric; the excommunication was lifted in 1432. His chief role in the 1430s appears to be that of a royal ambassador and papal petitioner. He was appointed as a representative of King James to the Council of Basel in 1433, but this seems to have been done by his brother Robert de Crannach. He helped negotiate the royal marriage between Scotland and France, and conducted James' daughter Margaret to La Rochelle in 1436 before arranging the final details of the marriage. He was present at the wedding at Tours on 13 June 1436.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 121 He was at Bruges in July 1436, and at Rome between February and July 1437, again in 1440, and yet again from September to November 1442. As a diocesan, Crannach was much absent, taking up residence in his diocese in three periods: 1429, 1433-1436, and from 1445 onwards.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 120-21 In 1429, he witnessed the foundation of a college of priests at Brechin by Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl and Lord of Brechin. In June 1430 Crannach obtained a license to visit his diocese by proxy, and only in March 1433 is he found once again in his diocese. From 1433 to 1436 there is an intense period of activity by the bishop, the extant records emphasizing the bishop's attempts to secure his revenues and property. There was a dispute with Gilbert Forrester, the archdeacon of Brechin and nephew of the previous bishop. Forrester, who perhaps thought himself entitled to the episcopal office, is said to have assaulted the bishop in church, and was subsequently excommunicated by the cathedral chapter on 27 February 1435.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 121-22 Although largely absent from his diocese between 1436 and 1445, his presence is on record for January 1439, February 1441, and February 1445. From 1445 onwards he appears settled in his diocese, and the evidence once again indicates Crannach's concern with securing the rights and privileges of his office and see.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 122 One of his earliest acts in this period was the purchase of land at Keithock (Angus). He endowed a chaplaincy on 11 June 1451 for the benefit of his own soul, and for the soul of his former lord Walter Stewart, despite the damnatio memoriae of the latter for regicide. The dispute with the archdeacon Gilbert Forrester continued, Forrester's excommunication being renewed on 30 July 1448. Forrester tried to secure exemption from episcopal authority at the Roman court. Although Crannach resisted Forrester, the bishop-archdeacon dispute was to continue after Crannach's death. Crannach also attacked his dean, John de Lichton (Leighton) for inefficiency and immorality.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 122; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 59 for name The Auchinleck Chronicle placed Crannach's death in 1456, but this is incorrect.Dowden, Bishops, p. 185 Crannach's last appearance in surviving contemporary sources is 17 November 1453.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 121, note; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 353 He was dead by 8 March 1454, when his successor George Shoreswood received notice of his provision to the vacant see.Dowden, Bishops, p. 185; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 121, note; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 353 Notes References Sources  * 1380s births 1450s deaths Bishops of Brechin Bishops of Caithness People from Banffshire University of Paris alumni Scottish Roman Catholics ","title":"John de Crannach"},{"id":"28960664","text":"Michael Arthur Overs (June 24, 1939 ‚Äì March 31, 2010) was a Canadian businessman who was the founder and CEO of Pizza Pizza, a successful franchise of pizza restaurants.

Set in Scotland, the film centres on John McGill (Conor McCarron), a teenager growing up in 1970s Glasgow. John's story follows his involvement with the city's youth culture and its impact on his development as a teenager. The title is from the word Ned which is a derogatory term applied in Scotland to hooligans, louts or petty criminals. The film has received critical acclaim. Plot Neds follows the story of John McGill, a young boy growing up in 1970s Glasgow. While a brilliant student who excels in his studies at school, his studious nature causes conflicts with his working-class family and the wider, gang-riddled neighbourhood. John's immediate family consists of his mother, a part-time hospital worker; his father, an abusive, alcoholic, tool-maker; and his older brother, Benny, leader of a neighbourhood gang called the Young Car-D. On a visit from New York, his Auntie Beth encourages John to leave Scotland when he is older to pursue opportunities there. The film opens with a leaving ceremony marking John's transition from primary to secondary school. On his final day, John is accosted by Canta, a local bully and member of the Hardridge Parka Gang, who intimidates him, threatening to beat him up when he moves to secondary school. John relays the details of the encounter to his brother who enlists the help of his fellow gang members to track down and assault Canta as punishment. Once John begins secondary school, apart from not being in the top class, everything goes well. Informed by the headmaster that he will be moved up to the appropriate level by Christmas time by proving he is different to his brother, who assaulted two teachers and was expelled, he successfully progresses. However, he finds himself socially isolated and his teacher advises him to attend a summer camp for children with disabilities. There, he becomes friendly with a middle class boy called Julian. One day he accidentally breaks one of Julian's father's LP records and is forbidden from seeing Julian again. While walking home, a group of Young Car-D gang members threaten to mug him until they realize whose brother he is. They stop harassing him, ask him to join them and offer John vodka and cigarettes which he accepts, marking the start of his downward spiral. When the school year recommences, John has changed his ways for the worse: drawing graffiti on desks, being impolite to teachers and smoking cigarettes in the toilets at break time. At one point he is caught up in a fight between two gangs and obtains a knife which has been kicked under the door of the toilet cubicle in which he is hiding. In revenge for the rejection by Julian's family, John throws a pair of football boots full of fireworks through the dining room window while they are eating. He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase up to the edge of their territory where they escape via a walkway. John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang. It emerges later that she is the mother of the boy who hurled the bicycle. John becomes more deeply involved in gang feuds taking place between 1972 and 1974. He slits a boy's throat in a gang fight and hides the blade. On a walk with Claire, one of the girls from the gang, John spots his one-time tormentor Canta, now an isolated and slightly pathetic character. John confronts him about the bullying incident years earlier, and agrees to move past it, but Canta makes a snide remark as he turns away. Enraged, John first knocks him to the floor, then drops a stone slab on his head, causing permanent brain damage. Returning home he finds that the police are there and hides from them. Upon their departure, John learns that his brother has been arrested as a suspect in the stabbing. The next day he finds that his brother's bail has been set at ¬£15 by the Sheriff court. He robs a bus driver at knife point to raise the money, but fails to pay the sum in time. John becomes increasingly confrontational, throwing a glass bottle at a passing police officer, as he hangs out with the Young Car-D in a park, which results in them ostracizing him for attracting police attention. His father is drunkenly abusive to his mother so John later beats him about the head with a frying pan. His mother orders John out of the house and he is forced to take refuge in the machine room in a block of high rise flats, living on deliveries of bread and milk stolen from tenants. Returning to his refuge he finds the room locked and, after sniffing glue, wanders the streets, stripped to the waist. Seeing a statue of Jesus, who John jokingly urges to come down, he has a glue-fuelled vision that Christ accepts the offer but then challenges him on his poor life choices. The next morning, his sober dad finds John and tells him to come home. His father asks him to put him out of his misery and end his life. John goes to his room, taking two knives which he tightly straps to both hands. He goes downstairs and finds his father urinating in a bottle. He asks John to wait until he is asleep, so John wanders the streets. When he encounters members of the rival gang, he attacks one, leaving him grievously injured. Pursued by the other gang members, John is himself badly beaten. Members of Young Car-D then spot John and fight off his attackers, only to have the enraged John turn on them. Injured, he returns home to the room where his father is asleep but is unable to go through with killing him. Falling asleep, he collapses on top of him. He chooses to change his ways and returns to school, attending a remedial class, wanting no further involvement with the gang. The class goes on a field trip to a safari park and their minibus breaks down. Thinking the teachers have abandoned him with the brain-damaged Brown (Canta), John decides to leave the van. The film closes with John and Brown walking hand-in-hand into the distance through a pride of lions, who ignore them.

Origin  The Gadhai claim to have immigrated from Rajasthan about five hundred years ago. They were first settled in Kutch, where they were employed by the local Rajputs, and then brought to Saurashtra by the Kathi rulers. The Gadhai bred donkeys, which were the main beasts of burdens. They are said to get their name from the Gujarati word for a donkey, which is gadha, and gadhai means a donkey keeper. The Gadhai were also involved in selling salt. According to their traditions, the community were once Rajputs, who lost status as a result of their conversion to Islam. They are now found mainly in the districts of Amreli, Bhavnagar and Junagadh.

Their name derives from the monastery of Christ Philanthropos (\\"Christ Friend of Man\\") in Constantinople.. Some members of the family use the composite surname Doukas Philanthropenos, and may, according to Demetrios I. Polemis, constitute a distinct branch of the family. History The first known member of the family is Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos, first attested circa 1255 as a commander at Ohrid. He is usually equated with the distinguished admiral of the same name, who rose to the rank of protostrator and eventually megas doux. He died circa 1275. His daughter, Maria, married Michael Tarchaneiotes. Their second son was the pinkernes Alexios Philanthropenos, a general celebrated for his successes against the Turks, who rose up unsuccessfully against Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1295. He was pardoned in the 1320s and was again active in the field until 1334. A Michael Doukas Philanthropenos, epi tes trapezes and uncle of Andronikos II, is attested from 1286 to 1304, when he was sent to defend Magnesia from the Turks. A number of Philanthropenos women are known only from short references: Theodora Doukaina Philanthropene married John Komnenos Akropolites, perhaps a son of the historian George Akropolites; Irene Komnene Doukaina Philanthropene Kantakouzene, who died on 8 August 1292; and Eirene Komnene Philanthropene Doukaina, who died on 7 September 1303. Others are known only by their surname.cf. . In the 14th century, a John Philanthropenos, megas droungarios tou ploimou, is attested in a synodal decision of 1324, George Doukas Philanthropenos, megas hetaireiarches and governor of Lemnos, is attested in 1346, and the megas stratopedarches Michael Philanthropenos, a cousin of John V Palaiologos, is attested in 1350. In Thessaly, Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos and Manuel Angelos Philanthropenos are attested in the 1380s and 1390s. Alexios ruled Thessaly with the title of Caesar from circa 1382 to 1389, and was succeeded by Manuel (either his son or his brother), who ruled until the Ottoman conquest in 1393/1394. In the 15th century, the two most prominent members of the family are George Doukas Philanthropenos, mesazon to John VIII Palaiologos, and Alexios Laskaris Philanthropenos, megas stratopedarches, governor of Patras in 1445 and a friend of Bessarion.

Hemopexin-like repeats occur in vitronectin and some matrix metalloproteinases family (matrixins). The HX repeats of some matrixins bind tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidases (TIMPs). Hemopexin () is a serum glycoprotein that binds haem and transports it to the liver for breakdown and iron recovery, after which the free hemopexin returns to the circulation. Hemopexin prevents haem- mediated oxidative stress. Structurally hemopexin consists of two similar halves of approximately two hundred amino acid residues connected by a histidine-rich hinge region. Each half is itself formed by the repetition of a basic unit of some 35 to 45 residues. Hemopexin-like domains have been found in two other types of proteins, vitronectin, a cell adhesion and spreading factor found in plasma and tissues, and matrixins MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, MMP-14, MMP-15 and MMP-16, members of the matrix metalloproteinase family that cleave extracellular matrix constituents. These zinc endopeptidases, which belong to MEROPS peptidase subfamily M10A, have a single hemopexin-like domain in their C-terminal section. It is suggested that the hemopexin domain facilitates binding to a variety of molecules and proteins, for example the HX repeats of some matrixins bind tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidases (TIMPs).

It was thwarted in April 2003 with the arrest of William J. Krar, Judith Bruey (Krar's common- law wife) and Edward Feltus and the seizure of a cyanide gas bomb along with a large arsenal that included at least 100 other conventional bombs, machine guns, an assault rifle, an unregistered silencer, and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. The chemical stockpile seized included sodium cyanide, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid. The three individuals were linked to white supremacist and anti-government groups. Feltus was a member of the New Jersey Militia while Krar was suspected of making his living travelling across the country selling bomb components and other weapons to violent underground anti-government groups. Federal authorities had been watching Krar since at least 1995 when ATF agents investigated a possible plot to bomb government buildings, but he was not charged at the time. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks their attention was focused on middle- eastern terrorist activities and were only alerted to Krar's recent activities by accident when he mailed Feltus a package of counterfeit birth certificates from North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, and United Nations Multinational Force and Defence Intelligence Agency IDs. The package was mistakenly delivered to a Staten Island man who alerted police. On May 4, 2004 Krar was sentenced to 135 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to building and possessing chemical weapons. Ms. Bruey was sentenced to 57 months after pleading to \\"conspiracy to possess illegal weapons\\". 2005 =Sydney terrorism plot= Five men were arrested in late 2005 in Sydney, Australia and charged over a terrorism-plot they planned between July 2004 and November 2005. Each pleaded not guilty to the charges. Police searches of their homes discovered instructions on bomb-making, 28,000 rounds of ammunition (including 11,000 7.62√ó39mm), 12 rifles, militant Islamist literature, and footage of beheadings carried out by Islamists, and also of aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. According to the prosecution, the men purchased explosive chemicals and guns between July 2004 and November 2005. The five were found guilty on 16 October 2009 and were jailed on 15 February 2010 for terms ranging from 23 to 28 years. The trial was one of Australia's longest and involved approximately 300 witnesses and 3,000 exhibits, including 18 hours of telephone intercepts and 30 days of surveillance tapes, which has overtaken the record previously held by the liquidation of Bell Group. 2006 *2006 Ontario terrorism plot 2007 *2007 Glasgow Airport attack 2009 =Raleigh jihad group= * 2009 Bronx terrorism plot Seven men were arrested on July 27, 2009 near Raleigh, North Carolina on charges of participating in a conspiracy to commit \\"violent jihad\\" outside the United States. An eighth man named in the indictment, believed to be in Pakistan, has not been arrested. The alleged leader of the group, Daniel Patrick Boyd, was accused of recruiting the other seven men, including two of his sons, to take part in a conspiracy ‚Äúto advance violent jihad, including supporting and participating in terrorist activities abroad and committing acts of murder, kidnapping or maiming persons abroad.‚Äù At their detention hearings, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Webb ruled that all were to be held without bond until trial. 2010 =Ottawa arrests= On 25 August 2010, seven individuals were arrested in Ottawa and London, Ontario on terrorism-related charges. It was the culmination of Project Samosa, a year-long probe by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which identified eight members of a cell targeting government buildings on Parliament Hill. =Operation Guava terror plot= Also known as the \\"London Stock Exchange bomb plot\\", nine conspirators were arrested in December 2010 for plotting a terrorist attack; they all eventually pleaded guilty, and eight were convicted of engaging in preparation for acts of terrorism. One of the convicts, Usman Khan, had his sentence reduced on appeal by Lord Justice Leveson. He became Cambridge University's \\"poster boy for Britain's anti-radicalisation strategy\\", but he went on to perpetrate the 2019 London Bridge stabbing. 2020 =Brexit Day bomb plot= On 31 January 2020, the day the United Kingdom was to withdraw from the European Union, the Police Service of Northern Ireland received two anonymous tips that a bomb inside a lorry would be on a ferry heading from Belfast Harbour to Cainryan, Scotland. While the explosive device was not found at the harbour, or detonated, it would be found on 5 February inside a lorry on the Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland after a search of 400 lorries; it was then disarmed by a bomb disposal team.

Background The port city of Malacca controlled the narrow strategic strait of Malacca, through which all seagoing trade between China and India was concentrated.The Cambridge History of the British Empire Arthur Percival Newton p.11 The capture of Malacca was the result of a plan by the King of Portugal Manuel I, who in 1505 had resolved to thwart Muslim trade in the Indian Ocean by capturing Aden, in order to block trade through Alexandria, capturing Ormuz, in order to block trade through Beirut, and Malacca to control trade with China.Malabar Manual by William Logan p.312 Capture of Malacca In 1509, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira was sent to Malacca by the king of Portugal with four ships in order to establish contact with the Sultanate of Malacca. Initially, Sequeira was well received by the Sultan Mahmud Syah (1488‚Äì1528). Soon however, the Muslim community convinced Mahmud Syah that the Portuguese should be eliminated. Several men were captured and killed, but the ships escaped.A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300 Merle Calvin Ricklefs p.23 Albuquerque first departed from India for Malacca in April 1511, with 1,200 men and 17 to 18 ships. Albuquerque's objective was to sever Islamic trade and Venetian trade on the same occasion. A first attack by the Portuguese failed on 25 July 1511. Albuquerque's captains spoke against another attempt, but he struck again, succeeding in capturing Malacca in August, despite strong resistance and the presence of artillery on the Malaccan side. In celebration, Trist√£o da Cunha was sent to Pope Leo X in Rome with rich presents including the elephant that the pope named Hanno. Chinese involvement In response to the Portuguese invasion of Malacca, which was a Chinese tributary state, the Chinese Imperial Government imprisoned and executed multiple Portuguese envoys after torturing them in Guangzhou. The Malaccans had informed the Chinese of the Portuguese seizure of Malacca, to which the Chinese responded with hostility toward the Portuguese. The Malaccans told the Chinese of the deception the Portuguese used, disguising plans for conquering territory as mere trading activities, and told of all the atrocities committed by the Portuguese.) Malacca was under Chinese protection and the Portuguese invasion angered the Chinese. Due to the Malaccan Sultan lodging a complaint against the Portuguese invasion to the Chinese Emperor, the Portuguese were greeted with hostility from the Chinese when they arrived in China.) The Sultan's complaint caused \\"a great deal of trouble\\" to Portuguese in China. The Chinese were very \\"unwelcoming\\" to the Portuguese. The Malaccan Sultan, based in Bintan after fleeing Malacca, sent a message to the Chinese, which combined with Portuguese banditry and violent activity in China, led the Chinese authorities to execute 23 Portuguese and torture the rest of them in jails. After the Portuguese set up posts for trading in China and committed piratical activities and raids in China, the Chinese responded with the complete extermination of the Portuguese in Ningbo and Quanzhou) Pires, a Portuguese trade envoy, was among those who died in the Chinese dungeons.(the University of Michigan) The rest of the Portuguese embassy stayed imprisoned for life. The Chinese defeated a Portuguese fleet in 1521 at the First Battle of Tamao (1521), killing and capturing so many Portuguese that the Portuguese had to abandon their junks and retreat with only three ships, only escaping back to Malacca because a wind scattered the Chinese ships as the Chinese launched a final attack. The Chinese effectively held the Portuguese embassy hostage, using them as a bargaining chip in demanding that the Portuguese restore the deposed Malaccan Sultan (King) to his throne. The Chinese proceeded to execute several Portuguese by beating and strangling them, and torturing the rest. The other Portuguese prisoners were put into iron chains and kept in prison. The Chinese confisticated all of the Portuguese property and goods in the Pires embassy's possession. In 1522 Martim Afonso de Merlo Coutinho was appointed commander of another Portuguese fleet sent to establish diplomatic relations. The Chinese defeated the Portuguese ships led by Coutinho at the Second Battle of Tamao (1522). 40 Portuguese were captured and one ship destroyed during the battle. The Portuguese were forced to retreat to Malacca. The Chinese forced Pires to write letters for them, demanding that the Portuguese restore the deposed Malaccan Sultan (King) back onto his throne. The Malay ambassador to China was to deliver the letter. The Chinese had sent a message to the deposed Sultan (King) of Malacca concerning the fate of the Portuguese embassy, which the Chinese held prisoner. When they received his reply, the Chinese officials then proceeded to execute the Portuguese embassy, slicing their bodies into multiple pieces. Their genitalia were inserted into the oral cavity. The Portuguese were executed in public in multiple areas in Guangzhou, deliberately by the Chinese in order to show that the Portuguese were insignificant in the eyes of the Chinese. When more Portuguese ships landed and were seized by the Chinese, the Chinese then executed them as well, cutting off the genitalia and beheading the bodies and forcing their fellow Portuguese to wear the body parts, while the Chinese celebrated with music. The genitalia and heads were displayed strung up for display in public, after which they were discarded. In response to Portuguese piracy and establishing bases in Fujian at Wuyu island and Yue harbor at Zhangzhou, Shuangyu island in Zhejiang, and Nan'ao island in Guangdong, the Imperial Chinese Right Deputy Commander Zhu Wan exterminated all the pirates and razed the Shuangyu Portuguese base, using force to prohibit trading with foreigners by sea. =Chinese Boycott of Portuguese= Chinese traders boycotted Malacca after it fell under Portuguese control, some Chinese in Java assisted in Muslim attempts to reconquer the city from Portugal using ships. The Java Chinese participation in retaking Malacca was recorded in \\"The Malay Annals of Semarang and Cerbon\\" trading the Chinese did business with Malays and Javanese instead of the Portuguese. Cape Rachado Malacca, which was earlier the capital of the Sultanate of Malacca, was sieged and wrested by the Portuguese in 1511, forcing the Sultan to retreat and found the successor state of Johor and continue the war from there. The port city, which the Portuguese had turned into a formidable fortress, was strategically situated in the middle of the strait of the same name giving control to both the spice trade of the Malay archipelago and supremacy over the sea lane of the lucrative trade between Europe and the Far East. The Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) decided that to expand further to the east, the Portuguese monopoly and especially Malacca must first be neutralized. Last battle of the Malacca In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC) began the campaign to destroy Portuguese power in the East. At that time, the Portuguese had transformed Malacca into an impregnable fortress (the Fortaleza de Malaca, controlling access to the sea lanes of the Straits of Malacca and the spice trade there. The Dutch started by launching small incursions and skirmishes against the Portuguese. The first serious attempt was the siege of Malacca in 1606 by the third VOC fleet from Holland with eleven ships, led by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge that lead to the naval battle of Cape Rachado. Although the Dutch were routed, the Portuguese fleet of Martim Afonso de Castro, the Viceroy of Portuguese India; suffered heavier casualties and the battle rallied the forces of the Sultanate of Johor in an alliance with the Dutch and later on with the Achehnese. A Famosa 280px In 1511, a Portuguese fleet arrived under the command of Afonso de Albuquerque. His forces attacked and successfully defeated the armies of the Malacca Sultanate. Moving quickly to consolidate his gains, Albuquerque had the fortress built around a natural hill near the sea. Albuquerque believed that Malacca would become an important port linking Portugal to the Spice Route in China. At this time other Portuguese were establishing outposts in such places as Macau, China and Goa, India in order to create a string of friendly ports for ships heading to China and returning home to Portugal.

Born in Germany, came to Denmark as Royal administrator of the trade on the Danish West Indies and in the same time built a successful private trading empire during the early Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th century, profiting on Denmark's neutrality. At the time of his death in 1836, Brun was one of the wealthiest persons in Denmark, leaving an estate of more than 2 million Rigsdaler. He was married to Friederike Brun, a writer and prominent salonist during the Danish Golden Age. Early life and career Constantin Brun was born into a poor family on 27 November 1746 in Rostock. He moved to L√ºbeck to Apprentice in Pauli, one of the local trading houses, and after showing a remarkable talent for business, his employer set him up, along with his own son, with a business in Saint Petersburg, Russia. On 16 October 1777, Brun received an appointment as Danish Consul and this brought him to Copenhagen. There he met his future wife, Friederike, for the first time when he visited her father, Balthasar M√ºnter, who was a priest at the St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen. He was immediately struck by the young girl, and in the winter of 1782/83 he returned to Copenhagen. Career in Denmark The Danish Government had become aware of his eminent talent for business and, presumably at Count von Schimmelmann's initiative, offered him a position as royal administrator of the trade on the Danish West Indies. Brun accepted, settled in Copenhagen and proposed to Friederikke M√ºnter, who accepted, later that same year. Under Brun, Danish trade on the West Indies passed over from the Danish West India Company to the state. During the following decades, the trade flourished, assisted by Denmark's neutrality in the European wars which raged at the time. Brun also ran his own private business and over the years built a colossal fortune. In 1788-99 the Danish Government send Brun on a diplomatic mission to Russia, an allied of Denmark, with financial support for the Russian war against Sweden. Property Brun was the owner of several large estates and prominent homes. In 1790 he bought Sophienholm in Lyngby as a summer residence supplementing his town mansion in Copenhagen. From 1800 to 1805 he had it extended and redesigned to its present-day appearance with the assistance of the French architect Joseph- Jacques Ram√©e. Over the next decade he acquired first Antvorskov Manor and later Falkensteen Manor, both located near Slagelse, and made many progressive modernizations to the agricultural operations of the estates. He imported several families from Switzerland and established a production of Swiss cheese which was mainly exported to oversea markets. He also marketed chopping and threshing machines. In 1810 Brun bought Krogerup Manor for his sons. The estate stayed in the Brun family until 1939. Family and personal life Friederike Brun with daughter Charlotte, painting by Erik Pauelsen (1780) His wife, Friederike Brun, was a writer and played host to many prominent Danish artists and intellectuals of her day. Particularly her salons at Sophienholm enjoyed great popularity. She also socialized and kept up a correspondence with many leading cultural figures around Europe. Constantin Brun himself took no interest in these activities, routinely referring to them as \\"poetic madness\\". His parsimonious reputation is reflected in his comment that he \\"saw the moon as a time counter and as a good bright light which shone without the need for payment.\\" He found Friederike's social habits extravagant, but she always got her way, and he was obviously flattered by the fact that it was his wealth which made it all possible. =Children= * Carl Friedrich Balthasar Brun (20 April 1784 ‚Äì 14 November 1869), Chamberlain * Charlotte Brun (1788) * Augusta Brun (1790) * Adelaide Caroline Johanne Brun (20 September 1792 - 23 November 1857) See also * Sophienholm References 18th-century Danish businesspeople 19th-century Danish businesspeople Businesspeople from Copenhagen German emigrants to Denmark Naturalised citizens of Denmark Brun family 1746 births 1835 deaths ","title":"Constantin Brun"},{"id":"28961073","text":"Radien-pardne or Raediengiedte was the son of Radien-attje and Raedieahkka in the Sami mythology.

These criticisms have been aimed at the plethora of and lack of consistency between Linux distributions, their usefulness and ease of use as desktop systems for general end users, driver support and issues with multi- media playback and audio development. While smartphones running the Linux- based Android mobile operating system dominate the smartphone market, and Linux is used on most servers, almost exclusively run on the world's 500 fastest supercomputers, and is even used on the New York Stock Exchange, Linux-based operating systems have failed to achieve widespread adoption on personal computers. Viability of Linux as a desktop system Linus Torvalds has expressed that he intended the Linux kernel to be used in desktop operating systems. He argues that Android is widely used because it comes pre- installed on new phones, and that Linux distributions would need to be bundled on new computers to gain market share. Linux has been criticized for a number of reasons, including lack of user-friendliness and having a steep learning curve, being inadequate for desktop use, lacking support for exotic hardware, having a relatively small games library and lacking native versions of widely used applications and missing GUI API standardization. Some critics do not believe Linux will ever gain a large share in the desktop market. In May 2009 Preston Gralla, contributing editor to Computerworld.com, believed that Linux will never be important to desktop/notebook users, even though he felt it was simple and straightforward to use, but that its low usage is indicative of its low importance in the desktop market. In his essay Luxury of Ignorance: An Open-Source Horror Story, Eric S. Raymond stated that the lack of usability in many open-source and Linux tools is not from lack of manuals but from a lack of thought about the users' experience. James Donald from Princeton University analyzed shared library concepts of several operation systems. In his 2003 paper titled Improved Portability of Shared Libraries, he worried about the lack of a Windows Application Compatibility Group equivalent. =Missed opportunities= Desktop Linux was criticized in late 2010 for having missed its opportunity to become a significant force in desktop computing. PC World executive editor Robert Strohmeyer commented that although Linux has exceptional security and stability, as well as great performance and usability, the time for desktop Linux to succeed has been missed. Nick Farrell, writing for TechEye, felt that the release of Windows Vista was a missed opportunity to grab significant market share. Both critics indicated that Linux did not fail on the desktop due to being \\"too geeky,\\" \\"too hard to use,\\" or \\"too obscure\\". Both had praise for distributions, Strohmeyer saying \\"the best-known distribution, Ubuntu, has received high marks for usability from every major player in the technology press\\". Both laid the blame for this failure on the open-source community. Strohmeyer named the \\"fierce ideology of the open-source community at large\\" as being responsible, while Farrell stated \\"The biggest killer of putting penguin software on the desktop was the Linux community. If you think the Apple fanboys are completely barking, they are role models of sanity to the loudmouthed Open Sauce religious loonies who are out there. Like many fundamentalists they are totally inflexible ‚Äì waving a GNU as if it were handed down by God to Richard Stallman\\". The accusation of over-zealous advocacy has been dealt with previously; in 2006 Dominic Humphries stated that the aims of the Linux community are not desktop market- share or popularity, but in Linux being the best operating system that can be made for the community. Criticisms =Choice and fragmentation= A criticism often leveled against Linux is the abundance of distributions available. As of September 2019, DistroWatch lists 262 major distributions that are active. Critics cite the large number as cause for confusion to prospective users and argue it is a factor preventing the widespread adoption of Linux on consumer desktops. Alexander Wolfe wrote in InformationWeek: Along with the argument that forking and the resulting fragmentation divides and wastes development efforts and resources, it is asserted that with the lack of standardization between distributions for software libraries, package managers, configurations, as well as the varied desktop environments, the resulting incompatibilities also make it more difficult for application developers and software maintainers since applications have to be adapted to run on each distribution or family of distributions. This fragmentation also complicates software installation, forcing non-technical users who cannot build applications from source and resolve dependency issues by themselves to rely on precompiled packages from distribution-specific software repositories, which have a more or less limited selection of applications and typically lag behind the latest releases as the software has to be picked up by the software maintainer and packaged to run on the specific distribution and release. Caitlyn Martin from LinuxDevCenter wrote critically on the lack of standardization and compatibility between distributions: However, Linux advocates have defended the large number of distributions as promoting of freedom of choice and describe the diversity as a key strength. Jim Lynch from InfoWorld wrote: Attempts have been made to standardize Linux distributions through the Linux Standard Base in order to make software more compatible across distributions; however, it had very limited adoption. Projects such as AppImage, Flatpak, and Snappy are seeking to remedy the issue of software fragmentation by instead packaging applications with all the required dependencies to enable them to run as portable applications independent of the libraries, configuration and idiosyncrasies of a particular distribution, but even this approach has been criticized of fragmentation. =Third-party application development= Linux desktop operating systems are criticized for the difficulty of developing third-party applications for the platforms, with distribution fragmentation, insistence on using shared libraries instead of including the libraries with the application, and lack of concern given to keeping APIs consistent and backwards compatible being cited as factors. This particularly causes difficulties for closed-source applications, which are distributed exclusively as binaries, since the burden of ensuring compatibility with the myriad of Linux distributions and release versions is borne solely by the developer. Dirk Hohndel, VMware's Chief Open Source Officer, criticized the lack of standardization across distributions for creating an unfriendly environment for application development, writing that it \\"basically tells app developers ‚Äògo away, focus on platforms that care about applications. Miguel de Icaza, founder of the GNOME desktop environment, regards the disregard of backwards compatibility as a cultural issue with the Linux development community: Tony Mobily, editor of Free Software Magazine, identified problems in the server roots of Linux in his article 2009: software installation in GNU/Linux is still broken ‚Äì and a path to fixing it: In August 2014 on the DebConf in Portland Linus Torvalds also voiced his unhappiness with the binary application packaging for the Linux distro ecosystem: =Audio development= The lack of strong API standards for multimedia has been criticised. For example the Adobe Systems development blog penguin.SWF discusses the complicated Linux audio infrastructure in the analysis Welcome to the jungle. The nearly one dozen actively supported systems are called an audio jungle. PulseAudio main developer Lennart Poettering stated that it is very difficult for programmers to know which audio API to use for which purpose. =Driver support= Linux has in the past been criticized for a lack of driver support; however, this was largely due to manufacturers not supporting the Linux system. It wasn't until 2004 that ATI started development of Linux drivers. Major adoption of Linux in servers and Android has encouraged driver development for Linux. Wireless support Wireless driver support has been a problem area for Linux. At one time many drivers were missing and users were required to use solutions such as ndiswrapper, which utilizes drivers made for the Windows operating system. Broadcom was particularly criticized for not releasing drivers. This issue was also worked around by extracting proprietary firmware for use on Linux. Broadcom has since released free and open-source drivers for the Linux kernel, eliminating the issues for modern Broadcom chipsets. The problem has been largely fixed in recent years and there are now a fairly large number of drivers, adding support to most wireless cards available today. However, many features are still missing from these drivers, mostly due to manufacturers not providing specifications and documentation, and thus forcing developers to reverse engineer cards. =Directory structure= The traditional directory structure, which is a heritage from Linux's Unix roots in the 1970s, has been criticized as inappropriate for desktop end users. In particular, the Linux directory structure is criticized for scattering application-specific components in different system directories instead of keeping them in a common application- specific directory. Some Linux distributions like GoboLinux and moonOS have proposed alternative hierarchies that were argued to be easier for end users, though such proposals have achieved little acceptance.\\"The GoboLinux directory structure brings a fresh, clean look the Linux system...\\", 2003, GoboLinux.org See also * Criticism of Linux * Linux on the desktop References Linux Desktop Linux ","title":"Criticism of desktop Linux"},{"id":"28961152","text":"EN 10025 - Hot rolled products of structural steels refers to a set of European standards which specify the technical delivery conditions for hot rolled products of structural steels.
