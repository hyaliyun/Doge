The Schoolcraft River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 30 mi (48 km) long, in northern Minnesota in the United States. Although short, it is considered as the first major tributary of the Mississippi, since it is the first river that joins the Mississippi below its source that is nearly the same size as the Mississippi itself. The river is named after Henry Schoolcraft, who mapped the region and discovered nearby Lake Itasca as the source of the Mississippi in 1831. Its name in the Ojibwe language is Ozaawindibe-ziibi (Yellow-head River), named after Ozaawindib who guided Schoolcraft to the nearby Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan (Elk Lake), which Schoolcraft then named Lake Itasca. Prior to being named for these early explorers it had been called the \\"Naiwa River\\" It rises in Schoolcraft Lake, in central Hubbard County just south of Lake George. It flows NNE through Paul Bunyan State Forest and through Lake Plantagenet . It joins the Mississippi just south of Bemidji, just before the Mississippi enters Lake Bemidji. The river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing, and for recreation fishing of walleye.

For the first time, the Luftwaffe employs illuminator aircraft ‚Äì Junkers Ju 88s dropping flares ‚Äì to provide light for attacking \\"Wild Boar\\" daylight fighters. Cloud cover, H2S problems, and stiff German resistance cause Pathfinder aircraft to drop their markers well south of the target area and lead the bombers to scatter their bombs as much as back along the approach route to Berlin, suggesting that Bomber Command crews are turning back early in the face of increasing losses. Forty-seven bombers do not return; although this is only 1.6 percent of the overall force, the loss rate among Handley Page Halifaxes is 11.4 percent and that among Short Stirlings is 16 percent. German fighters have shot down two-thirds of the lost bombers. Despite the raids failure, it prompts Gauleiter of Berlin Joseph Goebbels to order all children and all adults not engaged in war work to be evacuated from Berlin to the countryside and to towns in eastern Germany where air raids are not expected.Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary Campaign Diary August 1943Hinchcliffe, Peter, The Other Battle: Luftwaffe Night Aces vs. Bomber Command, Edison, New Jersey: Castle Books, 1996, , p. 190.

German night fighters successfully intercept a major diversionary raid by another 395 British bombers on Mannheim and shoot down 23 bombers (5.9 percent of the force). Mannheim also is cloud- covered and the raid scatters its bombs largely outside the city, but nonetheless kills 21 people, injures 154, and renders 7,500 homeless. It is the last raid on Mannheim for 15 months. * November 19‚Äì20 (overnight) ‚Äì 266 British bombers attack Leverkusen, Germany, in bad weather, which prevents most German night fighters from intercepting them but also makes them scatter their bombs so widely that only one bomb lands in Leverkusen, with other bombs hitting at least 27 other towns well to the north.

Twenty- six British bombers (3.4 percent of the force) are lost. It is the last time that Short Stirlings participate in a raid against a target in Germany. * November 23‚Äì24 (overnight) ‚Äì 383 British bombers attack Berlin with the loss of 20 of their number (5.2 percent of the force). Although cloud cover interferes with target maerking, bomber crews are able to bomb using 11 major fires still burning from the previous night as aiming points and inflict further heavy damage on the city. * November 24  The Japanese submarine torpedoes and sinks the U.S. Navy escort aircraft carrier southwest of Butaritari with the loss of 644 lives, including that of Rear Admiral Henry M.

He pauses at the Junkers Ju 290 bomber/transport/maritime patrol plane and orders that one be made available as his personal aircraft. He shows great interest in the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber, ordering that 200 be built by the end of 1944, and is most excited by the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, two of which make demonstration flights. Informed by Willy Messerschmitt that it could be adapted to carry one or two 250-kg (551-pound) bombs, Hitler orders that the Me 262 be produced as a bomber rather than a fighter, delaying its entry into service.Dorr, Robert F., \\"German Jets at Insterburg: Hitler's Excellent Airshow,\\" defensemedianetwork.com, December 11, 2013.

Bomber Command dispatches 450 bombers to attack Berlin; they scatter their bombs, but add to the damage to the city center and suburbs. German night fighters intercept them, and 28 Lancasters (6.2 percent of the force) are lost and 14 more crash upon reaching England. A diversionary raid on Stuttgart by 173 more bombers scatters its bombs and loses six additional bombers (3.4 percent of the force). * November 28 ‚Äì Japanese resistance on Tarawa Atoll ends.

He miraculously survives, and spends the rest of World War II as a prisoner of war.von Wodtke, Carl, \\"Miracle of Saint- Nazaire,\\" Aviation History, May 2014, p. 21.  Amid snow squalls and strong, gusting winds that had grounded all other aircraft in the area, United States Coast Guard Commander Frank A. Erickson pilots a Sikorsky HNS-1 helicopter from Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, to Battery Park in Manhattan, where he picks up two cases containing over 40 units of blood plasma that are lashed to the helicopter's floats. He then flies on to deliver the plasma to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where it is used to treat survivors from the United States Navy destroyer , which had capsized and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off New York Harbor that morning after a series of violent internal explosions. It is both the first time in history that a helicopter has flown in such adverse weather conditions and history's first \\"lifesaving\\" flight by a helicopter. * January 4 A strike by American aircraft based at Tarawa Atoll lays mines in the channel at Jaluit, forcing Japanese shipping to cease use of the atolls lagoon and the withdrawal of most Japanese seaplanes there. 539 bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force raid Kiel and M√ºnster, Germany, escorted by 155 fighters.

German night fighters intercept them over Belgium before they cross the German border and continue to attack them for the next hour, shooting down 82 bombers as they fly to Nuremberg and over the target. Another 13 bombers are lost on the return flight, and the total of 95 bombers lost (11.9 percent of the force) is the highest Bomber Command loss on a single raid during World War II. The raid inflicts little damage on Nuremberg due to cloud cover, wind, and poor target marking which cause most of the bombs to land in open countryside, and 120 aircraft mistakenly bomb Schweinfurt, where they scatter their bombs widely, also hitting mostly open countryside and killing two people. Pilot Officer Cyril Joe Barton, the pilot of a Halifax, pushes through to Nuremberg despite heavy damage to his bomber by a night fighter attack, then brings the aircraft home and dies in crash landing with only minor injuries to his crew. He posthumously receives the Victoria Cross. * March 31 Task Force 58 aircraft strike Yap.

All of the bombers return safely. * July 11  In a raid on a V-1 flying bomb site at Grapennes, France, 26 British Lancasters make the first \\"heavy Oboe\\" raid of World War II. In this new technique, a Lancaster fitted with Oboe rather than a Mosquito leads the heavy bombers to the target, with other bombers in its formation dropping their bombs when it does, allowing a greater tonnage of bombs to be dropped directly on Oboe signals. The new tactic becomes Bomber Commands most accurate, allowing effective bombing of small targets like V-1 sites even through clouds. All of the Lancasters and all six Mosquitos which attack the same target separately return without loss.  A USAAF Douglas A-26 Invader crashes in late afternoon fog into a temporary trailer park in South Portland, Maine on approach to Portland-Westbrook Municipal Airport (now Portland International Jetport), killing both men on board.

Political career Gash was elected to Federal Parliament at the 1996 federal election. In January 2012, she announced that she would not be contesting the next federal election. At the same time, she announced her intention to stand for the mayoral position at the Shoalhaven City Council elections, due to be held in September 2012. Gash was successful, winning the directly-elected role with 63.19% of the vote. She also led a ticket that saw nine other Councillors elected to the thirteenmember Shoalhaven City Council. Following her election as mayor, there was criticism about her constitutional ability to hold office as a federal Member of Parliament and to hold an office of profit under the crown, as Mayor. Gash vigorously defended her position. She sought re-election as mayor of City of Shoalhaven at the 2016 NSW Local Council Elections, but lost her position following a massive swing, which saw her lose about half of the vote she won at the 2012 election. Amanda Findley of the Australian Greens was elected as mayor,http://vtr.elections.nsw.gov.au/shoalhaven-city- council/mayoral with Gash being elected as a Ward 2 councillor. Honours and awards In 2017, Gash was appointed a member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the Parliament of Australia, to local government, and to the community of the Shoalhaven.

Among its prominent musicians is Foday Musa Suso. Mbalax is a widely known popular dance music of the Gambia and neighbouring Senegal. It fuses popular Western music and dance, with sabar, the traditional drumming and dance music of the Wolof and Serer people. National music \\"For The Gambia Our Homeland\\", the national anthem of the Gambia, was composed by Jeremy Frederic Howe, based on the traditional Mandinka song \\"Foday Kaba Dumbuya\\", with words by Virginia Julia Howe, for an international competition to produce an anthem (and flag) before independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. Traditional music The Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, is an independent coastal state along the River Gambia. It gained its separate identity as a colony of the United Kingdom while Senegal was a colony of France, but the two countries' traditional music are very much intertwined. Among Gambia's people, who together number some 1.728 million (2010), 42% are Mandinka, 18% Fula, 16% Wolof\\\\Serer, 10% Jola and 9% Soninke, the remainder being 4% other African and 1% non-African (2003). 63% of Gambians live in rural villages (1993 census), though the population is young and tends towards urbanization. 90% are Muslims and most of the remainder Christians. Griots, also known as jelis, hereditary praise-singers, a legacy of the Mande Empire, are common throughout the region. Gambian griots, as elsewhere, often play the kora, a 21 string harp. The region of Brikama has produced some famous musicians, including Foday Musa Suso, who founded the Mandingo Griot Society in New York City in the 1970s, bringing Mande music to the New York avant- garde scene and collaborating with Bill Laswell, Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet. Mbalax (meaning \\"rhythm\\" in Wolof), derives its from accompanying rhythms used in sabar, a tradition that originated from the Serer of the Kingdom of Sine and spread to the Kingdom of Saloum whence Wolof migrants took it to the Wolof kingdoms.Patricia Tang. Masters of the Sabar: Wolof griot percussionists of Senegal, p-p32, 34. Temple University Press, 2007. The Nder (lead drum), Sabar (rhythm drum), and Tama (talking drum) percussion section traces some of its technique to the ritual music of Njuup.

New York: Columbia University Press, 2004. 224-49. Print.For the Njuup tradition, see: The Culture Trip The Njuup was also progenitor of Tassu, used when chanting ancient religious verses. The griots of Senegambia still use it at marriages, naming ceremonies or when singing the praises of patrons. Most Senegalese and Gambian artists use it in their songs.Ali Colleen Neff. Tassou: the Ancient Spoken Word of African Women. 2010. The Serer people are known especially for vocal and rhythmic practices that infuse their everyday language with complex overlapping cadences and their ritual with intense collaborative layerings of voice and rhythm.\\" Each motif has a purpose and is used for different occasions. Individual motifs represent the history and genealogy of a particular family and are used during weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals etc. Popular music Gambian popular music began in the 1960s. The Super Eagles and Guelewar formed under the influence of American, British and Cuban music. The Super Eagles played merengue and other pop genres with Wolof lyrics and minor African elements. They visited London in 1977, appearing on Mike Raven's Band Call. After the programme, when the band began playing traditional tunes, an unknown listener is said to have inspired the group to return to the Gambia's musical roots, and they spent two years travelling around studying traditional music. The reformed band was called Ifang Bondi, and their style was Afro-Manding blues. Gambian Laba Sosseh, who relocated to Dakar, Senegal as a teenager, spent his entire career outside of the Gambia, becoming a significant presence in the African and New York salsa scene. Musa Ngum, former Guelewar and Super Diamono frontman relocated to Senegal in 1981.\\"Gambia‚Äôs superstar musician Musa Ngum dies\\", The Point (the Gambia), October 12, 2015. Civil unrest caused Ifang Bondi and other Gambian musicians to leave for Europe. Former Ifang Bondi musician Juldeh Camara has been working with Justin Adams since 2007 and has been touring all over the world. Also from Ifang Bondi, Musa Mboob and Ousman Beyai have started a new group XamXamhttp://www.xamxam.co.uk which started with a project in the Gambia to produce new music by taking six musicians based in the UK to the Gambia to work with top musicians from four different tribal backgrounds. Ousman Beyai moved to the UK where he worked with Musa Mboob to set up the live band XamXam. Jaliba Kuyateh and his Kumareh band is currently the most popular exponent of Gambia's Mandinka music. There is also a thriving Gambian hip hop scene. It is impossible to overstate the importance of Alhaji Bai Konte as the first to introduce the kora and its musical culture to the live and mass media music audience. Every kora musician after his North American debut tour in 1973 owes him a unqualified debt of gratitude for his accomplishments. In 1973, Alhaji Bai Konte of Brikama, Gambia, introduced the kora to mass audiences in North America. He performed at some of the largest festivals in North America, appeared multiple times on National Public Radio and Television, was interviewed and reviewed by many newspapers. The tour would not have happened without the dedication and hard work of Marc and Susan Pevar, who organized, promoted and facilitated Alhaji Bai Konte's tours in North American from 1973 through 1980.

Originally hailing from the world of Earth-Two, first envisioned as the home of DC's wartime heroes as published in 1940s comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the main universe where DC stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world's Superman and her own counterpart, Supergirl. In common with Supergirl's origin story, she is the daughter of Superman's aunt and uncle and a native of the planet Krypton. The infant Power Girl's parents enabled her to escape the destruction of her home planet by placing her in a rocket ship. Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. On Earth, as with other Kryptonians, Power Girl discovered she possessed abilities like super strength, flight, and heat vision, using which she became a protector of innocents and a hero for humanity. Though the specifics of how vary over subsequent retellings, Power Girl is later stranded on another Earth when a cosmic crisis affects her home of Earth-Two, and later carves out a separate identity for herself from her dimensional counterpart Supergirl once they are forced to coexist. Though they are biologically the same person, Power Girl behaves as an older, more mature, and more level-headed version of Supergirl, with a more aggressive fighting style. She also adopts a different secret identity from her counterpart. These changes are reflected in their differing costumes and superhero names as well; Power Girl sports a bob of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume with a cleavage-displaying cutout. The name Power Girl reflects that she chooses not to be seen as a derivative of Superman, but rather her own hero and this choice is reflected in the strong independent attitude of the character. Over various decades, Power Girl has been depicted as a member of superhero teams such as the Justice Society of America, Infinity, Inc., Justice League Europe, and the Birds of Prey. Power Girl's origin has gone through revisions, but over time has reverted to her original conception as the Supergirl of Earth-Two. The 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths eliminated Earth-Two from history, causing her to be retconned as the granddaughter of an Atlantean sorcerer known as Arion. This was an unpopular change and writers depicted the revised Power Girl inconsistently. The 2005‚Äì2006 Infinite Crisis limited series then restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the destroyed Pre-Crisis Earth-Two universe. Following DC's 2011 \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline and New 52 reboot, Power Girl's origin was retold as the Supergirl of \\"Earth 2\\", cousin and adopted daughter of Superman, who during evil Fourth World New God Darkseid's invasion of Earth 2 becomes stranded in the main continuity of Earth 0, subsequently adopting the name Power Girl to hide her true identity. She returned to her source Earth in the story Earth 2: World's End (2014‚Äì2015). Publication history Power Girl was introduced in All Star Comics #58 in 1976, and was a member of the superhero team the Justice Society of America through the remainder of the 1970s and 1980s period known as the Bronze Age of Comics. Marvel Comics' then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978 that when DC Comics created Power Girl after Marvel had introduced Power Man, \\"I'm pretty annoyed about that. ...I've got to ask the Marvel lawyer ‚Äì she's supposed to be starting a lawsuit about that and I haven't heard anything. I don't like the idea. ... You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and [DC Comics] sued us because they had Wonder Woman, and ... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got Power Girl. Oh, boy. How unfair.\\"\\"Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at James Madison University\\", The Comics Journal #42, October 1978, p. 55 Ironically, Marvel had previously published Thor #207, written by Power Girl co-creator Gerry Conway, in which Len Wein's character says, \\"Whoever heard of Powergirl, anyhow?\\"Issue #207 ‚Äî released January 1973 After All Star Comics was canceled as a part of the DC Implosion, the character would continue to appear along with the rest of the JSA in Adventure Comics for a six-issue run. Due in part to her being one of the more popular characters in All Star Comics at the time, she was given a solo tryout in Showcase issues 97‚Äì99, which expanded on her pre-Crisis origin. During this time, she was a regularly featured character in the annual Justice Society crossovers in the original Justice League of America series. She was a founding member of Infinity Inc., appearing in each of the first 12 issues and making later guest appearances. After DC's continuity-altering Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, her origin was retconned in Secret Origins vol. 2, #11 and she became a magic-based character with ties to ancient Atlantis, leading to appearances in The Warlord. The character did not receive her own self-titled series until the Power Girl miniseries of 1988.The Comic Book Database ‚Äì Power Girl (1988) The character became a featured member of Justice League Europe (a spin off from Justice League International) for the run of the series. After the cancellation of JLI, the character joined Chris Claremont's creator-owned series Sovereign Seven and appeared in several issues of Birds of Prey. She eventually rejoined the Justice Society in JSA #31 and became a regular part of that series and its follow-up, Justice Society of America vol. 3. Power Girl played a significant role in the continuity-changing events of Infinite Crisis (2005), which tied into her starring role in the first JSA Classified story arc \\"Power Trip\\" in 2005 (issues #1‚Äì4 of the series).The Comic Book Database ‚Äì \\"Power Trip\\" These stories heavily featured the revelation that Power Girl was in fact the Earth- Two Power Girl and a Kryptonian, who survived Crisis, and that her Atlantean backstory had been a lie. Starting in July 2009, Power Girl received her first ongoing series, simply titled Power Girl (volume 2), with the first twelve issues written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, drawn by Amanda Conner,Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 338: \\"Writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti, together with artist Amanda Conner, emphasized the fun of Power Girl in her first ongoing series.\\" and colored by Paul Mounts. According to Comic Book Resources, the series has been \\"wildly praised for its fresh and fun approach.\\" When Palmiotti, Grey and Conner left the series after issue #12, Palmiotti said, \\"Amanda always said she could just commit to the book for a year, and as we got into the series we realized that we just couldn't do the same type of book with another artist at this point and decided it was a good idea to leave with her and give another team a shot.\\" Judd Winick took over as writer with artist Sami Basri beginning with issue #13. Winick stated that the tone of the book will continue, and the premise of the character in New York. The trade paperback \\"Power Girl\\" () collects Showcase issues #97‚Äì99, Secret Origins volume 2 issue #11, JSA issues 32 and 39, and JSA Classified issues #1‚Äì4. \\"Power Girl: A New Beginning\\" () collects the first six issues of the 2009 series. \\"Power Girl: Aliens & Apes\\" () collects issues 7 through 12, and \\"Power Girl: Bomb Squad\\" () covers 13 to 18, and \\"Power Girl: Old Friends\\" collecting issues 19-27. The entirety of the Palmiotti/Grey/Conner run is contained in \\"Power Girl: Power Trip\\" () which collects JSA Classified #1‚Äì4 and Power Girl #1‚Äì12. Fictional character biography Journey from Krypton-Two Kara's father discovers that Krypton is about to explode, and places her in a spacecraft directed towards the Earth. Although this occurs at the same time that Kal-L's ship is launched, Kara's ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara‚Äôs Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of virtual reality. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians. Originally, by the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is shown to be in her early twenties. However, as mentioned in JSA Classified #1, her age at arrival has now been retconned to about eighteen in post-Crisis continuity. In Showcase #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time. Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship. Debut Power Girl's existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin Clark and his wife Lois Lane provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships. In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members Flash and Wildcat with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China. She then joins Robin and Star-Spangled Kid to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating Brainwave and Per Degaton, who were causing disasters around the world. She pushes their base towards the Sun, the heat causing the villains to fall unconscious. Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership. Having been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth. However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the secret identity of computer programmer Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to Wonder Woman's Purple Ray on Paradise Island). On the pre-Crisis Earth-Two, Power Girl's closest friend is the Huntress, the daughter of the Earth-Two Batman and Catwoman. The first contact between Power Girl and Earth-One's universe was on the crossover Justice League of America #147, written by Paul Levitz & Martin Pasko, where the character shows her attraction to that reality saying, \\"It has a much nicer brand of Superman, y'know?\\".Justice League of America #147 (October 1977): \\"Crisis in the 30th Century!\\".

However, her background was retconned; she was told that she was the descendant of the Atlantean sorcerer Arion, and was frozen in suspended animation for millennia until the present day.Secret Origins #11.

Later, while a member of Justice League Europe, she suffers a near fatal injury while battling a mystical being.

Although she recovers, Power Girl is significantly weaker, as she lost her vision powers and could not fly for a time. However, she regained them all as time went on. Power Girl adopts a one-eyed mangy cat, an animal which would affect much of the team. One aspect of this is her beloved cat is used to spy on the group by intelligence gathering criminals.\\"Justice League Europe Annual\\" #2 (1991). DC Comics.

Although she has worked with her again on a few occasions when needed, the relationship between the two is tense.

Powers and abilities As the biological cousin of Superman, Power Girl exhibits all of the classic Kryptonian powers: super strength; flight; super speed; invulnerability; x-ray, telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; freeze breath; and super-hearing. Over the years various writers have given Power Girl's Kryptonian power differing levels, reflecting the lower powers of the Earth-Two Superman Kal-L. For example, Power Girl can fly through space, but has to breathe, so before she leaves a planet, she must take a deep breath and hold it for several hours until she needs a new oxygen source. Power Girl needs to sleep or she will experience disorientation due to fatigue. However, as recently shown in \\"Brightest Day\\", she now draws her superpowers from yellow sunlight, just like Superman. The reason for this change has not yet been explained. Since she is from an alternative universe (pre-Crisis Earth Two), kryptonite has no effect on her, but she is still vulnerable to magic. As Karen Starr, she is an accomplished business woman and is regarded by Mr. Terrific as a first rate scientist. Even though Power Girl is from an alternative universe, her biology is still similar to Superman's. As one of a handful of characters who survived the Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC editorial was initially uncertain how to portray the character and attempted to portray Power Girl with a non-Kryptonian origin for a number of years. Power Girl's abilities have fluctuated since 1986. For some time, Power Girl believed she was an Atlantean.Infinite Crisis #2 At one point, Power Girl possessed telekinesis;Birds of Prey #42 at another she was vulnerable to attacks by certain natural elements (for example, wooden weapons).Supergirl #16 (1997) After sustaining severe injuries from a magic attack Power Girl retained only a degree of super strength, speed and durability.Justice League Europe #9 (1989) However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her superpowers.Justice Society of America #31 (2002) Physical appearance and costumes Power Girl's original Wally Wood artwork (1976) showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her figure and build conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women. However, in Wonder Woman #34 (2009), written by Gail Simone, Dinah Lance, the Black Canary, mentions Power Girl as having the top bosom of DCU, comparing her assets with a \\"national treasure\\".Wonder Woman #34 (September 2009). DC Comics. Her most common outfit is a leg-baring, figure-hugging, long-sleeved white leotard with a keyhole cut-out opening in the chest.All-Star Comics #58 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1976) According to character writer Jimmy Palmiotti, \\"Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said every issue I‚Äôm going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like hey, what‚Äôs with the tits? And that‚Äôs where they stopped. True story.\\" Power Girl was at one time portrayed as having a highly athletic but slender physique.Who‚Äôs Who in the DC Universe #18 (August 1986) Artists Bart Sears (in the Justice League Europe series), and later Alex Ross (in the limited series Kingdom Come) restored Power Girl's well-endowed shape. Ross rendered her as a heavily muscled Power Woman (as if she was an ardent bodybuilder). The character is consistently depicted as a large breasted young woman, and her physique is one of her most recognizable attributes ‚Äì to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.Power Girl #1, May 2009 Page 12 and 17. DC Comics.Jeph Loeb. Superman/Batman #6 (March 2004) Page 3. DC Comics. For example, Justice League Europe #37 (1992) attempts to explain Power Girl's revealing costume by having Crimson Fox question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume \\"shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.\\"Justice League Europe #37 (April 1992). DC Comics. Conversely, in JSA: Classified #2 (2005), writer Geoff Johns has Power Girl explain her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that \\"the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just‚Ä¶I couldn‚Äôt think of anything. I thought eventually, I‚Äôd figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven‚Äôt.\\"JSA: Classified #2 (October 2005). DC Comics. A similar treatment of the character can be seen in Superman/Batman #4 (written by Jeph Loeb), in which the heroes need to distract the Toyman while Batman and Superman battle Captain Marvel and Hawkman. Batman suggests that Power Girl's endowments would be likely to distract Toyman, a 13-year-old boy. Toyman later attempts to make a reference to the size of her chest before being cut off by Superman.Jeph Loeb. Superman/Batman #4 (January 2004). DC Comics. A variant of this joke is included in the Superman/Batman: Public Enemies movie.Warner Premiere, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, Warner Home Video (2009). DC Comics. Power Girl's costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from All-Star Comics #58 is that which is in use today: a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white bodysuit sporting a circular cleavage-exposing cut-out on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her). According to Gerry Conway, \\"The true, dumb reason for the circle? At the time, it was a convention for hero costumes to have a chest symbol. I thought a giant 'P' looked silly. The circle was intended as a nod to convention without being conventional. Not a sexy thing at all, until Wally Wood‚Äôs inks.\\" This window was closed for the first time in All-Star Comics #64, pencilled by Wood.All-Star Comics #64, Cover (February 1977). DC Comics. According to Conway, it was dictated by publisher Jenette Kahn, because \\"she felt it was sexist\\". During her time with Justice League Europe/America, she wears a capeless yellow and white spandex unitard, and later a blue and white spandex unitard with a short mini-cape, headband, and a diamond shaped opening on her chest, once again exposing her cleavage. She has also worn a headband, as had Supergirl prior to her death in Crisis on Infinite Earths. In a guest appearance in Green Lantern, Kara is seen in her large wardrobe closet with every costume design she has ever worn in DC continuity, deciding which costume to wear for that mission.Green Lantern and Power Girl one-shot (October 2000), part of the \\"Circle of Fire\\" story arc Her original costume returned when Johns and David Goyer had her rejoin the JSA. In Justice League: Generation Lost #16, she sports a variation of her traditional costume that includes pants.Justice League: Generation Lost #16 (Late February 2011). DC Comics. As part of DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Power Girl was reintroduced into the DC Universe as first being the Earth-2 Supergirl, where she wears a variation of the traditional Supergirl costume designed by Kevin Maguire that features red gloves and belt, and a new S-shield, identical to the new Earth 2 Superman's, and has a cape that attaches directly to the shield. However, some aspects of her continuity were retained: she was still adopted by Clark Kent and Lois Lane, married on Earth 2 before their deaths and still uses the secret identity of software entrepreneur Karen Starr. After some time passes, she decides to take on a new identity as she is now trapped on the mainstream DC Earth. Here she adopts the identity Power Girl, where she wears a white one piece body suit that covers her legs, and a red cape that attaches to a new P-shield symbol over her left breast. In Supergirl #19, she returns to her classic costume, complete with the opening on her chest, after her then- current costume is badly damaged. Later, when back in her home world, she discovers her cousin and adopted father Superman has been resurrected by Darkseid, but Superman sacrifices himself to help stave off Darkseid's attack on Earth. After his second death, Power Girl's adoptive mother Lois Lane (Red Tornado) gives her the S-shaped hope symbol from Superman's chest, which then becomes a part of Power Girl's costume.Earth 2: World's End #16 (2015). DC Comics. Other versions * The first use of the name Power Girl was a story in Superman #125 (1958). In this story, Lois Lane has a dream where she is a superhero named Power Girl who is constantly coming to the aid of a bumbling Clark Kent whom she dreams as a superhero named Power Man. In Power Girl #23 (June 2011), Power Girl adopts this incarnation's red wig disguise for her Karen Starr identity (along with glasses), after being advised by Superman to make Karen a real person, not just a costume. * In the final issue of 52 (2007), a new Multiverse is formed, consisting of 52 parallel realities. As a result of Mister Mind \\"eating\\" aspects of these realities, their histories are modified, and one takes on aspects of the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. This reality listed as \\"Earth-2\\" has its own Power Girl who has spent years in space searching for her long lost cousin Superman. As shown in several issues of Justice Society (Vol 3 Annual 1 (2008) and issues 18‚Äì25), the mainstream Power Girl was sent to Post-Crisis Earth-2 by Gog and was briefly confused to be the Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl by its native heroes. Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl returned to her source Earth and battled the mainstream Power Girl as she regarded the mainstream Power Girl to be an imposter who caused the disappearance of her source Earth Superman who she had been searching unsuccessfully for years off-world. Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl wears the original Power Girl costume and shows herself to be arrogant to the point of being unbalanced, and is overtly aggressive as shown when she openly tortured the mainstream Power Girl almost to the point of killing her as well as directly attacking the Earth-22 Superman. The two Power Girls parted with no apologies given for the torture. Starman stated that the mainstream Power Girl will have important interactions with the Post-Crisis Earth-2 heroes including the Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl at some points in the future (Justice Society Vol 3 #25), despite the obvious disregard the Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl has for the mainstream Power Girl. The Post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl has not reappeared since this storyline concluded. * In the Tangent Comics imprint, Power Girl is a vastly powered genetically engineered superhero created by the Chinese government. This Power Girl is of Chinese descent and is married to that reality's Superman who is an African American man with vast psionic powers. This powerful couple have conquered the Earth in the reality of Earth-9. * The JLA: Another Nail graphic novel features a Power Girl who is an ally of that reality's Black Canary and Black Orchid. Though visually identical to her Earth-2 counterpart, her relationship to Superman or if she is even a Kryptonian at all is never mentioned in the story. * In Kingdom Come, Power Girl is renamed Power Woman, and assists Superman in reforming the Justice League. * In JLA: Created Equal, Power Girl is a member of the Justice League. She has a daughter of her own, Kara Zor-L II. * A version of Power Girl appeared in Justice League International Annual #5, No Rules to Follow. This version of Kara has no memory of where she came from before she arrived on Earth. As part of a team of ten revealed metahumans, she sides with the heroes who go into hiding. * Karen, now stripped of her powers thanks to the Great Darkness Engine, appeared as a prisoner of Kid Karnevil's Neo-Nazi regime shown in the Fatherland storyline depicted in Justice Society of America #37‚Äì40. She is portrayed as one of the world's few living surviving superheroes, with most of her comrades having been executed. * An elderly, grotesque and blind version of Power Girl, known as Old Karrie, appeared in an alternative timeline depicted in Justice League: Generation Lost. Set in 2351, she is stated to be the sole survivor of a violent metahuman war instigated by Maxwell Lord. According to Karrie, even the immortal metahumans were killed in the war. She also claimed to have lost her powers, as a result of kryptonite. She is still somehow alive, after more than 300 years, without powers, food or even sleep.Justice League: Generation Lost #6. DC Comics. Another future Power Girl appears later in the series, fighting alongside a future incarnation of the Justice League. When Captain Atom is once again sent into the future, he meets an older Kara Zor-L, with white hair. She has abandoned her classical white bodysuit for a black one, with bracelets (similar to Wonder Woman's) & Superman's S-shield.Justice League: Generation Lost #14. DC Comics. * In the Ame-Comi line, Power Girl is that universe's equivalent of Superman. She is Kara Jor-El, daughter of Jor-El, cousin of Supergirl, and the primary protector of Metropolis. She makes no efforts to maintain a secret identity, and uses her corporation to utilize Kryptonian technology for the betterment of mankind. This version of Power Girl, unusually for most depictions of Kryptonians, doesn't get her powers from the sun.Ame-Comi: Power Girl #1. DC Comics. * A red haired version of Power Girl is seen amongst the agents employed by Monarch in the battle on Earth-51 during Countdown to Final Crisis. This version appears to be Kryptonian as she is shown to be susceptible to kryptonite and is slain by that world's version of Batman. Nothing is known about her personality or powers as she is seen only in a few panels and appears to be fully under Monarch's control and arrogantly describes Batman as being \\"just a human\\". It is the only line she speaks before being slain. * In the DC Comics Bombshells universe, Power Girl was cloned from Supergirl's DNA by Hugo Strange during the Siege of Leningrad, and was forced by her master to fight Supergirl until the latter convinces her to turn on Strange. She escapes the facility beneath the Church of the Savior on Blood thanks to the assistance of Supergirl and another superhuman clone whom she treated like a brother, Superman. * During the 2011 relaunch of DC Comics' entire superhero line known as The New 52, Karen Starr appears in the Mister Terrific series as a friend of the titular hero, with whom she has a casual relationship. In the series, Starr is still the head of Starr Enterprises, which was financed by her comrade in arms Helena Wayne (Huntress) after the latter hacked into Wayne Enterprises accounts. From a software design and development corporation, Starr Enterprises now purchases intellectual property and technology with possible interdimensional access capabilities so that the two women can return home.Mister Terrific #1 (September 2011). DC Comics. Power Girl subsequently stars in a new ongoing series, Worlds' Finest, which premiered in May 2012. In the new continuity both she and Huntress, with whom she is partnered, are from Earth 2 but were flung into the Prime Earth's universe by an interdimensional vortex of unknown origin during the closing stages of an invasion from Apokolips-2 which took the life of Earth-2's Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman. It is also revealed that prior to adopting the alias of Power Girl, she functioned as Earth 2's Supergirl and, in stark contrast to the Supergirl of Prime Earth, Karen loves her adopted Earth with a passion and was accepted with open arms by an adoring public. Power Girl eventually returned to her source Earth in the Earth 2: World's End weekly mini-series to team up with the new Earth-2 Superman Val-Zod. A temporarily amnesiac Power Girl from a seemingly alternative reality (not Earth 2, but more reminiscent of the pre-New 52 Power Girl) crashes in Harley Quinn's reality as shown in Harley Quinn (2013-) storyline \\"Power Outage\\" (Issues #10-13). Some of the missing time from this joint encounter was explored in the 6-issue mini-series Harley Quinn and Power Girl (2015). Due to an attack by some evil aliens she got knocked back to Earth and landed at Harley Quinn's feet, devoid of memories. Harley temporarily took her on as a partner and they fought crime together before being sent across the universe on a quest to return home. When Power Girl got her memories back and realized that Harley had lied to her, she was less than amused, but forgave her. However when Harley hit on her, Power Girl left her atop the Eiffel Tower. Power Girl has reappeared in Harley Quinn's ongoing series several times since and has recently taken Terra/Altee on as her sidekick/partner. Collected editions * Power Girl (collects JSA Classified #1-4, Showcase #97-99 and Secret Origins #11) * Power Girl: A New Beginning (collects Power Girl #1‚Äì6) * Power Girl: Aliens and Apes (collects Power Girl #7‚Äì12) * Power Girl: Bomb Squad (collects Power Girl #13‚Äì18) * Power Girl: Old Friends (collects Power Girl #19‚Äì27) * Power Girl: Power Trip (collects JSA Classified #1‚Äì4 and Power Girl #1‚Äì12) In other media Television * Although Power Girl did not directly appear in the Justice League animated series or the follow-up, Justice League Unlimited, the JLU character Galatea (voiced by Nicholle Tom) is based on her. This character is a clone of Supergirl (also voiced by Tom) created by Emil Hamilton (who sees her as a daughter, while she sees him as a father figure) from Project Cadmus as a contingency plan in case the Justice League turned against the US. Although the clone resembles Power Girl and wears a similar hairstyle and costume (at one point, she briefly drapes a red workout towel over her shoulder, resembling the half-cape of her comic book counterpart), her personality and origin are significantly different, being a supervillain who seeks the League's destruction. She also possesses a mental link with Supergirl, allowing them to experience each other's recent memories in the form of dreams. Galatea first appears in the first season's sixth episode, \\"Fearful Symmetry.\\" She subsequently appears at the end of season 2's \\"Flashpoint\\", and she is last seen in season 2's \\"Panic in the Sky\\". In her last appearance, \\"Panic in the Sky\\", she fights Supergirl for control of the Watchtower. She is defeated by Supergirl, who traps her in a contact, causing all of the Watchtower's power to flow through her, causing an overload. Following the massive surge of electricity, she is left twitching and catatonic; it is unknown whether she ultimately survives. Conversely, this continuity's Supergirl borrows several elements from Power Girl, such as having been in suspended animation (which had not been introduced in the Kara Zor-El mythology at that point) and being a surrogate cousin of Kal-El rather than a biological relative. Also, in her first appearance, in Superman: The Animated Series, when she first meets Jimmy Olsen, she's without a disguise and tells him that her name is \\"Karen\\". * Smallville  In the Smallville season 2 episode \\"Visage\\", Chloe Sullivan identifies Tina Greer (Lizzy Caplan) by the moniker \\"Power Girl\\".  In the Smallville season 3 episode \\"Extinction\\", the \\"meteor freaks\\" database created by Chloe Sullivan uses a program called Starr-Ware Database System 5.0, which hints at the existence of Karen Starr's corporation, Starrware, in the Smallville universe.  In the Smallville season 3 finale \\"Covenant\\", a girl named Kara (played by Adrianne Palicki) claims to be from Krypton, although she does not claim to be Kal-El's relative. However, when Lana Lang asks who she is, Clark pretends Kara is his visiting cousin. At the end of the episode, she is revealed to be Lindsay Harrison, a human empowered and possibly brainwashed by Jor-El's technology. As with many of the show's future superheroes, who tend to be dressed in the same colors as the costumes of their comic-book counterparts, Lindsay is dressed in white, matching the color of Power Girl's costume (minus the red cape and blue boots, as Lindsay never wore either a jacket or shoes).  In the Smallville season 10 episode \\"Supergirl\\", Lois Lane suggests \\"Power Girl\\" as a name for Kara Zor-El (then known as \\"Maiden of Might\\"). * Former The Flash executive producer Andrew Kreisberg hinted that Power Girl could appear in the series. * In the DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"#Powersurge\\", Supergirl (voiced by Nicole Sullivan) is presumed dead after a major battle with Livewire and decides to reinvent herself as a new heroine and becomes Power Girl. Her comic book origins on Earth-2 are referenced when Superman begins to suspect the ruse and she makes up a story on the spot about being an alternate universe's Supergirl. Film * Power Girl appears in the animated Superman/Batman: Public Enemies film, voiced by Allison Mack. This marks her first true appearance in animation, as opposed to the above JLU version which is merely based on her. In the film, she works under the command of Captain Atom, who is under orders from President Lex Luthor. When Superman is framed for murdering Metallo, she is the only one of her group to truly doubt his guilt, and she later switches sides and helps him and Batman. She angrily attacks Major Force after it is revealed he killed Metallo and almost killed Batman; in the fight, she accidentally ruptures Force's containment suit, almost causing him to explode, which would unleash his nuclear energies on the city. The potential disaster is averted by Captain Atom, who absorbs all of the dying Force's energy into his own containment suit, making himself considerably more powerful in the process but passing out from the strain. She is later revealed to have helped them escape from Hawkman and Captain Marvel. As in the graphic novel on which the film is based, she is assigned to watch over the new teenage Toyman, Hiro Okamura, who finds her quite attractive, even \\"testing\\" his X-ray goggles on her, which she finds offensive; so she breaks his goggles and avoids him from then on (he later tries to make a comment on her breast size as well, before being interrupted by Batman). She is knocked unconscious by Lex Luthor in his new kryptonite enhanced battle- suit, but she recovers and is seen at the end, along with her squad members, taking the now-impeached Luthor into custody. * In Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, a evil version of Power Girl appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the Crime Syndicate. * Power Girl is portrayed by Ashley Hinshaw in the 2011 short film The Death and Return of Superman. * While Power Girl doesn't appear herself, the animated Batman and Harley Quinn film briefly features a waitress, at a superhero themed restaurant called Superbabes, who is dressed in a Power Girl costume. The same restaurant is shown to offer a \\"Power Girl Jumbo Combo\\". * Power Girl makes a brief appearance in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. Miscellaneous * Power Girl appears in the DC Animated Universe in the comic book series: Adventures in the DC Universe (vol. 1) #6, Justice League Unlimited (vol. 1) #13, Justice League Unlimited (vol. 1) #16, Justice League Unlimited (vol. 1) #3, Justice League Unlimited (vol. 1) #34, Justice League Unlimited (vol. 1) #8 and Superman and Batman Magazine (vol. 1) #1. * Power Girl appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold #1 (March 2009), in which she helps Batman to stop Lex Luthor. Much like her mainstream comic counterpart, she came from an alternative universe's Krypton. In her civilian identity, she goes by the name Karen Starr and is a computer programmer. Her goal is to create a device to monitor Earth's condition, so that her new home planet will not suffer the fate of Krypton.Batman: The Brave and the Bold #1. DC Comics. Video games * Power Girl appears in the DC Universe Online video game, voiced by Adrienne Mishler. In the villain campaign, the players help Parasite to defeat Power Girl and to gain a sample of her DNA so that Lex Luthor can be one step ahead of cracking the Kryptonian genetic code. She is also a playable character in DC Universe Online through \\"Legends PvP\\". * Power Girl appears as DLC in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. * Power Girl appears in Injustice 2 as a premier skin for Supergirl, voiced by Sara Cravens.

The skits, which also feature parody versions of Superman and Aquaman, feature AOTS guest host Carrie Keagan as a physically accurate recreation of the character, although the skits cast Power Girl in the stereotypical \\"dumb blonde\\" role; for example, the second skit has Power Girl trying to convince her friends that actor Kevin Bacon is, in fact, made of bacon.G4TV: Power Girl Shares Her Thoughts on Kevin Bacon; accessed Oct. 14, 2010 * The character was ranked ninth in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list.

During the 32¬Ω-month war, the Nationalists have used about 1,300 aircraft and the Republicans about 1,500; about 10,000 people have died in air attacks. Early Republican numerical air superiority had been challenged almost immediately by the technical superiority of Italian Fiat CR.32 fighters and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, and German Junkers Ju 52 bomber-transports; Soviet Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters had given the Republicans air superiority in the winter of 1936‚Äì1937, but the Nationalists had achieved lasting air superiority after German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Heinkel He 111 bombers and Italian Savoia- Marchetti SM.79 bombers had arrived in 1937. Germany has sent about 600 aircraft to Spain, Italy about 660, the Soviet Union 1,000, and other countries (principally France) about 350. The German, Italian, and Soviet air forces have learned a great deal about the employment of modern aircraft in warfare through their involvement, and the Luftwaffes Condor Legion in particular has used the conflict to test new aircraft and revolutionary new air warfare concepts.The Main Events of the Spanish Civil WarThomas, Hugh, The Spanish Civil War, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1986, , pp. 927, 937, 940, 941, 977, 978, 980‚Äì981.

Early life Jennie George was born Eugenie Sinicky in Trani, Italy, where her parents Oleg and Natasha were displaced persons from the Soviet Union. Oleg and Natasha separated in 1955 and divorced in 1958. Oleg died in 1960, aged 39, after years of heavy drinking and smoking, during which he was frequently violent towards his wife and sometimes his daughter.Brad Norington, \\"Unions of the Heart\\", Sydney Morning Herald, Spectrum, 7 November 1998, p. 7s She was educated at the Burwood Girls High School (where she was first called Jennie, as Eugenie was deemed too hard to pronounce), Sydney University and the Sydney Teachers College. In February 1968 she married Paddy George, a full-time activist for the Communist Party and NSW State Secretary of the Eureka Youth League, of which she was also a member. Jennie George was a secondary school teacher and an active member of the teacher's union. George was elected General Secretary of the New South Wales Teachers Federation 1980‚Äì82. Career George was Vice President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in 1987, Assistant Secretary of the ACTU 1991-96 and President of the ACTU 1996- March 2000. She was the first woman to hold this position. She was Assistant National Director, Trade Union Training Authority 1989-91 and a board member of Delta Electricity from 2000 to 2001. In November 1994 she was endorsed as the Left faction's candidate for a Victorian Senate seat. When Victorian Senator Olive Zakharov, also a member of the Left, was killed in a road accident in March 1995, it was assumed that George would be nominated to fill the casual vacancy. However, factional negotiations resulted in the seat going to a member of the Right faction, Jacinta Collins. George then withdrew her candidacy and did not reconsider a political career until returning to Sydney after leaving the ACTU. She sought support for a seat in either of the houses of the NSW Parliament, but this came to nothing. She was then offered a chance to stand for the federal seat of Throsby in New South Wales in 2001.Alan Ramsey, \\"Labor's just a big, big man's world\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 June 2000, Opinion, p. 41 George served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage from 20 March 2002, on the Standing Committee on Family and Community Services from 20 March 2002 to 31 August 2004 and on the Standing Committee on Family and Human Services from 2 December 2004. She was Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Environment and Heritage from 2004 to 2007. She retired from Parliament at the 2010 federal election. Unlike other ACTU Presidents (including most notably former Prime Minister Bob Hawke) who went on to be elected to Federal Parliament, George did not hold a ministerial position during her federal parliamentary career. She was made an Officer (AO) in the General Division of the Order of Australia on 10 June 2013.

To correct for phase errors, a tint control is provided on NTSC television sets, which allows the user to manually adjust the phase relationship between the color information in the video and the reference for decoding the color information, known as the \\"color burst\\", so that correct colors may be displayed. The tint control is normally set by sight to create satisfactory skin tones in a picture. The range of adjustment typically allows these colors to be adjusted from a green to a magenta tint. Television sets produced in recent decades typically include a (sometimes non-defeatable) distortion of the color decoding spectrum, to minimize the visual effects of phase error and lessen the need to adjust the tint control. On broadcast equipment, such as timebase correctors and studio monitors, this control is typically marked \\"phase,\\" as it adjusts the phase of the color signal with respect to the color burst signal. Since the problem of phase errors in the real world became well known after the introduction of NTSC, the later PAL and SECAM color television standards attempted to correct for them. PAL uses the same color modulation scheme as NTSC but averages the received color information over adjacent scan lines, resulting in reduced color detail but canceling out small to moderate phase errors. (Severe phase errors result in picture grain and loss of color saturation in the PAL scheme.) SECAM uses a different modulation scheme that does not rely on the phase of the color signal. Because of this the amplitude of the color signal (color saturation) is unaffected as well. Because SECAM only broadcasts half the color information on each line, the color resolution is halved just like in the PAL system. Most TV sets designed for these later standards lack tint controls, as PAL and SECAM are not supposed to experience the problems a tint control would correct. (This leaves the viewer unable to correct for color errors originating at the transmission site, however.) Multistandard sets have tint controls for NTSC viewing, but the controls are inoperative when watching PAL or SECAM signals.

The letterer's use of typefaces, calligraphy, letter size, and layout all contribute to the impact of the comic. The letterer crafts the comic's \\"display lettering\\": the story title lettering and other special captions and credits that usually appear on a story's first page. The letterer also writes the letters in the word balloons and draws in sound effects. Many letterers also design logos for the comic book company's various titles.  History   Origins  By the time comic books came of age in the 1940s, the huge volume of work demanded by publishers had encouraged an assembly-line process, dividing the creative process into distinct tasks: writer, penciller, letterer, inker, and colorist. By the late 1940s, it became possible to make a living just lettering comic strips and comic books for artists, studios, and companies that didn't have the time or desire to do it in-house. The career of freelance letterer was born, and by the 1950s, letterers such as Gaspar Saladino, Sam Rosen, and Ben Oda were crafting full-time careers as letterers for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and King Features.Klein, Todd. \\"How it all began,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering ‚Äì Logos ‚Äì Design.

Computer lettering  The evolution of desktop publishing powered by computers, especially those made by Apple, began in the 1980s, and started having a gradual impact on comics lettering soon after. One of the first users of computer-generated lettering was writer/artist John Byrne, who made fonts from existing lettering. (Incidentally, Byrne made use of existing lettering by other artists, such as Dave Gibbons, without their permission.Klein, Todd. \\"Computer lettering,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering ‚Äì Logos ‚Äì Design.

Retrieved December 2, 2005. Other early users of computer lettering were David Cody Weiss and Roxanne Starr, who experimented in computer lettering with Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot Comics. Computer lettering really started making an impact with the availability of the first commercial comic book font, \\"Whizbang\\" (created by Studio Daedalus) around 1990. In the early 1990s letterer Richard Starkings and his partner John Roshell (formerly Gaushell) began creating comic book fonts and started Comicraft, which has since become the major source of comics fonts (though they have competition from others, such as Blambot). In deference to tradition, at first computer lettering was printed out and pasted onto the original artwork, but after a few years, as comics coloring also moved to desktop publishing, digital lettering files began to be used in a more effective way by combining them directly with digital art files, eliminating the physical paste-up stage altogether. Wildstorm Comics was ahead of the curve, Marvel came around a few years later, and DC held to traditional production methods the longest, but now nearly all lettering is digitally applied. In the early years of the 21st Century, the mainstream American comics companies moved almost exclusively to in-house computer lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer. Chris Eliopoulos designed the fonts for Marvel's in-house lettering unit, and Ken Lopez did the same at DC.Contino, Jennifer. \\"ABCs with Orzechowski,\\" Comicon.com: The Pulse (Dec. 30, 2003).

Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.  Tools and methods   On-the-board  The traditional comic book letterer needs little more than a lettering guide, a pen or brush, India ink, and white paint for corrections. Some situations required the letterer to use vellum overlays on top of the original art.  EC Comics  The lettering in the comics of the sensationalist horror comics publisher EC Comics (c. 1945 ‚Äì c. 1955) was different from other publishers ‚Äì its mechanical appearance gave it a sterile aspect, and helped define the particular style of comics EC was known for. EC's letterers achieved their particular look by using a Leroy lettering set, a device popular amongst draftsmen and architects. The Leroy lettering set consisted of a stylus and a pantographic lettering form.Burns, Casey. \\"Squa Tront and Spa Fon (2001)\\", Casey Burns official website. Accessed May 21, 2011.  Computer lettering  Most Marvel and DC books are now lettered using a graphics program such as Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop, and a font that resembles hand lettering. Computer lettering provides a lot of technical shortcuts, especially by combining the lettering work directly with digital art files, eliminating the tedious physical paste- up stage altogether. There are also still comics artists and inkers who prefer to have the lettering directly on their pages. First, it saves drawing time (not having to put art where a big caption will be); and second, comics tell a story, and a page of comics art without the lettering is only half the story. Long-time letterer John Workman toes a middle ground between traditional and digital lettering. In addition to his \\"on-the-art boards work\\", Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a Wacom tablet.  Awards and recognition  Both the Eisner Awards and the Harvey Awards feature a \\"best letterer\\" category. (The Shazam Awards also had a \\"best letterer\\" category until the Awards' demise in 1975.)

The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing. Only prototype and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 93, 95, 103‚Äì6, Cypress, CA, 2013. . Design and development The B-35 was the brainchild of Jack Northrop, who made the flying wing the focus of his work during the 1930s. In 1941 before the USA entered World War II, Northrop and Consolidated Vultee Corporation had been commissioned to develop a large wing-only, long-range bomber designated XB-35 and XB-36. Northrop advocated a \\"flying wing\\" as a means of reducing parasitic drag and eliminating structural weight not directly responsible for producing lift. Consolidated Vultee proposed a more conventional design with fuselage and tail, which was much larger and heavier. In theory, the B-35 could carry a greater payload faster, farther, and cheaper than a conventional bomber. On December 1941, the Army Air Forces awarded prototype contracts to both Northrop and Consolidated Vultee for a bomber that could carry of bombs to a round-trip mission of . Requested performance was a maximum speed of , cruise speed of , and service ceiling of . This aircraft would be able to bomb Nazi- occupied Europe in the event that Britain fell (this was similar to Nazi Germany's own Amerikabomber program design competition through the RLM, itself initiated in the spring of 1942). The original April 1941 USAAC proposal was first submitted to Boeing and Consolidated Aircraft Company and led to the production of the Convair B-36. In May, one month before the USAAF was created, the contract was also extended to include Northrop, inviting them to submit a design along the lines they were already exploring. Since the new aircraft would require a significant amount of engineering work in untested waters, the first order placed was actually for two prototypes of the XB-35, and included Northrop's plan to also build two all-wood one-third scale flying models to measure performance and stability; these were dubbed the Northrop N-9M (M standing for model). This aircraft would be used to gather flight test data on the Flying Wing design. Jack Northrop also hired part-time the leading aeronautical designer of the day Theodore von Karman, to evaluate and who approved of Northrop's initial design, and to start building the tooling for building the prototypes ... as explained in detail in the book \\"Goodbye Beautiful Wing\\" by Terrence O'Neill. The N9Ms would also be used as a flight trainer, to familiarize pilots with the radical, all-wing concept. Early in 1942, design work on the XB-35 itself began in earnest. Unlike conventional aircraft, truly \\"tailless\\" flying wings cannot use a rudder for lateral control as it was absent, so a set of clamshell-like, double split flaps (so called flaperon, a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on the trailing edge of the wingtips were used. When aileron control was input, they were deflected up or down as a single unit, just like an aileron. When rudder input was made, the two surfaces on one side opened, top and bottom, creating drag, and yawing the aircraft. By applying input to both rudder pedals, both sets of surfaces were deployed creating drag so that the airspeed or the glide angle could be manipulated.Winchester 2005, p. 193. Variants XB-35 On 22 November 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF, or AAF) signed the development contract for an XB-35;Allen 2003, p.5 the contract included an option for a second aircraft, which was exercised on 2 January 1942. The first was to be delivered in November 1943, the second in April of the next year. Detailed engineering began in early 1942. A fuselage-like crew cabin was to be embedded inside the wing; it included a tail cone protruding from the trailing edge. This tail cone would contain the remote sighting stations for the bomber's gunners and a cluster of rear-firing machine guns in the production aircraft. In the midsection of the cabin, there were folding bunks for off-duty crew on long missions.Allen 2003, pp. 6‚Äì7. The aircraft's bomb load was to be carried in six smaller bomb bays, three in each wing section, fitted with roll-away doors; this original design precluded the carrying of large bombs, and the early atomic bombs, without bomb bay redesign and modifications.Flight 20 March 1947, p. a.Allen 2003, p. 8. Production aircraft would have defensive armament of twenty machine guns or 20 mm cannon, carried in six turrets, two turrets along the aircraft's center line, four above and below the outer wings, and four in the \\"stinger\\" tail cone.Gunston 1996, p. 33. The B-35 would take advantage of a new aluminum alloy devised by Alcoa; it was considerably stronger than any alloy used previously. In June 1946, the XB-35 made its first flight, a 45-minute trip from Hawthorne, California, to Muroc Dry Lake, without incident. The XB-35's engines and propellers were AAF property, and had not been tested for engine-propeller compatibility by either Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Standard, or by the AAF which bought them at Wright Field without testing them or assuring reliability, and then shipped them to Northrop. Microfilmed records of reports and correspondence of the XB-35 program relate that after three or four flights, power plant and propeller vibrations increased, and the very efficient contra-rotating propellers began failing with frustrating frequency. Meetings were called by Northrop, of the AAF, Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard where no one would take responsibility for correcting the AAF's engines and propellers. In addition, the AAF failed to supply the AC electrical alternator, insisting on Northrop using an onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) unit driven by an automotive engine which limited the high-altitude, high-speed XB-35 to test flights below . The AAF also refused to allow Northrop proposed modification of the bomb bays to carry the standard Mk. 3 atomic bomb, while at the same time declaring the AF would not buy the bomber unless it could carry the A-bomb. Northrop reluctantly agreed to try a single-rotation propeller, which slightly increased takeoff distance and a reduced rate-of-climb and maximum speed. YB-35 Flying Wing showing its quartet of pusher contra-rotating propellers. The option was later discarded due to severe vibration in flight and later changed to traditional single rotating propeller Problems with the quartet of contra-rotating propellers' shafts comprising each aircraft's drive-line system continued until finally Jack Northrop himself grounded the XB-35s until the government fixed their propulsion system. Concurrently, the AAF ordered Northrop to convert two of the YB-35 airframes to YB-49s, essentially substituting eight jet engines for four reciprocating engines. As a result, the airframe promptly flew to more than and topped in flight tests, verifying the XB-35 air frame's aerodynamics, but at the price of range. The prop- version had a design range capable of reaching targets away, but the jet- engine version's range was cut nearly in half. The new version disqualified it for the Air Force's top-priority mission as a strategic bomber, which at that time meant striking at the USSR's industrial and military complexes in the Ural Mountains.\\"US government microfilm A2061, XB-35 Project Report, Vols. 1‚Äì4\\", Air Force Case History Files.

YB-35 On 30 September 1943, 13 pre-production YB-35s were ordered by the Army Air Force. The first one did not fly until 15 May 1948. While some Air Force generals felt the piston engines made the B-35 obsolete, it remained superior in overall performance and range to its competitor, the Convair B-36, and General Hoyt Vandenberg wrote that only the B-35 and the B-36 had adequate range for the Air Force's primary mission, and nothing comparable would be available until the mid-1950s. Only the first YB-35 was ever flown. Multiple flight testing demonstrated that it was airworthy; it was then parked and ignored for more than a year until being scrapped on 20 July 1949. The unfinished YB-35 #2, was scrapped almost a month later, on 19 August 1949. The other 11 of 13 YB-35 aircraft ordered underwent conversion to other power plants. YB-49 Two of those airframes were converted to use eight Allison J35 jet engines, and designated YB-49. The second YB-35 converted to a YB-49 all-jet airframe crashed after Air Force test pilot Forbes pulled the outer wing panels off during stall tests at . The first YB-35 airframe jet-modified to a YB-49 completed all stall tests and even demonstrated recovery from a spin. It was later destroyed after the Flying Wing's forward landing gear strut and wheel collapsed after encountering high vibration during a highly unusual taxi test procedure made with the engine's fuel tanks full, causing a fire that spread rapidly. Seven incomplete airframes began conversion to jet power as YB-49B but were never finished. YRB-49A A third YB-35 airframe was converted to use six jet engines (two placed in under wing pods) for use as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft, designated YRB-49A. After only a few months, the Air Force's order for 30 YRB-49As was suddenly cancelled without explanation. The sole YRB-49A built flew 13 test flights and then was returned to Northrop's Ontario Airport. The last of Northrop's big Flying Wings sat abandoned at the airport's edge for two years and was finally ordered scrapped on 1 December 1953.Winchester 2005, p. 192. EB-35B In order to test the advanced Northrop T37 Turbodyne turboprop engine, produced by a Northrop subsidiary, the final YB-35A was to be converted to a single EB-35B test aircraft (in this case the prefix \\"E\\" for the designation meant \\"Exempt,\\" not the later Electronic). The test aircraft would use two of the powerful T37 engines, each driving a pair of contra-rotating, paddle-blade propellers; the first planned ground tests were to be made using a single T37 engine. When the EB-35B project was canceled, the Air Force had Northrop's Turbodyne engine name, all its patents, and technical data reassigned to General Electric.Wooldridge, E.T. \\"The Northrop Bombers.\\" Century of Flight, 2003. Retrieved: 27 August 2011. B2T The B2T was a U.S. Navy designation for one B-35B airframe to be used for development trials; the project was canceled while still in the planning stage. Operational history The U.S. Army Air Forces had originally ordered 200 production model B-35s. Since Northrop's facilities were not up to the task of producing them, the Glenn L. Martin Company agreed to undertake mass production. This proved irrelevant when the aircraft had too many development problems. Even disregarding these, so many of Martin's engineers had been drafted by 1944 that Martin pushed the first delivery date back to 1947. Seeing that it would almost certainly never be ready in time for the war, the Army Air Forces canceled the production contract, though the Air Technical Services Command continued to run the program for research purposes. Actual flight tests of the aircraft revealed several problems: the contra- rotating props caused constant heavy drive-shaft vibration and the government- supplied gearboxes had frequent malfunctions and reduced the effectiveness of propeller control. After only 19 flights, Northrop grounded the first XB-35; the second aircraft was grounded after eight test flights. During this time, the contra-rotating propellers were removed and replaced with four-blade single-rotation propellers. In addition to having continued drive shaft vibration problems, the new single-rotation props greatly reduced the aircraft's speed and performance. Furthermore, the intricate exhaust system turned into a fiasco to maintain. After only two years of use, the engines already showed signs of metal fatigue. In the end, the program was terminated due to its technical difficulties and the obsolescence of its reciprocating propeller engines, and the fact it was far behind schedule and over budget. Another contributing factor to the program's failure was the tendency of Northrop to become engaged in many experimental programs, which spread its small engineering staff far too wide. While the competing propeller-driven B-36 was obsolete by that time and had just as many or even more development problems, the Air Force needed a very long-range, post-war atomic bomber to counter the perceived Soviet threat. It had more faith that the B-36's \\"teething\\" problems could be overcome, compared to those of the new and radical \\"Flying Wing\\", the unofficial name that was later associated with all the Northrop \\"all-wing\\" designs. There are long-standing conspiracy theories about the cancellation of the Flying Wing program; specifically, an accusation from Jack Northrop that Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington attempted to coerce him to merge his company with the Atlas Corporation-controlled Convair. In a 1979 taped interview, Jack Northrop claimed the Flying Wing contract was cancelled because he would not agree to a merger because Convair's merger demands were \\"grossly unfair to Northrop.\\" When Northrop refused, Symington supposedly arranged to cancel the B-35 and B-49 program. Symington became president of Convair after he left government service a short time later.Fitzsimons 1978, p. 2282. Other observers note that the B-35 and B-49 designs had well-documented performance and design issues while the Convair B-36 needed more development money.Donald 1997, p. 709. At that time, it appeared the B-36 program might be cancelled as well as the B-35. The USAF and the Texas Congressional delegation desired to have a production program for the large Fort Worth aircraft production factory, and Convair had much more effective lobbyists in Washington DC. The Northrop Corporation was always a technological trailblazer but the independent nature of Jack Northrop often collided with the political wheeling-and-dealing in Washington that tended to run huge military allocations. Consequently, the B-36 prevailed, with just over 380 aircraft built. Furthermore, earlier the same year, when the YB-49 jet bomber was cancelled, Northrop received a smaller production contract for its F-89 Scorpion fighter as compensation for the lost Flying Wing contract.Donald 1997, p. 708.Jones 1975, p. 238.

Early life Georgiou was born in Corfu, Greece, and was educated at Melbourne University. He was a senior tutor in politics at La Trobe University 1970‚Äì73, Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser 1975‚Äì79, Secretary of the Ethnic Television Review Panel 1979‚Äì80, Director of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs 1980‚Äì85, Senior Adviser to the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock, 1985, Director of the Victorian Liberal Policy Unit 1985‚Äì89 and State Director of the Victorian Liberal Party 1989‚Äì94. Parliament Upon the resignation of former Liberal leader Andrew Peacock, Georgiou was preselected to contest the 1994 Kooyong by-election for the Liberal Party. He won the safe Liberal seat on 64 per cent of the two-party vote against the main contender, the Greens. He was only the fourth member for this blue-ribbon non-Labor seat in 72 years. In 2005, Georgiou was one of a small number of Liberal parliamentarians who expressed disagreement with the government's policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers. He began speaking out against the policy in June and began drafting a private member's bill aimed at softening the policy. On 17 June, Prime Minister John Howard announced a shift in that policy, allowing families in detention with children to enter the community and ensuring that long-term detainees would have their cases reviewed regularly. Georgiou was given a large amount of credit for the policy change. On 11 August 2006, Georgiou joined Russell Broadbent and Judi Moylan in crossing the floor to vote against the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, that would force all asylum seekers to be processed offshore. Preselection challenge In March 2006, Josh Frydenberg, an investment banker and former political adviser, made known his intention to challenge Georgiou for his seat in an internal Liberal Party preselection. This followed another prominent Liberal former Victorian President Michael Kroger's decision not to contest the seat. Liberal Deputy Leader Peter Costello endorsed Georgiou and Kroger is believed to have supported him. In the days leading to the preselection convention, Queensland frontbenchers Ian Macfarlane, Peter Dutton and Santo Santoro backed Frydenberg's credentials, to the dismay of former Premier Jeff Kennett.ABC News Online (2006).

Each episode was one hour long including commercials. The show ran from 1958 to 1964. The character of detective Stuart Bailey was first used by writer Huggins in the 1948 film I Love Trouble. Description Initial set-up and characters Roger Smith with guest stars Biff Elliot and Maureen Leeds, 1961 Private detective Stuart (\\"Stu\\") Bailey (Zimbalist) was a former government secret agent. Jeff Spencer (Smith) also was a former government agent, and a nonpracticing attorney. The duo worked out of stylish offices at 77 Sunset Boulevard, Suites 101 and 102. The street address was colloquially known as Sunset Strip, and was located between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road on the south side of the strip next door to Dean Martin's real-life lounge, Dino's Lodge. Typically, the two detectives would alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week, and a Jeff Spencer case the next‚Äîalthough depending on the nature of the case, sometimes the two would team up. Suzanne Fabry, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by Jacqueline Beer, handled the phones for Sunset Answering Service located in suite 103. The firm of Bailey & Spencer employed her answering service, as did other clients. Although not technically an employee of the firm, Suzanne would be involved in casework from time to time, especially in season two. Comic relief was provided by Roscoe the racetrack tout (played by Louis Quinn). Roscoe was forever hanging around the offices, giving horse racing tips. However, he was sometimes used as an operative, and was an ever-informed source concerning the word on the street. The firm's most frequently seen police contact was Lt. Roy Gilmore (Byron Keith), who was almost never called by his first name. The 'breakout' character, who had not been included in the pilot film, was Gerald Lloyd \\"Kookie\\" Kookson III (Edd Byrnes), the rock and roll-loving, wisecracking, hair-combing hipster and aspiring PI who initially worked as the valet parking attendant at Dino's, the club next door to the detectives' office. \\"Kookie\\" often found a way to get himself involved in the firm's cases, and was eventually made a full partner in the firm with his own office. Also seen relatively frequently were The Frank Ortega Trio, playing themselves as the jazzy house band at Dino's Lodge. Tone and cultural impact Huggins intended the show to be a hard-edged drama, but beginning with the 23rd episode, \\"The Pasadena Caper,\\" the tone started to become much lighter, with a strong element of self-deprecating humor and \\"caper\\" frequently used in episode titles. The catchy theme song, written by the accomplished team of Mack David and Jerry Livingston, typified the show's breezy, jazzed atmosphere. The song became the centerpiece of an album of the show's music in Warren Barker orchestrations, which was released in 1959, a top-10 hit in the Billboard LP charts. Sue Randall and \\"Kookie\\", 1964 The Kookie character became a cultural phenomenon, with his slang expressions such as \\"ginchy\\" (cool) and \\"piling up Zs\\" (sleeping). When Kookie helped the detectives on a case by singing a song, Edd Byrnes began a singing career with the novelty single \\"Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)\\" (Warner Bros. 5047), based on his frequent combing of his hair; this featured Connie Stevens on vocals in the chorus and the song, with words and music by Irving Taylor, became the first hit single for the recently established Warner Bros. Records. Kookie was also used to provide product placement for Harley-Davidson, appearing on their Topper motor scooter in the show and in Harley-Davidson advertisements. Cast changes during seasons 1‚Äì5 When Byrnes' demands for more money and an expanded role were not met, he left the show for a period in season two. After an absence of 16 episodes beginning in January 1960, Byrnes and Warner Brothers settled their differences, and Kookie came back beginning in May. (During his absence, Roscoe's and Suzanne's roles were beefed up to handle the leg work normally assigned to Kookie.) For the 1960‚Äì61 season, Richard Long (who had previously been seen in different roles in two season one 77 Sunset Strip episodes) moved over from the recently canceled detective series Bourbon Street Beat. His BSB character of Rex Randolph was said to have left New Orleans and relocated to North Hollywood, joining Bailey and Spencer's firm, and taking office 104. The character was dropped after one season, but Long (once again playing different one-shot guest characters) was seen again on 77 Sunset Strip in seasons five and six. Kookie became a full- fledged detective and partner in the firm as of season four, taking over Rex Randolph's office in 104. At the same time, Robert Logan became the new parking lot attendant, J.R. Hale, who usually spoke in abbreviations. Hale was seen throughout seasons four and five. Episode and guest cast highlights One of the series' more unusual episodes was the 1960 \\"The Silent Caper\\", written by Smith. It presented its story completely without dialogue, hence the title. Another off-beat entry was 1961's \\"Reserved For Mr. Bailey\\", which finds Zimbalist alone in a ghost town. He is the only main actor on screen for the entire hour. (This latter episode was never included in the syndication package, and many fans had expressed their frustration at being unable to see it again. After 56 years out of circulation, it finally resurfaced on MeTV on June 17, 2017.) The show was so popular that rising young actors clamored for guest spots. Up-and-comers who made guest appearances include: Ellen Burstyn, Roger Moore, DeForest Kelley, William Shatner, Mary Tyler Moore, Shirley MacLaine look-alike Gigi Verone, Robert Conrad, Dyan Cannon, Janet De Gore, Jay North, Connie Stevens, Irish McCalla, Adam West, Tuesday Weld, Sherry Jackson, Marlo Thomas, Max Baer Jr., Carole Mathews, Elizabeth Montgomery, Karen Steele, Randy Stuart, Susan Oliver, Robert Vaughn, Suzanne Storrs, Peter Breck, Donna Douglas, Troy Donahue, Chad Everett, Gena Rowlands, Cloris Leachman, Eve McVeagh, and Diane Ladd. Established film and TV actors and older stars who guest-starred include Fay Wray, Francis X. Bushman, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Ida Lupino, Liliane Montevecchi, Keenan Wynn, Rolfe Sedan, Jim Backus, Billie Burke, Buddy Ebsen, George Jessel, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Burgess Meredith, Nick Adams, Gerald Mohr, and Roy Roberts, among others. The show occasionally featured sports stars such as Sandy Koufax in guest roles. The Controversial Sixth Season, 1963‚Äì1964 Efrem Zimbalist Jr. In 1963, as the show's popularity waned, the entire cast was let go except for Zimbalist. Jack Webb was brought in as executive producer and William Conrad as a producer/director. The character of Stuart Bailey was presented as a solo private investigator, with no continuity or reference to his past years with Jeff Spencer, Suzanne, Kookie, and Roscoe, or his military OSS background. It was an abrupt, unexplained disconnect. The series and Bailey's personality took on a darker tone, and the familiar office, parking lot and Dino's Lodge were gone. A new musical theme was written by Bob Thompson. The season six show title was not changed, it still was an address, but Bailey's new office was dramatically different from Bailey and Spencer's 77 Sunset Strip office of the past five years. The interior of Bailey's new office building was shown behind the show's opening and closing credits, forcing viewers to ponder how the same address could look so very different (it was actually the historic Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles). There seemed to be no spoken mention of his office address in the season six shows, although in the episode \\"Bonus Baby\\" when a police officer inspects Bailey's Private Investigator License, a close-up shows the address \\"77 Sunset Strip\\". As the season progressed, there were some shifts in tone. Several episodes into the season, Bailey's stern personality became lighter, though still different from prior seasons. His secretary Hannah, previously known to sixth season viewers only because Bailey addressed her in his recorded dictations, was seen on-screen beginning in the season's eleventh episode. Played by Joan Staley, Hannah worked in Bailey's office, where he developed a romantic interest in her‚Äîbut she continually stymied and frustrated him by playing hard-to-get. As of episode \\"Alimony League\\" (the sixteenth of the season's twenty episodes), the opening and closing background of Bradbury building was gone, replaced by Bailey in silhouette walking past lighted store windows. This was actually a scene from \\"5\\" (the 6th Season opener) and it was supposedly located in New York City where Bailey arrived to work for a client to \\"pay his dead brother's way into heaven\\". Episode \\"The Target\\" was unusual because key roles were played by the show's primary behind-the-scenes people, who happened to also be experienced actors. Show producer William Conrad played \\"Maestrian\\", associate producer James Lydon played \\"Charlie\\", writer Tony Barrett played \\"Carnovan\\", and director Lawrence Dobkin played \\"Landers\\". Season six of 77 Sunset Strip was essentially a different show from what had aired in seasons one to five‚Äîa show that oddly used the title (and one character name and actor) from the different prior show, and showed a different building with the same address. Viewers did not appreciate such a massive alteration, and the show was cancelled halfway through its sixth season in February 1964. In the 1964 summer reruns period, shows from the Bailey and Spencer years were shown; the Season Six episodes were abandoned, rarely seen until September 2017 on MeTV.

The casts and scripts of these various shows sometimes crossed over, which was logistically easy, since they were all shot in Burbank on the Warner Bros. lot. Some of the detectives, played by the same actors, became regulars in other series after their original series had been cancelled. The office and bar/nightclub sets of 77 Sunset Strip and Hawaiian Eye were on the same WB soundstage, intertwined to save space, with shared room walls and some doors actually going between the sets (not obvious to viewers). Production crews would pay attention to each other. For example, a carpenter hammering on a set would hear \\"Quiet\\" from the other set and hold the hammer mid-stroke until hearing \\"Cut\\". Legacy Andra Martin as a guest star on 77 Sunset Strip with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., 1960 Currently, only an engraving in the Sunset Boulevard sidewalk (address number 8524) between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road commemorates 77 Sunset Strip, and the area is slated for redevelopment as part of \\"The Sunset Millennium\\" project. In a twist of fate, the opposition to the redevelopment of the area is known as \\"Save Our Strip\\" or \\"SOS\\" and is spearheaded by former 77 Sunset Strip semiregular Gigi Verone. No number 77 exists on the Strip, as all Sunset Boulevard addresses in the area have four digits. The show was referenced in an episode of Jay Ward's Fractured Flickers, showing a satirical depiction of Ward looking at a lineup of fictional shows, one of them being \\"77 Gaza Strip\\". Episodes of the television series can be seen in reruns, through syndication packages offered by Warner Bros. Studios. At one time, 43 episodes had been removed from syndication for various legal reasons, but 13 of these can now be seen in reruns. As of 2017, the syndication package aired on Me-TV contained every original episode. Thirty-one years after the series left the air, Warner Bros. proposed a modern revival of 77 Sunset Strip, that was to be the first hour-long drama series to air on the new WB Television Network. It was to be produced by Clint Eastwood and starred Jim Caviezel, Timothy Olyphant, and Maria Bello. A 25-minute pilot presentation was shot for upfronts in the spring of 1995, but despite a few attempts to get it modified and finalized for broadcast in 1995‚Äì1996, the project never made it past the testing stage. Early mentioning of the show was made in the network's fall affiliate presentation promotion, the 77 Sunset Strip logo visible in the movie backlot motif.

The YB-49 featured a flying wing design and was a turbojet-powered development of the earlier, piston-engined Northrop XB-35 and YB-35. The two YB-49s actually built were both converted YB-35 test aircraft. The YB-49 never entered production, being passed over in favor of the more conventional Convair B-36 piston-driven design. Design work performed in the development of the YB-35 and YB-49 nonetheless proved to be valuable to Northrop decades later in the eventual development of the B-2 stealth bomber, which entered service in the early 1990s. Design and development With the XB-35 program seriously behind schedule by 1944, and the end of piston-engined combat aircraft in sight, the production contract for this propeller-driven type was cancelled in May of that year. Nevertheless, the Flying Wing design was still sufficiently interesting to the Air Force that work was continued on testing a single YB-35A production aircraft. Among the aircraft later completed were two airframes that the Air Force ordered be fitted with jet propulsion and designated as YB-49s. The first of these new YB-49 jet-powered aircraft flew on 22 October 1947 (from Northrop airfield in Hawthorne, CA) and immediately proved more promising than its piston engined counterpart. The YB-49 set an unofficial endurance record of staying continually above 40,000 ft (12,200 m) for 6.5 hours. The second YB-49 was lost on 5 June 1948, killing its pilot, Major Daniel Forbes (for whom Forbes Air Force Base was named), co-pilot Captain Glen Edwards (for whom Edwards Air Force Base is named), and three other crew members, one of whom, 1st Lieutenant Edward Lee Swindell, was a crew member on the Boeing B-29 that assisted Chuck Yeager in breaking the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 aircraft. Their aircraft suffered structural failure, with both outer wing sections becoming detached from the center section. Speculation at the time was that the YB-49 was lost due to excessive pullout loads imposed on the heavy airframe when a scheduled flight test of the large bomber's stall recovery resulted in a sudden and dramatic high- speed, nose-over dive. The post-stall high-speed dive resulted from the clean, low-drag, all-wing design, which gave the YB-49 a rapid speed increase in any type of dive. Fellow YB-49 test pilot Robert Cardenas later claimed that the YB-49 rotated backwards in stall, and that he warned Edwards about it. Jack Northrop later countered that such a behavior was impossible for the all-wing design.\\"Modern Marvels: Extreme Aircraft s11-e33\\", 21-26min. History Channel, 25 August 2004. Retrieved: 25 August 2012. During flight tests in the 1940s, it was noticed that the aircraft had a small radar cross-section, due to its flying wing design. Decades later, this stealthy detail would prove crucial to the design of Northrop Grumman's advanced, all-wing B-2 bomber.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-49.htm On 9 February 1949, the first YB-49 flew from Muroc Air Force Base in California to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., in 4 hours 25 minutes,Wooldridge, E.T. \\"The Northrop bombers.\\" Century of Flight, 2003. Retrieved: 22 October 2010. after which President Truman ordered a flyby of Pennsylvania Avenue at rooftop level. The return flight from Andrews was marred when four of the eight engines had to be shut down due to oil starvation. Inspection after a successful emergency landing at Winslow Airport, Arizona, revealed no oil had been replaced in these engines at Wright after the Muroc-to-Andrews leg, raising a suspicion of industrial sabotage. The last operational YB-49 prototype was destroyed on 15 March 1950, during high-speed taxi trials at Muroc Field. The nose wheel began to encounter severe vibration problems and finally collapsed; the aircraft was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire. The taxi trials took place with the YB-49's fuel tanks full, an unusual testing procedure, fanning further speculation of industrial sabotage of the aircraft. The Air Force ordered the remaining uncompleted YB-35 piston-engined airframes be completed as production B-35B aircraft. Bombing target tests showed a tendency of flying wings to \\"hunt\\" in yaw after turns and when flying in \\"disturbed\\" air, degrading bombing accuracy. It was thought that one of the new Honeywell autopilots, with yaw damping, would correct this flaw. Northrop chief test pilot on the YB-35 and YB-49 programs Max Stanley contends in the 1992 Discovery Channel documentary \\"The Wing Will Fly\\", the adaptation of the autopilot in this dual function \\"damped out the directional oscillations to the degree where... I think you would say it met the (military) specifications.\\" Brig. General Robert Cardenas also flew the YB-49 during many of its test flights, praising the aircraft for its marvelous performance, while also noting the YB-49 required a very long bomb run to dampen out directional oscillations. Many of these challenges would eventually be overcome when fly-by-wire systems were developed in the 1950s, which were first used in regular production for the Convair B-58 Hustler and then when computer-generated artificial stability became available in the 1970s, culminating in the development of the all-wing Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber. The conversion of the long-range XB-35 to jet power essentially cut the effective range of the aircraft in half, putting it in the medium-range bomber category with Boeing's new swept-winged jet bomber the B-47 Stratojet. The B-47 was optimized for high-altitude and high-speed flight and, in an era where speed and altitude were becoming the name of the game, the YB-49's thick airfoil could never be maximized for high-speed performance. In the same Discovery Channel documentary, former Air Force Flight Test Center Historian Dr. James Young states his opinion that while political gamesmanship and back room dealing certainly played a role in the aircraft's demise, the Flying Wing program was ultimately cancelled for solid technological reasons. Operational history In June 1948, the Air Force ordered the type into full production as the RB-49A reconnaissance aircraft (company designations N-38 and N-39Chong, Tony, 2016.

It was powered by six jet engines, two of them externally mounted in under-wing pods, ruining the aircraft's sleek, aerodynamic lines, but extending its range by carrying additional fuel. The use of jet engines had resulted in considerably increased fuel consumption and decreased its range significantly below that of the rival Convair B-36. One YB-35 airframe (s/n 42-102369) was chosen as the prototype for the RB-49 and designated YRB-49A. During early 1950, the remaining YB-35Bs airframes, which were being converted to YRB-49As, were ordered scrapped. Flight testing of the sole remaining YB-49 prototype ended 14 March 1950. On 15 March 1950, that program was canceled. Coincidentally, the sole remaining YB-49 prototype suffered a high-speed taxiing accident and, as previously noted, was totally destroyed in the ensuing fire. Only two months later, all Flying Wing contracts were canceled abruptly without explanation by order of Stuart Symington, Secretary of the Air Force. Shortly thereafter, also without explanation, Symington turned down a request from the Smithsonian for the Air Force to donate one of these big wings to its collection of pioneering Northrop aircraft. All remaining Flying Wing bomber airframes, except for the sole YRB-49A reconnaissance version, were ordered chopped up by Symington, the materials smelted down using portable smelters brought to Northrop's facility, in plain sight of its employees. Jack Northrop retired from both the company he founded and aviation shortly after he saw his dream of a pure, all-wing aircraft destroyed.Pattillo 2001, p. 186. His son, John Northrop Jr., later recounted during an interview his father's devastation and lifelong suspicion that his Flying Wing project had been sabotaged by political influence and back room wheeling-and-dealing between Convair and the Air Force.Honey, John. \\"The Wing Will Fly.\\" Broadcast on The Discovery Channel: 1991. Northrop YRB-49A with six engines, two of which are mounted externally The sole prototype reconnaissance platform, the YRB-49A, first flew on 4 May 1950. After only 13 flights, testing ended abruptly on 26 April 1951. It was then flown back to Northrop's headquarters from Edwards Air Force Base (formally Muroc) on what would be its last flight. There, this remaining flying wing sat abandoned at the edge of Northrop's Ontario airport for more than two years. It was finally ordered scrapped on 1 December 1953.\\"Fact sheet: Northrop YRB-49A.\\" National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved: 29 October 2010. In a 1979 videotaped news interview, Jack Northrop broke his long silence and said publicly that all Flying Wing contracts had been canceled because Northrop Aircraft Corporation refused to merge with competitor Convair at Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington's strong suggestion, because, according to Jack Northrop, Convair's merger demands were \\"grossly unfair to Northrop.\\"Fitzsimons 1978, p. 2282. Shortly thereafter, Symington became president of Convair upon leaving his post as Secretary of the Air Force.Pattillo 2001, p. 153. Allegations of political influences in the cancellation of the Flying Wing were investigated by the House Armed Services Committee, where Symington publicly denied exerting pressure on Northrop to merge. Northrop's Flying Wing program may have been terminated due to its technical difficulties and the program being behind schedule and over budget. Another possible contributing factor to the cancellation may have been Northrop spreading its small engineering staff too widely in other experimental programs. While the competing propeller-driven Convair B-36 \\"Peacemaker\\" was an obsolete World War II-era design by this time, and had been having just as many or even more development problems, the Air Force seemed to have greater confidence that its more conventional design and \\"teething\\" problems could be overcome, when compared to those of the more radical Flying Wing. While the YB-49 had well-documented performance and design issues, the B-36 program needed more development money.Donald 1997, p. 709. At one time, it appeared the B-36 program might be canceled as well. But the Air Force and the Texas Congressional delegation desired to have a production program for their large Fort Worth aircraft production factory, and Convair had much more effective lobbyists in Washington DC. The Northrop Corporation was always a technological trailblazer, but the independent nature of Jack Northrop often collided with the political wheeling-and-dealing in Washington, which gravitated toward massive military appropriations; consequently, the obsolete Convair B-36 prevailed. When the YB-49 jet bomber was canceled, Northrop was awarded a much smaller, lower profile production contract for its straight-winged F-89 Scorpion fighter as compensation for the canceled Flying Wing.Donald 1997, p. 708.Jones 1975, p. 238. The YB-49 and its modern counterpart, the B-2 Spirit, both built either by Northrop or Northrop Grumman, have the same wingspan: 172.0 ft (52.4 m). Flight test data collected from the original YB-49 test flights were used in the development of the B-2 bomber. Thirty years later, in April 1980, Jack Northrop, then quite elderly and using a wheelchair, was taken back to the company he founded. There, he was ushered into a classified area and shown a scale model of the Air Force's forthcoming, but still highly classified Advanced Technology Bomber, which would eventually become known as the B-2; it was a sleek, all-wing design. Looking over its familiar lines, Northrop, unable to speak due to various illnesses, was reported to have written on a pad: \\"I know why God has kept me alive for the past 25 years.\\" Jack Northrop died ten months later, in February 1981, eight years before the first B-2 entered Air Force service.Withington and Davey 2006, p. 12. Notable appearances in media Paramount Pictures' 1953 film, The War of the Worlds, depicts a YB-49 dropping an atomic bomb on the invading Martians.

In the past it often grew as a weed in cornfields (in the broad sense of \\"corn\\", referring to grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats), hence its name. It is now endangered in its native habitat by agricultural intensification, particularly over-use of herbicides, destroying its habitat. It is also, however, through introduction as an ornamental plant in gardens and a seed contaminant in crop seeds, now naturalised in many other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Australia. Description Cornflower is an annual plant growing to 40‚Äì90 cm tall, with grey-green branched stems. The leaves are lanceolate, 1‚Äì4 cm long. The flowers are most commonly an intense blue colour, produced in flowerheads (capitula) 1.5‚Äì3 cm diameter, with a ring of a few large, spreading ray florets surrounding a central cluster of disc florets. The blue pigment is protocyanin, which in roses is red. It flowers all summer. Distribution A honey bee on a cornflower Centaurea cyanus is native to temperate Europe, but is widely naturalized outside its native range. It has been present in the British Isles as an archaeophyte (ancient introduction) since the Iron Age. In the United Kingdom it has declined from 264 sites to just 3 sites in the last 50 years. In reaction to this, the conservation charity Plantlife named it as one of 101 species it would actively work to bring 'back from the brink'. In Co. Clare (VC H9), Ireland, Centaurea cyanus is recorded in arable fields as very rare and almost extinct, while in the north-east of Ireland it was abundant before the 1930s. Cultivation right Dried cornflower as used in thumb It is grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, where several cultivars have been selected with varying pastel colours, including pink and purple. Cornflower is also grown for the cutflower industry in Canada for use by florists. The most common colour variety for this use is a doubled blue variety such as 'Blue Boy' or 'Blue Diadem'. White, pink, lavender and black (actually a very dark maroon) are also used but less commonly. Cornflowers germinate quickly after planting. Light requirements: full sun. Water requirements: high-average water daily. Soil pH requirements: neutral (6.6-7.5) to mildly alkaline (7.6-7.8). Uses The edible flower of the cornflower can be used for culinary decoration, for example to add colour to salads. Cornflowers have been used historically for their blue pigment. Cornflowers are often used as an ingredient in some tea blends and herbal teas. Cornflower seed is one of the favourite foods of the European goldfinch. Folklore and symbolism Logo of the Conservative People's Party of Estonia right Flowering shoot of cornflower. I. Disk-floret in vertical section In folklore, cornflowers were worn by young men in love; if the flower faded too quickly, it was taken as a sign that the man's love was not returned. The blue cornflower has been the national flower of Estonia since 1918 and symbolizes daily bread to Estonians. It is also the symbol of the Estonian Conservative People's Party, the Finnish National Coalition Party, and the Liberal People's Party of Sweden, where it has since the dawn of the 20th century been a symbol for social liberalism. It is the official flower of the Swedish province of √ñsterg√∂tland and the school flower of Winchester College and also of Dulwich College, where it is said to have been the favourite flower of the founder, Edward Alleyn. The blue cornflower was one of the national symbols of Germany. This is partly due to the story that when Queen Louise of Prussia was fleeing Berlin and pursued by Napoleon's forces, she hid her children in a field of cornflowers and kept them quiet by weaving wreaths for them from the flowers. The flower thus became identified with Prussia, not least because it was the same color as the Prussian military uniform. After the unification of Germany in 1871, it went on to become a symbol of the country as a whole. For this reason, in Austria the blue cornflower is a political symbol for pan-German and rightist ideas. It was worn as a secret symbol identifying members of the then-illegal NSDAP in Austria in the 1930s.New far-right German party adopts former secret Nazi symbol The Guardian, 2019 Members of the Freedom Party wore it at the openings of the Austrian parliament since 2006. After the last general election 2017 they replaced it with the edelweiss. It was also the favourite flower of Louise's son Kaiser Wilhelm I. Because of its ties to royalty, authors such as Theodor Fontane have used it symbolically, often sarcastically, to comment on the social and political climate of the time. The cornflower is also often seen as an inspiration for the German Romantic symbol of the Blue Flower. Due to its traditional association with Germany, the cornflower has been made the official symbol of the annual German-American Steuben Parade. In France the is the symbol of the 11 November 1918 armistice and, as such, a common symbol for veterans (especially the now defunct poilus of World War I), similar to the Remembrance poppies worn in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The cornflower is also the symbol for motor neurone disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cornflowers are sometimes worn by Old Harrovians, former pupils of the British Harrow School. A blue cornflower was used by Corning Glass Works for the initial release of Corning Ware Pyroceram cookware. Its popularity in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia was so high that it became the symbol of Corning Glass Works.

Biography  G√ºnther was born in Arnsdorf, Hirschberg im Riesengebirge, Prussian Silesia (modern day Jelenia G√≥ra, Poland). From 1921 to 1933, G√ºnther studied sinology and philosophy at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, and wrote his doctor's thesis on Hegel in 1933 under the guidance of Eduard Spranger. From 1935 to 1937, he worked at the institute of Arnold Gehlen at the University of Leipzig, publishing Christliche Metaphysik und das Schicksal des modernen Bewusstseins (Christian metaphysics and the fate of modern consciousness, together with Helmut Schelsky in 1937). He was a member of the Leipzig School. In the same year, following his wife, the Jewish psychologist Dr. Marie G√ºnther-Hendel, he emigrated from Germany first to Italy, afterwards to Stellenbosch University in South Africa and, in 1940, to the United States. There he completed his system of place-valued logics and morphogrammatics. His great study Die philosophische Idee einer nicht-Aristotelischen Logik (‚ÄúThe philosophical concept of a non-Aristotelian logic‚Äù) went to print in 1957 (Hamburg, Meiner). As a research professor, he joined the department of electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960, working together with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, Heinz von Foerster, Humberto Maturana and others. In 1962, he published Cybernetic ontology and transjunctional operations. Later he lectured at the University of Hamburg until he died in that city, in 1984 at the age of 84. According to Isaac Asimov, who considered Gunther \\"a good friend,\\" Gunther \\"felt that civilization was a product of the Old World and could not flourish indigenously in the New.\\"In Memory Yet Green. Isaac Asimov. 1979. p. 605. Asimov noted that Gunther thus \\"maintained [that] when Old World civilization was transplanted to the New World, a distortion was introduced and one of the ways in which this distortion was evidenced was by the peculiar American invention of science fiction, which was not to be confused with earlier European ventures in the field (i.e., Jules Vernes).\\" Work and legacy G√ºnther's work was based upon Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Martin Heidegger and Oswald Spengler. He developed a trans-Aristotelian logical approach (omitting the tertium non datur). G√ºnther's transclassical logic was the attempt to combine improved results of modern dialectic with formal logic. His focus on the philosophical problem of the \\"Du\\" (\\"You\\"/\\"Thou\\") was trailblazing. He also contributed to the fields of cybernetics and to both natural and social sciences, especially to sociology. His ≈ìuvre (body of work), in German and English, is quite substantial. An overview can be gathered from his three volumes, helping make dialectics operationable (see below). He was of influence in the areas of philosophy, cybernetics, mathematics, and sociology.

Kanzi has learned hundreds of arbitrary symbols representing words, objects, and familiar people (including the generic \\"Visitor\\"). Sue Savage-Rumbaugh (L), Kanzi (R), and his sister Panbinisha (C) working at the portable \\"keyboard\\" Although Kanzi can sometimes mimic human speech, this shows him during a species-standard vocalization. Kanzi (born October 28, 1980), also known by the lexigram 20px (from the character Â§™), is a male bonobo who has been the subject of several studies on great ape language. According to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, a primatologist who has studied the bonobo throughout her life, Kanzi has exhibited advanced linguistic aptitude.  Biography  Born to Lorel and Bosandjo at Yerkes Field Station at Emory University and moved to the Language Research Center at Georgia State University. Shortly after birth Kanzi was stolen and adopted by a more dominant female, Matata, the chief leader of the group. Kanzi and his sister (Matata's offspring, now deceased) moved to the Ape Cognition and Conservation Initiative (ACCI), formerly the Great Ape Trust, in Des Moines, Iowa, where Kanzi is the highest ranking male of the resident community of bonobos. As an infant, Kanzi accompanied Matata to sessions where Matata was taught language through keyboard lexigrams, but showed little interest in the lessons. It was a great surprise to researchers then when one day, while Matata was away, Kanzi began competently using the lexigrams, becoming not only the first observed ape to have learned aspects of language naturalistically rather than through direct training, but also the first observed bonobo to appear to use some elements of language at all. Within a short time, Kanzi had mastered the ten words that researchers had been struggling to teach his adoptive mother, and he has since learned more than two hundred more. When he hears a spoken word (through headphones, to filter out nonverbal clues), he points to the correct lexigram. According to a Discover article, Kanzi is an accomplished tool user. Kanzi's adoptive mother, Matata, lived to be one of world's oldest captive bonobos until her death in June 2014. In the matriarchal society of bonobos, a male's position is primarily determined by the position of the females he is related to. Matata was the group's chief leader so his status as the highest ranking male was established by being adopted as her \\"son\\". According to the Smithsonian magazine, Kanzi \\"has the mien of an aging patriarch ‚Äì he's balding and paunchy with serious, deep-set eyes.\\"Raffaele, Smithsonian, November 2006. This description is confirmed by a full-page color photograph of Kanzi in the March 2008 National Geographic, and a full-page black-and-white photograph in Time magazine.Time, August 16, 2010.  Examples of behavior and abilities  Kanzi's behavior and abilities have been the topic of research published in scientific journals, as well as reports in popular media. Research programs When he was eight years old, Kanzi was a subject of a research program in which his ability to respond to spoken requests was compared with that of a two-year-old human child called Alia. The study took nine months to complete. Kanzi and Alia were given 660 spoken instructions, asking them to deal with familiar objects in novel ways. Kanzi responded correctly to 74 percent of the instructions, Alia to 65 percent. Another study, designed and carried out by archaeologists Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth, aimed to compare Kanzi's cognitive and mechanical abilities with those of our early human ancestors who made and used Early Stone Age tools (probably Homo habilis), such as Oldowan stone flakes and cores (a core is the rock from which a flake has been removed). In this study, Schick and Toth showed Kanzi how to flake stone, producing a sharp edge that could be used to cut through a rope in order to gain access to a food reward. After modeling the flaking behavior on a variety of occasions, the researchers set up each experiment by placing a food reward inside a box with a transparent lid which was held closed by a length of rope. Kanzi would then be led into an enclosure where the box was located and provided with the stones needed for flaking (known as chert or flint). Over the course of this multi-year study, Kanzi not only learned how to flake, he also developed his own method by throwing the cobbles onto hard surfaces to make a flake, as opposed to the hand-held percussion method that was modeled for him. With the many sharp flakes he produced, Kanzi was able to cut through the rope to gain access to the food reward. However, the flakes he produced and used were more crude than those produced by our Early Stone Age ancestors.Schick, K. D., Toth, N., Garufi, G., Savage-Rumbaugh, E. S., Rumbaugh, D., & Sevcik, R. (1999). Continuing Investigations into the Stone Tool-making and Tool-using Capabilities of a Bonobo (Pan paniscus). Journal of Archaeological Science, 26(7), 821-832. Anecdotes The following are anecdotes, rather than experimental demonstrations. * In an outing in the woods in Georgia, Kanzi touched the symbols for \\"marshmallows\\" and \\"fire\\". Susan Savage-Rumbaugh said in an interview that, \\"Given matches and marshmallows, Kanzi snapped twigs for a fire, lit them with the matches and toasted the marshmallows on a stick.\\" The Telegraph has published photographs of Kanzi putting together a fire for food. * Paul Raffaele, at Savage- Rumbaugh's request, performed a haka for the Bonobos. This MƒÅori war dance includes thigh-slapping, chest-thumping, and shouting. Almost all the bonobos present interpreted this as an aggressive display, and reacted with loud screams, tooth-baring, and pounding the walls and the floor. Kanzi, who remained calm, communicated with Savage-Rumbaugh using bonobo vocalizations; Savage-Rumbaugh interpreted these vocalizations, and said to Raffaele, \\"he'd like you to do it again just for him, in a room out back, so the others won't get upset.\\" Later, a private performance in another room was carried out. * Savage-Rumbaugh has observed Kanzi in communication to his sister. In this experiment, Kanzi was kept in a separate room of the Great Ape Project and shown some yogurt. Kanzi made some vocalizations that his sister could hear; his sister, Panbanisha, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt, suggesting those vocalizations may have meaning. * In one demonstration on the television show Champions of the Wild,Season 4, Episode 3. Screened 10/30/2000 Kanzi was shown playing the arcade game Pac-Man and understanding how to beat it.  Language  Although Kanzi learned to communicate using a keyboard with lexigrams, Kanzi also picked up some American Sign Language from watching videos of Koko the gorilla, who communicated using sign language to her keeper Penny Patterson; Savage- Rumbaugh did not realize Kanzi could sign until he signed, \\"You, Gorilla, Question\\", to anthropologist Dawn Prince-Hughes, who had previously worked closely with gorillas. Based on trials performed at Yerkes Primate Research Center, Kanzi was able to identify symbols correctly 89-95% of the time. Kanzi cannot speak in a manner that is comprehensible to most humans, as bonobos have different vocal tracts than humans, which makes them incapable of reproducing most of the vocal sounds humans can make. Nonetheless, it was noticed that every time Kanzi communicated with humans with specially-designed graphic symbols, he also produced some vocalization. 181x181px Later, it was discovered that Kanzi was producing the articulatory equivalent of the symbols he was indicating, although in a very high pitch and with distortions.Greenspan, S. I., and S. G. Shanjer. 2004. The first idea: How symbols, language and intelligence evolved from our primate ancestors to modern humans. Da Capo Press. According to the research of Dr. Sue Savage- Rumbaugh, Kanzi shows ability in cognitive capabilities. The research demonstrated that ‚ÄúHe can understand individual spoken words and how they are used in novel sentences‚Äù. For example, the researcher asked Kanzi to go get the carrot in the microwave, Kanzi went directly to the microwave and completely ignored the carrot that was closer to him, but not in the microwave.\\"Chimp matches 2-year-old Cognitive capabilities more like humans' than experts believed.\\" Globe & Mail [Toronto, Canada], April 6, 1991, A11.

In another example, a researcher gave the task of ‚Äúfeed your ball some tomato‚Äù.

In addition, he heavily promoted Monterey Park in newspapers of Hong Kong and Taiwan to encourage prospective Chinese emigrants to move to the city. In the early 1970s, he predicted that the then-predominantly Caucasian city of Monterey Park and the San Gabriel Valley would serve as an anchor for new ethnic Chinese immigrants as an alternative to the old Chinatown in Los Angeles, but it was immediately dismissed and brushed off as mere speculation at the time. However, his prophetic words came true as many Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrant elite and poverty-stricken ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam alike began settling in Monterey Park and in nearby Alhambra, Rosemead, and San Gabriel, California. Additionally, many immigrants from Mainland China, who would have settled to traditional immigrant points such as San Francisco or New York City, have also arrived to Monterey Park and other parts of the San Gabriel Valley due to the work of Hsieh. Wealthier immigrants have since moved onto San Marino (an expensive neighborhood) in large numbers during the 1980s and eventually in other communities such as Walnut and Rowland Heights thus giving rise to new suburban Chinatown areas in the Los Angeles. By the 1980s, for the first time in US history, Monterey Park became the first suburban city with an Asian American majority population. Hence, Hsieh is generally credited for leading the way to Chinese immigration in the Greater Los Angeles area. This process initiated a wave of some \\"white flight\\" from then white-bread communities. He owned and operated the prominent Chinese American realty company, Mandarin Realty, which still operates in Monterey Park. As a developer, entrepreneur, he was also a community activist. He left a historic mark on the city of Monterey Park and the entire region. Hsieh died while visiting Las Vegas in 1999.

It was written by John M. Ford and won the H. G. Wells Award for Best Role-Playing Adventure of 1985. Plot summary The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues is a four-part scenario in which the troubleshooters repeatedly try to get hold of a mysterious black box. Their quest pits them against the various secret societies of Alpha Complex (including the Death Leopards and the Sierra Club) and eventually leads them to the Outside and an ancient rock 'n' roll cult. The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues consists of 4 sub-missions that aren't related at all, save for the constant appearance of a mysterious Black Box. Each of the PC Troubleshooters have orders to capture the box for their secret society. Unfortunately, everyone else they meet has the same orders. This leads to a constant, massive brawl for the box, despite no one really knowing what is inside. Legacy Several concepts in this adventure have become Paranoia staples: * Everyone (not just the PCs) vying for a single MacGuffin, often leading to... * Massive firefights with a half-dozen or more groups battling it out (with the PCs caught in the crossfire). * Situations of pure madness in which the PCs can either flail about helplessly or sit back and try to survive. (In this case, the Dance Routine From Hell.) * A series of escalating gags at the briefings. * Seemingly fatal events that the PCs can survive, provided they don't do anything (like try to survive). * Two endings, a semi-serious one and a bring- the-house-down one. (Literally; Alpha Complex doesn't survive the latter.) Publication history The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues was written by John M. Ford, with art by Jim Holloway, and was first published by West End Games in 1985 as a 48-page book with an outer folder. Ford's award-winning adventure The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues was one of a number of early supplements for Paranoia, along with Warren Spector and Allen Varney's Send in the Clones (1985). Reception Marcus L. Rowland reviewed The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues for White Dwarf #77, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that \\"John M Ford, the author of this adventure, should be justifiably proud.

Despite numerous requests from the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, which had been established to produce a practicable motor based on his work, he consistently refused to reveal to them the principles on which his motor operated, and also repeatedly refused demands to produce a marketable product by claiming that he needed to perform more experiments. He secured substantial investments from many people, among whom was John Jacob Astor IV. Biography Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, John Keely was orphaned in early childhood and was raised by his grandparents. Before becoming an inventor, he worked as a member of a theatrical orchestra, a painter, a carpenter, a carnival barker, and as a mechanic. Career In 1872 Keely invited scientists to attend a demonstration at his laboratory at 1422 North Twentieth Street Philadelphia, of a machine which he asserted was motivated by a new and previously unknown force. Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the musical vibrations of tuning forks and that music could resonate with atoms or with the aether. Public interest was aroused and within a few months the Keely Motor Company was formed in New York, with a capital of $5,000,000, equivalent to $95 million in 2013. Keely's theories Keely delivered descriptions of the supposed principles of his process on various occasions. In 1884 following the demonstration of his \\"Vaporic gun\\": Following a demonstration in June 1885: In the 19th century most physicists believed, incorrectly, that all of space was filled with a medium called the \\"Luminiferous aether\\" (or \\"ether\\"), a hypothetical substance which was thought necessary for the transmission of electromagnetic waves and to the propagation of light, which was believed to be impossible in \\"empty\\" space. Etheric generator On November 10, 1874 Keely gave a demonstration of an \\"etheric generator\\" to a small group of people in Philadelphia. Keely blew into a nozzle for half a minute, then poured five gallons of tap water into the same nozzle. After some adjustments a pressure gauge indicated pressures of 10,000 psi which Keely said was evidence that the water had been disintegrated and a mysterious vapor had been liberated in the generator, capable of powering machinery. In subsequent demonstrations he kept changing the terminology he used, to \\"vibratory-generator\\" to a \\"hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacu-engine\\" to \\"quadruple negative harmonics\\". It was later reported that the witnesses of the demonstration were so impressed that they formed a stock company, purchased patent rights for the six New England states, and paid $50,000 in cash for their share in the invention. The New York Times reported in June 1875 that Keely's new motive power was generated from cold water and air and evolved into a vapor \\"more powerful than steam, and considerably more economical\\". It reported that Keely refused to disclose what the vapor was or how it was generated until he had taken out patents in \\"all the countries of the globe which issue patent rights\\" which was estimated would cost around $30,000. Keely said that the discovery of this new energy source was accidental. He said that the apparatus by which it was generated was called a \\"generator\\" or \\"multiplicator\\", from where it was then passed into a \\"receiver\\" and from there to the cylinders of a steam engine. The \\"generator\\" was reported as being about , made of Austrian gunmetal in one piece, and holding about 10 or 12 gallons of water. Its inside was made up of cylindrical chambers connected by pipes and fitted with stopcocks and valves. The \\"receiver\\" or \\"reservoir\\" was about long by in diameter and connected to the \\"generator\\" by a diameter pipe. Keely claimed that his apparatus would generate his \\"vapor\\" from water solely by mechanical means without using any chemicals and claimed to be able to produce 2,000 psi in 5 seconds. Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore In 1881 Keely met Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, the wealthy widow of a Philadelphia industrialist who had the year before established the Bloomfield Moore art collection. Mrs Moore became acquainted with Keely through her interest in scientific subjects, and remained his friend and patron until his death. She invested $100,000 plus a monthly salary of $250 (around $2.2 million and $5400/month in today's values ) so that he could focus completely on the perfection of his motor and widely advocated him and his work, producing many articles and books. Her family did not approve of her assuming obligations which they believed the company should fulfill under its contract with Keely. She made an arrangement with Keely in 1890 to furnish him with an additional $2000 per month for his household and shop expenses and instruments, which was to expire when he had gained sufficient control of his unknown force to enable him to resume his work under the direction of the management of the company upon a provisional engine. This arrived in December 1890, when Mrs Bloomfield Moore handed over to the Directors bills that had been presented since the expiration of Mr. Keely's contract with her. Stockholder suit On December 14, 1881 the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company held a meeting at which a report was read that complained that while they had faith in the merits of Keely's invention, the inventor was unreasonably secretive of the principles and operating methods of his apparatus. He had assured them that the \\"generator\\" had been perfected a year before, and that the \\"multiplicator\\" was also now perfected, and they considered it only fair and reasonable that the secrets of the machinery be revealed to them. They recommended that some intelligent and trustworthy person be taken into Keely's confidence \\"so that in the case of accident they would not be totally without a clue to the invention\\". The report complained at some length about Keely's uncommunicativeness and said that it was the experience of everyone who had come into contact with him over the previous ten years that \\"any attempt at a serious investigation of his operations has been met on his part with deception and misrepresentation\\". Keely was reluctant to reveal his secrets, and filed a demurrer on January 20, 1882 to the bill in equity presented against him by the Keely Motor Company's stockholders. The demurrer was described as entirely technical, and gave a number of reasons why the court should not afford the plaintiffs the relief they sought. Argument was heard on the demurrer in Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas on March 27, when it was argued that the inventor \\"could not be made to expose that which no one knew but himself and which was hidden in his own brain\\". However, Keely was overruled by Judge Pierce on April 1, 1882, who ordered him to \\"make known his process in the way indicated in the bill filed by the Keely Motor Company\\". On May 24 Keely filed his answer to the stockholders' equity suit. He admitted the truth of the complainants' bill regarding the contract, and added that although, due to \\"certain abstruse difficulties by reason of the nature and qualities of the said force\\", he had so far failed to bring his inventions into practical use, he believed he would ultimately succeed. In June 1882 a committee appointed by the Company's board of directors agreed that one William Boekel of Philadelphia was to be \\"instructed by Mr. Keely in the construction and operation of his inventions\\". The annual meeting of the Company's stockholders on December 13, 1882 heard a report from Boekel in which he stated that what Keely claimed to have discovered was \\"the fact that water in its natural state is capable of being, by vibratory motion, disintegrated so that its molecular structure is broken up, and there is evolved therefrom a permanent expansive gas or ether, which result is produced by mechanical action\\". Boekel said that it would be improper to describe the mechanism used, and added that Keely had discovered all that he had claimed. It was later discovered by a Times reporter in August that Boekel had not yet been entrusted with the secrets of the motor as promised by Keely, and that the inventor kept delaying matters by telling Boekel that he could explain it to him in less than two hours after it was completed, and that he had not done so already because the engine had not yet reached that state. On August 28, 1883 at the monthly meeting of the Company's directors, it was announced that Keely's engine would be ready for operation around the first week in September, and that a final inspection of it by the Trustees would be conducted on August 29, at which the stockholders were expected to be present. When the inspection was made the following day, however, Keely said that it would not be ready for another six weeks. On October 29, 1883 it was reported that the Company's stockholders were to bring another suit against the inventor in the name of the company for \\"fulfilment of his many pledges\\". At a meeting of the Board of Directors the following day, Keely made a statement explaining his progress, saying that he was constructing a street chamber to hold his vapor and that when this was complete a demonstration would be given, and his explanation was voted \\"very satisfactory\\" by the directors. At the annual stockholders' meeting on December 12, 1883 a letter from Keely was read out, in which the inventor said that he could not see why he might not fulfil the shareholders' expectations in the next two months and suggested that the stockholders' meeting be postponed to February 1, 1884. This proposal met with some disagreement from some stockholders, and it was decided to give Keely no funds for the next 60 days. When the promised stockholders' meeting was held on February 1, 1884, another postponement was announced at Keely's request. A board meeting which took place on March 25, 1884 reported that the vibratory engine was finished, that \\"the work of adjusting and focalizing is progressing rapidly\\", and that Keely had set the date for the demonstration of the motor to take place on or before April 10. Vaporic gun On September 20, 1884 Keely demonstrated a \\"vaporic gun\\" at Sandy Hook to a party of Government officials. He said that he had brought with him five gallons of \\"vaporic force\\" in a \\"receiver\\" which, if the experiments were successful, would show that no bogus aids had been used. The gun was described as a small gun with a bore, resting on wheels, with an iron \\"receiver\\" long containing Keely's mysterious force connected to it by \\"an iron wire tube\\" 3/16\\" (5 mm) in diameter. Keely rammed a small lead ball about in weight into the gun's muzzle, then tapped the iron \\"receiver\\" with a hammer. He explained that this was to stimulate the \\"vibratory force\\". He then turned a handle and the ball was fired from the gun with a short, sharp report but no smoke and very little recoil. It was reported that the projectile had been fired a distance of . More shots were fired and their velocity measured; one attained , another , and yet another . The gun was also tested by firing against three thick spruce planks and penetrated the first and went halfway through the second. Keely said that he had used a pressure of 7,000 psi and could use 30,000 psi. On the following day, Keely met with a reporter to whom he declared that his experimenting days were over and that complete success was close. He announced that his motor would be completed in less than two months and that he would then make a public exhibition of its powers. The vaporic gun failed to impress Lieutenant E.L. Zalinski, who had witnessed the demonstration. He told the President of the Keely Motor Company, A.R. Edey, that with the same apparatus he could perform the same experiments with compressed air, and go even further than Keely had gone. Edey said he would \\"speak about it to Mr. Keely,\\" but the offer was not accepted. Zalinski said that none of the experiments at Sandy Hook showed that Keely had discovered a new force. Zalinski later attended a demonstration at Keely's workshop in November, in place of Colonel John Hamilton. He later reported that he suggested to Keely that it would be a more complete test of his power if he would discharge a large reservoir which he showed his guests, and then recharge it using his generator. Keely declined to do this, on the grounds that it would take two hours - despite his many statements that he could generate force in a few seconds - and that the reservoir had been \\"carefully negatized\\". Keely also claimed to have achieved pressures of 50,000 psi, and that he had broken all his pressure gauges. When Zalinski produced a pressure gauge he had brought with him - capable of registering 10,000 psi - and offered it to Keely, saying \\"I would like to have you put it on, and break it for me\\", Keely was momentarily lost for words before saying, \\"I do not believe in pressure gauges, anyhow.\\" June 1885 demonstration On June 6, 1885 Keely gave what he called \\"an exhibition\\" of his motor at his workshop at North Twentieth Street, Philadelphia. Around 20 witnesses attended, including newspaper reporters, a mechanical engineer, and officers and stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. A reporter noticed a \\"large iron globular object\\" which he was told was a new engine which Keely was engaged in building. Keely assembled an apparatus on top of which was screwed a globe with several apertures to which tubes were fixed, leading to cylinders. A reporter asked if he could see the globe's contents, but Keely declined, saying that it would take too long, and that he wished to show results rather than the mechanism. Keely then proceeded by taking a violin bow and rubbing it across one of two large tuning forks which formed part of his apparatus. After making a minor adjustment to the device, he opened a stopcock leading into one of the cylinders and the witnesses heard \\"a hiss as of escaping air\\". Keely told them that it was in fact \\"etheric vapor\\", adding \\"It ain't compressed air or any vapor having substance.\\" The force was then used to lift some weights, and Keely claimed that he had about 22,000 psi of pressure at his disposal. A further demonstration was given, of a rotating iron globe suspended on an axle, which was used to saw some wood. The globe was not opened, Keely saying that it was hollow and empty, and his assistants saying that it contained \\"some bits of mechanism\\". A skeptical reporter, who believed that it was in fact operating on compressed air, asked how long the engine could work. Keely replied that he had one run for 40 days, whereupon the reporter suggested he simply run it for half an hour, just making the globe rotate. Keely duly set the globe rotating, and it ran for less than 15 minutes, constantly decreasing in power, before he stopped it. On March 26, 1886 Keely performed a demonstration before a committee of scientists and engineers from New York, where he obtained a pressure of 2,700 psi apparently by using a single pint of water, and then doubled the pressure by adding more water. Keely claimed that the \\"etheric force\\" by which these results were obtained would be utilized as fully as possible in the 25,000 hp engine on which he was then working. The stockholders of the Keely Motor Company met on December 14, 1887, and expressed their confidence in Keely's ultimate success. Keely did not attend the meeting, but supplied a report in which he reviewed his efforts and experiments since 1882 and announced that he had abandoned \\"etheric force\\" in favor of a new force which was unnamed but which he said was based on \\"vibratory sympathy\\". Wilson suit On January 3, 1888 an injunction was granted against Keely on behalf of complainant Bennett C. Wilson, who said that in 1863 he had entered into an agreement with Keely, whom he had originally engaged to varnish furniture. The agreement was that Wilson was to find tools and materials and pay the expenses of inventions made by Keely, Keely agreeing that all inventions so made, and patents obtained, should be equally owned by him and Wilson. On August 14, 1869 Keely assigned a half ownership in what was referred to as the \\"Keely motor\\" to Wilson, who claimed that Keely had then assigned all rights and title to the invention later that same month in return for funds. Wilson alleged that he had only recently become aware that the machine called the \\"Keely motor\\" was the same as the one constructed in 1869 and assigned to him. He asked for an injunction restraining Keely from removing the machine or altering its construction or mode of operation, and requested that an order also be made compelling Keely to exhibit to the complainant all models, machines, and drawings of the invention referred to in the assignments to Wilson, and that an order be made compelling Keely to fully disclose the invention and the mode of constructing and operating it. On April 7, a formal order was made directing Bennett Wilson, his attorney, and four experts, to make a full and detailed inspection of the Keely motor, its mode of construction, and principle of operation within 30 days. The four experts were named as Dr. Charles M. Cresson, Analytical Chemist of City and State Boards of Health; Thomas Shaw, mechanical engineer; William D. Marks, civil engineer and Professor of Dynamical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; and Jacob Naylor, iron founder and President of the Eighth National Bank. The result of the inspection was to make known only whether the present Keely motor was or was not the same apparatus that he was alleged to have assigned to Wilson in 1869. On September 18 it was revealed that Keely had not yet obeyed the court order, despite the time span having been increased to 60 days, and a lawyer representing Bennett Wilson said he believed Keely never would comply with the order and that he had never intended to do so. Finally, on November 17, 1888, Keely was jailed in Moyamensing Prison for contempt of court for refusing the court order to \\"operate and explain the mode of operation\\" of the Keely Motor. However, he was soon released on bail on November 20 by three judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Finally, on January 28, 1889 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania handed down an opinion reversing the order committing Keely to prison for contempt, and ordered his discharge. The opinion declared that the order commanding Keely to \\"exhibit, explain, and operate his motor\\" was premature, and that the court had no right to enforce the order by committing Keely to jail for contempt. On March 28, 1889 Keely's counsel announced that the inventor had the \\"missing link\\" which was needed to make the \\"vibratory resonator and ethereal generative evaporator\\" a success. It was described as a copper tube in the form of a loop, with the ends welded together so that no joint could be seen, and had been made in copper due to that metal's \\"resonant properties\\". A private demonstration of Keely's motor was promised as soon as the tube was \\"adjusted\\", and was stated as likely to occur \\"in a week or two\\". At the Keely Motor Company's stockholders' meeting in December, a report was read from Keely in which he discussed the difficulties he had had with the Board of Directors during 1889 and said that while the work of \\"graduating\\" or adjusting his provisional engine had not progressed as rapidly as he had expected, no serious obstacles had presented themselves, and there were no difficulties affecting the principle or \\"essence\\" of his work. While he could not give a timescale for when the graduation of the engine would be completed, Keely said that it would not be a protracted period, and that when it was finished, one or more engines would at once be ordered. In June 1895 the trade journal Electricity published a challenge to Keely, in which they said that they would undertake to repeat every phenomenon produced by Keely within 60 days. Keely ignored this challenge. After an absence of several years in England, Mrs Moore returned to the US to deal with litigation concerning her late husband's estate. Her advocacy of Keely and his inventions formed part of the case and she decided to strengthen her position by getting eminent physicists to examine his inventions. Among those invited were Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, both of whom declined the opportunity for various reasons. Keely again informed the directors of his company in early November 1895 that \\"before the end of the year\\" he would \\"positively be all through with his work to prove conclusively that\\" he has devised \\"a practical commercial working engine\\" operated by his new force. On November 14, it was reported that another meeting had been arranged between Keely and Mrs Bloomfield Moore and New York capitalists headed by John Jacob Astor IV, who were interested in the Keely Motor Company. It was reported the following week that Astor had purchased a large interest in the motor from \\"a person who for some years past has been an enthusiastic advocate of M. Keely\\". Also in November 1895, Mrs Moore invited Addison B. Burk, president of the Spring Garden Institute to make an inspection. Burk asked if electrical engineer E. Alexander Scott of the Engineers Club could accompany him, and this was agreed to. In the event, Scott took charge of the investigation as he was familiar with Keely and had talked to him in 1874. Scott made several visits to Keely's workshop, beginning on November 9, 1895, and was shown many demonstrations. Among these was a levitation experiment where heavy weights in sealed flasks of water were made to rise and fall in response to differently pitched sounds from a zither, to activate a \\"globe liberator\\" which then transmitted \\"the aetheric force\\" through a wire to the water container. This had been shown to many investors and investigators. Scott was accompanied by Burk on his second and third visits and when the two analysed what they had seen they concluded that compressed air had been used in nearly all the experiments, in some cases alongside another more powerful but hidden force. The demonstration with the rising and falling weights was powered by compressed air via a thin tube which Keely had assured Burk and Scott was a solid wire and which was a common feature in nearly every piece of apparatus in Keely's laboratory.Ord-Hume, p. 144 Burk and Scott reported their findings to Mrs Moore, who was concerned by the negative report, and also by dismissive articles in the press. It was reported on March 22, 1896 that Mrs Bloomfield Moore had arranged with Professor Wentworth Lascelles Scott of London to investigate Keely's claims of etheric force and also to examine his other inventions. It was said that \\"an important series of tests will be made in the presence of the scientist\\". Lascelles Scott was allowed to examine whatever he wanted and had complete instructions on its use from Keely. After spending a month investigating, Lascelles Scott stated to a meeting of the Franklin Institute that \\"Keely has demonstrated to me, in a way which is absolutely unquestionable, the existence of a force hitherto unknown.\\" Since Lascelles Scott and Alexander Scott disagreed, they were brought together to witness more demonstrations by Keely. Mrs Moore suggested that a definitive test would be to cut the wire that Scott alleged was in fact an air pipe, but Keely flatly refused to do so and Mrs Moore, her faith shaken, reduced Keely's monthly salary. On December 24, 1895 Mrs Bloomfield Moore said that due to the position taken by the managers of the old Keely Motor Company at the annual meeting, and the delay on the part of the stockholders in accepting his proposition for a reorganization, Keely had decided not to take out any patents on his inventions, and would instead adopt a royalty system in dealing with his inventions commercially. Mrs Moore said that at least 30 patents would be required, which would take much time and money which would be better used in developing Keely's system. On June 18, 1897 Keely demonstrated his new etheric engine to the General Manager of the Manhattan Elevated Railway, the Chief Engineer of Western Union, and a representative of the Metropolitan Traction Company. All were reported as being surprised at the force produced by Keely's new motor, but declined to express any opinion as to its value. The engine was reported as weighing about and being capable of developing 10 hp. Death Keely died at his home in Philadelphia from pneumonia on November 18, 1898. His will was admitted to probate on December 1, and bequeathed his entire estate of about $10,000 to his widow, Anna M. Keely, who was appointed his executor. The will made no reference to his motor. Keely is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The first meeting of the Keely Motor Company's stockholders following his death was held on December 20, 1898. Charles S. Hill, his widow's attorney, stated that Keely's secret did not exist in manuscript form, but that Keely had suggested before his death that an inventor, Thomas Burton Kinraide of Boston, was the one man who could successfully carry on his work. Hill then announced that he had a secret which he would pass on to only one person. This secret, he said, was \\"of a nature to encourage the stockholders and to induce them to leave everything in Kinraide's hands for one year\\". John J. Smith, one of the Company's Directors, was appointed to confer with Hill, and later reported that the secret told to him by Hill \\"offered great encouragement to the stockholders\\" but did not divulge any further details. In January 1899 Kinraide had 20 large packing cases transported to his laboratory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, said to contain the material part of Keely's motor. Kinraide said that he had often talked with Keely about the principles of his invention and said that he felt he knew more about it than any other person. He was to continue with Keely's experiments at the request of Mr. and Mrs Keely. However, on May 6, 1899 it was reported that Kinraide had abandoned all work on the Keely motor and was to return all the machines and notes to the Keely Company. He stated that he wanted nothing more to do with the motor due to the notoriety caused him by the Philadelphia Press's report and when asked whether he thought the motor was a fraud simply replied that he had not arrived at any such conclusion and had decided to make no further investigations. Philadelphia Press investigation On January 19, 1899, The Philadelphia Press published an illustrated article detailing an investigation made by the newspaper of Keely's workshop, in which the Press contended that the investigation had clearly proven Keely's motor to have been \\"a delusion and deception\\" and that its alleged mysterious forces were the result of trickery. The investigation, which took a week, was assisted by consulting engineer Professor Carl Hering, Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania Professor Arthur W. Goodspeed, Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania Lightner Witmer, and Doctor M. G. Miller, who superintended digging operations. Electrical engineer Clarence B. Moore, the son of Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, was an observer. The scientists involved substantiated the report with signed statements. Sphere under the laboratory The floors of Keely's workshop were taken up and a brick wall was removed. Inside the wall they found mechanical belts linked to a silent water motor two floors below the laboratory. In the basement there was a three-ton sphere of compressed air that ran the machines through hidden high pressure tubes and switches. The walls, ceilings and even solid beams were found to have concealed tubes. Journalists documented everything photographically to leave no room for doubt. Hering and Goodspeed were of the opinion that the tubing and the large steel sphere in the basement indicated the use of normal forces and possible deception, and Hering said in his signed statement that Keely had probably lied and deceived, and was satisfied that he had used highly compressed air to power his demonstrations. At a meeting of the Keely Motor Company's board on January 25, 1899, President B. L. Ackerman issued a statement denying the Philadelphia Press report. The statement claimed that the tubes mentioned in the report had been discarded by Keely years before, and that in all his experiments since 1887 only solid wires had been used. Up to that time, it was stated, Keely had been working on a theory of etheric or vaporic force, and used the tubes to convey this force, but after 1887 he was convinced that he had discovered what he called \\"vibratory sympathy\\". A concealed electric wire discovered in Keely's workshop was described by Ackerman as the remains of the wires of a burglar alarm, and in no way connected with the force used by Keely's motor. The statement denied all assertions that Keely was an imposter, and declared that there was no trickery in any of the results that Keely had claimed to have obtained. Present day A model of Keely's engine was in the collection of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and an \\"Etheric Force Machine\\" of his dating from 1878 is in the American Precision Museum in Windsor, Vermont. In 2005, Jeff and Rita Behary found the original glass plate negatives of the Keely Motor taken by Thomas Burton Kinraide in his Jamaica Plain home Ravenscroft.

By one definition, a coronet differs from a crown in that a coronet never has arches, and from a tiara in that a coronet completely encircles the head, while a tiara does not. By a slightly different definition, a crown is worn by an emperor, empress, king or queen; a coronet by a nobleman or lady. See also diadem. In other languages, this distinction is not made as usually the same word for crown is used irrespective of rank (Krone in German, kroon in Dutch, krona in Swedish, couronne in French, etc.) The main use is now actually not on the head (indeed, many people entitled to a coronet never have one made; the same even applies to some monarchs' crowns, as in Belgium) but as a rank symbol in heraldry, adorning a coat of arms. Etymology The word stems from the Old French coronete, a diminutive of co(u)ronne (\\"crown\\"), itself from the Latin corona (also \\"wreath\\"), from the Ancient Greek Œ∫ŒøœÅœéŒΩŒ∑ (kor≈çnƒì, \\"garland, wreath\\"). Traditionally, such headgear is ‚Äì as indicated by the German equivalent Adelskrone (literally \\"crown of nobility\\") ‚Äì used by nobles and by princes and princesses in their coats of arms, rather than by monarchs, for whom the word crown is customarily reserved in formal English, while many languages have no such terminological distinction. Other than a crown, a coronet shows the rank of the respective noble. Hence, in German and Scandinavian languages there is also the term Rangkrone. For equivalents, both physical and emblematic, in other languages and cultures, see under crown (headgear). Commonwealth usage Depiction of a baron's coronet on a 17th- century funerary monument In the United Kingdom, a peer wears his or her coronet on one occasion only: for a royal coronation, when it is worn along with coronation robes, equally standardised as a luxurious uniform. In the peerages of the United Kingdom, the design of a coronet shows the rank of its owner, as in German, French and various other heraldic traditions. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were engraved while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.Cox, Noel (1999). \\"The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage.\\" The Double Tressure, the Journal of The Heraldry Society of Scotland. No. 22, pp. 8‚Äì13. Retrieved on 2007-10-19. Since a person entitled to wear a coronet customarily displays it in his or her coat of arms above the shield and below the helmet and crest, this can provide a useful clue as to the owner of a given coat of arms. In Canadian heraldry, descendants of the United Empire Loyalists are entitled to use a Loyalist military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others) in their arms. Royal usage British heir apparent Members of the British Royal Family often have coronets on their coats of arms, and may wear actual coronets at coronations (e.g., Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret at the 1937 coronation of their father as George VI). They were made, according to regulations made by King Charles II in 1661, shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; Louis XIV started monumental work at Versailles that year) during the Restoration. They vary depending upon the prince's relationship to the monarch. Occasionally, additional royal warrants vary the designs for individuals. The most recent (and most comprehensive) royal warrant concerning coronets was the 19 November 1917 warrant of George V.1917 royal warrant Rather than a coronet, the heir apparent receives a crown with a single arch. There is evidence to support the wearing of coronets amongst Welsh royalty and nobility, particularly in the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Llywelyn's coronet was for a while kept with the English crown jewels. {class=wikitable style=font-size:95% - style=\\"vertical- align:top; text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:206px;\\"Image !

In particular, title was not a good indication of actual preeminence or precedence: Ancestry, marriages, high office, military rank and the family's historical renown (as documented, e.g., in the Honneurs de la Cour or in P√®re Anselme's histories of the nobility) counted far more than the precise title. Some distinguished families held no higher title than count or even baron, but were proud of their ancient origin. Moreover, most of the nobility was legally untitled, some hereditary titles could be acquired by a nobleman who purchased a \\"titled\\" fief, while titres de courtoisie were freely assumed in the absence of strict regulation by the French crown and became more numerous than titles legally borne. As an example, the title of marquis ranks in principle immediately after duke, but was so ridiculed by the late 18th century (cf. the phrase \\"petit marquis\\" meaning a presumptuous and vain person) that Napoleon omitted it from his own scale of titles. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people assumed and used freely coronets of ranks that they did not have; and, in the 19th and 20th centuries abuse was still made of \\"courtesy titles\\". Titles continued to be granted until the Second Empire fell in 1870, and legally survive among their descendants. The only title that was never usurped under the ancien r√©gime, and rarely without some excuse afterwards, was the title of duc, because it was so often attached to the rank peer of France, which carried specific legal prerogatives such as the right to a seat in the Parliament of Paris. As a result, the title of duc was actually, as well as nominally, at the top of the scale after the royal family and foreign princes, and a cut above all of the other nobility. Prince: this was not a title in Old Regime France, but a rank, hence there was no coronet. *Roi: closed crown of fleurs-de-lis (the crown was open until the early 16th century). *Dauphin (or heir apparent): initially an open crown of fleurs-de-lis; starting with Henri IV's son (1601‚Äì10), the crown is closed with dolphins instead of arches. *Fils de France et Petit-Fils de France (children and grandchildren of a sovereign): open coronet of fleurs-de- lis. *Prince du Sang (Prince of the Blood ‚Äì descended in male line from a sovereign): first a coronet alternating fleurs-de-lis and acanthus leaves (called strawberry leaves in English blazon), e.g., on Fran√ßois de Montpensier's coinage in Dombes, c. 1575. In the 17th and 18th centuries they used a coronet of fleurs-de-lis like the enfants de France. The legitimized princes (descended from legitimized children of sovereigns) ranked immediately after the princes of the blood (from 1694 to 1717 and from 1723 onward), and were given the same coronet. *Pair de France (Peer of the Realm): a coronet of the title (usually duke) with a crimson velvet cap, a mantle armoy√© (reproducing the arms) fringed with gold and lined with ermine. *Duc (duke): a coronet of acanthus leaves. *Marquis: a coronet of alternating acanthus leaves and groups of three pearls in trefoil (or two pearls side by side in some versions). *Comte (count): a coronet of pearls. *Vicomte (viscounts): 4 large pearls (3 visible) alternating with smaller pearls. *Vidame (a peculiar French title, for protectors of the temporal estates of a bishopric): a small coronet with 4 crosses (3 visible). *Baron: a circle of gold wreathed with a string of small pearls. *Chevalier (knight): coronet, but a helm. *Ecuyer (squire): no coronet, but a helm. Helms were reserved for nobles, titled or untitled, by the 16th century regulations that were universally ignored. In principle, a helm without coronet indicated an untitled noble, chevalier or √©cuyer (on this distinction, see a discussion of the French nobility).

Some of the senior comital houses used coronets showing five leaves and four pearls (some mediatized counties and minor principalities had other types of coronets that distinguished them from regular counts). *Freiherrnkrone: the coronet of a Freiherr (baron) shows seven visible tines with pearls. *Adelskrone: the coronet of Adel members (untitled nobility) displays five visible tines with pearls. Sometimes, the central and outer tines are leaves and the other tines are headed by pearls. In the southern states of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg, usually all tines are headed by pearls.

Still, there are often traditions (often connected to the Holy Roman Empire, e.g., those in Sweden, Denmark or Russia) that include the use of crown and coronets. While most languages do not have a specific term for coronets, but simply use the word meaning crown, it is possible to determine which of those crowns are for peerage or lower-level use, and thus can by analogy be called coronets. Precisely because there are many traditions and more variation within some of these, there is a plethora of continental coronet types. Indeed, there are also some coronets for positions that do not exist or entitle one to a coronet in the Commonwealth tradition. Such a case in French (ancien, i.e., royal era) heraldry, where coronets of rank did not come into use before the 16th century, is the vidame, whose coronet (illustrated) is a metal circle mounted with three visible crosses (there is no documentary or archeological evidence that such a coronet was ever made). Often, coronets are substituted by helmets, or only worn on a helmet.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Division of Corinella between 1993 and March 1996, and the Division of Bruce, from March 1996 until May 2016. Background and early career Griffin was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at the Australian National University. He was a public servant, union organiser and electorate secretary before entering politics. Griffin was ministerial adviser to the Victorian Minister for Community Services, Kay Setches, 1990‚Äì91 and to Simon Crean, then a federal minister, 1991‚Äì93. He was also a member of the Springvale City Council, 1991‚Äì93. Political career Griffin was first elected to Parliament at the 1993 federal election, unseating the Liberal incumbent in Corinella, Russell Broadbent. He became a backbench supporter of Prime Minister Paul Keating's government. Corinella was abolished for the 1996 election, and Griffin followed most of his constituents into Bruce. That seat had been in Liberal hands since its creation in 1955. However, it had been significantly altered by the latest redistribution, which gave Labor a slim majority. Griffin defeated Liberal incumbent Julian Beale by only 1195 votes, making him one of the few bright spots in Labor's severe defeat that year. Griffin was elected to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in October 1998. He was Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs and Shadow Minister Assisting the Shadow Minister for Health from 2003 to 2005. In June 2005, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Shadow Special Minister of State. After Labor won government back in the 2007 federal election, new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Griffin Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the ministry. On 1 April 2010, he gained the portfolio of Minister for Defence Personnel. He retained these portfolios in Julia Gillard's first ministry but chose not to continue in the Second Gillard Ministry, which was sworn in on 14 September 2010 following the 2010 election. On 10 February 2015, he announced he would not contest the next election, due in 2016. In March 2015, former City of Port Phillip Mayor Julian Hill was preselected unopposed to contest Bruce for the Labor Party.

Pico de Orizaba is also the highest volcanic summit in North America. It rises above sea level in the eastern end of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The volcano is currently dormant but not extinct, with the last eruption taking place during the 19th century. It is the second most prominent volcanic peak in the world after Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro. Toponymy Pico de Orizaba overlooks the valley and city of Orizaba, from which it gets its Spanish name. During the colonial era, the volcano was also known as Cerro de San Andr√©s due to the nearby settlement of San Andr√©s Chalchicomula at its base. Its N√°huatl name, Citlalt√©petl, comes from citlalli (star) and tepƒìtl (mountain) and thus means \\"Star Mountain\\". This name is thought to be based on the fact that the snow-covered peak can be seen year round for hundreds of kilometers throughout the region. This name is not, however, used by N√°huatl speakers of the Orizaba area, who instead call it Istaktepetl (Iztact√©petl in the traditional orthography for Classical Nahuatl), meaning 'White Mountain'. A third name, Poyauhtecatl, which means \\"the one that colours or illuminates\\", has also been recorded. This name was given by the Tlaxcaltecs in memory of their lost country.Map of Cuauhtinchan 2 Vol 2. Keiko Yoneda. p 239 Topography The peak of Citlalt√©petl rises dramatically to an elevation of above sea level; it has a topographic prominence of . Regionally dominant, Pico de Orizaba is the highest peak in Mexico and the highest volcano in North America; it is also the third highest peak in North America after Denali and Mount Logan. Orizaba is ranked 7th in the world in topographic prominence. It is the second most prominent volcanic peak in the world after Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, and the volcano is also ranked 16th in the world for topographic isolation. About to the west of the port of Veracruz, its peak is visible to ships approaching the port in the Gulf of Mexico, and at dawn rays of sunlight strike the Pico while Veracruz still lies in shadow. The topography of Pico de Orizaba is asymmetrical from the center of the crater; the eastern face is the steepest side of the volcano and the northwestern face the most gradual side. The gradual slopes of the northwestern face of the volcano allows for the presence of large glaciers and is the most traveled route to take for hikers traveling to the summit. Glaciers The main peaks and glaciers of Pico de Orizaba Pico de Orizaba is one of only three volcanoes in M√©xico that continue to support glaciers and is home to the largest glacier in Mexico, Gran Glaciar Norte. Orizaba has nine known glaciers: Gran Glaciar Norte, Lengua del Chichimeco, Jamapa, Toro, Glaciar de la Barba, Noroccidental, Occidental, Suroccidental, and Oriental. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is not known for Orizaba. Snow on the south and southeast sides of the volcano melts quickly because of solar radiation, but lower temperatures on the northwest and north sides allow for glaciers. The insolation angle and wind redeposition on the northwest and north sides allow for constant accumulation of snow providing a source for the outlet glaciers. On the north side of Orizaba, the Gran Glaciar Norte fills the elongated highland basin and is the source for seven outlet glaciers. The main glacier extends north of the crater rim, has a surface area of about descending from to about . It has a slightly irregular and stepped profile that is caused in part by the configuration of the bedrock. Most crevasses show an ice thickness of approximately . Pico de Orizaba looking south from atop Cofre de Perote Below the in elevation on the north side of the volcano, the outlet glaciers Lengua del Chichimeco and Jamapa extend north and northwest another and , respectively. The terminal lobe of Lengua del Chichimeco at , having a gradient of only , is a low, broad ice fan that has a convex-upward profile, a front typical of almost all Mexican glaciers. The most distinct glacier is Glaciar de Jamapa, which leaves Gran Glaciar Norte at about and, after with a gradient of , divides into two small tongues that end at and . Both tongues terminate in broad convex-upward ice fans thinning along their edges. The retreat of these tongues prior to 1994 produced much erosion downstream and buried their edges by ablation rock debris. The west side of Gran Glaciar Norte generates five outlet glaciers. From north to south, the first two, Glaciar del Toro and Glaciar de la Barba, are hanging cliff or icefall glaciers, reaching the tops of giant lava steps at and , respectively. They then descend farther down into the heads of stream valleys as huge ice blocks but are not regenerated there. About , Glaciar Noroccidental, a small outlet glacier long, drains away from the side of Gran Glaciar Norte at about and draws down the ice surface a few tens of meters over a distance of , descending to with a gradient of . Another still farther south, Glaciar Occidental breaks away from Gran Glaciar Norte west of the summit crater at about as a steep, long glacier having a gradient of that ends at . From the southwest corner of the mountain, another outlet glacier, Glaciar Suroccidental, long, flows from Gran Glaciar Norte at with a gradient of , which also ends at in a long smooth surface. East of the summit cone, a separate steep niche glacier, Glaciar Oriental, long and having a gradient of , flows down the mountainside from about ; it contains many crevasses and seracs and is the most difficult glacier to climb. Glacier Oriental had a surface area of about in 1958, which makes the total area of glaciers and firn field on Citlalt√©petl about . No earlier historical record of glacier tongue activity (advance or recession) is known for Citlalt√©petl's glaciers. Although the Gran Glaciar Norte ice cap is covered with snow, it is possible to see the seven outlet glaciers on the irregular west margin of the ice cap, especially Glaciar de Jamapa and Glaciar Occidental. Climate The climate of Pico de Orizaba, like the Sierra Madre Oriental, varies greatly due to the change of elevation and prevailing winds. Due to the latitude and the extreme rugged terrain the volcano experiences many microclimates. Vegetation varies from tropical at the lower elevations on the eastern face to alpine forests in the higher elevations. Large amounts of precipitation fall on the eastern face of the volcano due to adiabatic cooling and condensation from the trade winds that bring moisture off the Gulf of Mexico. The eastern face is frequently covered by fog and low cloud cover. The climate of the eastern face varies from tropical (Af) at the lower elevations to subtropical highland (Cwb) at the higher elevations, with mild variation in temperatures and an average annual rainfall of . Subtropical climates are found between above sea level with a regular rainfall all year long. Autumn and winter come with frequent freezes and light snow, but the snow on the south and southeast sides melt quickly due to solar radiation. The northern face is dominated by subtropical highland (Cwb). The southern face mostly experiences humid subtropical climate Cfa which experiences the highest annual temperatures in the month of April. Due to katabatic winds the western side is dominated by steppe (BSk) creating a rain shadow below above sea level. Although there are some areas on the western side that experience (Cfa) most of the area is semi-dry with temperate to warm temperatures and an annual precipitation average of . Vegetation here is grass and shrubs with few alpine species. Between where temperatures usually are between , continental subarctic climate (Dfc) predominates. Over with an annual average low of , alpine tundra (ET) prevails to the summit; heavy snowfalls and blizzards are common throughout the year. Snow on the south and southeast melts due to solar radiation, but continually remains on the north and northwestern faces. Extreme cold dominates a surface area of approximately . Geology Caldera Pico de Orizaba evolved in three stages, the most recent initiated about 16,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Citlalt√©petl consists of three superimposed stratovolcanoes and dome intrusions which are: Torrecillas (650‚Äì250 ka), Espol√≥n de Oro (210‚Äì 16 ka), and Citlalt√©petl (16 ka to present). The volcano was formed by thick andesitic and dacitic lavas that followed repetitive explosive eruptions and lava effusions which created the iconic cone structure. The volcano is currently dormant but not extinct. The latest eruption of the volcano occurred in 1846 with a magnitude of VEI 2. Previous eruptions occurred in: 1687, 1613, 1589‚Äì1569, 1566, 1555‚Äì1545,1539‚Äì1533, 1351, 1260, 1187, 1175, 1157, 220 AD, 140 AD, 90 AD, 40 AD, ~780 BC, ~1500 BC, ~2110 BC, ~2300 BC, ~2500 BC, ~2780 BC, ~4690 BC, ~6220 BC, ~6710 BC, ~7030 BC, and ~7530 BC. The most violent eruption in the volcano's history is thought to have occurred around 6710 BC reaching a magnitude of VEI 5 characterized by lava dome extrusion and pyroclastic flow. The volcano's crater is elliptical with a transverse diameter measuring and a conjugate diameter measuring . The crater has an estimated with a maximum depth of . Pico de Orizaba is constantly covered by an ice cap consisting of several glaciers. An outlet glacier, known as Jamapa Glacier is located on the north-eastern side of the peak; it has been a powerful force in shaping the volcano. The Jamapa Glacier is responsible for a significant portion of the geomorphologic evolution of the region surrounding the volcano. Geography Pico de Orizaba is located at 19¬∞1‚Ä≤48‚Ä≥N 97¬∞16‚Ä≤12‚Ä≥W, about west of the Gulf of Mexico and east of Mexico City, on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The volcano is approximately south of the Tropic of Cancer. Orizaba anchors the south-eastern end of the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt, a volcanic chain that runs from west to east across Central Mexico. A companion peak lying about six km to the southwest of Pico de Orizaba is the Sierra Negra, at . This subsidiary peak is significantly lower than its massive neighbour, but the road to the observatory on its summit is the highest road in North America. Pico de Orizaba, as part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, forms a barrier between the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Plateau. The volcano blocks the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico from saturating central Mexico and influences the climates of both areas. Both the state of Veracruz and Puebla depend on Pico de Orizaba for supplying fresh water. The largest river originating on the volcano is the Jamapa River. History Pico de Orizaba was important in pre-Hispanic cultures, such as those of the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs and the Totonacs. The volcano is part of many native mythologies. During the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, Hern√°n Cort√©s passed through the foothills of Pico de Orizaba; the volcano and the surrounding mountains made his journey to Tenochtitlan more difficult and delayed him for many days. During the 1600s, the Spanish Crown financed several roads to be built that would circumvent Citlalt√©petl. One of the roads was routed south of the volcano through the cities of Orizaba and Fort√≠n de las Flores, which became the main trade route between Mexico City and Veracruz on the Gulf Coast. A short road was later built by Jesuits to establish settlements at the base of Pico de Orizaba. The Spanish used the volcano as a landmark to guide themselves to the port of Veracruz. Many battles were fought near this volcano throughout Mexico's struggle for independence. In 1839, Henri Galeotti was the first European to explore the volcano, but did not hike to the summit. During the American occupation of Mexico in 1848, two American soldiers, F. Maynard and William F. Raynolds, were the first known hikers to reach the summit of Pico de Orizaba. In 1851, the French explorer Alejandro Doignon also reached the summit and found the flagpole left behind by the Americans in 1848. During the mid-19th century Citlalt√©petl was explored by many scientists, including the German botanist Hugo Fink, who was the first to record the numerous species of flora found on the volcano. In 1873, Martin Tritschler raised the Mexican flag at the summit. On December 16, 1936, President L√°zaro C√°rdenas, in an effort to protect the natural beauty of Pico de Orizaba, created a national park with an area of which included the volcano with the surrounding area and the settlements of Tlachichuca, Ciudad Serd√°n, La Perla, Mariano Escobedo, and Calcahualco. The federal decree became federal law on January 4, 1937. Climbing and recreation View of the standard route from the Stone Hut (Piedra Grande), shown in the bottom left of this photo - November 2007 Traverse of steep slope above Glacier Este during circumnavigation of crater rim. November 2008 Pico de Orizaba attracts a large number of international climbers every year. There are multiple routes for approaching and climbing the volcano, and many people attempt it. Most people climb the mountain during the period from October to March when the weather is favorable; temperatures do not vary much month to month due to being in the tropics and April through September are rainy months in the region. The most frequented route begins from the base camp Piedra Grande Hut (\\"refugio\\") via the Jamapa Glacier, located at an elevation of above sea level. Another option as a starting point is high camp located at the base of the glacier about above sea level. For a more technical challenge for the experienced climber, there is a technical ice climb called the Serpents Head which involves 10 pitches of grade 3 ice. Additionally, the southern side offers another challenging option; although the trail is shorter, it is also steeper and more difficult. No glaciers are found on the southern side. The final ascent to the summit is via a normally straightforward and crevasse-free glacier route. The caldera can be circumnavigated with relative ease, although at one point this requires a short, exposed traverse of steep rock and ice above the Glacier Este.

She is the cousin of Bo and Luke, the main protagonists of the show, and the three live on a farm on the outskirts of Hazzard County with their Uncle Jesse. Although never mentioned in the series itself, some press material for the show suggests that Daisy's parents, along with Bo and Luke's, were killed in a car accident; in the 1997 reunion movie, Daisy says her mother died when she was a baby. The series never explained how they all came to live with Uncle Jesse. Daisy frequently becomes involved in the Dukes' car chases, originally in her Plymouth Road Runner or, from the mid-second season onwards and more famously, in her Jeep. Daisy also works as a waitress at the Boar's Nest, the local tavern owned by Boss Hogg that was the main meeting place in Hazzard. She also aspires to be both a singer-songwriter and a journalist.  Character  Daisy Duke is a well-meaning though sometimes naive, often scantily dressed rogue Southern belle. As with her cousins Bo and Luke Duke, Daisy has a habit of landing herself/her family in trouble, though always believes in doing the right thing, especially when helping others in need. Despite her appearance as being somewhat naive, Daisy is a very outgoing person and can be quite feisty on occasion, who can more than hold her own when the chips are down, and displays on a number of occasions that she can turn her skills to any problem at hand. For instance, during one adventure with a stolen armored personnel carrier (the second season's \\"Follow That Still\\"), Daisy is able to accurately fire its main gun while the vehicle is in motion with barely any instruction from her Vietnam War veteran cousin, and Uncle Jesse cheerfully decorates her as \\"Sharpshooter of the Week\\" for the feat. She also displays horse riding, archery, and numerous other skills in various episodes; the character occasionally drives the General Lee during various adventures, and on some occasions it is suggested that Daisy may even be a better driver than her talented cousins (such as the first-season episode \\"The Big Heist,\\" in which Sheriff Rosco, believing that Bo and Luke are driving the General, comments that they are \\"driving particularly well today\\"). In addition to fending off intoxicated would-be suitors at The Boar's Nest, she frequently finds herself caught up in the ongoing war between Boss Hogg and her family, the Duke clan. Her job at Boss's tavern gives her the opportunity to eavesdrop on private conversations between Boss, Sheriff Rosco and various cohorts, often discovering important information that she can pass on to Uncle Jesse and the Duke boys. Her continued employment at the Boar's Nest in spite of her obvious loyalty to her family is a sign of her status and popularity in Hazzard County, and a corresponding lack of intelligence on Boss Hogg's part. Boss does in fact fire her on a few occasions, but by various story twists, always ends up re-hiring her by the end of the episode. As with her cousins, Daisy never finds a long-lasting beau of her own over the course of the series, though Deputy Enos Strate has a long-running crush on her that spans the life of the series. This crush is largely unrequited, although Daisy is aware of it and often displays genuine care and concern for the likeable Enos. In the penultimate episode of the show's run, \\"Enos and Daisy's Wedding,\\" the pair plan to hastily get married as a way to avoid Daisy having to testify against Enos, though the situation is eventually resolved before the wedding takes place. In his recurring appearances during the show (typically once per season), Boss Hogg's nephew Hughie also displays a romantic interest in Daisy (he actually feels no genuine respect or affection for her, however; he merely harbors a selfish lust for her beauty), although Daisy loathes the idea, and there is occasionally a vague hint of a possible previous romantic falling-out between the pair. The fourth season opening episode, \\"Mrs. Daisy Hogg,\\" sees Daisy falling in love and planning to marry another one of Boss's nephews, Jaimie Lee Hogg (the character's only appearance in the series), although before the wedding she realises he is a villain and the marriage is called off. Similarly, in the second-season episode \\"Duke of Duke,\\" Daisy becomes attracted to a visiting English Duke claiming to be a distant relation of the Duke clan; she eventually finds out he is a con man and again the romance is over. In the 1997 reunion movie, she is said to have left Hazzard to get married at some point after the original series, but is subsequently divorced. After her marriage ended, she was pursuing a graduate degree at Duke University, and upon her return to Hazzard agrees to marry Enos Strate, who reveals he had been writing weekly love letters to Daisy for many years (tying into Enos's own spin-off series), but backs out at the last minute due to both the sudden reappearance of her ex-husband, and for fear of another debacle like her first marriage.  Vehicles  Daisy's first car in the series is a yellow 1974 Plymouth Road Runner with a black stripe along the sides and over the roof. Although the car was intended to be a Plymouth Road Runner, later appearances in the second season used a 1971 Plymouth Satellite with a matching \\"Road Runner\\" stripe running along the sides and over the roof. The car meets its demise when the accelerator sticks while Bo and Luke are driving it during a chase in the second-season episode \\"The Runaway,\\" sending it over a cliff. Because the episodes were broadcast in a different order to that in which they were filmed, the Plymouth makes several reappearances after its supposed destruction (additionally, after the Plymouth has been destroyed on- screen, several models of the car appear in various episodes with different paint jobs, serving as other vehicles within the context of the stories). After losing that car, at the end of \\"The Runaway\\" she receives her trademark white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 \\"Golden Eagle,\\" named Dixie. The initial version of the Jeep seen at the end of this episode is noticeably different from what soon becomes the standard version, with a slightly different paint job, doors with \\"Dixie\\" painted on, and \\"Golden Eagle\\" printed on the hood on either side of an eagle emblem. After this and its second appearance, in the episode \\"Arrest Jesse Duke\\" (produced after \\"The Runaway\\" but actually broadcast before, creating a continuity error), bar a couple of stock footage shots of the Jeep parked outside of the Duke farm where the initial design can be seen, the design changes to a lighter paint job, no doors, and \\"Dixie\\" painted alongside the emblem on the hood. However, as with other vehicles in the show, there are different versions of the Jeep used for filming of various episodes. Sometimes the Jeep has a slightly different paint scheme, and alternates between automatic and manual transmissions. The design of the roll-bars also varies slightly across the seasons. On a number of occasions Daisy also drives Uncle Jesse's pickup truck, and certain storylines occasionally call for her to drive the General Lee.  Appearance  Daisy Duke is both the main female protagonist and the sex symbol on Dukes of Hazzard. In two episodes Daisy wears a red bikini to distract Cletus and a truck driver. She appears numerous times wearing short, tight denim shorts, which later became colloquially known as \\"Daisy Dukes\\". The network censors believed that Daisy's famous denim cut- off shorts alone would be too revealing. The shorts were so short that the only way the producers could get them on air was for Catherine Bach to wear flesh-colored pantyhose with them to ensure that the shorts revealed no more of her than intended. Bach herself had concerns about the shorts, saying she could not wear them in a restaurant scene in the show. The producers suggested that Bach go and see what the girls were wearing in the restaurant across the street; she found the waitresses there were wearing \\"little miniskirts that matched the tablecloths!\\". Bach made many of Daisy's costumes herself, especially the early ones, including the red bikini in the first episode, which is seen during the show's opening credits. At the suggestion of the show's producers, Bach posed as Daisy Duke for a poster, which sold 5 million copies. The poster created unexpected admiration from Nancy Reagan and other staff after Bach visited, then sent a copy to one of her former schoolteachers employed in the White House.  In film   2005 version  In the 2005 feature film The Dukes of Hazzard, Daisy Duke is portrayed by Jessica Simpson. Film critics commended Simpson on her performance, but claimed that her portrayal had little in common with the character Catherine Bach created, and that she was merely cast because of her celebrity status. Daisy's costume was slightly modified for the film to make her more overtly sexual: her Daisy Dukes were shorter than they had been on the series, and her shirts showed much more cleavage than Bach's ever had. She also did not wear pantyhose under her shorts, going bare-legged in the film. Another difference in her appearance was that Simpson's hair remained blonde, whereas Bach's was brunette. Simpson did, however, wear a brunette wig as a disguise during the film, and her hair was a darker blonde in the music video for \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\".  2007 film  In the 2007 film The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning, Daisy starts out as an innocent Bible school girl and does not dress particularly attractively. She wears large flannel shirts, jeans, big glasses, and her hair in a bun. To get a job as a waitress at the Boar's Nest and to attract Hughie Hogg (Boss's nephew), she decides to change her look. She goes through several outfits before finally settling on her signature look. She is also a brunette in this movie. Daisy is played by April Scott.

It is remembered not for its minor damage, but for its haunting pictures which became the subject of worldwide press attention. The tornado formed around 2:00 PM, initially touching down in the Silver Bluff Estates area. It then swept through Downtown Miami, bypassing the city's skyscrapers. It crossed the MacArthur Causeway and the Venetian Causeway towards Miami Beach, sideswiping the cruise ship MS Sovereign of the Seas. The tornado lifted from the water halfway through Biscayne Bay and touched down briefly again in Miami Beach, flipping over a car and then dissipating. The Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma had noted the possibility for tornadoes in the area and warned that there might be more to come. While hurricanes are often seen as the biggest weather threat to Miami, tornadoes are relatively common in South Florida, although the vast majority of the ones that strike Miami-Dade County are small, relatively weak F0 or F1 tornadoes. Most of these tornadoes form as either waterspouts off Biscayne Bay, as part of the frequent afternoon thunderstorms, or spawned from a tropical storm or hurricane. Tornadoes can and have occurred in every month of the year in Miami-Dade County.

She became the first woman to compete at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1902 by entering what was previously an all-male event and won the silver medal, which prompted the International Skating Union (ISU) to create a separate ladies' championship. Syers was the winner of the first two ladies' events in 1906 and 1907, and went on to become the Olympic champion at the 1908 Olympics, the first Olympic Games to include figure skating. She also competed as a pairs skater with her husband Edgar Syers, winning the bronze medal at the 1908 Olympics. Personal life Florence Madeline Cave was born on 16 September 1881 in Kensington, London, one of 15 children of Edward Jarvis Cave, a builder, and his wife Elizabeth Ann. She was a proficient figure skater, as well as a gifted swimmer and equestrienne. Madge became a regular at the Prince's Skating Club in Knightsbridge, which had been formed in 1896 and was popular with aristocratic society in London. In 1899 Madge met her future husband Edgar Syers, a figure skater and coach who was 18 years her senior. Edgar was an exponent of the international skating style, which was freer and less rigid than the traditional English style, and encouraged Madge to adopt this style. Madge and Edgar completed together in pairs skating events, and in 1900 finished second in one of the first international pairs events, staged in Berlin. They married in June of that year. The Syers co-authored The Book of Winter Sports in 1908. Career 1902 World championships The World Figure Skating Championships, first contested in 1896, was regarded as an all-male event since competitive skating was generally viewed as a male activity, but there was no regulation barring women, enabling Syers to enter and compete at the 1902 Championships in London. She won the silver medal behind Ulrich Salchow, who was reputedly so impressed with her challenge that he offered her his gold medal. T. D. Richardson later wrote: \\"Rumour, nay more than rumour ‚Äì a good deal of expert opinion ‚Äì thought she should have won.\\" Syers' entry into the World Championships prompted the ISU to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903. The concerns raised were that \\"(1) the dress prevents the judges from seeing the feet; (2) a judge might judge a girl to whom he was attached; and (3) it is difficult to compare women with men.\\" The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships. 1903‚Äì1907 Syers continued to compete elsewhere, and in 1903 won the inaugural British Figure Skating Championships, which began as a mixed competition. She won again the following year, beating her husband, who won the silver medal. She also entered the 1904 European Championships but withdrew due to injury after the first stage of the competition, the compulsory figures. The 1905 ISU Congress established a separate ladies' event, which was supported by strong lobbying from the National Ice Skating Association. The event was known at the time as the Ladies' Championship of the ISU rather than a World Championship, and was staged at a different date and location from the men's event. Syers won the inaugural event held in Davos, Switzerland in 1906, finishing first in a field of five competitors. She won her second title in Vienna at the 1907 Championships. 1908 Olympics The 1908 Summer Olympics in London were the first Games to include figure skating events in the programme, which were staged in October at the Prince's Club. Syers entered both the ladies' event and the pairs with Edgar. In the ladies' event, Syers comfortably won the compulsory figures section, with all five judges placing her first. The official report of the Games described her as \\"in a class by herself\\" and stated that \\"the wonderful accuracy of her figures, combined with perfect carriage and movement, was the chief feature of the morning's skating.\\" In the free skating, the report described her as having \\"excelled in rhythm and time-keeping, and her dance steps, pirouettes, &c.;, were skated without a fault.\\" She was again placed first by all five judges and won the title. In the pairs event Syers and Edgar finished third (of three couples) and won the bronze medal. Later life Syers retired from competitive skating after the Olympics due to fading health. She and Edgar co-authored a second book together, The Art of Skating (International Style), published in 1913. She died of heart failure caused by acute endocarditis on 9 September 1917 at her home in Weybridge, Surrey, seven days shy of her 36th birthday. Syers was elected to the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1981.

Cole was criticised for 'selling out' when he acted as a defence witness for his club teammate John Terry, who was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, Rio's brother, as Cole and the Ferdinand brothers are of Caribbean descent.Rio Ferdinand claims 'choc ice' term is common slang, not racist, The Guardian, 15 July 2012  References  Category:Ice cream cs:Nanuk sk:Nanuk ","title":"Choc ice"},{"id":"566115","text":"The tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava) is a small passerine bird belonging to the genus Prinia in the family Cisticolidae, a family of Old World warblers. It is widespread and common in most parts of Africa south of the Sahara. The plain prinia (P. inornata) of southern Asia was formerly included in this species but is now usually considered to be a separate species. Description It is 10-13 centimetres in length with a long, narrow, graduated tail and a fairly long, slender bill. The tail is often held erect or waved from side to side. The upperparts are grey-brown with rufous-brown edges to the flight feathers and a rufous tinge to the rump. The throat and breast are whitish while the flanks and vent are warm buff. There is a whitish stripe over the eye and the lores are dark. The tail feathers have a white tip and a dark subterminal band. The sexes are similar in appearance. Non-breeding birds have a longer tail than breeding birds. Juveniles have pale yellow underparts and a yellowish bill. There are many recognised subspecies. The call is short, wheezy and rapidly repeated. The song is a monotonous series of shrill notes. The male often sings from an exposed perch. The pale prinia (P. somalica) of North-east Africa is similar but paler and greyer with whitish flanks. It inhabits drier, more open habitats than the tawny-flanked prinia. The river prinia (P. fluviatilis) of West Africa is also paler and greyer and has a longer tail. It is restricted to waterside vegetation.

It is absent from much of the Congo Basin, southern Namibia, south-west Botswana and the western half of South Africa. It is found amongst shrubs and grass in a variety of habitats including woodland, savanna and cultivated areas. It adapts well to man-made habitats and is not considered to be threatened. Behaviour Collecting nest material in Kruger National Park It feeds on insects and other invertebrates. It forages in small flocks which move through shrubs and undergrowth. The nest is purse-shaped and made of strips of grass woven together. It is built one to two metres above the ground. Two to four eggs are laid; they are variable in ground colour and usually have brown or purple spots or blotches.

Beaven moved to British Columbia from Toronto, where he had been educated at Upper Canada College, because of the gold rush. He entered business in Victoria, which was then the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island. After the colony's union with British Columbia, Beaven became involved with politics as secretary of Amor De Cosmos' Confederation League which advocated that the colony enter Canadian confederation. Beaven was elected to the provincial legislature in 1871, the year of union with Canada and served in the cabinets of De Cosmos and his successor George Anthony Walkem as chief commissioner of land and works. He was accused by the opposition of corruption and was criticised for not opening up land for settlement quickly enough as well as running up the deficit. Beaven was in opposition during the government of Andrew Charles Elliott but rejoined the government when Walkem became premier for a second time in 1878 and became minister of finance and agriculture. Due to a shortage of revenues he instituted a poll tax in 1881. In 1882 Beaven became premier of the province but many of his supporters were defeated in the subsequent July election and Beaven ruled with a minority. As Premier he hosted the three- month visit to British Columbia of the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lorne, and his wife Princess Louise, offering to make the princess Queen of Vancouver Island. She declined. In January 1883 Beaven attempted to introduce a legislative program but his government was brought down by a Motion of No Confidence and he resigned on January 29, 1883. Beaven remained an MLA and leader of the opposition until 1894 when he lost his seat in an election after having served in the legislature for twenty-three years. He also served three terms as mayor of Victoria, British Columbia in the 1890s. Following the 1898 election, no party had a majority and the lieutenant- governor Thomas Robert McInnes passed over the former premier John Herbert Turner and asked Beaven to form a government despite the fact that he had been out of the legislature for four years. Leading members of the legislature refused to support Beaven and he was unable to form a cabinet. Robert Beaven died in 1920 and was interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria.

It calls itself \\"Seattle's Only Newspaper,\\" an expression of its disdain for Seattle's two dailies (the Seattle Times and the now-defunct print edition of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer) and The Strangers main rival, the Seattle Weekly. The paper regularly covers Seattle City Council politics. In its early days, The Stranger had a print run of 20,000, and was focused in Seattle's University District. The paper was a single sheet wrapped around a wad of coupons for local businesses. On April 16, 2012, The Stranger won its first Pulitzer Prize. Eli Sanders won in the Feature Writing category for \\"The Bravest Woman In Seattle,\\" which the citation describes as \\"a haunting story of a woman who survived a brutal attack that took the life of her partner, using the woman‚Äôs brave courtroom testimony and the details of the crime to construct a moving narrative.\\" The feature appeared in the June 15, 2011 edition.Pulitzer Prizes awarded to Seattle Times, The Stranger .

Savage, an associate editor since the paper's founding, made his name writing the paper's sarcastic and sometimes inflammatory sex advice column, titled \\"Savage Love\\", which has since appeared in every issue of The Stranger. In September 2007, Savage became the paper's editorial director and was replaced as editor-in-chief by then-27-year-old Christopher Frizzelle, formerly the Books Editor (in 2003) and Arts Editor (from 2004 to 2007). In July 2016, Frizzelle was replaced by Tricia Romano, a former staff reporter at the Seattle Times and eight-year-long columnist at The Village Voice in New York. Romano left the paper in June 2017. The paper does not currently have an editor-in-chief, as Frizzelle now acts as the print editor. Chase Burns is the digital editor. The newspaper's current managing editor is Leilani Polk, who replaced Kathleen Richards. The previous managing editor was Bethany Jean Clement, who was formerly the managing editor of Seattle Weekly. Clement's essays in the restaurant section of the newspaper have been anthologized in Best Food Writing 2008 and 2009. The Stranger's \\"Police Beat\\", a weekly column authored by Associate Editor Charles Mudede, has been adapted to an indie film of the same title. Mudede also co-wrote the controversial documentary film, Zoo (2007), about the life and death of Kenneth Pinyan who died in a bestiality incident in Enumclaw, Washington in July 2005. The Arts and Music editor is the lead singer of Seattle band Harvey Danger, Sean Nelson‚Äîformerly a staff writer and The Stranger's Film Editor‚Äîwho has profiled the Portland, Oregon band the Decemberists and the pre-teen Seattle band Smoosh when they landed a record deal. The paper does not currently have a news editor. Previously, the position was held by Steven Hsieh, Eli Sanders, and Dominic Holden. Prior to the latter was Erica C. Barnett, who, in 2007, was named reporter of the year by Seattle's venerable Municipal League. Barnett left the paper in 2009 to work for news website Publicola.net, founded by former Stranger news editor Josh Feit. Writers As of 2020, staff writers include Lester Black, Nathalie Graham, Katie Herzog, Jasmyne Kiemig, and Dave Segal. Previous staffers have included: * actor/monologist David Schmader, who wrote a \\"news of the week\\" column called \\"Last Days\\"; * Emily White, former editor-in-chief, who has authored such books as Fast Girls: Teenage Tribes and the Myth of the Slut, (2002), and You Will Make Money in Your Sleep: The Story of Dana Giacchetto, Financial Adviser to the Stars (2007); * Eric Fredericksen, who went on to run the art space Western Bridge; * novelist Matthew Stadler; * Traci Vogel; * art critic Emily Hall; * S.

Writers closely associated with the newspaper include Sherman Alexie, Charles D'Ambrosio, Sarah Vowell, Dave Eggers, Jonathan Raban, Heather McHugh, Rebecca Brown, Edmund White, Gary Shteyngart, Miranda July, Tao Lin, Travis Jeppesen, Andrew Sullivan, Stacey Levine, and JT LeRoy. Writers for the paper in the early 1990s include Inga Muscio, Catholic Activist Thomas E. Byers and Clark Humphrey. The Stranger won its first ever journalism award in 1995 when contributing writer Lewis Kamb, under News Editor George Howland Jr., exposed the financial shenanigans of Seattle‚Äôs chapter of Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA). New York Times Best Seller and 2012 National Book Award Finalist Domingo Martinez, author of The Boy Kings of Texas, worked on staff in the production department from 1993 through 1996 as a production designer, but never wrote for the publication. Ombudsman The Stranger ombudsman, A. Birch Steen, wrote acerbic criticism of the paper within every issue, usually assailing the contents for their extreme liberal bias. He was billed as a former member of the OSHA Board of Governors, but was likely a fictional character. The name is an anagram of Steinbacher, after Bradley Steinbacher, the paper's Managing Editor from 2003 until 2008. Steen's harsh critiques originally appeared on the inside of the back page, and later above the table of contents (\\"The Stranger: A Critical Overview\\"). He would also be the apparent author of the paper's Twitter feed. Steen died on Monday, April 16, 2012, after suffering a stroke. Cartoonists The Stranger has published original comics, illustrations, and graphic art by such notable cartoonists as Tony Millionaire, Peter Bagge, Ellen Forney, Megan Kelso, Al Columbia, Chris Ware, R.

Winners of the award include the filmmaker James Longley, the filmmaker Lynn Shelton, the writer Sherman Alexie, the poet Heather McHugh, the actress Sarah Rudinoff, the experimental-theater collective Implied Violence, Strawberry Theatre Workshop, the artist Jeffry Mitchell, and the artist Wynne Greenwood. A party and rock show for the winners is held every fall; past Stranger Genius Award parties have been held at the downtown public library, Seattle Art Museum, and the Moore Theater. Controversies On the Halloween prior to the 2008 elections the Stranger published a parody in its Topography of Terror series, which included the addresses of homes displaying Republican yard signs. The controversy was then mentioned in a Saturday Night Live sketch about internet conspiracy theories about Democratic intimidation of elderly Republican voters. The Stranger later blacked out the addresses on the online version of its story, after charges of voter intimidation.

German pilots report Soviet aircraft refusing combat over the front during the offensive ‚Äì which lasts from 19 August to 10 October ‚Äì thanks to the one-sided results, prompting Josef Stalin to threaten to court-martial any Soviet pilot who refuses to engage German aircraft. The only test flight of the Soviet Antonov A-40 winged tank is partially successful. Although A-40s aerodynamic drag forces the Tupolev TB-3 towing it to detach it early to avoid crashing, the A-40 glides to a successful landing and drives back to base as a conventional T-60 tank. The A-40 project nonetheless is abandoned due to the lack of aircraft powerful enough to tow it. * September 4‚Äì5 (overnight) - 251 British bombers attack Bremen, Germany.

Genders runs out of fuel and is forced to ditch his Spitfire off the Egyptian coast and make a 21-hour swim to shore, but not before he damages the Ju 86P enough to force it to descend to a lower altitude, where another Spitfire damages it further and forces it to crash-land behind German lines in the North African desert. After two inconclusive encounters at altitude between Ju 86Ps and Spitfires over Egypt in October, the Luftwaffe will withdraw the Ju 86P from high-altitude flights over defended targets. * September 6 - The U.S. Navy's Naval Air Transport Service makes its first flight to Naval Station Argentia in the Dominion of Newfoundland, the beginning of an expansion of its service along the United States East Coast and in the Atlantic which by the end of September will reach the Panama Canal Zone and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and briefly will include Iceland. * September 7 - The Naval Air Transport Service establishes a detachment at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which begins survey flights as a first step in establishing routes between San Francisco, California, and Brisbane, Australia. * September 9 An Imperial Japanese Navy Yokosuka E14Y floatplane (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") launched by the submarine I-25 makes two attacks against the coast of Oregon in the United States, dropping four 76-kg (167.5-lb) phosphorus bombs in an attempt to start forest fires. They become known as the Lookout Air Raids.

During a 45-minute dogfight, Galatzine makes four firing passes at the Ju 86R, reaching an altitude of 44,000 feet (13,411 meters) before the Ju 86R escapes over the English Channel. It is the highest combat engagement of World War II. Learning that even the twin-Jumo 207 diesel-powered Ju 86R has become susceptible to interception, the Luftwaffe never flies one over the United Kingdom again.Lehmann, Pete, \\"The Luftwaffe‚Ä≤s High-Flying Diesel,\\" Aviation History, January 2017, pp. 33-34.

The college offered bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration, computer science, digital arts, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, mechanical engineering technology, and professional management. It was named after temperance movement crusader Henry D. Cogswell. Historically, the college had an enrollment of 300 students that relied mainly on Boeing-related tuition. History Henry Cogswell College was founded in 1979 in Kirkland, Washington as Cogswell College North (at the time, an affiliate of Cogswell College in Sunnyvale, California), largely to provide engineering education to local Boeing employees. The college also operated night and summer classes at Shoreline Community College before permanently moving to south Kirkland. The college moved to Everett, located near Boeing's largest assembly plant, in 1996, leasing space in a former Bon March√© department store. In 2000, the college moved into the historic Federal Building in downtown Everett, spending $2 million to renovate the 1917-built office building. Off-campus classes were also held at a Boeing facility in the south Puget Sound (about 30 miles from Everett) to accommodate students living in that area. Limited classes continued to be offered at the Boeing facility even after the main campus moved to Everett.

He was a minister in the Howard Government from 2001 to 2007, and later served as Administrator of Norfolk Island from 2014 to 2017. Early life Hardgrave was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was educated at Griffith University, Queensland. In the 1970s he began his career as a radio broadcaster, and a TV reporter firstly with the award-winning Australian children's television show Wombat between 1979 and 1982. Between 1982 and 1986 he reported for award-winning Queensland TV programme State Affair, in 1987 for ABC TV's The 7.30 Report before returning to BTQ 7 in 1988 as a senior reporter for Carroll at Seven. In 1989 he was the founding news director for SEA-FM Gold Coast and later worked as a media adviser to Liberal politicians, before entering politics. Politics Hardgrave initially ran for election to the Queensland state seat of Sunnybank in the 1992 election, but lost. He contested the Division of Moreton successfully at the 1996 federal election against Labor incumbent Garrie Gibson, going on to retain the seat in 1998, 2001 and 2004. Hardgrave served as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs from 2001 to 2004, Minister for Vocational and Technical Education between October 2004 to early 2007 and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister from 7 October 2003 to 30 January 2007. On 23 January 2007, Hardgrave was axed from the ministry and returned to the backbench. He lost his seat to Graham Perrett in the 2007 election. Later activities In March 2008, Hardgrave returned to media and corporate activities. From January 2011 he hosted talk- back in Brisbane. From 2011 he made regular contributions to Sky News Agenda and Paul Murray Live programmes as well as regular appearances on the Nine Network Today show and A Current Affair. Since leaving Parliament, Hardgrave graduated from the Australian Institute of Company Directors' course and served on a variety of company and community boards including Brisbane Airport Corporation and TAFE Queensland. In January 2014, he left full-time radio but commenced a weekly column in the Queensland Sunday Mail newspaper before resigning media and corporate activities in June 2014. On the advice of the Abbott Government, Australian Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove appointed Hardgrave as the 37th Administrator of the Australian External Territory of Norfolk Island. His term commenced on 1 July 2014, and he was Administrator when Norfolk Island lost its self-governing status.

It breeds in semi-desert along the southern edge of the Sahara, Africa. The white-throated bee-eater is migratory, wintering in a completely different habitat in the equatorial rain forests of Africa from southern Senegal to Uganda. Description Male in flight This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green, but its face and throat are white with a black crown, eye stripe, and neckband. The underparts are pale green shading to blue on the breast. The eye is red and the beak is black. The white-throated bee-eater can reach a length of 19‚Äì21 cm, excluding the two very elongated central tail feathers, which can exceed an additional length of 12 cm. They weigh between 20 and 28 grams. Sexes are alike, except that the male has longer tail feathers. The call is similar to European bee-eater. Habits White-throated bee-eaters also feed and roost communally. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes mainly flying ants and beetles. Nesting The white-throated bee-eater is a bird which breeds in dry sandy open country, such thorn scrub and near-desert. These abundant bee-eaters are gregarious, nesting colonially in sandy banks or open flat areas. They make a relatively long 1‚Äì2 m tunnel in which the 6 to 7 spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs, but up to five helpers also assist with caring for the young. Status Widespread and common throughout its large range, the white- throated bee-eater is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

The species is native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, by being sold as a pet lizard, and is now found in Florida and as far north in the United States as southern Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii, and Southern California. It has also been introduced to other Caribbean islands and Taiwan in Asia. This species is highly invasive. In its introduced range, it reaches exceptionally high population densities, is capable of expanding its range very quickly, and both outcompetes and consumes many species of native lizards.Campbell, T.S. (2000). Analysis of the effects of an exotic lizard (Anolis sagrei) on a native lizard (Anolis carolinensis) in Florida, using islands as experimental units. PhD Thesis, Univ. of Tennessee. The brown anole's introduction into the United States in the early 1970s has altered the behavior and negatively affected populations of the native Carolina anole (Anolis carolinensis, also known as the green anole), which have since generally been relegated to the treetops. Etymology The specific name, sagrei, is in honor of Spanish botanist Ram√≥n de la Sagra.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Anolis sagrei, p. 231; \\"De la Sagra\\", pp. 68-69). Description The brown anole is normally a light brown color with darker brown to black markings on its back, and several tan to light color lines on its sides. Like other anoles, it can change color, in this case a darker brown to black. Its dewlap ranges from yellow to orange-red. The males can grow as large as their male Carolina anole counterparts, around long, with some individuals topping . The females are also around the size of female Carolina anoles: . The male brown anole's head is smaller than that of the male Carolina anole. Also, the brown anole's tail has a ridge that travels all the way up to behind the head, a feature that the Carolina anole lacks. Female brown anoles can be distinguished by a light brown stripe that runs over their back, a feature that males lack.

They reach sexual maturity one year after hatching, and typically breed in the summer months (depending on the climate) from March-April to August-September. After breeding, the female will lay 1‚Äì2 eggs every 7‚Äì14 days, burying and then abandoning them. If viable, the eggs will hatch about seven weeks later, and the hatchlings that survive do so entirely on instinct. Shedding Brown anoles molt in small pieces, unlike some other reptiles, which molt in one large piece. Anoles may consume the molted skin to replenish supplies of calcium. In captivity, the molted skin may stick to the anole if humidity is too low. The unshed layer of skin can build up around the eyes, preventing the lizard from feeding and may lead to starvation. This can be prevented by maintaining high humidity. Diet Brown anoles feed on small arthropods such as crickets, moths, ants, grasshoppers, cockroaches, mealworms, spiders, and waxworms. They may also eat other lizards, such as skinks and the Carolina anole, lizard eggs, and their own molted skin and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small fish ‚Äì nearly anything that will fit in their mouths. Rockport, Texas Predation As a defense mechanism, the brown anole can detach most of its tail when pursued or captured (autotomic). The piece that breaks off will continue to move, possibly distracting the predator and allowing the anole to escape. The lost tail will partially regrow.Casanova, L. (2004). Norops sagrei (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 31, 2008 If provoked, the brown anole will bite, urinate, and defecate. Also some brown anoles may do a short hiss if caught, injured, or fighting. Predators include rats, snakes, birds and many larger animals such as cats. Recent work in experimentally introduced populations in the Bahamas has shown that body size in the brown anole may not be affected by predation, as was previously thought.

A newspaper stamp is a special type of postage stamp used to pay the cost of mailing newspapers and other periodicals. Although many types were issued in the 19th century, typically representing rates reduced from regular mail, they generally fell out of use in the mid-20th century, as mail services began to arrange bulk handling directly with publishers. The exact use of newspaper stamps varied; small-value stamps were generally intended to be affixed to newspaper wrappers, in much the fashion of regular mail, but with values usually less than regular stamps. Higher values were used on bundles of newspapers, and later on receipts. The first newspaper stamp was issued by Austria in 1851, and a number of nations soon followed suit. The newspaper stamps of the United States, in use from 1865 to 1898, were always intended for bulk shipments, and with face values ranging up to US$100, are the highest-value newspaper stamps. Newspaper stamps seem to have been printed in great quantities, and almost all types are today inexpensive and easily acquired. {U.S. Newspapers & Periodicals stamps of 1875 } Further reading * Chandler, John H. and H.

Background He was born in Adelaide, and was educated at Geelong Grammar School and the University of Melbourne, where he entered residence at Trinity College in 1968.\\"Salvete 1968\\", Fleur-de-lys [Trinity College], 1968, p. 57. A graduate in engineering, Hawker was also a farmer and grazier before entering politics. He comes from a family with a long history of political involvement. He is a cousin of Charles Hawker, who was a member of the House of Representatives from South Australia from 1929 to 1938. His great-grandfather, George Charles Hawker, was Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1860 to 1865. Career After Fraser announced his retirement from politics amid the Coalition's heavy defeat in the 1983 federal election, Hawker won the seat in a May 1983 by-election. Hawker was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1990‚Äì93, a Deputy Opposition Whip 1989‚Äì90 and 1994, and Chief Opposition Whip 1994‚Äì96. On 15 November 2004 Hawker was chosen by the Parliamentary Liberal Party as its candidate for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was formally elected to the position on 16 November without opposition. After the 2007 federal election, Labor member Harry Jenkins succeeded Hawker as Speaker of the House, and took office on 12 February 2008. Hawker announced in June 2009 that he would retire from parliament at the 2010 federal election.Long-serving Liberal member for Wannon to quit: The Age 1/6/2009 Speaker As speaker from 2004 to 2007, Hawker was the subject of some controversy. Early dissent Some of Hawker's rulings, from motions put by the Australian Labor Party Opposition, were somewhat controversial early in his term, with one session of Question Time on 1 December 2004 resulting in twelve points of order, some continuously raised, to Brendan Nelson's response to a question on school funding raised by Sophie Mirabella, in that it was seen by the Opposition to anticipate debate. This session resulted in a dissent motion regarding the permission of ministers tabling documents at the end of answers, which was negatived. A further dissent motion was raised on 7 December 2004, regarding questions asked relating to public affairs but not directly regarding the subject's portfolio, specifically, the desire of the Opposition to question De-Anne Kelly to her supposed approval of funding of a project not relating to her portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. This dissent motion was also voted down. Likewise, a motion of dissent on 28 November 2005 to a ruling that the Member for Perth resume his seat, having twice ignored an instruction to desist in argument across the chamber, was voted down. (Immediately thereafter, the motion to place further motions on notice was passed without a vote, and the Speaker responded to the Leader of the Opposition's subsequent Point of Order by stating that the motion was a \\"request\\".) Questions over impartiality A 2006 ruling made by Hawker after an incident during a heated exchange in the House brought further motions of dissent from the Opposition, and drew criticism of the Speaker's impartiality from the media. After a motion regarding share trading was moved by Kelvin Thomson, the Member for Wills, on 25 May 2006, Leader of the House Tony Abbott referred to Thomson indirectly using unparliamentary language by moving the motion \\"that that snivelling grub be no longer heard\\". The Deputy Chair at the time, Peter Lindsay, did not make comment against to the withdrawal Abbott made using the words \\"if I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally\\". Later, the Speaker assumed the Chair, but it was only after the Opposition attempted to move a dissent motion that Abbott withdrew \\"unconditionally any imputation or offensive words against the member for Wills\\". When Manager of Opposition Business Julia Gillard however attempted to mimic exactly the exchange of 25 May by moving the motion \\"that that snivelling grub over there be not further heard\\" against Abbott on a health legislation amendment, and then stating that \\"If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally\\", the Speaker asked Gillard to withdraw \\"without reservation\\". Gillard responded that \\"in accordance with your ruling yesterday, I have withdrawn effectively\\", but the Speaker then said that \\"I have no option...but to name the member\\", and subsequently by motion from Abbott, Gillard was removed from the House for 24 hours. The Opposition had earlier asked questions to the Speaker about the apparent impartiality of the latter ruling, but criticism of the decision reached the media, with the Speaker defending the decision made referring to Abbott's later unconditional withdrawal. Under standing order 94A, the Speaker can throw members out of the parliament without a verbal warning for one hour. This rule has frequently been used to expel disruptive opposition members from the parliament. During the Question Time debate over the government's controversial Industrial Relations reforms some eleven Labor members were thrown out in one day.

It occurs widely from West Asia to the Indian Subcontinent. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The Indochinese roller was formerly included as a subspecies. It is best known for its aerobatic displays of males during the breeding season. It is often seen perched along roadside trees and wires and are commonly seen in open grassland and scrub forest habitats. The largest population occurs in India, and several states in India have chosen it as their state bird. Taxonomy Corvus benghalensis was the scientific name given by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 based on an Indian roller specimen from Bengal. The Indochinese roller (C. affinis) was formerly included as a subspecies. Two subspecies are recognized: * C. b. benghalensis - (Linnaeus, 1758): occurs from eastern Arabia to north-eastern India and Bangladesh * Southern roller (C. b. indicus) - Linnaeus, 1766: Originally described as a separate species. It occurs in central and southern India, Sri Lanka Description A large hook-tipped bill, seen here in subspecies indicus The Indian roller is a stocky bird about 26‚Äì27 cm long and can only be confused within its range with the migratory European roller. The breast is brownish and not blue as in the European Roller. The crown and vent are blue. The primaries are deep purplish blue with a band of pale blue. The tail is sky blue with a terminal band of Prussian blue and the central feathers are dull green. The neck and throat are purplish lilac with white shaft streaks. The bare patch around the eye is ochre in colour. The three forward toes are united at the base. Rollers have a long and compressed bill with a curved upper edge and a hooked tip. The nostril is long and exposed and there are long rictal bristles at the base of the bill. The three forward pointing toes appear to be joined at the base Three subspecies are usually recognized. The nominate form is found from western Asia (Iraq, Arabia) east across the Indian Subcontinent, and within India north of the Vindhyas mountain ranges. The subspecies indicus is found in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The southern form has a darker reddish collar on the hind neck which is missing in the nominate form. The Indochinese roller of eastern India and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Indochina) has been suggested as a full species, but within the Indian region, it is seen to intergrade with benghalensis. The Indochinese roller is darker, larger and has a purplish brown and unstreaked face and breast. It has underwing coverts in a deeper shade of blue.  Distribution and habitat  The Indian roller is distributed across Asia, from Iraq and United Arab Emirates in south-western Asia through the Indian Subcontinent, including Sri Lanka, Lakshadweep islands and Maldive Islands. Its main habitat includes cultivated areas, thin forest and grassland.  Ecology and behaviour  Indian rollers are often seen perched on prominent bare trees or wires. They descend to the ground to capture their prey which may include insects, spiders, scorpions, small snakes and amphibians. Fires attract them and they will also follow tractors for disturbed invertebrates. In agricultural habitats in southern India, they have been found at densities of about 50 birds per km2. They perch mainly on 3‚Äì10-metre high perches and feed mostly on ground insects. Nearly 50% of their prey are beetles and 25% made up by grasshoppers and crickets. Indian roller (Coracias benghalensis benghalensis) composite.jpgeating a grasshopper Indian roller by arshad ka.jpgin flight The feeding behaviour of this roller and habitat usage are very similar to that of the black drongo. During summer, they may also feed late in the evening and make use of artificial lights and feed on insects attracted to them. They are attracted to swarms of winged termites, and as many as 40 birds have been seen to perch on a 70-metre stretch of electric wires. Its habit of feeding near roadsides sometimes results in collisions with traffic. A decline in the numbers of these birds seen along roadsides in northern India has been noted. A study on roosting behaviour found that immediately after waking up, the birds spend a few minutes preening followed by flying around their roosting sites. Favoured perches include electric or telegraphic wires. They have also been observed perching in trees and shrubs. Rollers tend mostly at a heights of 3‚Äì9 m height from where they forage for ground insects. They may also use taller perches and obtain insects from the upper canopy of trees. The display of this bird is an aerobatic display, with the twists and turns that give the Coraciidae its English name of \\"rollers\\". The breeding season is March to June, slightly earlier in southern India. Displays when perched include bill-up displays, bowing, allopreening, wing drooping and tail fanning. Holes created by woodpeckers or wood boring insects in palms are favoured for nesting in some areas. Nest cavities may also be made by tearing open rotten tree trunks or in cavities in building. The cavity is usually unlined and is made up mainly of debris from the wood. The normal clutch consists of about 3‚Äì5 eggs. The eggs are white and broad oval or nearly spherical. Both sexes incubate the eggs for about 17 to 19 days. The young fledge and leave the nest after about a month. Nearly 80% of the eggs hatch and fledge. The call of the Indian roller is a harsh crow-like chack sound. It also makes a variety of other sounds, including metallic boink calls. It is especially vociferous during the breeding season. The bird bathes in open water by plunge-diving into it, a behaviour often interpreted as fishing. But it may occasionally attempt fishing from water. Blood parasites Leucocytozoon of the family Plasmodiidae have been noted in the lung tissues. Parasitic helminth worms Hadjelia truncata and Synhimantus spiralis were recorded as well. In culture The Indian roller is very common in the populated plains of India and associated with Hindu legends. It is said to be sacred to Vishnu, and used to be caught and released during festivals such as Dussera or the last day of Durga Puja. A local Hindi name is neelkanth, meaning \\"blue throat\\", a name associated with the deity Shiva (who drank poison resulting in the blue throat). Adding its chopped feathers to grass and feeding them to cows was believed to increase their milk yield. The Indian roller has been chosen as the state bird by the Indian states of Odisha, Karnataka and Telangana. References Other sources * Stonor, C.R.

With the right configuration, distcc can dramatically reduce a project's compilation time. It is designed to work with the C programming language (and its derivatives like C++ and Objective-C) and to use GCC as its backend, though it provides varying degrees of compatibility with the Intel C++ Compiler and Sun Microsystems' Sun Studio Compiler Suite. Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, distcc is free software. Design distcc is designed to speed up compilation by taking advantage of unused processing power on other computers. A machine with distcc installed can send code to be compiled across the network to a computer which has the distccd daemon and a compatible compiler installed. distcc works as an agent for the compiler. A distcc daemon has to run on each of the participating machines. The originating machine invokes a preprocessor to handle header files, preprocessing directives (such as \`#ifdef\`) and the source files and sends the preprocessed source to other machines over the network via TCP either unencrypted or using SSH. Remote machines compile those source files without any local dependencies (such as libraries, header files or macro definitions) to object files and send them back to the originator for further compilation. distcc version 3 supports a mode (called pump mode) in which included header files are sent to the remote machines, so that preprocessing is also distributed. Related software ccache is another tool aimed to reduce the compilation time by caching the output from the same input source files. ccache can also use distcc as its backend, providing distributed compiling if it is not already cached by using the CCACHE_PREFIX environment variable. distcc was an option for distributed builds in versions of Apple's Xcode development suite prior to 4.3, but has been removed. icecream was created by SUSE based on distcc. Like distcc, icecream takes compile jobs from a build and distributes it among remote machines allowing a parallel build. But unlike distcc, icecream uses a central server that dynamically schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server.

A branding iron is used for branding, pressing a heated metal shape against an object or livestock with the intention of leaving an identifying mark. History The history of branding is very much tied to the history of using animals as a commodity. The act of marking livestock with fire-heated marks to identify ownership begins in ancient times with the ancient Egyptians. The process continued throughout the ages, with both Romans and American colonists using the process to brand slaves as well.The branding of slaves. The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities In the English lexicon, the Germanic word \\"brand\\" originally meant anything hot or burning, such as a fire-brand, a burning stick. By the European Middle Ages it commonly identified the process of burning a mark into a stock animals with thick hides, such as cattle, so as to identify ownership under animus revertendi. In England, the rights of common including the common pasture system meant that cattle could be grazed on certain land with commoner's rights and the cattle were branded to show ownership, often with the commoner's or Lord of the manor's mark. The practice was widespread in most European nations with large cattle grazing regions, including Spain. With colonialism, many cattle branding traditions and techniques were spread via the Spanish Empire to South America and to countries of the British Empire including the Americas, Australasia & South Africa where distinct sets of traditions and techniques developed respectively. In the Americas these European systems continued with English tradition being used in the New England Colonies and spread outwards with the western expansion of the U.S. The Spanish system evolved from the south with the vaquero tradition in what today is the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The branding iron consisted of an iron rod with a simple symbol or mark which was heated in a fire. After the branding iron turned red-hot, the cowhand pressed the branding iron against the hide of the cow. The unique brand meant that cattle owned by multiple owners could then graze freely together on the commons or open range. Drovers or cowboys could then separate the cattle at roundup time for driving to market. Types of branding irons Branding Irons come in a variety of styles, designed primarily by their method of heating. Fire-heated The traditional fire-heated method is still in use today. While they require longer lengths of time to heat, are inconsistent in temperature and all around inferior to more advanced forms of branding, they are inexpensive to produce and purchase. Fire-heated branding irons are used to brand wood, steak, leather, livestock and plastics. Electric Electric branding irons utilize an electric heating element to heat a branding iron to the desired temperature. Electric branding irons come in many variations from irons designed to brand cattle, irons designed to mark wood and leather and models designed to be placed inside a drill press for the purposes of manufacturing. An Electric Branding Iron's temperature can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the flow of electricity. Propane Propane Branding Irons use a continuous flow of propane to heat the iron head. They are commonly used where electricity is not available. Utilizing the flow of propane, the temperature can be adjusted for varying branding environments. A commercially built branding iron heater fired with L.P. gas is a common method of heating several branding irons at once. Freeze-branding In contrast to traditional hot- iron branding, freeze branding uses a branding iron that has been chilled with a coolant such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Rather than burning a scar into the animal, a freeze brand damages the pigment-producing hair cells, causing the animal's hair to grow white where the brand has been applied. To apply a freeze brand, the hair coat of the animal is shaved so that the bare skin is exposed, then the frozen iron is applied to the bare area for a period of time that varies with both the species of animal and the color of its hair coat: Shorter times are used on dark-colored animals, simply causing the hair follicles to lose all color and regrow as white hairs. Longer times are needed on animals with white hair coats, as the brand is applied long enough to permanently stop the hair from growing in the branded area and only epidermis remains. Popular use Livestock Livestock branding is perhaps the most prevalent use of a branding iron. Modern use includes gas heating, the traditional fire-heated method, an iron heated by electricity (electric cattle branding iron) or an iron super cooled by dry ice (freeze branding iron). Cattle, horses and other livestock are commonly branded today for the same reason they were in Ancient times, to prove ownership. Wood branding Woodworkers will often use Electric or Fire-Heated Branding Irons to leave their maker's mark or company logo. Timber pallets and other timber export packaging is often marked in this way in accordance with ISPM 15 to indicate that the timber has been treated to prevent it carrying pests. Steak Steak branding irons are used commonly by barbecue enthusiasts and professional chefs to leave a mark indicating how well done a steak is or to identify the chef or grill master. Leather Branding Irons are used often by makers of horse tack often in place of a steel leather stamp to indicate craftsmanship.

It is resident in the southern part of its range, but northern breeding populations are short-distance migrants, moving further south after the wet season. Description The Abyssinian roller is a large bird, nearly the size of a jackdaw at . It has a warm brown back, with the rest of the plumage mainly blue. Adults have long () tail streamers. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult. Abyssinian roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings contrasting with the brown back and the long tail streamers trailing behind. The call of the Abyssinian roller is a harsh crow- like gak sound, or a screeched aaaargh. Distribution and habitat The Abyssinian roller is native to tropical Africa. Its range extends from southern Mauritania and Senegal in the west and to Ethiopia, Somalia and northern Kenya in the east. It is also found in south-western Saudi Arabia and western Yemen. This is a common bird of warm open country with some trees, and has adapted to farmland and human habitation. Behaviour and ecology These rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts or overhead wires, like giant shrikes, whilst watching for the large insects and small rodents on which they feed. They will dash into the smoke of a forest fire for disturbed invertebrates. They are fearless, and will dive and roll at humans and other intruders. The display of this bird is a lapwing-like display, with the twists and turns that give this group its English name. It nests in a scantily lined hole in a tree or building, and lays three to six eggs. Status The population trend for the Abyssinian roller is thought to be upward, as it exploits the opportunities provided by modern agricultural practices and urbanization. It has an extensive range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Flash, Dale and Dr. Hans Zarkov fight together against Ming the Merciless.  Profile  Dale is Flash Gordon's constant companion in his adventures, as well as his one true love. The emperor Ming the Merciless is immediately attracted to her and the early strips were essentially based on Flash‚Äôs heroic efforts to rescue Dale from Ming's many attempts to marry her. Filmation‚Äôs Flash Gordon‚Äôs Bible portrayed Dale Arden as follows: Alex Raymond's comic strip Dale Arden is introduced in the first Flash Gordon story, July 7, 1934, as simply \\"a passenger\\" on the plane Flash is flying on. After the plane is hit by a meteor, Flash saves Dale by parachuting to the ground. The two are then abducted by Dr. Zarkov, who takes them on his rocket to the planet Mongo. In the 1930s comic strips, Dale often comes into conflict with other female characters who desire Flash romantically (such as Princess Aura and Queen Azura). Comic books In the 2011 Dynamite Comics Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist, Dale Arden is a cartographer and researcher for the State Department in 1934. As in Raymond's original story, she and Flash are abducted by Zarkov and brought to Mongo. In the later Dynamite Comics Flash Gordon series, Dale Arden is a modern-day science journalist with a special interest in the space program, as well as a feminist. She travels with Zarkov and Flash on the former's Z-Plane to Mongo. In other media *Dale's broadcast debut was in a Hearst Radio series that ran from April to October 1935. The actress who played her is unknown. *Dale was first portrayed on film by Jean Rogers in the film serials Flash Gordon (1936) and Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938). *In the 1940 serial, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, Dale was portrayed by Carol Hughes. *Irene Champlin took the role for the 1954 Flash Gordon television series.

The tower was initially known as the JG Strijdom Tower, after JG Strijdom, South African Prime Minister from 1954 to 1958. On 31 May 2005 it was renamed the Telkom Jo'burg Tower. The tower was constructed for South African Posts & Telecommunications, which later became Telkom,James Barber, Angela Fung, Sandeep Toshniwal, Becky Voorheis, and Campbell R. Harvey, Telkom, South Africa\\", Winter (1999). Retrieved 2011/03/17. South Africa's government run and the country's largest telecommunications company. As the general height of buildings rose in the central business district, it became necessary that the height of the new telephone tower stayed above the height of the buildings surrounding it.  Tourist attraction  The Hillbrow Tower has been closed to visitors since 1981, primarily due to security reasons. Before the closure, the Hillbrow tower was one of the largest tourist draws in Johannesburg. The public was able to enter six public floors at the top of the tower. One of the floors housed a popular revolving restaurant named Heinrich's Restaurant, as well as another non-rotating restaurant known as the Grill Room and the observation floor which was at 197 m height. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a huge football was fitted to the tower to celebrate the event. In 2013, television programme Carte Blanche broadcast from what used to be the revolving restaurant. The Hillbrow Tower is one of two iconic towers that are often used to identify the Johannesburg skyline. The second tower, the Sentech Tower (Albert Hertzog Tower), is used for television and radio transmissions.

Description The blue-bellied roller is a large bird, nearly the size of a jackdaw at 28‚Äì30 cm. It has a dark green back, white head, neck and breast, with the rest of the plumage mainly blue. Adults have 6 cm tail streamers. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult. The blue-bellied roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings contrasting with the dark back and cream colored head, and the tail streamers trailing behind. The call of blue-bellied roller is a harsh clicking ga-ga-ga sound. Fluffing its feathers Distribution and habitat This is a common bird of warm open country with some trees. These rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts, or overhead wires, like giant shrikes, whilst watching for the grasshoppers and other large insects on which they feed. Behaviour and ecology The display of this bird is a lapwing-like display, with the twists and turns that give this species its English name. It nests in a hole in a tree - a tree cavity.

It is the innate result of a voluntary and an involuntary emotional response occurring simultaneously and conflicting with one another, and occurs when the amygdala (the emotion center of the brain) responds appropriately to the stimuli that the individual experiences and the individual wishes to conceal this specific emotion. This results in the individual very briefly displaying their true emotions followed by a false emotional reaction. Human emotions are an unconscious biopsychosocial reaction that derives from the amygdala and they typically last 0.5‚Äì4.0 seconds, although a microexpression will typically last less than 1/2 of a second. Unlike regular facial expressions it is either very difficult or virtually impossible to hide microexpression reactions. Microexpressions cannot be controlled as they happen in a fraction of a second, but it is possible to capture someone's expressions with a high speed camera and replay them at much slower speeds.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224160151_Facial_micro- expressions_recognition_using_high_speed_camera_and_3D-gradient_descriptor Microexpressions express the seven universal emotions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, contempt, and surprise. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, Paul Ekman expanded his list of emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles. These emotions are amusement, embarrassment, anxiety, guilt, pride, relief, contentment, pleasure, and shame. History Microexpressions were first discovered by Haggard and Isaacs. In their 1966 study, Haggard and Isaacs outlined how they discovered these \\"micromomentary\\" expressions while \\"scanning motion picture films of psychotherapy for hours, searching for indications of non-verbal communication between therapist and patient\\"Haggard, E. A., & Isaacs, K. S. (1966). Micro-momentary facial expressions as indicators of ego mechanisms in psychotherapy. In L. A. Gottschalk & A. H. Auerbach (Eds.), Methods of Research in Psychotherapy (pp. 154‚Äì165). New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. Through a series of studies, Paul Ekman found a high agreement across members of diverse Western and Eastern literate cultures on selecting emotional labels that fit facial expressions. Expressions he found to be universal included those indicating anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized. Working with his long-time friend Wallace V. Friesen, Ekman demonstrated that the findings extended to preliterate Fore tribesmen in Papua New Guinea, whose members could not have learned the meaning of expressions from exposure to media depictions of emotion. Ekman and Friesen then demonstrated that certain emotions were exhibited with very specific display rules, culture-specific prescriptions about who can show which emotions to whom and when. These display rules could explain how cultural differences may conceal the universal effect of expression. Chapter: The argument and evidence about universals in facial expressions of emotion. In the 1960s, William S. Condon pioneered the study of interactions at the fraction-of-a-second level. In his famous research project, he scrutinized a four-and-a-half-second film segment frame by frame, where each frame represented 1/25th second. After studying this film segment for a year and a half, he discerned interactional micromovements, such as the wife moving her shoulder exactly as the husband's hands came up, which combined yielded rhythms at the micro level.http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1966/10000/Sound_Film_Analysis_of_Normal_and_Pathological.5.aspx Sound Film Analysis of Normal and Pathological Behavior Patterns, Condon, W.S.; Ogston, W.D., Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease. 143(4):338‚Äì347, October 1966. Years after Condon's study, American psychologist John Gottman began video-recording living relationships to study how couples interact. By studying participants' facial expressions, Gottman was able to correlate expressions with which relationships would last and which would not. Gottman's 2002 paper makes no claims to accuracy in terms of binary classification, and is instead a regression analysis of a two factor model where skin conductance levels and oral history narratives encodings are the only two statistically significant variables. Facial expressions using Ekman's encoding scheme were not statistically significant. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink, Gottman states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive to a marriage: defensiveness which is described as a reaction toward a stimulus as if you were being attacked, stonewalling which is the behavior where a person refuses to communicate or cooperate with another,Webber, Elizabeth; Feinsilber, Mike (1999). Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions. Merriam- Webster. pp. 519‚Äì. . Retrieved 10 December 2012. criticism which is the practice of judging the merits and faults of a person, and contempt which is a general attitude that is a mixture of the primary emotions disgust and anger.TenHouten, W.D. (2007). General Theory of Emotions and Social Life. Routledge. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most important of them all.Gladwell, Malcolm (2005). Blink, Chapter 1, Section 3, The Importance of Contempt Types Microexpressions are typically classified based on how an expression is modified. They exist in three groups: *Simulated expressions: when a microexpression is not accompanied by a genuine emotion. This is the most commonly studied form of microexpression because of its nature. It occurs when there is a brief flash of an expression, and then returns to a neutral state. * Neutralized expressions: when a genuine expression is suppressed and the face remains neutral. This type of micro-expression is not observable due to the successful suppression of it by a person. *Masked expressions: when a genuine expression is completely masked by a falsified expression. Masked expressions are microexpressions that are intended to be hidden, either subconsciously or consciously. In photographs and films Microexpressions can be difficult to recognize, but still images and video can make them easier to perceive. In order to learn how to recognize the way that various emotions register across parts of the face, Ekman and Friesen recommend the study of what they call \\"facial blueprint photographs,\\" photographic studies of \\"the same person showing all the emotions\\" under consistent photographic conditions.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. p. 169 However, because of their extremely short duration, by definition, microexpressions can happen too quickly to capture with traditional photography. Both Condon and Gottman compiled their seminal research by intensively reviewing film footage. Frame rate manipulation also allows the viewer to distinguish distinct emotions, as well as their stages and progressions, which would otherwise be too subtle to identify. This technique is demonstrated in the short film Thought Moments by Michael Simon Toon and a film in Malayalam Pretham 2016Prof. Ragod√≠. \\"Trabajo Psicolog√≠a de 1er Trimestre.\\" El Bigote de Bernays.

For example, a feeling of anger lasting for just a few minutes, or even for an hour, is called an emotion. But if the person remains angry all day, or becomes angry a dozen times during that day, or is angry for days, then it is a mood.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. p. 12. Many people describe this as a person being irritable, or that the person is in an angry mood. As Paul Ekman described, it is possible but unlikely for a person in this mood to show a complete anger facial expression. More often just a trace of that angry facial expression may be held over a considerable period: a tightened jaw or tensed lower eyelid, or lip pressed against lip, or brows drawn down and together.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W..V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. pp. 12‚Äì13. Emotions are defined as a complex pattern of changes, including physiological arousal, feelings, cognitive processes, and behavioral reactions, made in response to a situation perceived to be personally significant.http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx#e Controlled microexpressions Facial expressions are not just uncontrolled instances. Some may in fact be voluntary and others involuntary, and thus some may be truthful and others false or misleading.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. p. 19. Facial expression may be controlled or uncontrolled. Some people are born able to control their expressions (such as pathological liars), while others are trained, for example actors. \\"Natural liars\\" may be aware of their ability to control microexpressions, and so may those who know them well; they may have been \\"getting away\\" with things since childhood due to greater ease in fooling their parents, teachers, and friends.Ekman, P. (1991). Telling Lies Clues to deceit in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage. New York: W.W. Norton & Company Inc., p. 56. People can simulate emotion expressions, attempting to create the impression that they feel an emotion when they are not experiencing it at all. A person may show an expression that looks like fear when in fact they feel nothing, or perhaps some other emotion.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. p. 20. Facial expressions of emotion are controlled for various reasons, whether cultural or by social conventions. For example, in the United States many little boys learn the cultural display rule, \\"little men do not cry or look afraid.\\" There are also more personal display rules, not learned by most people within a culture, but the product of the idiosyncrasies of a particular family. A child may be taught never to look angrily at his father, or never to show sadness when disappointed. These display rules, whether cultural ones shared by most people or personal, individual ones, are usually so well-learned, and learned so early, that the control of the facial expression they dictate is done automatically without thinking or awareness.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V. (2003). Unmasking the Face. Cambridge: Malor Books. pp. 20‚Äì21.  Emotional intelligence  Involuntary facial expressions can be hard to pick up and understand explicitly, and it is more of an implicit competence of the unconscious mind. Daniel Goleman created a conclusion on the capacity of an individual to recognize their own, as well as others' emotions, and to discriminate emotions based on introspection of those feelings. This is part of Goleman's emotional intelligence. In E.I, attunement is an unconscious synchrony that guides empathy. Attunement relies heavily on nonverbal communication. Looping is where facial expressions can elicit involuntary behavior, In the research motor mimicry there shows neurons that pick up on facial expressions and communicate with motor neurons responsible for muscles in the face to display the same facial expression. Thus displaying a smile may elicit a micro expression of a smile on someone who is trying to remain neutral in their expression. The amygdala is the emotion center of the brain Through fMRI we can see the area where these Mirror neurons are located lights up when you show the subject an image of a face expressing an emotion using a mirror. In the relationship of the prefrontal cortex also known as the (executive mind) which is where cognitive thinking experience and the amygdala being part of the limbic system is responsible for involuntary functions, habits, and emotions. The amygdala can hijack the pre-frontal cortex in a sympathetic response. In his book Emotional Intelligence Goleman uses the case of Jason Haffizulla (who assaulted his high school physics teacher because of a grade he received on a test) as an example of an emotional hijacking this is where rationality and better judgement can be impaired. This is one example of how the bottom brain can interpret sensory memory and execute involuntary behavior. This is the purpose of microexpressions in attunement and how you can interpret the emotion that is shown in a fraction of a second. The microexpression of a concealed emotion that's displayed to an individual will elicit the same emotion in them to a degree, this process is referred to as an emotional contagion. Being able to introspect these emotions can have applications to having more accurate judgements on an individuals intentions although accuracy depends a lot of factors. Accuracy can be determined by a web based microemotional aptitude test called the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (PONS) which is similar to the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) which tests the ability to read emotions.  MFETT and SFETT  Micro Facial expression training tools and subtle Facial expression training tools are software made to develop someone's skills in the competence of recognizing emotion. The software consists of a set of videos that you watch after being educated on the facial expressions. After watching a short clip, there is a test of your analysis of the video with immediate feedback. This tool is to be used daily to produce improvements. Individuals that are exposed to the test for the first time usually do poor trying to assume what expression was presented, but the idea is through the reinforcement of the feedback you unconsciously generate the correct expectations of that expression. These tools are used to develop rounder social skills and a better capacity for empathy. They are also quite useful for development of social skills in people on the autism spectrum. Although lie detection is not only an important skill in social situations and the workplace, but is a vital aspect to law enforcement and other occupations that deal with continual acts of deception. Microexpression and subtle expression recognition are valuable assets for these occupations as it increases the chance of detecting deception. In recent years it was found that the average person has a 54% accuracy rate in terms of exposing whether a person is lying or being truthful. However, Ekman had done a research experiment and discovered that secret service agents have a 64% accuracy rate. In later years, Ekman found groups of people that are intrigued by this form of detecting deception and had accuracy rates that ranged from 68% to 73%. Their conclusion was that people with the same training on microexpression and subtle expression recognition will vary depending on their level of emotional intelligence. Lies and leakage The sympathetic nervous system is one of two divisions under the autonomic nervous system, it functions involuntarily and one aspect of the system deals with emotional arousal in response to situations accordingly. Therefore, if an individual decides to deceive someone, they will experience a stress response within because of the possible consequences if caught. A person using deception will typically cope by using nonverbal cues which take the form of bodily movements. These bodily movements occur because of the need to release the chemical buildup of cortisol, which is produced at a higher rate in a situation where there is something at stake. The purpose for these involuntary nonverbal cues are to ease oneself in a stressful situation. In the midst of deceiving an individual, leakage can occur which is when nonverbal cues are exhibited and are contradictory to what the individual is conveying. Despite this useful tactic of detecting deception, microexpressions do not show what intentions or thoughts the deceiver is trying to conceal. They only provide the fact that there was emotional arousal in the context of the situation. If an individual displays fear or surprise in the form of a microexpression, it does not mean that the individual is concealing information that is relevant to investigation. This is similar to how polygraphs fail to some degree: because there is a sympathetic response due to the fear of being disbelieved as innocent. The same goes for microexpressions, when there is a concealed emotion there is no information revealed on why that emotion was felt. They do not determine a lie, but are a form of detecting concealed information. David Matsumoto is a well-known American psychologist and explains that one must not conclude that someone is lying if a microexpression is detected but that there is more to the story than is being told.Matsumoto, D. (2010, March 21). Dr. David Matsumoto: How to Tell a Lie with the Naked Eye. Retrieved from Spying for Lying: Paul Ekman created a paradigm to determine the confidence in deception apprehension due to the context of the situation and the person to be the liar themselves. The situational factors can be the type of person, any relationships, or the type of lie they are telling, or whether it is the act of withholding information or telling a false information. If a lie is successful, it can be followed by expressions of false delight, which is when happiness expressed in the satisfaction of the deceiver, or deception guilt, which can come on as an expression of fear or sadness. Universality Universal Facial Expressions A significant amount of research has been done in respect to whether basic facial expressions are universal or are culturally distinct. After Charles Darwin had written The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals it was widely accepted that facial expressions of emotion are universal and biologically determined.Darwin, C. (1872). The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. London: John Murray. Many writers have disagreed with this statement. David Matsumoto however agreed with this statement in his study of sighted and blind Olympians. Using thousands of photographs captured at the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Matsumoto compared the facial expressions of sighted and blind judo athletes, including individuals who were born blind. All competitors displayed the same expressions in response to winning and losing.Bible, E. (2009, January 7). Smiles and frowns are innate, not learned. Retrieved from San Francisco State University: http://www.sfsu.edu/news/2009/spring/1.html Matsumoto discovered that both blind and sighted competitors displayed similar facial expression, during winnings and loss. These results suggest that our ability to modify our faces to fit the social setting is not learned visually. Facial Action Coding System  The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is used to identify facial expression. This identifies the muscles that produce the facial expressions. To measure the muscle movements the action unit (AU) was developed. This system measures the relaxation or contraction of each individual muscle and assigns a unit. More than one muscle can be grouped into an Action Unit or the muscle may be divided into separate action units. The score consists of duration, intensity and asymmetry. This can be useful in identifying depression or measurement of pain in patients that are unable to express themselves.http://www.paulekman.com/facs/ The Facial Action Coding System training manual, first published in 1978 with multimedia supplements, is designed to teach individuals how to detect and categorize facial movements. The guide provides lessons and practice for memorizing action units and combinations of action units. The manual's purpose is to enable practitioners to recognize different physiological attributes of facial expressions, but leaves the interpretation of this data up to other works. Users should not expect to become face-reading experts. It can be particularly useful to behavioral scientists, CG animators, or computer scientists when they need to know the exact movements that the face can perform, and what muscles produce them. It also has potential to be a valuable tool for psychotherapists, interviewers, and other practitioners who must penetrate deeply into interpersonal communications. A new version (2002) of FACS by Paul Ekman, Wallace V. Friesen, and Joseph C. Hager is now available with several core improvements, including more accurate representations of facial behaviors and cleaner, digital images. Other related tools for facial expression recognition training include the Micro Expression Training Tool (METT) and Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT), both developed by Paul Ekman. In popular culture Microexpressions and associated science are the central premise for the 2009 television series Lie to Me, based on discoveries of Paul Ekman. The main character uses his acute awareness of microexpressions and other body language clues to determine when someone is lying or hiding something. They also play a central role in Robert Ludlum's posthumously published The Ambler Warning, in which the central character, Harrison Ambler, is an intelligence agent able to recognize them. Similarly, one of the main characters in Alastair Reynolds' science fiction novel, Absolution Gap, Aura, can easily read microexpressions. In The Mentalist, the main character, Patrick Jane, can often tell when people are being dishonest. However, specific reference to microexpressions is only made once in the 7th and final season. In the 2015 science fiction thriller Ex Machina, Ava, an artificially intelligent humanoid, surprises the protagonist, Caleb, in their first meeting, when she tells him \\"Your microexpressions are telegraphing discomfort.\\" Controversy Though the study of microexpressions has gained popularity through popular media, studies show it lacks internal consistency in its conceptual formation.http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/5/508.abstract See also *Interpersonal deception theory *Nonverbal communication *Microaggression *Facecrime *Silent Talker Lie Detector *Tell (poker) References Further reading * External links * Lying Is Exposed By Microexpressions We Can't Control, Science Daily, May 2006 * The Naked Face * Facial Expressions Test based on \\"The Micro Expression Training Tool\\" * \\"A Look Tells All\\" in Scientific American Mind October 2006 * Microexpressions Complicate Face Reading, by Medical News Today August 2007 * Deception Detection, American Psychological Association Category:Facial expressions Category:Emotion Category:Nonverbal communication ","title":"Microexpression"},{"id":"566236","text":"Time of Judgment is a series of roleplaying game scenario books for the World of Darkness settings of White Wolf Game Studio. These scenarios are presented as the semi-canonical endings of the original World of Darkness, as preparation for the new version of the setting. As the Time of Judgment approaches, vampires cease to exist, werewolves fight their last battle against the Wyrm, and mages face their last test. The series ran for four hardback books; one for Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and Mage: The Ascension respectively, with the fourth book delegated to each of the remaining settings. Each setting received between three and six potential scenarios. Roleplaying scenario books Vampire: Gehenna Vampire: Gehenna, released in January 2004, began the Time of Judgment chronicle, providing four different scenarios and tips for Storytellers to end their Vampire: The Masquerade game sessions. Its scenarios are; * \\"Wormwood\\", which is similar to the biblical story of Noah's ark, in which God silently eradicates vampiric life from Earth. The focus is on character interaction as the Player Characters are among the sole survivors in an abandoned sanctuary, as all other vampiric forms are cleansed, with the Player Characters given a chance to interact with each other, reconcile and turn to God before 40 Nights are over. * \\"Fair is Foul\\", which concerns the mythology of Lilith and the struggles of her own descendants against those of her enemy, Caine. * \\"Nightshade\\", a large-scale story which follows up on many metaplot hooks such as the rising of the antediluvian and rebirth of Saulot. * \\"Crucible of God\\", is best described as a post-apocalyptic monster epic, with the antediluvian having completely rewritten the world to their ideals. Werewolf: Apocalypse Werewolf: Apocalypse, released in February 2004, providing four different scenarios for Werewolf: The Apocalypse game sessions. * \\"The Last Battleground\\" covered the apocalypse as a great battle, taking place in the spirit realm, where the players would seek for any support before the final battle. * \\"A Tribe Falls\\" covers what events could occur if one of the existing thirteen tribes fell 'to the wyrm', like the Black Spiral Dancer tribe. * \\"Weaver Ascendant\\" essentially places the Weaver as the source of all problems in the cosmos, and throws the characters into conflict with it. * \\"Ragnarok\\" outlines what would happen if a giant asteroid were to collide with the world, igniting an apocalyptic war with the forces of the Wyrm. Mage: Ascension Mage: Ascension, released in March 2004, providing five different scenarios for Mage: The Ascension game sessions. * \\"Judgment\\", the most metaplot-heavy of the lot, features many current strands (rogue councils, forgotten traditions, the avatar storms), which ultimately leads to all characters ascending while the universe becomes one great singularity. * \\"The Revolution Will Be Televised\\" outlines a civil war in the Technocracy, with a view from the inside. * \\"The Earth Will Shake\\" outlines what would happen if a giant asteroid were to collide with the world, in a different manner to the event in Werewolf. * \\"A Whimper, Not A Bang\\" dealt with a threat from an alien lifeform, which had not previously been mentioned within the game for many years. These creatures are gradually consuming the world's magic, not much affecting humans but essentially producing the extinction of mages. * \\"Hell On Earth\\" outlined what would happen were the Nephandi to win the battle and bring chaos to the world. Time of Judgment World of Darkness: Time of Judgment, also released in March 2004, covered Changeling: The Dreaming, Demon: The Fallen, Hunter: The Reckoning, Kindred of the East, and Mummy: The Resurrection, with each receiving between three and four scenarios. Orpheus also got its final book, End Game in 2004, but it was not considered part of the Time of Judgment. Wraith: The Oblivion had already ended in 1999 due to lack of sales. Mind's Eye Theatre Laws of Judgment ended the Mind's Eye Theatre line of World of Darkness live-action role-playing games. Laws of Judgment is a condensed adaptation of the Time of Judgment books, as well as the final Wraith: The Oblivion book, Ends of Empire. Laws of Judgment omitted the \\"Rising of Mount Meru\\" scenario for Kindred of the East (from World of Darkness: Time of Judgment), on the grounds that its themes did not fit with those of Mind's Eye Theatre, as well as the entire Demon: The Fallen scenario from World of Darkness: Time of Judgment, as Demon was never adapted to Mind's Eye Theatre format. Novels There are also three fiction novels that picture the end of times for Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and Mage: The Ascension, respectively. These novels are \\"Gehenna\\", \\"The Last Battle\\", and \\"Judgment Day\\". None of these are considered to be the canonical ending of the line, as the storylines are left open for each group to end them as they please. References * Sean Riley et al. (2004). Apocalypse.

The term may refer to polyamory, but generally indicates a relationship where there is a primary emotional and intimate relationship between two partners, who agree to at least the possibility of intimacy with other people. Open relationships include any type of romantic relationship (dating, marriage, etc.) that is open. An \\"open\\" relationship is where one or more parties have permission to be romantically or sexually involved with people outside of the relationship. This is opposed to the traditionally \\"closed\\" relationship, where all parties agree on being with one another exclusively. The concept of an open relationship has been recognized since the 1970s. Types To a large degree, open relationships are a generalization of the concept of a relationship beyond monogamous relationships. A form of open relationship is the open marriage, in which the participants in a marriage have an open relationship. There are several different styles of open relationships. Some examples include: * Multi-partner relationships, between three or more partners where a sexual relationship does not occur between all of the parties involved. * Hybrid relationships, when one partner is nonmonogamous and the other is monogamous. * Swinging, in which singles or partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity. The term open relationship is sometimes used interchangeably with the closely related term polyamory, but the two concepts are not identical. The main unifying element to open relationship styles is non-exclusivity of romantic or sexual relationships. Another generic term for all these types of relationships is open love. Swinging Swinging is a form of open relationship in which the partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others at the same time. Swingers may regard the practice as a recreational or social activity that adds variety or excitement into their otherwise conventional sex lives or for curiosity. Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship. Open marriage An open marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/magazine/is-an-open-marriage-a- happier-marriage.html sometimes referred to as consensual non- monogamyhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/study-reveals-5-benefits-of-an- open-marriage_us_591b204ce4b086d2d0d8d2d7 or CNM, is a type of marriage wherein the involved parties unequivocally consent to their partners entering or engaging in romantic and/or sexual relationships with other people. Polyamory Polyamory is the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. While \\"open relationship\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \\"polyamory\\" or \\"polyamorous relationship\\", the terms are not synonymous. The \\"open\\" in \\"open relationship\\" refers to the sexual aspect of a relationship, whereas \\"polyamory\\" refers to allowing bonds to form (which may be sexual or otherwise) as additional long-term relationships. The terms \\"polyamory\\" and \\"friends with benefits\\" are fairly recent, having come about within the past few decades though the concept is as old as society. Prevalence Some believe that open relationships occur more frequently in certain demographics, such as the young rather than the old in America, including, more specifically, the college-educated middle-class, rather than the uneducated working-class, or people of certain ethnic and/or other racial minorities. Open relationships may also be more common among females rather than males, especially those in the same categories, such as college-educated, middle-class, white, younger Americans. This may be because women have more to gain by stressing this idea of equal rights, and that the women's rights movement supports the idea of open relationships. A 1974 study showed that male students who either cohabit or live in a communal group are more likely to become involved in open relationships than females, and are still more interested in the concept than females even if not participating in open relationships. A survey taken by gay men's \\"health and life magazine\\", FS Magazine, of the 1,006 gay men they surveyed 41% are in, or have previously experienced, an open relationship. Of the men who are in an open relationship, 75% believe that open relationships are great. Many couples within open relationships are dual-career, meaning that both primary partners have a stable job and/or a career. Both men and women in these, especially in closed groups, are also more likely to be in managerial jobs. Most also are either childfree, or post child-rearing. Reward vs. risk Reasons for entering an open relationship An open relationship may form for various reasons. These include: * liking another person but not wanting to end the old relationship * being non-monogamous by nature (i.e. born that way) * a difference emerging between two people in a relationship * one partner realizing that they are unable to fulfill the other's needs * varying sex drive between partners * one or both partners desiring more freedom, companionship, intellectual variety, a variety of sexual partners, getting ahead career-wise or maintaining relationships * a need for challenge: some people feel that their relationship is inadequate unless they are being challenged. Open relationships may create a sense of jealousy, attachment, or possessiveness, all of which are challenges for a relationship to work through. These emotions can also lead to greater self-awareness which may be seen as satisfying to those in open relationships. * the enjoyment of new relationship energy, the state of heightened emotional and sexual receptivity and excitement experienced during the formation of a new physical relationship * being able to meet other couples and individuals with a similar outlook with whom the participants can connect with on an intellectual and emotional level * being in a relationship of convenience, that is, one that is not primarily based on mutual feeling of love towards each other (anymore), but rather on economic or social factors (e.g.: the traditional practice of polyandry in rural Tibet) * distance ‚Äì when partners live in separate parts of the world for part or all of the time * sex may be more pleasing, and the participants may engage in it more frequently than those in an average couple ‚ÄúIt has been proposed that men (both gay and straight), in contrast to women, are able to cognitively separate sex from emotions (or love) in a process commonly termed compartmentalization.\\" This means it is not unusual for homosexual men to have open relationships, which means breaking the ‚Äònorm‚Äô of a committed and ‚Äòtypical‚Äô heterosexual relationship. That is not to suggest that open relationships do not work; research has shown comparable relationship satisfaction for both monogamous and non-monogamous couples. However, it could be that there is a lack of emotional investment in the relationship that makes it harder to navigate through tough times. Reasons for avoiding an open relationship Many couples consider open relationships, but choose not to follow through with the idea. If a person attempts to approach their committed monogamous partner about transitioning to an open relationship, the monogamous partner may convince or coerce them to either stay monogamous or pursue a new partner. There may also be concern that when beginning an open relationship, a partner may become only concerned in their personal development and pay less attention to their partner. Jealousy is often present in monogamous relationships, and adding one or more partners to the relationship may cause it to increase. Results of some studies have suggested that jealousy remains a problem in open relationships because the actual involvement of a third party is seen as a trigger. In Constantine & Constantine (1971), the researchers found that 80% of participants in open marriages had experienced jealousy at one point or another. Cultural pressure may also dissuade initiating or switching to an open relationship. There is a commonly held societal stereotype that those involved in open relationships are less committed or mature than those who are in monogamous relationships. Films, media, and self- help books present the message that to desire more than one partner means not having a \\"true\\" relationship. In the post-WWII 1950s-1970s, it was traditional to \\"date around\\" (with guidelines such not going out with one particular suitor twice in a row) until ready to start \\"going steady\\" (the onset of exclusivity and sexual exploration); since then, non-exclusive dating around has lost favour and going directly to steady (now known simply as exclusive dating) has been elevated instead. Desiring an open relationship in these days often claimed to be a phase that a person is passing through before being ready to \\"settle down\\". The logistics of an open relationship may be difficult to cope with, especially if the partners reside together, split finances, own property, or parent children.  Sexually transmitted infection  Any sexual contact outside of a strictly monogamous or polyfidelitous relationship increases the possibility that one member of the group will contract a sexually transmitted infection and pass it into the group. Neither barrier device use (such as condoms) nor more vigilant STI testing and vaccination can fully eliminate such risk, but can reduce the statistical increase attributable to nonmonogamy. Successful open relationships One of the most significant factors that aids a relationship in being successful is that it is about making the relationship fit the needs of all parties involved. No two open relationships will be the same, and the relationship will change due to the current circumstances at each specific moment. The style of the open relationship will mirror the parties' involved values, goals, desires, needs and philosophies. The most successful relationships have been those that take longer to establish. By taking the time to develop a clear idea of what both partners want out of the openness of a relationship, it allows the parties involved to self-reflect, process their emotions, deal with possible conflicts, and (for those transitioning from monogamy to nonmonogamy) find ways to cope with the change. Negotiating the details of the open relationship is important throughout the communication process. Topics that are commonly found in negotiations between couples include honesty, the level of maintenance, trust, boundaries and time management. Other tools that couples utilize in the negotiation process include allowing partners to veto new relationships, prior permission, and interaction between partners. This helps to reassure each partner in the relationship that their opinion is important and matters. However, although ability to veto can be a useful tool in negotiation, a successful negotiation and open relationship can still occur without it. Some reject veto power because they believe it limits their partner from experiencing a new relationship and limits their freedom. Boundaries Types of boundaries include physical, which is along the lines of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions. Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable to the members of the relationship. They also help people to feel safe and that they are just as important in the open relationship as their partners. Examples of boundaries that are set could include: * Who (geographically and interpersonally, such as in the community, friends, family, et cetera) could be an additional partner; * What types of physical limits are placed on that relationship (kissing, dating, or other sexual activities); * Whether sexual relations will take place in a separate bedroom, playroom or premises (e.g. hotel). Some couples create a physical relationship contract. These can be useful in not only negotiating, but also clearly articulating the needs, wants, limits, expectations, and commitments that are expected of the parties involved. Time management Adequate time management can contribute to the success of an open relationship. Even though having a serious commitment with one partner is common, negotiating the time spent among all partners is still important. Although the desire to give an unlimited amount of love, energy, and emotion to others is common, the limited amount of time in a day limits the actual time spent with each partner. Some find that if they cannot evenly distribute their time, they forego a partner. Time management can also be related to equity theory, which stresses the importance of fairness in relationships. Research on open marriages Positive outcomes Published 1974, a national study of sexuality conducted by Hunt found that relatively few people engage in swinging. Hunt attributed the low number of people in these open marriages to various social, psychological, and practical problems. Yet, some of these people \\"confirmed what the advocates and enthusiasts have claimed‚Äînamely, that marital swinging can provide physically intense experiences, that it can be immensely ego- gratifying and that it is a temporary release from confinement and responsibility and a brief chance to live out one's wildest fantasies\\" (pages 273‚Äì274). Some studies show that couples in open marriages can maintain satisfying relationships. Rubin observed no differences in marital adjustment between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages. Rubin and Adams reported no differences in marital satisfaction between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous relationships. Gilmartin likewise found no differences in marital satisfaction between sexually open and sexually monogamous couples. A study by Bergstrand and Willams found couples in open marriages had higher levels of satisfaction than couples in the general population. Some couples in open marriages report high levels of satisfaction with their relationships. A study conducted by Wolf found that 76 percent of couples in open marriages described the quality of their relationships as \\"better than average\\" or \\"outstanding\\". Dixon found similarly high levels of marital satisfaction in a study of 100 bisexual and heterosexual husbands in open marriages. In another study, Dixon observed that 80 percent of wives in open marriages rated their marital compatibility as \\"excellent\\" or \\"good\\", and 76 percent of the wives rated their sexual satisfaction as \\"excellent\\" or \\"good\\". Buunk has also reported high levels of satisfaction in couples in open marriages. Some couples feel open marriage has increased their marital satisfaction. Bergstrand and Williams collected online questionnaires from 1092 people involved in swinging style open marriages. Among those people who said they were \\"somewhat unhappy\\" or \\"unhappy\\" with their marriages before swinging, around 80‚Äì90 percent said they were happier with their marriages after they started swinging. Nearly half of people who said they were \\"very happy\\" with their marriages before swinging claimed to be even happier with their marriages after swinging. Open marriage can in some cases increase marital satisfaction. Neutral outcomes Couples sometimes drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. In a five-year study of bisexuals, 80 percent of whom initially had open relationships, Martin Weinberg, Colin J. Williams, and Douglas Pryor observed a definite shift towards sexual monogamy over time. When first interviewed, a majority of these bisexuals preferred sexual non-monogamy as their ideal form of romantic relationships. Five years later, around 60 percent had changed their views, and most of those who changed their views said sexual monogamy was their new ideal. Some of these changes were motivated by the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. Monogamy was seen as a way to avoid getting HIV/AIDS. But, for many, the shift to monogamy was due to a genuine change in what they sought in relationships. Their desire to be sexually monogamous had nothing to do with the AIDS epidemic. Couples who try open marriages and decide to return to sexually monogamous marriages may be left with different feelings about open marriage. Some may have negative feelings about their open marriage experiences. Others may continue to \\"see nonmonogamy as possibly good for others but not for themselves\\". Overall, open marriage has a relatively neutral impact on these couples. Negative outcomes Couples in open marriages expose themselves to the potential for conflicts caused by jealousy. Couples in open marriages appear to experience jealousy more frequently than people in sexually monogamous marriages. Studies have shown that 80 percent or more of couples in open marriages experience jealousy over their extramarital relationships. Jealousy with its roots in open marriage can lead to serious conflicts. For example, attempting to interfere with a rival relationship may make a partner angry. Insulting or berating a partner may provoke retaliatory responses. Demanding greater commitment may ignite arguments. Indeed, many studies have reported that conflict occurs during episodes of jealousy.Citations:    The conflicts caused by jealousy can seem overwhelming and damage relationships. Even when jealousy is not an overwhelming problem, open marriage may cause other complications. For example, a five-year study of bisexuals observed a shift from open relationships to sexually monogamous relationships in many participants because they \\"felt that nonmonogamy was too time consuming, took too much energy, or was too complicated. They also thought that it got in the way of developing love, trust, and more intimate relationships with a partner\\". Numerous authors have argued that open marriages disrupt relationships by interfering with intimacy and provoking insecurities.Other citations:   Some couples report that open marriage contributed to their divorces. Janus and Janus asked divorced people to list the one primary reason for their divorces. Approximately 1 percent of men and 2 percent of women listed open marriage as the primary reason for their divorce. This seems like a small percentage, but keep in mind that only 1 to 6 percent of the population have open marriages.Other citations:  * Open marriage is perceived as a primary cause of divorce in a substantial minority of the 1 to 6 percent of people who have open marriages. The extent to which open marriage actually contributes to divorce remains uncertain. Blumstein and Schwartz note a slightly higher risk of divorce among couples who engage in extramarital sex, even if the couples agree to allow extramarital sex. However, Rubin and Adams did not observe any difference in the risk of divorce for couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages.

The Edy‚Äôs Pie was the first such dessert sold in the United States. It is marketed by Dreyer's, a division of Froneri. The dessert received its current name in 2020 when Dreyer‚Äôs chose to drop the Eskimo Pie name, saying that Eskimo is a derogatory term. History Danish immigrant Christian Kent Nelson, a schoolteacher and candy store owner, claimed to have received the inspiration for the Eskimo Pie in 1920 in Onawa, Iowa, when a boy in his store was unable to decide whether to spend his money on ice cream or a chocolate bar. After experimenting with different ways to adhere melted chocolate to bricks of ice cream, Nelson began selling his invention, under the name I-Scream Bars. In 1921, he filed for a patent, and secured an agreement with local chocolate producer Russell C. Stover to mass- produce them under the new trademarked name \\"Eskimo Pie\\" (a name suggested by Mrs. Stover), and to create the Eskimo Pie Corporation. After patent 1,404,539 was issued on January 24, 1922, Nelson franchised the product, allowing ice cream manufacturers to produce them under that name. The patent, which applied to any type of frozen confection encased in candy, was invalidated in 1928. One of the earliest advertisements for Eskimo Pies. November 3, 1921, Iowa City Press-Citizen. File:Russell Stover Portrait Painting.pngRussell Stover, co-founder of the Eskimo Pie File:Christian Kent Nelson.jpgChristian Kent Nelson, co-founder of the Eskimo Pie, in 1922 Stover sold his share of the business. He then formed the well-known chocolate manufacturer Russell Stover Candies. Nelson became independently wealthy off the royalties from the sale of Eskimo Pies. In 1922 he was selling one million pies a day. The abandoned Rosedale Dairy, Fort Dodge, Iowa, longtime manufacturer of Eskimo Pies Nelson then sold his share of the business to the United States Foil Company, which made the Eskimo Pie wrappers. He retired at a young age, but reportedly out of boredom rejoined what was then called Reynolds Metals Company (now part of Alcoa) in 1935, inventing new methods of manufacturing and shipping Eskimo Pies and serving as an executive until his ultimate retirement in 1961. In 1992, Nelson died at the age of 99. In that same year, Eskimo Pie Corporation was spun off from Reynolds in an initial public offering, as an alternative to an acquisition that Nestl√© had proposed in 1991. The original round-faced child icon for the brand was created by the illustrator Gyo Fujikawa. CoolBrands International, a Markham, Ontario-based company, acquired Eskimo Pie Corporation in 2000. Originally a yogurt maker, CoolBrands at one point owned or held exclusive long-term licenses for brands including Eskimo Pie, Chipwich, Weight Watchers, Godiva, Tropicana, Betty Crocker, Trix, Yoo-hoo and Welch's. The company encountered financial difficulties after losing its Weight Watchers/Smart Ones license in 2004. By 2007 it was selling off core assets, and in February 2007 it sold Eskimo Pie and Chipwich to the Dreyer's division of Nestl√©. On June 19, 2020, Dreyer's announced that it would change the \\"Eskimo Pie\\" brand name and marketing, saying the term is \\"derogatory.\\"  In France  In June 1924, the \\"Esquimaux-Brick\\" company was founded in Paris. It quickly expanded its production to other European countries, in particular to Italy and Hungary. The company produced \\"Esquimaux Bricks\\" which, as the name says, did not yet have a stick. The rights for Esquimau brand were registered in France in 1928. The \\"Esquimaux Ch. Gervais\\" were marketed the same year by Gervais, a French cheese producer. In 1931, Gervais bought the Soci√©t√© Esquimaux-Brick, which was dissolved. The brand was deposited by Gervais. It was renamed to \\"Kim\\" (\\"Kim Eskimo\\" or \\"Kim cone\\") during the years 1990‚Äì2000, as due to its wide use it was recognized as a generic name. In other countries USSR, 1935 In South Australia, the Alaska Ice Cream company licensed the Eskimo Pie name and manufacturing process in 1923. The product was introduced to New Zealand in the 1940s, where it is produced by Tip Top. In the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as in France the word \\"Eskimo\\" is used as a generic name, not a trademark, for chocolate- covered ice cream with a wooden stick to handle it. In the Czech Republic, \\"Eskymo\\" is a brand of Eskimo-Pie style ice cream produced (as of 2020) by Unilever under its Algida brand. While the word \\"Eskymo\\" can be used as a generic term in some regions of the country, the most common word for a chocolate-covered bar of ice-cream with a stick handle is \\"Nanuk\\" (in reference to the Nanook of the North film).

According to different sources, 45% of all English words have a French origin. This suggests that 80,000 words should appear in this list; this list, however, only includes words imported directly from French, such as both joy and joyous, and does not include derivatives formed in English of words borrowed from French, including joyful, joyfulness, partisanship, and parenthood. It also excludes both combinations of words of French origin with words whose origin is a language other than French ‚Äî e.g., ice cream, sunray, jellyfish, killjoy, lifeguard, and passageway‚Äî and English-made combinations of words of French origin ‚Äî e.g., grapefruit (grape + fruit), layperson (lay + person), mailorder, magpie, marketplace, surrender, petticoat, and straitjacket. This list also excludes words that come from French but were introduced into the English language via a language other than French, which include commodore, domineer, filibuster, ketone, loggia, lotto, mariachi, monsignor, oboe, paella, panzer, picayune, ranch, vendue, and veneer. Although French is derived mainly from Latin (which accounts for about 60% of English vocabulary either directly or via a Romance language), it also includes words from Gaulish and Germanic languages (especially Old Frankish). Since English is of Germanic origin, words that have entered English from the Germanic elements in French might not strike the eye as distinctively from French. Conversely, as Latin gave many derivatives to both the English and the French languages, ascertaining that a given Latinate derivative did not come to the English language via French can be difficult in a few cases.  Historical context  Most of the French vocabulary now appearing in English was imported over the centuries following the Norman Conquest of 1066, when England came under the administration of Norman-speaking peoples. William the Conqueror invaded the British Isles, distributing lands and property to Norman, Breton, Flemish, and French soldiers. As a result, Old French became the language of culture and the administration, evolving into Anglo-Norman French. The majority of the population of England continued to use their Anglo-Saxon language, but it was influenced by the language of the ruling elite, resulting in doublets. Consider for example the words for the meats eaten by the Anglo- Norman nobility and the corresponding animals raised by the Anglo-Saxon peasants: beef / ox, mutton / sheep, veal / calf, pork / pig, or pairs of words pertaining to different registers of language: commence / start, continue / go on, disengage / withdraw, encounter / meet, vend / sell, purchase / buy, commerce / trade. Words of French origin often refer to more abstract or elaborate notions than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents (e.g. liberty / freedom, justice / fairness), and are therefore of less frequent use in everyday language. This may not, however, be the case for all English words of French origin. Consider, for example, some of the most common words in English: able, car, chair, city, country, different, fine, fruit, journey, juice, just, part, people, person, place, real, stay, table, travel, use, very, and wait. After the rise of Henry Plantagenet to the throne of England, other forms of dialectal French may have gained in influence to the detriment of Anglo-Norman French (notably the variants of Anjou where the House of Plantagenet came from, and possibly Poitevin, the tongue of Eleanor of Aquitaine). With the English claim to the throne of France, the influence of the language in use at the royal court of France in Paris increased. The cultural influence of France remained strong in the following centuries and from the Renaissance onward borrowings were mainly made from Parisian French, which became the de facto standard language of France.  Notable fields of French influence   Feudalism  Norman rule of England had a lasting impact on British society. Words from Anglo-Norman or Old French include terms related to chivalry (homage, liege, peasant, seigniorage, suzerain, vassal, villain) and other institutions (bailiff, chancellor, council, government, mayor, minister, parliament), the organisation of religion (abbey, clergy, cloister, diocese, friar, mass, parish, prayer, preach, priest, sacristy, vestment, vestry, vicar), the nobility (baron, count, dame, duke, marquis, prince, sir), and the art of war (armour, baldric, dungeon, hauberk, mail, portcullis, rampart, surcoat). Many of these words related to the feudal system or medieval warfare have a Germanic origin (mainly through Old Frankish) (see also French words of Germanic origin). The Norman origin of the British monarchy is still visible in expressions like Prince Regent, heir apparent, Princess Royal where the adjective is placed after the noun, like in French.  Heraldry  The vocabulary of heraldry has been heavily influenced by French (blazon, or, argent, sable, gules, passant), for more details see tinctures, attitudes, and charges of heraldry. Sometimes used in heraldry, some mythological beasts (cockatrice, dragon, griffin, hippogriff, phoenix) or exotic animals (lion, leopard, antelope, gazelle, giraffe, camel, zebu, elephant, baboon, macaque, mouflon, dolphin, ocelot, ostrich, chameleon) draw their name from French. It is also the case of some animals native of Europe (via Anglo-Norman: eagle, buzzard, falcon, squirrel, coney, rabbit, leveret, lizard, marten, ferret, salmon, viper).  Military  The vocabulary of warfare and the military include many words and expressions of French origin (accoutrements, aide-de-camp, army, artillery, battalion, bivouac, brigade, camouflage, carabineer, cavalry, cordon sanitaire, corps, corvette, dragoon, espionage, esprit de corps, √©tat major, fusilier, grenadier, guard, hors-de-combat, infantry, latrine, legionnaire, logistics, mat√©riel, marine, morale, musketeer, officer, pistol, platoon, reconnaissance/reconnoitre, regiment, rendezvous, siege, soldier, sortie, squad, squadron, surrender, surveillance, terrain, troop, volley). This includes military ranks: admiral, captain, colonel, corporal, general, lieutenant, sergeant. Many fencing terms are also from French.  Politics and economics  The political/economic lexicon include many words of French origin like money, treasury, exchequer, commerce, finance, tax, liberalism, capitalism, materialism, nationalism, plebiscite, coup d'√©tat, regime, sovereignty, state, administration, federal, bureaucracy, constitution, jurisdiction, district.  Law  The judicial lexicon has also been heavily influenced by French (justice, judge, jury, attorney, court, case).  Diplomacy  attach√©, charg√© d'affaires, envoy, embassy, chancery, diplomacy, d√©marche, communiqu√©, aide-m√©moire, d√©tente, entente, rapprochement, accord, treaty, alliance, passport, protocol.  Arts  art, music, dance, theatre, author, stage, paint, canvas, perform, harmony, melody, rhythm, trumpet, note, director, gallery, portrait, brush, pallet, montage, surrealism, impressionism, fauvism, cubism, symbolism, art nouveau, gouache, aquarelle, collage, render, frieze, grisaille.  Architecture  aisle, arcade, arch, vault, voussoir, belfry, arc-boutant, buttress, bay, lintel, estrade, facade, balustrade, terrace, lunette, niche, pavilion, pilaster, porte coch√®re.  Aviation and automobile engineering  France played a pioneering role in the fields of aviation (nacelle, empennage, fuselage, aileron, altimeter, canard, decalage, monocoque, turbine) and automobile engineering or design (chassis, piston, arbor, grille, tonneau, berline, sedan, limousine, cabriolet, coup√©, convertible).  Cuisine  baba au rhum, beef, beef bourguignon, boudin, caramel, casserole, cassoulet, clafoutis, confit, consomm√©, cream, croissant, custard, filet mignon, fillet, foie gras, flognarde, fondant, fondue, gateau, gratin, madeleine, marmalade, mayonnaise, meringue, mille-feuille, mustard, mutton, navarin, p√¢t√©, pastry, petit four, pork, porridge, potage, pudding, puree, ragout, ratatouille, roux, salad, sauce, sausage, souffl√©, soup, stew, terrine, trifle, veal, vol-au-vent.  Colours and Other Influences  Other influences include the names of colours (ecru, mauve, beige, carmine, maroon, blue, orange, violet, vermilion, turquoise, lilac, perse, scarlet, cerise), vegetables or fruits (courgette, aubergine, cabbage, carrot, cherry, chestnut, cucumber, nutmeg, quince, spinach, lemon, orange, apricot), and months of the year (January, March, May, July, November, December).  Terms coined by French people  Some of the French words that made their way into the English language were coined by French speaking inventors, discoverers or pioneers, or scientists: cinema, television, helicopter, parachute, harmonium, bathyscaphe, lactose, lecithin, bacteriophage, chlorophyll, mastodon, pterodactyl, oxide, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, photography, stethoscope, thermometer, stratosphere, troposphere.  Named after French people  Some French words were named after French people (from their family name), especially in the fields of science (ampere, appertisation, baud, becquerel, braille, coulomb, curie, daguerreotype, pascal, pasteurise, vernier), botany and mineralogy (begonia, bougainvillea, clementine, magnolia, dolomite, nicotine), fashion and style or any other cultural aspect (lavalier, leotard, recamier, mansard, chauvinism, kir, praline, saxophone, silhouette, guillotine).  Proper names  The names of certain cities in non- francophone regions/countries entered English with French spelling (Constance, Ypres, Bruges, Louvain, Turin, Milan, Plaisance, Florence, Rome, Naples, Syracuse, Vienna, Prague, Munich, Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Seville, Constantinople). In North America, the names of some of the Native American peoples or First Nations the French came in contact with first are from French (Sioux, Saulteaux, Iroquois, Nez Perce, Huron, Cheyenne, Algonquin). It is also the case of some place names such as Canada, Arkansas, Michigan, Illinois, Maine, Vermont, Des Moines, Detroit, Chicago and Baton Rouge.  Main patterns of influence  Some words from Old French have been imported again from Middle French or Modern French, but have generally taken a more restrictive or specialised meaning the second time. Consider for instance these doublets : chief / chef, luminary / luminaire, liquor / liqueur, castle / ch√¢teau, hostel / hotel, mask / masque, necessary / n√©cessaire, petty / petit, ticket / etiquette, troop / troupe, vanguard / avant-garde. Note that the word in French has kept the general meaning: e.g. ch√¢teau in French means \\"castle\\" and chef means \\"chief\\". Even when not imported several times in different forms, loanwords from French generally have a more restrictive or specialised meaning than in French: e.g. legume (in Fr. l√©gume means \\"vegetable\\"), gateau (in Fr. g√¢teau means \\"cake\\"). In some cases, the English language has been more conservative than the French one with Old French words, at least in spelling if not in pronunciation: e.g. apostle (O.Fr. apostle / M.Fr. ap√¥tre), castle (O.Fr. castel or chastel / M.Fr. ch√¢teau), forest (O.Fr. forest / M.Fr. for√™t), vessel (O.Fr. vaissel / M.Fr. vaisseau). Other Old French words have even disappeared from Modern French: dandelion. On the other hand, a move to restore the classical roots (Latin or Ancient Greek) occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Thus words from Old French saw their spelling re-Latinized. Although in most cases this did not affect their pronunciation (e.g. debt, doubt, indict, mayor), in some cases it did (e.g. abnormal, adventure, benefit). The ph transcription of words of Greek etymology was restored instead of the f. Thus fantosme became phantom, fesan became pheasant. This move occurred also in French, although less systematically: Old French farmacie became pharmacie (\\"pharmacy\\"), fenix became ph√©nix (\\"phoenix\\"), but fantosme became fant√¥me (\\"phantom, ghost\\") and fesan became faisan (\\"pheasant\\"). Beside re-Latinization that blurred the French origin of some words (e.g. peradventure), other modifications in spelling have included folk etymology alterations (e.g. belfry, crayfish, gillyflower, gingerbread, penthouse, pickaxe). Furthermore, the spelling of some words was changed to keep the pronunciation as close to the original as possible (e.g. leaven), whereas in other cases the French spelling was kept and resulted in totally different pronunciation than French (e.g. leopard, levee)Leading some to say that . Terms that most recently entered the English language have kept French pronunciation and spelling (ambiance, aplomb, arbitrage, armoire, barrage, bonhomie, bourgeoisie, brochure, bureau, caf√©, camaraderie, catalogue, chandelier, chauffeur, coiffure, collage, cort√®ge, cr√®che, critique, debris, d√©cor, d√©nouement, depot, dossier, √©lite, entourage, ennui, entrepreneur, espionage, expertise, expos√©, financier, garage, genre, glacier, intrigue, liaison, lingerie, machine, massage, millionaire, mirage, montage, panache, penchant, personnel, plaque, promenade, rapport, repertoire, reservoir, routine, sabotage, sachet, souvenir, tableau, terrain, tranche), though this may change with time (e.g. the initial h in hotel is not silent anymore, consider also the evolving pronunciation of herb, or garage). Expressions like femme fatale, b√™te noire and enfant terrible are still recognisably French. Borrowings are not a one-way process (See Reborrowing), some words of French origin ultimately come from Old English (Anglo-Saxon words): e.g. bateau, chiffon, gourmet. While conversely English words of French origin made their way \\"back\\" into Modern French: budget, challenge, design, discount, establishment, fuel, gay, gin, humour, interview, jury, management, mess, pedigree, record, reporter, spleen, sport, squat, standard, suspense, tennis, ticket, toast, toboggan, tunnel, vintage.

Written in 1877, it is the only published piece by the British composer Euphemia Allen (under the pseudonym Arthur de Lulli). Allen‚Äîwhose brother, Mozart Allen, was a music publisher‚Äîwas sixteen when she composed the piece, with arrangements for solo and duet. The title \\"Chop Waltz\\" comes from Allen's specification that the melody be played in two-part harmony with both hands held in a vertical orientation, little fingers down and palms facing each other, striking the keys with a chopping motion. The similar \\"The Coteletten Polka\\" also was first heard in 1877, with the piano collection Paraphrases elaborating on the theme by 1879. \\"Chopsticks\\" continues to be popular in various forms of media.  Paraphrases  In 1877, Alexander Borodin's daughter played \\"The Coteletten Polka\\", with four bars of music similar to the beginning of de Lulli's work, though there is no hard evidence of a common source between the two pieces. A group of Russian composers‚ÄîAlexander Borodin, C√©sar Cui, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Anatoly Lyadov‚Äîcollaboratively composed three-hand piano variations on this theme for Borodin's daughter Gania. (Modest Mussorgsky did not participate, thinking that the composition would be meaningless.) The original edition of this collection dates from 1879. The second edition was published the following year (1880), under the title Paraphrases: 24 Variations et 15 petits pi√®ces sur le th√®me favori et oblig√©. Franz Liszt was thrilled with this volume and composed a short tribute for piano solo to be inserted before Borodin's Polka. Later editions of the work saw it grow from 15 to 17 other pieces, including a contribution from Nikolai Shcherbachov when it was reissued in 1893.

In 2002, Discover magazine recognized Matzinger as one of the 100 most important women in science. Early years Polly Matzinger was born on July 21, 1947, in France, of a French mother (Simone) and a Dutch father (Hans). She immigrated to the US, along with her parents and sister (Marjolaine) in 1954. Before finishing university, she worked at many different kinds of jobs. She was a jazz musician (playing the bass), a carpenter, a dog trainer, a waitress, and a Playboy Bunny. Although it took her eleven years to finish her undergraduate degree, she finished her BS in biology at the University of California, Irvine, in 1976. She was talked into going to graduate school by Professor Robert Schwab of UC Davis and finished her PhD in biology at the University of California, San Diego in 1979. She then did four years of postdoctoral work at the University of Cambridge and was a scientist at the Basel Institute for Immunology for six years, before heading to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Ghost Lab at NIAID Polly Matzinger was a section head at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) until April 2013. Matzinger and her coworkers referred to the lab as the \\"Ghost Lab\\" when listing their affiliation in papers. The nickname was given to the lab by her colleagues when Matzinger first arrived at the NIH because she spent the first nine months studying a new field (chaos theory) that she thought might apply to the immune system, and the lab sat empty. The formal name of her laboratory was the T-Cell Tolerance and Memory Section of the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology. On average, the Ghost Lab hosted three postdoctoral researchers at any one time. On April 1, 2013, NIAID administration closed the Ghost Lab. The T-Cell Tolerance and Memory Section was incorporated into the Laboratory of Immunogenetics, but without any funding for research, and Matzinger's research was effectively shut down. Since that time she has given a series of eight lectures explaining the function of the immune system from the point of view of the danger model. These lectures were taped and can be found on the NIH videocast website. The lectures cover immunological theory, transplantation, pregnancy, tumors, autoimmunity, T regulatory cells, tissue control of immunological class, allergy, parasites and the nature of danger signals.  Research  The danger model The self/non-self model, the predominant model in immunology since the 1950s, began to encounter problems in the late 1980s when immunologists began to recognize that T cells depend on other cells to pick up and then present the things to which they will respond  and that the T cell response depends on whether the other cell (known as antigen-presenting cells) is sending activation signals to the T cells. In 1989, drawing on the ideas of Thomas Kuhn, Charles Janeway proposed that the old immunological paradigm had reached the limits of its usefulness‚Äîor, as he described it, the asymptote of the increase in knowledge which it had brought. Janeway argued that the innate immune system was the real gatekeeper of whether the immune system responded or did not respond. He also argued that the innate immune system used ancient pattern-recognition receptors to make these decisions, recognizing a pathogen by its unchanging characteristics. Danger signals In a 1994 article entitled \\"Tolerance, Danger and the Extended Family\\", Matzinger went several steps further by laying out the idea that antigen-presenting cells respond to \\"danger signals\\" ‚Äî most notably from cells undergoing injury, stress or \\"bad cell death\\" (as opposed to apoptosis, controlled cell death). The alarm signals released by these cells let the immune system know that there is a problem requiring an immune response. She argued that T cells and the immune response they orchestrate occurs not because of a neonatal definition of \\"self\\", as in the previous model, nor because of ancient definitions of pathogens, as in Janeway's argument, but because of a dynamic and constantly updated response to danger as defined by cellular damage. Scope The danger model is broad, covering topics as diverse as transplantation, maternal/fetal immunity, autoimmunity, cancer treatments, and vaccines, but Matzinger points out that the original model was designed to offer an explanation of how an immune response is triggered and how it ends, but did not offer an explanation of why the immune system responds in different ways to different situations. She has now extended the model to hypothesize that tissues not only send signals alerting the immune system to local damage and stress, but that the tissues also determine the immune response appropriate for that tissue. Before her lab was closed, it was working on experiments to test that hypothesis. She is currently seeking collaborations to continue the research. The danger model has not won universal acceptance. Some immunologists, following Janeway's ideas more directly, believe that the immune response is mainly fueled by innate evolutionarily conserved \\"pattern recognition receptors\\" which recognize patterns expressed by microbes such as bacteria, and do not see cell death in the absence of pathogens as a primary driver of immune responses. These ideas however, do not explain how the immune system rejects tumors, induce autoimmune diseases, or generate allergy and asthma. Pattern recognition and a tissue-driven immune system Seong and Matzinger have suggested that the \\"patterns\\" that the immune system recognizes on bacteria are not as different from the alarm signals released by damaged cells as one might have thought. They suggested that, because life evolved in water, the hydrophobic portions of molecules are normally hidden in the internal parts of molecules or other structures (like membranes) and that the sudden exposure of a hydrophobic portion is a sure sign that some injury or damage has occurred. They suggested that these are the most ancient alarm signals, that they are recognized by evolutionarily ancient systems of repair and remodeling, and that the modern immune system piggy-backed on this ancient system. Thus bacteria and other organisms may have very similar alarm systems. They describe these ancient signals as danger-associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs. In a 2013 article in Nature Immunology, Matzinger makes a case for what she now views as the most important implication of the danger model: that the tissues of the body are a large part of what drive immune response. She argues that immunologists have had overly simplistic and schematic ideas about immune response because of the limits of their assays, and that organs are likely to induce immune responses that are best-suited to defending the organ from the damage of microbes but also from the damage of the immune system itself. She also asserts that the relationship of the immune system to commensal bacteria remains poorly understood but is likely to be important. Matzinger argues that the idea of DAMPs may explain why Toll-like receptors seem to respond both to external and endogenous signals (while acknowledging controversy over this issue). By emphasizing her theory that the tissues drive the nature of the immune response (i.e., the \\"what type\\" rather than the \\"whether\\" of immune response), Matzinger describes a dynamic immune system with complex webs of signalling, rather than an immune system that can be explained by a simple and easily reducible set of molecular signals that initiate response or by a small set of cells (e.g., regulatory T cells) that shut it down. Challenges to Matzinger's theories There is now a growing body of work on regulatory T cells which argues that immune activity is stopped by a special subset of T cells. These ideas challenge several of the key specifics of Matzinger's model. Matzinger argues that these cells are misinterpreted because their functions have not been explored enough. To date (with rare exceptions) these cells have been tested almost exclusively for their ability to suppress highly inflammatory immune response types. The exceptions are illustrative in that they show that regulatory T cells can also act as helper T cells for immune responses in the gut and mucosal tissue. Matzinger argues that their function is to maintain the right kinds of immune responses in the right places, and that they are controlled by signals from the tissues that they protect. A student sitting in an immunology class today will likely hear many phrases coined by Matzinger, such as \\"professional antigen-presenting-cell\\", \\"danger signal\\", or \\"DAMPs\\", but will often hear them in the framework of a self/non- self explanation of immunity. Other immunologists have often adapted parts of Matzinger's ideas without adopting the danger model as a theoretical framework. Indeed, in an era of increasingly detailed molecular work, many immunologists simply avoid constructing an alternative broad theory of immune function. One immunologist believes that the immune system is not a single system at all, and is instead a set of mechanisms \\"cobbled together\\" by evolution. If this is true, no single theory can explain the function of the system as a whole. For both of these reasons, Matzinger has had to defend her larger theory, but also has had to defend the value of grand theory itself. She argues that, without a theoretical framework on which to hang the data, much will be missed. The University of Rhode Island Institute for Immunology and Informatics has named a scholarship for her: the Polly Matzinger Fearless Scientist Scholarship. Dog co-author controversy In one of her first publications, a paper for the Journal of Experimental Medicine, she listed a dog as a coauthor.

December * December 4 ‚Äì A de Havilland Sea Vampire Mk 5 becomes the first jet aircraft to intentionally take off and land from an aircraft carrier, .\\"First Jet Landing.\\" Naval Aviation News, United States Navy, March 1946, p. 6. The first jet aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier was the unconventional composite propeller- jet Ryan FR Fireball, but it was designed to utilize its piston engine during takeoff and landing. On 6 November 1945, the piston engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach and the pilot started the jet engine and landed, thereby performing the first jet-powered carrier landing, albeit unintentionally.Angelucci, Enzo, The American Fighter: The Definitive Guide to American Fighter Aircraft From 1917 to the Present, New York: Orion Books, 1987, p. 298, states that the Sea Vampire's landing was on December 3, 1945. * December 5 ‚Äì Flight 19, a formation of five U.S. Navy TBM Avengers with a total of 14 men aboard, vanishes without trace over the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida.

It finds that in a war with the Soviet Union, the United States will have to seize forward bases from which to launch bombers for nuclear strikes, and that the United States will have to strike first to preempt a Soviet nuclear attack if the Soviet Union develops an atomic arsenal and the United States detects preparations for such an attack.Ross, Steven T., American War Plans 1945‚Äì1950: Strategies For Defeating the Soviet Union, Portland, Oregon: Frank Cass, 1996, , p. 14. * December 21 ‚Äì The first flight by an American turboprop-powered aircraft takes place, when the Consolidated Vultee XP-81, previously flown with a piston engine, flies under turboprop power for the first time.Anonymous, \\"Mystery Ship Answer,\\" Aviation History, January 2011, p. 12.

Mintz. Book One, page 25. Silk Pagoda (2006). ) was the founding monarch of Baekje (Î∞±Ï†ú,ÁôæÊøü), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.Gina Barnes, ¬´State Formation in Korea: Emerging Elites¬ª, p.13, Routledge, 2013, According to the Samguk Sagi (ÏÇºÍµ≠ÏÇ¨Í∏∞, ‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò), he founded the royal family of Baekje.  Background  There are a few theories and legends of Onjo's parentage. One is that he was the third son of King Dongmyeong (Jumong), the founder of the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo.Martin Zatko. ¬´The Rough Guide to Seoul¬ª, p.170, Penguin, 2011, He was the younger brother of Yuri, who became Goguryeo's second king, and younger brother of Biryu who built small state in Michuhol.Y≈èng-jun Ch ªoe, ¬´Land and Life: A Historical Geographical Exploration of Korea¬ª, p.258, Jain Publishing Company, 2005, The second theory is that he is the son of Wutae, his mother's first husband. A third legend says that his older brother Biryu was his mother's son with Wutae but Onjo was born after the second marriage with King Dongmyeong.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23  Founding and expansion of Baekje  Dongmyeong had three sons: Yuri, Biryu, and Onjo. When Yuri, born from Dongmyeong's previous wife in Dongbuyeo, came to Goguryeo and became the heir to the throne, Biryu and Onjo moved south to found their own kingdoms.Jinwung Kim, ¬´A History of Korea: From \\"Land of the Morning Calm\\" to States in Conflict¬ª, p.38, Indiana University Press, 2012, According to the Samguk Yusa, Biryu founded his kingdom in Michuhol (ÎØ∏Ï∂îÌôÄ/ÂΩåÈÑíÂøΩ), but his didn't last long. Biryu's people joined Sipje after Biryu's death and Onjo renamed it to Baekje. After that, the capital city of Baekje was moved southward from Habuk Wiryeseong because the Malgal were located at the North and Nangnang was located to the East. Both capital cities correspond to land within current Seoul. In 13 BC and 8 BC, the Malgal tribes attacked from the north, and both times, Onjo directly led his armies and won victories over the invaders. In 5 BC, Onjo moved the capital city to a more defensible location south of the Han River, renaming it Hanam Wiryeseong, and sent a messenger to the king of the Mahan confederacy telling him of the recent action. At this time, Onjo already had plans of conquering Mahan and Jinhan. By 7 AD, he was already preparing his armies for war and finally attacked during 8 AD. In 8 AD, he secretly took his armies across the border, laying the deceit that he was going to hunt in the forests. Soon, all of Mahan except for two fortresses were conquered.Duk-kyu Jin, ¬´Historical Origins of Korean Politics¬ª, p.87, 2005, The citizens of the last two Mahan fortresses surrendered to Onjo and were given mercy. The Mahan King, however, committed suicide and left a letter for Onjo, asking him to take in Mahan's people with kindness and mercy. Onjo respected the Mahan King's last request and took his people in. Baekje had expanded greatly, and several fortresses were being built every year. Peace lasted for 8 years until 16 AD, when a former Mahan general caused a rebellion. Onjo directly led an army of 5,000 and successfully destroyed the rebellion. Soon after this, the Malgal tribes invaded again during 22 AD, but were once again defeated by Onjo and his army.  Death and succession  Onjo died of natural causes in 28 AD, during the 46th year of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Daru. Onjo laid the foundations for a powerful dynasty that would last for 678 years and 31 rulers. Samguk Sagi \\"The first ancestor of the Baekje [kings] was King Onjo. His father was Chumo, also known as Jumong. From Bukbuyeo he escaped peril and arrived in Jolbon Buyeo. The king of Buyeo was without a male child, and only had three daughters. Upon seeing Jumong, they knew he was not an ordinary man, and made his second daughter [Jumong's] wife. Shortly thereafter, the king of Buyeo died. Jumong succeeded him to the throne and had two children. The oldest was called Biryu, and the next was called Onjo (it is also said that Jumong went to Jolbon and married a woman from Wolgun, and that he had two sons [by her]). Now Jumong, when he was in Bukbuyeo, had one son, who came and became the crown prince. Biryu and Onjo were afraid that they would not be treated well by the one who had become crown prince, and so with Ogan, Mayeo, and some other ten ministers went south with a large number of commoners following them. Then they reached Mt. Hansan and climbed themselves to the summit to look upon the land where they were. Biryu wanted to settle on the beach, and the ten ministers admonished him, saying \\"But the land to the south of the river: in the north it is bordered by the Han river, and the East occupied by high mountain peaks; the south faces marshland, and the west is guarded by the sea. This benefits of this divinely strategic land possess a fate not easily acquired. Why should you not make your capital in this place? However Biryu did not listen, and divided the people, and he reverted to Michuhol and settled there. Onjo made his capital south of the river in Wiryeseong, and the ten ministers assisted him, and the country was called Sipje. This happened in the third year of Hongjia, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Early Han. Biryu was in Michu, where the earth was wet and the rivers salty, and could not dwell in security. Then he returned to look upon Wirye, where the capital and its villages were stable as a three-legged cauldron, and the people dwelt in security. Then he was ashamed and died. His ministers and people all returned to Wirye. Afterwards in the times that came the people were happy and obedient, and the name [of the kingdom] was changed to Baekje. Its lineage and that of Kogyureo are both out of Buyeo, therefore they took the surname Buyeo. One version says, the first ancestor was King Biryu, and that his father was Utae, an illegitimate grandson of the king of Bukbuyeo Hae Buru. His mother was Soseono, a daughter of Yeon Ta-bal (Âª∂ÈôÄÂãÉ), a man of Jolbon. She was married to Utae and gave birth to two sons. The oldest was called Biryu, and the younger called Onjo. Utae died and she was widowed, and settled in Jolbon. After some time Jumong was not well-treated in Buyeo ‚Äì this was during the second year of Jianzhao in early Han [during the reign of Emperor Yuan]. In spring of the second month, he fled south to Jolbon and established the capital of Goguryeo. He married Soseono and she became his consort, and because she, in the creation of his realm, rendered great assistance, Jumong especially favored them and received Biryu and the other as if they were his own sons. When Jumong was in Buyeo he had a child Yuryu by a woman of the Ye clan, and when he came he was made crown prince and the one who would succeed him. Therefore, Biryu asked his younger brother Onjo, saying ‚ÄúOriginally the great king fled the difficulties in Buyeo and escaped here. Our mother's clan poured out the riches of their house to aid in the endeavor [of creating the kingdom], and her toils were many. Now the great king has left this world, and the state has fallen to Yuryu, and if we were to follow along here it would be as depressing as a tumor. Would it not be respectful to our mother's clan if we went to the south and divined the land, and established a separate capital?‚Äù Then he and his brother many factions, and crossed the Pae and Dae rivers, and arrived in Michuhol and settled there. The Pei Shih and Book of Sui both tell that one descendant of Dongmyeong was Gutae who was sincere in his benevolence. When he first established his country in the territory of the former commandery of Daifang, the prefect of the Han territory of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, had his daughter marry [Gutae]. Afterwards [his country] became a powerful state among the Eastern Barbarians. It is unknown which is true [of these accounts].\\" * 18 BC, spring, fifth month. The court of King Dongmyeong was established. * 17 BC, spring, first month. The king asked the myriad ministers, saying, \\"The Mohe assemble on my northern boder, and these people are fierce and have many tricks. We should ready our soldiers, store up grain, and make a plan for our defense. Third month. The king, because the clan leader Euleum possessed both knowledge and bravery, appointed him Marshal Bulwark of the Right, and entrusted him with matters relating to the soldiers and horses. * 16 BC, autumn, ninth month. The Mohe invaded the northern border. The king led powerful soldiers to a quick attack and defeated them handily. The rebels who lived to return were only one or two of every ten. Winter, tenth month. There was lightning, and the peaches and plums blossomed. * 15 BC, spring and summer, there was drought, famine, and plague. Autumn, eighth month. Envoys were sent to Lelang to cultivate favor. * 14 BC, winter, tenth month. The king took a tour of the northern regions to console them. He went hunting and got a supernal deer. * 13 BC, autumn, seventh month, last day of the month (ËæõÊú™Êô¶). There was a solar eclipse. * 11 BC, spring, second month. Three thousand of the Mohe came and surrounded Wiryeseong. The king shut the fort and would not go out. After ten days time the rebels had depleted their stores and returned. The king led a sharp thrust and chased them to the Daebuhyeon, where he fought and overcame them. Over 500 were killed or captured. Autumn, seventh month. The fort of Masuseong was constructed, and a palisade was erected at Mt. Byeongsan. The prefect of Lelang sent a messenger to report: ‚ÄúRecently you inquired about connecting in good favor, with the intention of making us like the same family. But now at the boundary of our territory you have built a fortress and a palisade. Is this some scheme to munch away [our territory] like a silkworm? If there is no change in our former good relations, then destroy the fort and tear down the palisade, and accordingly we will feel no more doubt. However, if you do not approve, then we request a battle to decide winner and loser. Then the king said, ‚ÄúDoing construction at strategic points and protecting the country has been the usual way of things from the past up to now. How dare you change our peaceful relations because of this. You should not have any doubts about this matter! If you presume to lead out a force because of this, then accordingly our tiny country will await you.‚Äù Therefore, peaceful relations with Lelang were lost. * 9 BC, autumn, ninth month.

The Zulus were originally a close-knit ethnic group community that had migrated to the eastern plateau of present-day South Africa; they became a strong tribal nation largely due to the efforts of an ambitious chieftain named Shaka (c. 1787-1828, reigned 1816-1828). A rebellious young man, Shaka was estranged from his father, who was a Zulu chief named Senzangakhona, and became a warrior with the Mthethwa people. The Mthethwa paramount chieftain Dingiswayo helped Shaka become recognized as head of the Zulus after Senzangakhona died in 1816. The two chieftains were close friends, and their warriors fought together against common enemies, such as the Ndwandwe headed by King Zwide. After Dingiswayo was captured and executed by Zwide, the Mthethwa people placed themselves under Shaka and took the Zulu name. Shaka revolutionized traditional ways of fighting by introducing the iklwa, a short stabbing spear, as a weapon and by organizing warriors into disciplined units that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields. In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1817, his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people, who failed to destroy the Zulus in their first encounter. The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1819. By this time the Ndwandwe had adopted Zulu battle tactics and weapons so Shaka wore the invaders down with guerrilla tactics before launching his major attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River.Donald R. Morris, The Washing of the Spears,, Jonathan Cape, 1965. Zulu warriors arrived at Zwide's headquarters near present-day Nongoma before news of the defeat, and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry. Zwide was killed, and most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north establishing Zulu-like (named Ngoni after the ethno-linguistic name \\"Nguni\\") kingdoms in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. This was the final phase of the Mfecane, a catastrophic, bloody civil war and eventual migration of many different tribes in the area, initially (ca. 1802) caused by famine but ultimately as a result of escaping from the Zulus.John Omer-Cooper, The Zulu Aftermath, Longmans, 1966. The Ngoni groups caused their own havoc by using Zulu tactics in war. They established stronger political units in other countries and thus posed a threat to European colonisation, for example during the Maji-Maji Rebellion in German East Africa (1905-7).John Iliffe, Tanganyika under German rule 1905-1912, East African Publishing House, 1969. Shaka was the ultimate victor, and his people still live today throughout Zululand, with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shaka's day.

It ended in 1823 when, with the approval of the crowned heads of Europe, a French army invaded Spain and reinstated the King's absolute power. This invasion is known in France as the \\"Spanish Expedition\\" (exp√©dition d‚ÄôEspagne), and in Spain as \\"The Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis\\". Revolution of Cabezas de San Juan 1820 print depicting the Cortes Generales. Rafael del Riego (1784-1823), the leader of the Cortes Generales, which sought to restore the 1812 constitution. King Ferdinand VII provoked widespread unrest, particularly in the army, by refusing to accept the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. The King sought to reclaim the Spanish colonies in the Americas that had recently revolted successfully, consequently depriving Spain from an important source of revenue. In January 1820, soldiers assembled at C√°diz for an expedition to South America, angry over infrequent pay, bad food and poor quarters, mutinied under the leadership of Colonel Rafael del Riego y Nu√±ez. Pledging fealty to the 1812 Constitution, they seized their commander. Subsequently, the rebel forces moved to nearby San Fernando, where they began preparations to march on the capital, Madrid.  Liberal government  Ferdinand VII of Spain, who abolished the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in 1814. Portrait by Francisco Goya, 1814. Despite the rebels' relative weakness, Ferdinand accepted the constitution on March 9, 1820, granting power to liberal ministers and ushering in the so-called Liberal Triennium (el Trienio Liberal), a period of popular rule. However, political conspiracies of both right and left proliferated in Spain, as was the case across much of the rest of Europe. Liberal revolutionaries stormed the King's palace and seized Ferdinand VII, who was a prisoner of the Cortes in all but name for the next three years and retired to Aranjuez. The elections to the Cortes Generales in 1822 were won by Rafael del Riego. Ferdinand's supporters set themselves up at Urgell, took up arms and put in place an absolutist regency. Ferdinand's supporters, accompanied by the Royal Guard, staged an uprising in Madrid that was subdued by forces supporting the new government and its constitution. Despite the defeat of Ferdinand's supporters at Madrid, civil war erupted in the regions of Castile, Toledo, and Andalusia. Three years of liberal rule (the Trienio Liberal) followed. The Progresista government reorganized Spain into 52 provinces, and it intended to reduce the regional autonomy that had been a hallmark of Spanish bureaucracy since Habsburg rule in the 16th and 17th centuries. Opposition of the affected regions, in particular, Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia, shared in the king's antipathy for the liberal government. The anticlerical policies of the Progresista government led to friction with the Roman Catholic Church, and attempts to bring about industrialisation alienated old trade guilds. The Spanish Inquisition, which had been abolished by both Joseph Bonaparte and the Cortes of C√°diz during the French occupation, was ended again by the government, which led to accusations of it being nothing more than afrancesados (francophiles), who, only six years earlier, had been forced out of the country. More radical liberals attempted to revolt against the entire idea of a monarchy, regardless of how little power it had. In 1821, they were suppressed, but the incident served to illustrate the frail coalition that bound the government together. The election of a radical liberal government in 1823 further destabilized Spain. The army, whose liberal leanings had brought the government to power, began to waver when the Spanish economy failed to improve, and in 1823, a mutiny in Madrid had to be suppressed. The Jesuits, who had been banned by Charles III in the 18th century, only to be rehabilitated by Ferdinand VII after his restoration, were banned again by the government. For the duration of liberal rule, Ferdinand (still technically head of state) lived under virtual house arrest in Madrid. The Congress of Vienna, ending the Napoleonic Wars, had inaugurated the \\"Congress system\\" as an instrument of international stability in Europe. Rebuffed by the \\"Holy Alliance\\" of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in his request for help against the liberal revolutionaries in 1820, by 1822, the \\"Concert of Europe\\" was so concerned by Spain's liberal government and its surprising hardiness that it was prepared to intervene on Ferdinand's behalf. In 1822, the Congress of Verona authorized France to intervene. Louis XVIII of France was only too happy to put an end to Spain's liberal experiment, and a massive army, the 100,000 Sons of Saint Louis, was dispatched across the Pyrenees in April 1823. The Spanish army, fraught by internal divisions, offered little resistance to the well organised French force, who seized Madrid and reinstalled Ferdinand as absolute monarch. The liberals' hopes for a new Spanish War of Independence were dashed. Regarding the policy for America in the absolutist period, the new government changed political repression into negotiation. Sending troops was replaced by commissioners to attract pro-independence leaders, who were invited to submit to royal authority in exchange for recognition by Spain. With that in mind, the government announced a ceasefire for negotiations with the rebels until the 1812 Constitution, which ironically, had been superseded by Ferdinand's actions, was accepted. According to the ceasefire, Spain would end the persecution and would issue a blanket amnesty for the insurgents; otherwise, the war would continue. The 11 commissioners failed since the patriots demanded recognition of their independence from Spain. Luis Mar√≠a de Borb√≥n y Vallabriga, 14th Count of Chinch√≥n (1777-1823), Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain, a liberal churchman who abolished the Spanish Inquisition in 1820. (It would be re-established in 1823.) French intervention In 1822, Ferdinand VII applied the terms of the Congress of Vienna, lobbied for the assistance of the other absolute monarchs of Europe, in the process joining the Holy Alliance formed by Russia, Prussia, Austria and France to restore absolutism. In France, the ultra-royalists pressured Louis XVIII to intervene. To temper their counter-revolutionary ardour, the Duc de Richelieu deployed troops along the Pyrenees Mountains along the France-Spain border, charging them with halting the spread of Spanish liberalism and the \\"yellow fever\\" from encroaching into France. In September 1822, the cordon sanitaire became an observation corps and then very quickly transformed itself into a military expedition. The Holy Alliance (Russia, Austria and Prussia) refused Ferdinand's request for help, but the Quintuple Alliance (United Kingdom, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria), at the Congress of Verona in October 1822, gave France a mandate to intervene and restore the Spanish monarchy. On 22 January 1823, a secret treaty was signed at the congress of Verona, allowing France to invade Spain to restore Ferdinand VII as an absolute monarch. With that agreement from the Holy Alliance, on 28 January 1823, Louis XVIII announced that \\"a hundred thousand Frenchmen are ready to march, invoking the name of Saint Louis, to safeguard the throne of Spain for a grandson of Henry IV of France\\".

It is the coldest permanently inhabited settlement on Earth. Etymology It is named after the Oymyakon River, whose name reportedly comes from the Even word kheium, meaning \\"unfrozen patch of water; place where fish spend the winter\\". However, another source states that the Even word heyum (h—çj—É–º) (kheium may be a misspelling) means \\"frozen lake\\". Geography Oymyakon has two main valleys beside it. These valleys trap wind inside the town and create the colder climate. The temperatures here are extremely cold throughout the year, and it snows frequently. Schools are closed if it is colder than . History During World War II, an airfield was built in the district of Aeroport, for the Alaska- Siberian (ALSIB) air route, used to ferry American Lend-Lease aircraft to the Eastern Front. Over the last few decades, the population of Oymyakon has shrunk significantly. The village had a peak population of roughly 2,500 inhabitants, but that number has decreased to fewer than 900 in 2018. Climate With an extreme subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfd/Dwd), Oymyakon is known as one of the places considered the Northern Pole of Cold, the other being the town of Verkhoyansk, located away by air. The ground is permanently frozen (continuous permafrost). There is a monument built around the town square commemorating a reading in January 1924 of . This was shown on the Australian program 60 Minutes in a 2012 documentary. On 6 February 1933, a temperature of was recorded at Oymyakon's weather station. This was the coldest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Only Antarctica has recorded lower official temperatures (the lowest being , recorded at Vostok Station on 21 July 1983). The weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor. The station is at above sea level and the surrounding mountains at , causing cold air to pool in the valley: in fact, recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area increase with altitude by as much as . Some years the temperature drops below in late September and may remain below freezing until mid-April.

Reasons Tensions between the two empires had been rising due to the Ottoman Empire's harboring of rebellious tribesmen from Iranian Azerbaijan. The issues concerning the Kurdish borderland tribes such as the Haydaran and Sipki tribes had complicated the relations between the two empires. For instance, Iran launched a military campaign against Dervish Pasha, the muhafiz of Van, when he refused to return the Sipki Kurdish who took refuge and settled in Ercish. The Ottoman-Persian War that began in 1821 was also part of a series of wars between the two empires, which was attributed to the influences of foreign powers, particularly Great Britain and the Russian Empire. The Persians and the Ottomans were within their respective spheres of influence and were drawn to their rivalry. The Russian Empire was attempting to put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which was then at war with the Greeks. War Crown Prince Abbas Mirza of Persia, at the instigation of the Russian Empire, invaded Western Armenia and the areas surrounding Iranian Azerbaijan. The governor of Baghdad's invasion of Persia is defeated by Mohammed Ali Mirza who then besieges Baghdad, his untimely death ends the siege. Meanwhile, Abbas Mirza marched into eastern Anatolia with 30,000 troops and met an Ottoman army of 50,000 at the Battle of Erzurum. Abbas Mirza scored a crushing defeat over the Ottomans despite being severely outnumbered and his army suffering from a cholera epidemic. Result Peace was not concluded until the Treaty of Erzurum two years later; both sides recognized the previous borders established by the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639, with no territorial changes. Also included in the treaty, was the guaranteed access for Persian pilgrims to holy sites within the Ottoman Empire.

These belong to the larger category of Gallo-Romance languages, which also include the historical languages of east-central France and western Switzerland (Arpitania), southern France (Occitania), portions of northern Italy, and the Val d'Aran in Spain. Linguists divide the Romance languages of France, and especially of Medieval France, into three geographical subgroups: the first two are Langues d'o√Øl and occitan, both named after their words for 'yes' (o√Øl and √≤c, respectively), and the third is Franco-Proven√ßal (Arpitan). Terminology Langue d'o√Øl (in the singular), O√Øl dialects and O√Øl languages (in the plural) designate the ancient northern Gallo-Romance languages as well as their modern-day descendants. They share many linguistic features, a prominent one being the word o√Øl for yes. (Oc was and still is the southern word for yes, hence the langue d'oc or Occitan languages). The most widely spoken modern O√Øl language is French (o√Øl was pronounced or , which has become , in modern French oui). There are three uses of the term o√Øl: #Langue d'o√Øl #O√Øl dialects #O√Øl languages Langue d'o√Øl In the singular, Langue d'o√Øl refers to the mutually intelligible linguistic variants of lingua romana spoken since the 9th century in northern France and southern Belgium (Wallonia), since the 10th century in the Channel Islands, and between the 11th and 14th centuries in England (the Anglo-Norman language). Langue d'o√Øl, the term itself, has been used in the singular since the 12th century to denote this ancient linguistic grouping as a whole. With these qualifiers, langue d'o√Øl sometimes is used to mean the same as Old French (see History below). O√Øl dialects In the plural, O√Øl dialects refer to the varieties of the ancient langue d'o√Øl. O√Øl languages O√Øl languages are those modern-day descendants that evolved separately from the varieties of the ancient langue d'o√Øl. Consequently, langues d'o√Øl today may apply either: to all the modern-day languages of this family except the French language; or to this family including French. \\"O√Øl dialects\\" or \\"French dialects\\" are also used to refer to the O√Øl languages except French‚Äîas some extant O√Øl languages are very close to modern French. Because the term dialect is sometimes considered pejorative, the trend today among French linguists is to refer to these languages as langues d'o√Øl rather than dialects. Varieties Five zones of partially mutually intelligible O√Øl dialects have been proposed:Manuel pratique de philologie romane, Pierre Bec, 1970‚Äì1971 The area of langues d'o√Øl can be seen in shades of green and yellow Frankish zone (zone francique) *Picard *Walloon *Lorrain *Northern Norman (spoken north of the Joret line): including Anglo-Norman; Dg√®rn√©siais (spoken in Guernsey), J√®rriais (spoken in Jersey), Auregnais (spoken in Alderney), Sercquiais (spoken in Sark) *Eastern Champenois Francien zone (zone francienne) *Standard French Non-standard varieties: *Orl√©anais *Tourangeau, not to be confused with the French language in Touraine *Berrichon *Bourbonnais *Western Champenois (or Eastern Francien) Burgundian zone (zone burgonde) *Bourguignon *Franc-Comtois Armorican zone (zone armoricaine) *Eastern Armorican: Angevin; Mayennais; Manceau (Sarthois and Percheron); Southern Norman (spoken south of the Joret line) *Western Armorican: Gallo Gallo has a stronger Celtic substrate from Breton. Gallo originated from the o√Øl speech of people from eastern and northern regions: Anjou; Maine (Mayenne and Sarthe); and Normandy; who were in contact with Breton speakers in Upper Brittany.

Each of the O√Øl languages has developed in its own way from the common ancestor, and division of the development into periods varies according to the individual histories. Modern linguistics uses the following terms: *9th‚Äì13th centuries Old French Old Norman etc. *French Middle French for the period 14th‚Äì15th centuries 16th century: fran√ßais renaissance (Renaissance French) 17th to 18th century: fran√ßais classique (Classical French) History Romana lingua In the 9th century, romana lingua (the term used in the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842) was the first of the Romance languages to be recognized by its speakers as a distinct language, probably because it was the most different from Latin compared with the other Romance languages (see History of the French language). Many of the developments that we now consider typical of Walloon appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon \\"had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the thirteenth century\\". In any case, linguistic texts from the time do not mention the language, even though they mention others in the O√Øl family, such as Picard and Lorrain. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language \\"Roman\\" when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that we find the first occurrence of the word \\"Walloon\\" in the same linguistic sense that we use it today. Langue d'o√Øl By late- or post-Roman times Vulgar Latin within France had developed two distinctive terms for signifying assent (yes): hoc ille (\\"this (is) it\\") and hoc (\\"this\\"), which became o√Øl and oc, respectively. Subsequent development changed \\"o√Øl\\" into \\"oui\\", as in modern French. The term langue d'o√Øl itself was first used in the 12th century, referring to the Old French linguistic grouping noted above. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante mentioned the yes distinctions in his De vulgari eloquentia. He wrote in Medieval Latin: \\"nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil\\" (\\"some say 'oc', others say 'si', others say 'o√Øl'\\")‚Äîthereby distinguishing at least three classes of Romance languages: oc languages (in southern France); si languages (in Italy and Iberia) and o√Øl languages (in northern France). Other Romance languages derive their word for \\"yes\\" from the classical Latin sic, \\"thus\\", such as the Italian s√¨, Spanish and Catalan s√≠, Portuguese sim, and even French si (used when contradicting another's negative assertion). Sardinian is an exception in that its word for \\"yes\\", eja, is from neither origin. Similarly Romanian uses da for \\"yes\\", which is of Slavic origin. However, neither lingua romana nor langue d'o√Øl referred, at their respective time, to a single homogeneous language but to mutually intelligible linguistic varieties. In those times, spoken languages in Western Europe were not codified (except Latin and Medieval Latin), the region's population was considerably lower than today, and population centers were more isolated from each other. As a result, mutually intelligible linguistic varieties were referred to as one language. French (Old French/Standardized O√Øl) or lingua Gallicana In the 13th century these varieties were recognized and referred to as dialects (\\"idioms\\") of a single language, the langue d'o√Øl. However, since the previous centuries a common literary and juridical \\"interdialectary\\" langue d'o√Øl had emerged, a kind of koin√©. In the late 13th century this common langue d'o√Øl was named French (fran√ßois in French, lingua gallica or gallicana in Medieval Latin). Both aspects of \\"dialects of a same language\\" and \\"French as the common langue d'o√Øl\\" appear in a text of Roger Bacon, Opus maius, who wrote in Medieval Latin but translated thus: \\"Indeed, idioms of a same language vary amongst people, as it occurs in the French language which varies in an idiomatic manner amongst the French, Picards, Normans and Burgundians. And terms right to the Picards horrify the Burgundians as much as their closer neighbours the French\\". It is from this period though that definitions of individual O√Øl languages are first found. The Picard language is first referred to by name as \\"langage pikart\\" in 1283 in the Livre Roisin. The author of the Vie du bienheureux Thomas H√©lye de Biville refers to the Norman character of his writing. The Sermons poitevins of around 1250 show the Poitevin language developing as it straddled the line between o√Øl and oc. As a result, in modern times the term langue d'o√Øl also refers to that Old French which was not as yet named French but was already‚Äîbefore the late 13th century‚Äîused as a literary and juridical interdialectary language. The term Francien is a linguistic neologism coined in the 19th century to name the hypothetical variant of Old French allegedly spoken by the late 14th century in the ancient province of Pays de France‚Äîthe then Paris region later called √éle-de-France. This Francien, it is claimed, became the Medieval French language. Current linguistic thinking mostly discounts the Francien theory, although it is still often quoted in popular textbooks. The term francien was never used by those people supposed to have spoken the variant; but today the term could be used to designate that specific 10th-and-11th centuries variant of langue d'o√Øl spoken in the Paris region; both variants contributed to the koine, as both were called French at that time. Rise of French (Standardized O√Øl) versus other O√Øl languages For political reasons it was in Paris and √éle-de-France that this koin√© developed from a written language into a spoken language. Already in the 12th century Conon de B√©thune reported about the French court who blamed him for using words of Artois. By the late 13th century the written koin√© had begun to turn into a spoken and written standard language, and was named French. Since then French started to be imposed on the other O√Øl dialects as well as on the territories of langue d'oc. However, the O√Øl dialects and langue d'oc continued contributing to the lexis of French. In 1539 the French language was imposed by the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter√™ts. It required Latin be replaced in judgements and official acts and deeds. The local O√Øl languages had always been the language spoken in justice courts. The Ordinance of Villers-Cotter√™ts was not intended to make French a national language, merely a chancery language for law and administration. Although there were competing literary standards among the O√Øl languages in the mediaeval period, the centralisation of the French kingdom and its influence even outside its formal borders sent most of the O√Øl languages into comparative obscurity for several centuries. The development of literature in this new language encouraged writers to use French rather than their own regional languages. This led to the decline of vernacular literature. It was the French Revolution which imposed French on the people as the official language in all the territory. As the influence of French (and in the Channel Islands, English) spread among sectors of provincial populations, cultural movements arose to study and standardise the vernacular languages. From the 18th century and into the 20th century, societies were founded (such as the \\"Soci√©t√© li√©goise de Litt√©rature wallonne\\" in 1856), dictionaries (such as George M√©tivier's Dictionnaire franco-normand of 1870) were published, groups were formed and literary movements developed to support and promote the O√Øl languages faced with competition. The Third Republic sought to modernise France and established primary education where the only language recognised was French. Regional languages were discouraged, and the use of French was seen as aspirational, accelerating their decline. This was also generally the case in areas where O√Øl languages were spoken. French is now the best-known of the O√Øl languages. Literature The O√Øl languages have literary traditions, as for example seen in this 19th-century collection of J√®rriais short stories Besides the influence of French literature, small-scale literature has survived in the other O√Øl languages. Theatrical writing is most notable in Picard (which maintains a genre of vernacular marionette theatre), Poitevin and Saintongeais. Oral performance (story-telling) is a feature of Gallo, for example, while Norman and Walloon literature, especially from the early 19th century tend to focus on written texts and poetry (see, for example, Wace and J√®rriais literature). As the vernacular O√Øl languages were displaced from towns, they have generally survived to a greater extent in rural areas - hence a preponderance of literature relating to rural and peasant themes. The particular circumstances of the self-governing Channel Islands developed a lively strain of political comment, and the early industrialisation in Picardy led to survival of Picard in the mines and workshops of the regions. The mining poets of Picardy may be compared with the tradition of rhyming Weaver Poets of Ulster Scots in a comparable industrial milieu. There are some regional magazines, such as Ch'lanchron (Picard), Le Viquet (Norman), Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine (J√®rriais), and El Bourdon (Walloon), which are published either wholly in the respective O√Øl language or bilingually with French. These provide a platform for literary writing. Status Bilingual street sign for market square in French and Walloon Apart from French, an official language in many countries (see list), the O√Øl languages have enjoyed little status in recent times. Currently Walloon, Lorrain (under the local name of Gaumais), and Champenois have the status of regional languages of Wallonia. The Norman languages of the Channel Islands enjoy a certain status under the governments of their Bailiwicks and within the regional and lesser-used language framework of the British-Irish Council. The Anglo-Norman language, a variant of Norman once the official language of England, today holds mostly a place of ceremonial honour in the United Kingdom (now referred to as Law French). The French government recognises the O√Øl languages as languages of France, but the Constitutional Council of France barred ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.Constitutional Council Decision 99-412 DC, European Charter for regional or minority languages Influence The langues d'o√Øl were more or less influenced by the native languages of the conquering Germanic tribes, notably the Franks. This was apparent not so much in the vocabulary (which remained overwhelmingly of Latin origin) as in the phonology and syntax; the invading Franks, Burgundians and Normans became the rulers and their accents were imposed as standard on the rest of the population. This accounts in large part for the relative distinctiveness of French compared to other Romance languages.Signage in Gallo in the metro of Rennes The English language was heavily influenced by contact with Norman following the Norman Conquest and much of the adopted vocabulary shows typically Norman features. Portuguese was heavily influenced by more than a millennium of perennial contact with several dialects of both O√Øl and Occitan language groups, in lexicon (up to 15‚Äì20% in some estimates, at least 5000 word roots), phonology and orthography. Exhibition at the Museum of the Portuguese Language shows the French influence in our language Contacts between French and Portuguese or the first's influences on the second The influence of loanwords in the Portuguese language: a process of globalization, ideology and communication The influence of Occitan was, nevertheless, the most marked, through the status Proven√ßal in particular achieved in southwestern Europe around the troubadour apex in the Middle Ages, when Galician-Portuguese lyric was developed. Aside the direct influence of Proven√ßal literature, the presence of languages from modern-day France in the Galician-Portuguese area was also strong due to the rule of the House of Burgundy, the establishment of the Orders of Cluny and Cister, the many sections of the Way of St. James pilgrimage route that come from elsewhere in Europe out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the settlement in Iberia of people from the other side of the Pyrenees, arriving during and after the Reconquista.A l√≠ngua que falamos: Portugu√™s, hist√≥ria, varia√ß√£o e discurso Luiz Ant√¥nio da Silva, 2005.Occitejano: Sobre a origem occitana do subdialeto do Alto Tejo portugu√™s Paulo Feytor Pinto, 2012. The anti- Portuguese factor of Brazilian nationalism in the 19th century led to an increased use of the French language in detriment of Portuguese, as France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress., p. 19 The learning of French has historically been important and strong among the Lusophone elites, and for a great span of time it was also the foreign language of choice among the middle class of both Portugal and Brazil, only surpassed in the globalised postmodernity by English.

The city is encircled by mountains along the Tigris river. Duhok has a growing tourist industry. Its population has increased rapidly since the 1990s, as the rural population moved to the cities after villages were destroyed by the Iraqi Army during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The University of Duhok, founded in 1992, is a renowned center for teaching and research. The city of Duhok is populated by Kurds and Assyrians. Duhok Governorate contains many mosques and historical shrines and tombs built during the Ayyubid period and historical sites from the Guti Medes, and still exist in the present, including the Great Duhok Mosque, the Azadi Mosque, the Saladin Salah Din Al - Ayoubi Mosque and the Great Mosque in Akre. It also has historical churches such as the Mar Odisho Church in the village of Dooreh (located in the Amadiya District), the Church of Mart Shmoni and the Church of Sultana Mahdokht (established in 325 AD) in the village of Araden. Located in Sheikhan district is the Yazidi Lalish Temple.  History  Throughout history to the present time, Duhok has acquired a strategic position historically and geographically. Between the 25th and 22nd century BC, it changed hands between the Akkadians, Sumerians, Assyrians, Amorites, Gutians, Hurrians and Hattians, before becoming an integral part of Assyria from the mid 21st century BC until the dissolution of Assyria (then known as Athura/Assuristan) in the mid 7th century AD after the Arab Islamic Conquest. During the Assyrian period the town was named Nohadra (and also Bit Nuhadra or Naarda). During Parthian-Sassanid rule in Assyria (c. 160 BC to 250 AD) Beth Nuhadra gained semi-independence as one of a patchwork of Neo-Assyrian kingdoms in Assyria, which also included Adiabene, Osroene, Assur and Beth Garmai. During the Christian era it became an eparchy within the Assyrian Church of the East metropolitanate of ·∏§adyab (Erbil).NAARDA, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) The city became prominent again in 1236, when Hasan Beg Saifadin joined the Kurdish Badinan principality. In 1842, the principality was dissolved by the Ottomans and the region administered from the city of Mosul.Duhok by night In 1898 there were eleven small private schools in the city, including two Assyrian and two Jewish schools. In 1920 there were, in all of Iraq, only five primary schools that were accessible for girls, and one of them was in Duhok. In September 2005, Duhok held a cultural festival for the first time to which Kurdish writers from many countries were invited. Duhok has been a center for many refugees since 2014 as the Kurdistan Regional Government was the only part of Iraq to take in both Iraqi and Syrian refugees. Demographics Multiple travelers commented on its ethnic composition in the 19th and early 20th century. The city's population is 340,000. It consists mostly of Kurds with a significant Assyrian community. The Assyrians of Duhok boast one of the largest churches in the region, the Mar Marsi Cathedral, and is the center of an eparchy. Tens of thousands of Yazidi and Assyrian Christian internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in the city as well due to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) expansion in Iraq in 2014 and the subsequent Fall of Mosul and the Nineveh Plains region after two more months of fighting, in addition to the Sinjar massacre in which 5,000 Yezidis were massacred during the genocide of Yazidis by ISIL. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM-Iraq), as of June 2019, Duhok Governorate hosted 326,106 IDPs across 169 different locations.  Educational institutions  Educational institutions in Duhok include: * University of Duhok * Duhok Polytechnic University * Nawroz University * Duhok Private Technical Institute * University of Cihan * Sardam International School * Da Vinci World School * Da Vinci institute Sport Duhok Stadium The city is home to several sporting clubs including Duhok SC, a professional football club that plays in the Iraqi Premier League. Another football team from the city is Zeravani SC, which plays in the Kurdish Premier League. Duhok also has a range of other sport clubs, including the Duhok Basketball Club. Duhok SC Basketball competes in the Iraqi Division I Basketball League and came third in FIBA Asia Champions Cup in 2012. Duhok SC won the Iraqi Premier League championship for the first time in the 2009/2010 season, beating Al- Talaba SC 1‚Äì0.

It is the sister school of the City of London School and the City of London School for Girls, which are both independent single-sex schools located within the City of London itself. All three schools receive funding from the City's Cash. The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The Good Schools Guide described the school as \\"A traditional academic and sporty school in a stunning setting with impressive facilities but not at all elitist ‚Äì in fact quite the opposite.\\"  History  The school was founded in 1854 by the Corporation of London, and was originally located in Brixton, London to educate orphans of the freemen of the City. It is still possible for such orphan children to be educated as ‚ÄúFoundationers‚Äù at the school with the costs of their education borne by the City of London Corporation. The tradition of freemen goes back many centuries, when the citizens of towns and cities would be granted valuable rights to trade, and other privileges conceded by royal charters. The system was also shared by livery companies, associations of craftsmen developed to control the admission to the trade by apprenticeship, and founded on the triple bases of commerce, benevolence and religion. From medieval times the City of London worked together with livery companies to control acceptance of freemen. However, in the nineteenth century it became possible for people to apply for the Freedom of the City of London without belonging to a livery company, and this created the need for an organisation to which all freemen could belong to pursue the interests of the City. This led to the foundation, in 1908, of the Guild of Freemen of the City of London, to bring together free men and women, for the purposes of charity, benevolence, education and social interaction. City of London Freemen's School is set in of Ashtead Park in the heart of Surrey, having moved from London to Ashtead in 1926 from Brixton. The school celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2004 with a year long series of events. The Anniversary started with a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral attended by the whole school (now numbering over 800) and culminated in the school being represented with a float in the annual Lord Mayor‚Äôs Show. Houses The School has three Houses: Gresham, Hale and Whittington (colours green, red and blue respectively). These are named after the influential Londoners and school benefactors Sir Thomas Gresham, Warren Stormes Hale and Richard Whittington. Pupils are assigned to a House as they start at the school, which they stay in throughout their school career. Since it is now predominantly a day school and there are limited numbers of boarders, Houses do not have the same connotations as in similar independent schools, though are still important for Inter-House Competitions and weekly House Assemblies. If a sibling of a City of London Freemen's pupil were to join the school, he or she would be assigned to the same house.  Sports  The school has a very strong sporting reputation and the impressive grounds include rugby, hockey and cricket pitches, as well as two all-weather pitches, both of which are floodlit, with a variety of uses. There are also tennis courts, cricket nets and athletics facilities. The school has a large, modern, multi-purpose sports hall complex that incorporates a multi-activity fitness suite. Sporting fixtures are played in a wide range of sports against other independent schools such as Sevenoaks School, The King's School, Canterbury, St Mary's Ascot, King's College School and The Oratory School. The School tends to achieve superior results at the Public Schools Fencing Championship.  Boarding houses  There are girls‚Äô and boys‚Äô boarding houses. The girls' boarding house was in Main House, a Georgian mansion built in 1790 by Sir Thomas Wyatt. The Main House remains the focal point of the school. The boys' boarding house was located in Philp House, a building located by the bus-stop. The boarding houses are now located in the new boarding house located next to the new music school and the junior school.  Old Freemen's  Once pupils leave school they become part of Old Freemen‚Äôs Association, which includes the Old Freemen's Rugby Football Club, Cricket Club and Hockey Club. There is also a Guild of Scholars of the City of London, which was formed to encourage former pupils from the three ‚ÄòCity Schools‚Äô to develop links with The City of London. Membership is open to all former pupils, staff, and retired staff, who must have obtained their ‚ÄòFreedom of the City of London‚Äô but there is no subscription. In addition any pupil aged 14‚Äì17, who is still at school may apply to become an Apprentice to a Freeman of the City at little cost and minimal commitment. They will then be entitled, at the age of 21, to apply for the Freedom of the City and membership of the Guild of Scholars. This Apprenticeship will be of particular interest to those who wish to pursue a career in the City. Annual events are organised to promote fellowship among the members, including an annual dinner and visits to places of interest. Drama and music The school organises a number of performances each year, and these have included Oliver!, Oklahoma!, Cabaret, Les Mis√©rables and Into the Woods. The latest addition to this list is Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, which was performed in December 2009. The senior school musical for 2011 was \\"Evita\\".  Catering  The catering is currently provided by the contract caterers Sodexo. Catering is provided for the pupils and staff through a number of outlets. The main dining hall, located in the main house, is the focal point of catering operations, with breakfast, lunch and dinner being served from here. The dining hall is also employed for a number of private dinners, both internal and external, throughout the year. The main house may also be seen as the hub of operations as it houses the catering facilities offices. The Tuck Shop, now located in a red van, offers a choice of hot and cold meals and snacks to all those who choose not to subscribe to school lunches. Both the Junior School and the Senior School (Haywood Centre) also house common rooms which come equipped with tea and fresh coffee making facilities.

A piconet consists of two or more devices occupying the same physical channel (synchronized to a common clock and hopping sequence). It allows one master device to interconnect with up to seven active slave devices. Up to 255 further slave devices can be inactive, or parked, which the master device can bring into active status at any time, but an active station must go into parked first. Some examples of piconets include a cell phone connected to a computer, a laptop and a Bluetooth-enabled digital camera, or several PDAs that are connected to each other. Overview A group of devices are connected via Bluetooth technology in an ad hoc fashion. A piconet starts with two connected devices, and may grow to eight connected devices. Bluetooth communication always designates one of the Bluetooth devices as a main controlling unit or master unit. Other devices that follow the master unit are slave units. This allows the Bluetooth system to be non-contention based (no collisions). This means that after a Bluetooth device has been added to the piconet, each device is assigned a specific time period to transmit and they do not collide or overlap with other units operating within the same piconet. Piconet range varies according to the class of the Bluetooth device. Data transfer rates vary between about 200 and 2100 kilobits per second. Because the Bluetooth system hops over 79 channels, the probability of interfering with another Bluetooth system is less than 1.5%. This allows several Bluetooth piconets to operate in the same area at the same time with minimal interference.

The terms \\"scatternet\\" and \\"piconet\\" are typically applied to Bluetooth wireless technology. Description A piconet is the type of connection that is formed between two or more Bluetooth-enabled devices such as modern cell phones. Bluetooth enabled devices are \\"peer units\\" in that they are able to act as either master or slave. However, when a piconet is formed between two or more devices, one device takes the role of the 'master', and all other devices assume a 'slave' role for synchronization reasons. Piconets have a 7 member address space (3 bits, with zero reserved for broadcast), which limits the maximum size of a piconet to 8 devices, i.e. 1 master and 7 slaves. A scatternet is a number of interconnected piconets that supports communication between more than 8 devices. Scatternets can be formed when a member of one piconet (either the master or one of the slaves) elects to participate as a slave in a second, separate piconet. The device participating in both piconets can relay data between members of both ad hoc networks. However, the basic Bluetooth protocol does not support this relaying - the host software of each device would need to manage it. Using this approach, it is possible to join together numerous piconets into a large scatternet, and to expand the physical size of the network beyond Bluetooth's limited range. Currently there are very few actual implementations of scatternets due to limitations of Bluetooth and the MAC address protocol. However, there is a growing body of research being conducted with the goal of developing algorithms to efficiently form scatternets. Future applications Scatternets have the potential to bring the interconnectivity of the Internet to the physical world through wireless devices. A number of companies have attempted to launch social networking and dating services that leverage early scatternet implementations (see Bluedating). Scatternets can also be used to enable ad hoc communication and interaction between autonomous robots and other devices. Research Several papers exist that propose algorithms for scatternet formation,F. Cuomo, T. Melodia, I. F. Akyildiz, \\"Distributed self-healing and variable topology optimization algorithms for QoS provisioning in scatternets,\\" IEEE JSAC Special Issue on Quality of Service Delivery in Variable Topology Networks, Sept. 2004, Vol. 22, Issue 7, pp. 1220-1236. and many different approaches have been simulated in both academic and corporate R&D; environments. Some early experiments with large scatternets can be found at ETH ZurichETH Zurich in the BTnode projectBTnode project. In 2008, a student at University College Cork, Ireland, developed a scatternet-based application in the Java programming language, using the JSR-82 library.B. Donegan, D. Doolan, S. Tabirca \\"Mobile Message Passing using a Scatternet Framework\\", International Journal of Communications & Control, May 2007, Vol. 3, Issue 1, pp. 51-60, http://www.journal.univagora.ro/?page=article_details&id;=106 This application's main purpose is to facilitate parallel computations over Bluetooth scatternets, using an MPI-style message passing paradigm. Although it only runs on the emulation environment provided by Sun's Wireless Toolkit, it is capable of creating a scatternet of up to 15 devices and routing a message through the network. In 2006, a student at the University of Technology, Iraq, developed an on-demand peer-to-peer scatternet routing algorithm and protocol,I.

This application was tested successfully on several real life Java-enabled mobile phones, and is capable of building large scatternets, but its only practical when routes are less than 3 nodes long due to Bluetooth's speed.

It is the birthplace of Tamil poets Mahakavi Bharathiar and Umaru Pulavar. Muthuswami Dikshitar, one of the triad of Carnatic music was patronized in his final years by the ruler of Ettayapuram.Write-up on patronage of Muthuswami Dikshitar by Ettappan Weaver with a handloom in Ettayapuram History Ettayapuram was originally Ilasanadu, which was ruled by the Pandya Kings. After the Pandyas, Ettappan was appointed as palayakarar by Madurai Nayak dynasty under the supervision of Vijayanagara empire. After 150 years of rule by the descendants of Ettappan, Ilasanadu became Ettayapuram in 1565.Ettayapuram was formed in 1565 . Ettayapuram estate Raja Jagavira Rama Kumara Ettappa Nayaker Aiyan of Ettaiyapuram with his Diwan Ranganadha Chettiar Ettaiyapuram estate was a zamindari estate situated in the Ettayapuram taluk of the erstwhile Tuticorin district. The estate covered an area of and 374 villages and in 1901, had a population of 154,000. The headquarters of the estate was the town of Ettaiyapuram. The estate was ruled by the Telugu Nayak dynasty whose ancestors hailed from Chandragiri in present-day Andhra Pradesh. During an invasion of Alauddin Khalji, Kumaramuttu Nayak the founder of the dynasty migrated from Chandragiri to Tirunelveli where he was granted the region comprising the later-established Ettaiyapuram estate. The town of Ettaiyapuram was established in 1567.

It was in Kovilpatti constituency till 2006 general Elections and Now it comes under the Vilathikulam constituency of Tamil Nadu legislative assembly from 2011 Elections. Demographics India census, Ettayapuram had a population of 12,800. Males constitute 48% of the population and females 52%. Ettayapuram has an average literacy rate of 69%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 61%. In Ettayapuram, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economy People of Ettayapuram are primarily engaged in weaving, making matches and agriculture. Traditional weavers weave cotton yarn using handlooms. Small companies operate power looms and allied trades of preparing the thread for weaving and dyeing. The other major industry is the manufacture of match boxes, which includes manufacturing small boxes that contain matchsticks, preparing match sticks and loading them on to the matchboxes. The area of land under cultivation has fallen due to failing rains and relatively poor soil fertility. The soil type is black soil, which supports crops like kezhvaragu, cumbu, cholam, cotton and sunflower. Kanni breed of goats, a drought-resistant variety reared for its meat, is most common in this region. Transport Ettayapuram is connected to Madurai, Thoothukkudi, Rameshwaram and Tirunelveli by road.

Ettappan, after whom the place was named carried a negative impression as he gave away the information regarding Veerapandiya Kattabomman's whereabouts to the British, which eventually led to his arrest and hanging. Ettappan became a metaphor for a traitor. His namesake descendants were involved in welfare activities including arrangements for water supply through huge tanks and patronized poets and musicians including Bharathy and Muthuswami Dikshitar.

Henry Spencer Ashbee is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Book collection Ashbee's book plate, designed by Paul Avril He was an avid book collector, with perhaps the world's most extensive collections of Miguel de Cervantes and erotica. Influenced by a friendship with the Belgian diplomat Joseph Octave Delepierre, his erotica collecting proceeded with purchases in Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. Ashbee was a part of a loose intellectual fraternity of English gentlemen who discussed sexual matters with a freedom that was at odds with Victorian mores; this fraternity included Richard Francis Burton, Richard Monckton Milnes, Algernon Charles Swinburne, and others. He also amassed thousands of volumes of pornography in several languages. He wrote on sex under the pseudonyms \\"Fraxinus\\" (Ash) and \\"Apis\\" (Bee), and sometimes combined them as \\"Pisanus Fraxi\\". Ashbee's will left his entire collection to the British Museum, with the condition that the erotic works had to be accepted along with the conventional items. Because the trustees wanted the materials related to Cervantes, they decided to accept the bequest. The trustees were allowed to destroy any of the books if they had a duplicate, but in practice went much further and destroyed six boxes \\"of offensive matter which is of no value or interest\\" including cheaply produced Victorian erotica.David Chambers, 'Ashbee, Henry Spencer (1834‚Äì1900)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008, accessed 23 Oct 2011.

The pass is located in the Boulder Mountains, in the northwest corner of Blaine County, within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area of the Sawtooth National Forest. The summit is on State Highway 75, the Sawtooth Scenic Byway,Idaho Byways - Sawtooth Scenic Byway and is northwest of Ketchum and the Sun Valley ski resort. It is the highest summit of a highway in the Northwest. Highway 75 was formerly designated U.S. Route 93, which is now to the east on the former U.S. 93 alternate, through the Lost River Valley. Galena Summit marks the divide between the Big Wood River and Salmon River drainage areas. A little more than west of the summit is Galena Overlook, a scenic viewpoint at . It offers views of the Sawtooth range to the northwest and the headwaters of the Salmon River in the Stanley Basin of Custer County, which SH-75 follows north to Obsidian and Stanley, then east and north towards Challis. The overlook facilities were originally opened in 1964; it was renamed in 2006 for Frank and Bethine Church, and was renovated in 2010. The Galena Lodge (in historic Galena) is at , on the Ketchum side of the summit, and hosts cross country skiing.

They were built for the rough conditions of the North Sea, and proved to be rugged and capable vessels, despite their being somewhat small and cramped.  The Caroline class  HMS Carysfort The Caroline class were all ordered in July and August 1913, as the first six of eight \\"light armoured cruisers\\" under the 1913 programme. The ships were launched in 1914 or 1915 and commissioned in 1915. They had an armament of two single 6 in aft, eight 4 in and two 6-pounder guns. Their anti-aircraft (A/A) weaponry consisted of four 3-pounder. Their aft 6 in guns were superfiring; the class had three funnels. During the First World War, the ships of the class underwent a variety of alterations, including the removal of the guns in Caroline, Carysfort and Comus, being replaced by two extra guns, while Cleopatra, Conquest and Cordelia retained one or two of the guns, with two 2-pounder guns being added to some of the ships.  Ships  * was built by Cammell Laird and Company, Birkenhead. She was laid down on 28 January 1914, launched on 29 September 1914, and completed in December. She became a drill ship for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in April 1924 and fulfilled that role in Alexandra Dock, Belfast until 31 March 2011, when she was decommissioned. In May 2013 the Heritage Lottery Fund announced an ¬£845,600 grant to support her conversion to a museum. * was built by Pembroke Dockyard.

She was laid down on 21 July 1913, launched on 23 February 1914, and completed in June. She was sold for breaking up 31 July 1923.  The Calliope class  The two ships of the Calliope sub- class - HMS Calliope and Champion - were the last pair of the eight \\"light armoured cruisers\\" to be ordered in July and August 1914 under the 1913 Programme. They both had geared turbines, the first Royal Navy cruisers to be so fitted. They also had increased belt armour; Champion had just two screws. They were commissioned in mid to late 1915, as modifications to the Caroline subclass with higher speeds, a more efficient boiler layout and a reduction in the number of funnels to two. The two ships had different machinery types for comparative purposes. Calliope and Champion underwent similar gun armament modifications to the Caroline subclass. They also had underwater tubes rather than the deck mounted weapons of the Caroline subclass and were given two twin deck mounted torpedo tubes during the war but these were later removed to reduce top weight.  Ships  * : Built by Chatham Dockyard, she was laid down on 1 January 1914, and launched on 17 December; she was completed in June 1915. She was sold for breaking up on 28 August 1931. * : Built by R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company, Hebburn on Tyne, she was laid on down 9 March 1914, launched on 29 May 1915, and completed in December 1915. She was sold for breaking up on 28 July 1934.  The Cambrian class  The Cambrian class were ordered in September 1914 under the 1914-15 Programme, and commissioned between 1915 and 1916. The ships had two funnels rather than the three of the Caroline subclass, following on from the developments in the Calliope subclass. The Cambrian subclass had similar armament to the previous sub- class, with their main armament being four guns in single mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of eight guns. They were later removed, with Canterbury and Champion retaining one single gun. The rest of the ships used either two or three guns.

She was sold for breaking up on 8 June 1936.  The Centaur class  The Centaur subclass were ordered in December 1914, and built using materials originally intended for two scout cruisers to be built for Turkey. These vessels were launched and commissioned in 1916. The class also had geared turbines as well as four screws. They retained the two funnels introduced to the C class by the Cambrians. Their main armament was five 6 in guns in single mounts. Their guns were mostly replaced in a similar fashion to the previous sub-classes, with smaller calibre weapons.  Ships  * ; she was built by Sir W.G. Armstrong- Whitworth & Co., Ltd., Walker on Tyne; she was laid down on 24 January 1915, launched on 6 January 1916, and completed in August 1916.

She was sold for breaking up in August 1935.  The Caledon class  HMS CalypsoThe Caledon class were all ordered in December 1915 and commissioned in 1917. The ships retained the two funnels of the previous two sub-classes. Their propulsion was slightly different from the previous sub- classes. Their superstructure was also slightly altered. They had a main armament of five guns and a secondary armament of two 3 in guns, as well as an AA armament of four 3 pounder guns. The surviving ships of the class saw World War II, undergoing a number of modifications along the way. Five Oerlikon 20 mm cannons were added to all ships. Caledon herself had a different armament, as she underwent an extensive rebuild to become an AA cruiser. She was armed with the effective gun, of which she had twelve, two 40 mm Bofors and eight 20 mm Oerlikons.  Ships  * was built by Cammell Laird; she was laid down on 17 March 1916, launched on 25 November, and was completed in March 1917. She became an AA ship in December 1943; she was sold for breaking up on 22 January 1948. * was built by Hawthorn Leslie; she was laid down on 7 February 1916, launched on 24 January 1917, and completed in June. She was sunk by the Italian submarine Bagnolini south of Crete on 12 June 1940. * was built by Vickers, Barrow in Furness; she was laid down March 1916, launched 25 November 1916, and completed in June 1917. She was sunk by a mine in the Baltic on 5 December 1918. * was built by Scott's Shipuilding and Engineering Company in Greenock; she was laid down on 21 February 1916, launched 23 December, and was completed in June 1917. She became a base ship in April 1944, and was sold for breaking up in May 1946.  The Ceres class  HMS Curacoa in 1941The Ceres class were ordered in March and April 1916 and commissioned in 1917 and 1918. These ships were very \\"wet\\" forward, which was remedied in the subsequent Carlisle sub-class with the addition of a \\"trawler bow\\". Their main armament consisted of five guns, while their secondary armament consisted of two weapons, of which a further one was later added to Ceres herself. Four 3-pounder guns were also fitted. Three ships underwent extensive rebuilds during the 1930s, becoming anti-aircraft (AA) cruisers, resulting in all previous armament being removed. The ships were Coventry, Curacoa and Curlew, with Curacoa being the last of the three to be rebuilt in 1939; the other two ships having been converted in 1935. Coventry and Curlew were given ten QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun for their AA role, disposed in single mounts one forward, three on each beam and three aft. Sixteen QF 2-pounder naval gun Mark VIII as two 8-barelled Mark VI mountings (\\"multiple pom-poms\\") were fitted aft (one removed by 1939). Torpedo tubes were removed, and two High-Angle HACS gun directors and a Pom-Pom director added. Curacoa received similar gun directors but a slightly different armament, being equipped with eight QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun in twin mountings replacing 6 inch guns number 1,3,4 and 5; and four QF 2-pounder naval gun Mark VIII as a 4-barelled Mark VII mounting (\\"multiple pom-pom\\") replacing 6 inch gun number 2 forward of the bridge.https://www.world-war.co.uk/Ceres/ceres_class.php3 Later on in the Second World War, four 20 mm Oerlikons were added. Cardiff and Ceres were to have undergone the same conversion, but this was prevented by the outbreak of war.  Ships  * was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, in Govan; she was laid down on 22 July 1916, and launched on 12 April; she was completed in June 1917. She was sold for breaking up on 23 January 1946. * built by John Brown; she was laid down on 11 July 1916, launched on 24 March 1917, and completed in June.

She became an AA ship in 1937; but was sunk by aircraft off Tobruk in the Mediterranean on 14 September 1942. * was built by Pembroke Dockyard; she was laid down in July 1916, launched on 5 May 1917, and completed in February 1918. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk in a collision with RMS Queen Mary north of Ireland on 2 October 1942. * was built by Vickers; she was laid down on 21 August 1916, launched on 5 July 1917, and was completed in December 1917. She became an AA ship in 1938; but was sunk by aircraft in Ofotfjord, Norway, on 26 May 1940.  The Carlisle class  HMS Carlisle in dazzle camouflage in Plymouth Sound, 1942The Carlisle class were ordered in June and July 1917 under the War Emergency Programme, and commissioned between 1918 and 1922. They differed from the previous sub-class, with the addition of a \\"trawler bow\\" which raised the bow higher, as well as having no conning tower. They had an armament of five guns in single mounts, while their secondary armament consisted of two guns, four 3-pounders and two 2-pounder guns.  Ships  * was built by Cammell Laird, Birkenhead; she was laid down on 28 November 1917, launched on 19 November 1918, and completed on 23 September 1919. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk by the Italian submarine Axum in the Mediterranean on 12 August 1942. * was built by Vickers, Barrow in Furness; she was laid down on 18 October 1917, launched on 9 July 1918, and completed in August 1919. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk by air attack during the evacuation of Crete on 1 June 1941. * was built by Cammell Laird; she was laid down 23 February 1918, launched on 28 June 1919 and then towed to Pembroke Dockyard where she was completed in April 1922. She was sold for breaking up on 5 April 1946. * (ex-Cawnpore), was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan; she was laid down on 2 October 1917 and launched on 9 July 1918; she was completed in November 1918. She became an AA ship in 1939; she then became a base ship in 1944; she was sold for breaking up at Alexandria in 1948. * was built by Fairfield; she was laid down on 8 December 1917, launched 18 December 1918, and completed in July 1919. She became an AA ship in 1943; she was sold for breaking up on 22 January 1948. All ships of the class except Colombo and Capetown were converted into AA cruisers in 1939, although Capetown received six 20 mm guns and radar. The ships' main armament consisted of eight guns in four twin turrets with varying numbers of 20 mm Oerlikons being added. Colombo was finally converted to an AA cruiser in 1942, with her armament consisting of eight guns and six 20 mm Oerlikons. All the AA cruiser conversions followed a similar pattern to that of HMS Curacoa (D41).https://www.world- war.co.uk/Cairo/cairo_class.php3  First World War service  In March 1916, Cleopatra rammed and sank the German destroyer while she covered a raid at Tondern. Ships of the C class were extensively involved later that year in the Battle of Jutland. In 1917, Centaur hit mines that blew her bow and stern off. Despite the extensive damage, Centaur survived and was repaired. The year also saw ships of the class involved in action at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. Cardiff leading German battle-cruisers into the Firth of Forth at the end of the First World War In 1918, Cardiff had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the River Forth, where the ships were held before being moved to various other ports. No C-class ships were lost during the First World War; however, in December 1918, Cassandra hit a mine and subsequently sank. Ships of the C class performed a variety of duties after World War I, including service on overseas stations. In 1919, Curacoa hit a mine that badly damaged her, but she survived and was repaired. The Caroline, Cambrian and Centaur classes were all scrapped or consigned to minor roles, such as training ships, by the 1930s.  Conversion  In the mid-1930s it was decided to modernize and refit the C class cruisers for anti-aircraft work. The aim was to convert all 13 cruisers of the late C (Caledon, Ceres and Carlisle) classes. The conversions between 1935 and 1936 of HMS Coventry and Curlew served as prototypes. Coventry and Curlew first had all armament removed. This was replaced with 10 single mount 4 inch high angle (HA) guns and two eight-barreled 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" mounts. The previous gun directors were removed and replaced with two suitable for anti-aircraft gun control. To keep costs down, only limited structural work was carried out, but the masts were altered. In 1938, because of a shortage of this weapon, the aft pom-pom was removed and fitted on another ship, being replaced by two quadruple Vickers machine gun mounts. The modifications were considered successful and plans for the conversion of the other eleven ships were drawn up. However, these conversions were delayed; the conversions of Cairo and Calcutta did not start until 1938. Instead of single 4 inch guns, they were to receive twin HA mounts, except that one mount was given over to a quadruple pom-pom. In mid-1939, Carlisle and Curacoa went in for their conversions, but the work ceased on the outbreak of war.  Second World War service  The Caledon, Ceres and Carlisle-class ships served in the Second World War, despite their age. Calypso caught the German blockade-runner Konsul Hendrik Fisser in 1939. That same year, Caradoc intercepted the German tanker Emmy Friedrich, whose crew subsequently scuttled her. A number of ships took part in the Norwegian campaign in 1940. The C class were also extensively used in the Mediterranean Sea; the first notable engagement by a ship of the class being Coventrys participation in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in 1940. In 1941, Calcutta and Carlisle took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which a number of Italian warships were sunk. C-class cruisers also took part in the campaign and evacuation of Crete, coming up against heavy German opposition from the air. In 1942, Carlisle took part in the Second Battle of Sirte. Colombo and Caledon went in for their refits in 1942/43 ‚Äì getting 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikons alongside the twin mounts. In 1943, Carlisle was badly damaged by German aircraft, but did not sink. She became a base ship in Alexandria Harbour until 1945. Capetown provided support to the Normandy Landings in 1944, bombarding German positions. HMS Caroline sporting her three flags (From left to right) Union Flag, Commodore RNR's Rank flag, Flag of the Royal Navy (White Ensign) Six ships of the C class were lost during the war: Curlew was sunk by German aircraft off Narvik during the Norwegian campaign on 26 May 1940; Calypso was sunk by the Italian submarine Bagnolini on 12 June 1940; Calcutta was attacked and sunk by German aircraft during the evacuation of Crete on 1 June 1941; Cairo was sunk on 12 August 1942 by the during Operation Pedestal (the pivotal resupply of Malta); Coventry was badly damaged by German aircraft while covering a raid on Tobruk on 14 September 1942, forcing the destroyer to scuttle her; and Curacoa was sunk after colliding with the ocean liner on 2 October 1942.  The survivor  remained the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve drill ship in Alexandra Dock, Belfast until 31 March 2011, when she was decommissioned. Despite ongoing alterations throughout her lifetime, many parts of the ship still date to when she was originally commissioned in 1914. In 2016 she was opened to the public as a museum ship.

NASA's Kennedy Space Center and visitor complex are also situated on the island and NASA can restrict access to the refuge based on its operational needs. The NWR contains over 1000 species of plants, 117 species of fish, 68 amphibians and reptiles, 330 birds, and 31 mammal species, of which 21 species are listed as endangered by the state of Florida or by the US federal government. Management of the NWR is provided through the Merritt Island NWR Complex, which provides hiking and driving trails for the public, subject to access restrictions from NASA. It is a 'gateway site' for the Great Florida Birding Trail. Location and extent View of refuge from Max Brewer Memorial Parkway near Gator Creek Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is located due east of Titusville on Merritt Island in Brevard County, Florida, and occupies , overlaid with the Kennedy Space Center. To the north, it borders on the Canaveral National Seashore; to the south it encompasses non-public portions of the Kennedy Space Center (with which it also shares some history), which in turn abuts Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Mosquito Lagoon and the Indian River run through the refuge. Since public access to all these areas is controlled in various ways, the refuge is part of a very substantial area of relatively undisturbed wildlife habitat. History The land occupied by the NWR was acquired by NASA in the early 1960s for the development of the Space Center and its non- operational purposes. Until then, there had been little development in the area because of the high number of salt marsh mosquitoes. Public access is normally permitted, and several state highways run across the refuge. However, the public can be excluded if necessary for NASA's purposes, as is done in the days before a launch. Habitats and species Bald eagles inhabit the refuge. The refuge provides a range of habitats, from saltwater estuaries and freshwater impoundments and marshes, to dunes, hardwood hammocks, and scrub. It contains over 1000 species of plants, 117 species of fish, 68 amphibians and reptiles, 330 birds, and 31 mammal species. Of these species, 21 are listed as endangered either by the state of Florida or by the US federal government. The following are some of the more important species using the refuge; most of them nest there: *Sea turtles including Loggerhead sea turtle Green turtle *American alligator *Osprey *Bald eagle *Many species of waterfowl use the refuge as a wintering ground; blue-winged teal and northern shoveler are resident in small numbers *Many species of shorebirds, some resident and some using the refuge in the course of their migration *Several species of rails *Anhinga Bobcat in Kennedy Space Center *Several species of heron and egret *Glossy and white ibis *Roseate spoonbill *Florida scrub jay *West Indian manatee *Bobcat *Dwarf siren, a recently discovered salamander Facilities Subject to the needs of NASA, public access is relatively unrestricted, though it is only allowed during daylight hours; camping is only allowed for certain organized youth organizations. The refuge provides hiking and driving trails for visitors, with opportunities for observing wildlife without causing disturbances; most of the species listed above can be seen by a casual visitor. An observation deck is provided near the drawbridge that carries State Road 3 over the Haulover Canal, in the northern part of the refuge, since manatees frequently congregate there. Boating is permitted on the waters around and within the refuge, and provides an opportunity for observing the wildlife. There are facilities for launching pleasure boats at several places. In addition the refuge includes, and gives access to Playalinda Beach on the outer barrier island. Fishing is generally permitted, and hunting for wildfowl is allowed on a strictly limited basis. There is a Visitor Center. Management Merritt Island NWR Complex acted as an administrative center for a number of other NWR's in central Florida but since 2012 management of the Merritt Island NWR, St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge, and Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge are administered by the Merritt Island NWR Complex located on SR 402, 5 miles east of Titusville, Florida.

Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, north-east of Colombo, south-east of Jaffna and miles north of Batticaloa, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil language speaking culture on the island for over two millennia. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. People from Trincomalee are known as Trincomalians and the local authority is Trincomalee Urban Council. Trincomalee city is home to the famous Koneswaram temple from where it developed and earned its historic Tamil name Thirukonamalai. The town is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur. The recorded history of Trincomalee spans more than two and a half thousand years, beginning with civilian settlement associated with the Koneswaram temple in the pre-modern era. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it has served as a major maritime seaport in the international trading history of the island with South East Asia. From its suburban village of Kankuveli, some of Asia's earliest medical research at the \\"Agathiyar Thapanam\\", the Siddhar Tamil medical university established by Agastya, helped spread Tamil Tamraparniyan culture across the continent. In the ancient world, it was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni country, developing under the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pallava Dynasty, Chola Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, the Vannimai chieftaincies and the Jaffna kingdom through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue. Trincomalee's urbanization continued when made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city's architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island. The Trincomalee Bay, bridged by the Mahavilli Ganga River to the south, the historical \\"Gokarna\\" in Sanskrit, means \\"Cow's Ear\\", akin to other sites of Siva worship across the Indian subcontinent. Uniquely, Trincomalee is a Pancha Ishwaram, a Paadal Petra Sthalam, a Maha Shakti Peetha and Murugan Tiruppadai of Sri Lanka; its sacred status to the Hindus has led to it being declared \\"Dakshina-Then Kailasam\\" or \\"Mount Kailash of the South\\" and the \\"Rome of the Pagans of the Orient\\". The harbour is renowned for its large size and security; unlike any other in the Indian Ocean, it is accessible in all weathers to all craft. It has been described as the \\"finest harbour in the world\\" and by the British, \\"the most valuable colonial possession on the globe, as giving to our Indian Empire a security which it had not enjoyed from elsewhere\\". Popular tourist destinations include its beaches at Uppuveli, Salli and Nilaveli, used for temple visits, surfing, scuba diving, fishing and whale watching, and the Kanniya Hot Springs. Trincomalee is served by a campus of the Eastern University, Sri Lanka and has been the inspiration of both domestic and international poetry, films, music and literature for many centuries. Names and etymology Trincomalee The city has developed from a village settlement on the promontory dedicated to the Hindu shrine. The origin of the term Ko, Kone and Konatha lies in the Old Tamil word for the terms \\"Lord\\", \\"King\\" or \\"Chief\\", which allude to the deity that presides here; this term appears in several Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of the 6th century BCE ‚Äî 2nd century CE. Trincomalee, the coastal peninsula town where Koneswaram is located is an anglicized form of the old Tamil word \\"Thiru-kona-malai\\" (), meaning \\"Lord of the Sacred Hill\\", its earliest reference in this form found in the Tevaram of the 7th century by Sambandhar. Thiru is a generally used epithet denoting a \\"sacred\\" temple site while Malai means mountain or hill; Middle Tamil manuscripts and inscriptions mention the monumental compound shrine as the Thirukonamalai Konesar Kovil. Kona () has other meanings in Old Tamil such as peak, while another origin for the term Koneswaram could come from the Tamil term Kuna (East). Therefore, other translators suggest definitions of Trincomalee such as \\"sacred angular/peaked hill\\", \\"sacred eastern hill\\" or \\"three peaked hill\\". The temple was constructed atop Swami Rock, also called Swami Malai or Kona-ma-malai, a cliff on the peninsula that drops 400 feet (120 metres) directly into the sea. Gokarna bay, Trincomalee The Trincomalee Harbour, a circular natural harbour which the temple crowns towards the north, is referred to as Ko-Kannam or \\"Lord's Cheek\\", alluding to the cheek shape of Shiva's bull Nandi. The Sanskrit equivalent of the port town's harbour bay is Go-Karna, meaning \\"Cow's Ear\\" or Gokarna Pattana and the deity's name Gokarneswara or Go‚ÄîNatha in Sanskrit. Pathmanathan offers the etymological link Thiru-Gokarna-Malai or Thiru-Gona- Malai based on this connection.S. Pathmanathan, The Kingdom of Jaffna, Colombo, 1978. pages 135‚Äì144 The ethnographer Megasthenes writing in his Indica from 350 ‚Äî 290 BCE, describes the island as being divided by a long river, productive of a large number of gold and pearls in one half and that the inhabitants of this country are called Paleogoni, meaning Old Goni in Tamil and Greek, who Pliny adds worshipped Hercules and Dionysus (Bacchus) like the Pandyans of Tamilakam. The Vayu Purana, written in 300 CE specifically mentions the tallest mountain peak of the great gold and silver rich mountain range Malaya on the island, and that \\"to the east of this island at the shore of the sea lies a great Siva temple in a holy place called Gokarna.\\"H.N. Apte, Vayupurana, Chapter 48 verses 20‚Äì30, Poona, 1929 The bay is also referred to as Gokaranna according to a Sanskrit inscription in Grantha script excavated on a doorjamb at the Hindu temple dated to Tamil New Years Day 1223 CE. Gokarna is also a place name in Karnataka, India, Kalinga, Tamil Nadu and Nepal all associated with ancient Shiva temples. The associated Bhadrakali Amman Temple of Trincomalee, significantly expanded by Rajendra Chola I, stands on Konesar Road before the entrance to Swami Rock.An inscription of the Cola king, Rajendra I (1012‚Äì1044 AD) was found recently at the goddess Kali's Temple in Trincomalee, detailing his expansion of the shrine.

As per another legend, Vayu Bhaghvan and Adiseshan had a dispute to find out who is superior, to prove the superiority adiseshan encircled the Kailasam, Vayu tried to remove this encircle by creating santamarutham (Twister).

Volume 1. pp.136 One inscription from 900‚Äì1000 CE belonging to the Chola Dynasty excavated near where the promontory's first temple stood is from a sluice and also concerns Koneswaram, as do the 10th century Nilaveli inscriptions.On palaeographical and other considerations this epigraphic record could be assigned to the late 10th or early 11th century. It records a grant of 250 veli of land on the coast, to the shrine of Nilakanta Mahadevar at Matsyakesvaram on Konaparvatam of Tirukonamalai for conducting daily worship and rituals. Nittavinotapuram, Patiyana Aipolilpattinam, Makalana, Vikkiramacalamekapuram, Matottamana Iramakulavallip pattinam are some of the merchant towns where archaeological remains of monuments datable to the period of Chola administration have been found. Ancient texts, as well as an inscription unearthed by archeologists among its Hindu archaeological remains, call it Gokarna in Sanskrit.Professor K. Indrapala, Early Tamil Settlements in Ceylon. PhD Thesis, University of London, 1965.page 331 Over its long history, Trincomalee, and specifically the Swami Rock promontory, has housed several Kovil temples to deities of the Hindu pantheon, as well as a Buddhist vihara and a Christian Catholic church, both introduced following invasions. A descendant of Ellalan of Anuradhapura, Kulakkottan, directed renovations of the Hindu temples and oversaw settlement of Tamils for their upkeep. Sacrificial and other cult practices at the Trincomalee promontory have been documented since the Yakkha period, and were noted during the reigns of Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura, Maha Naga of Anuradhapura and Manavanna of Anuradhapura until the publication of The Life of Alexander Alexander in 1830. The worship of Eiswara is noted to have been the original worship of the island and the deity worshiped by Kuveni, the ancient Yakkha queen; Charles Pridham, Jonathan Forbes and George Turnour state that it is probable there is no more ancient form of worship existing than that of Eiswara upon his sacred promontory.Constance Frederica Gordon Cumming (1893). Two happy years in Ceylon. pp. 295Jonathan Forbes, George Turnour. (1840). Eleven years in Ceylon: Comprising sketches of the field sports and natural history of that colony, and an account of its history and antiquities. p. 44 In the earliest known literary reference to the Siva temple, Mahabharata, the Hindu epic written between 400‚Äì100 BCE, the temple of Gokarna bay is in the middle of the ocean and is the island shrine of Uma's consort, known in the three worlds and worshiped by all natives of the island including the Nagas, Yakkhas, Siddhars and Devas, peoples from the subcontinent, the rivers, ocean and mountains.Mahabharata. Volume 3. pp. 46‚Äì47 Fasting there for three nights in worship of Siva as Ishana, one acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and the status of Ganapatya. By staying there for twelve nights, one's soul is cleansed of all sins. Mahabharata continues that the shrine is the next pilgrimage spot for Hindus en route south following Kanyakumari of the early Pandyan kingdom and Tamraparni island (Kudiramalai).\\"Listen as I now recount the isle of Tamraparni, gemmed upon the ocean. The gods underwent austerities there, in a desire to attain greatness. In that region also is the lake of Gokarna. Then one should go to Gokarna, renowned in the three worlds. O Indra among kings! It is in the middle of the ocean and is worshipped by all the worlds. Brahma, the Devas, the rishis, the ascetics, the bhutas (spirits or ghosts), the yakshas, the pishachas, the kinnaras, the great nagas, the siddhas, the charanas, the gandharvas, humans, the pannagas, rivers ocean and mountains worship Uma's consort there\\". Mahabharata. Volume 3. pp. 46‚Äì47, 99 In the same time period, the Ramayana in written form describes how King Ravana and his mother had worshipped Siva at the shrine, when the former wanted to remove the temple of Koneswaram when his mother was in ailing health around 2000 BCE. This literature continues that as the king was heaving the rock, Lord Siva made him drop his sword. As a result of this a cleft was created on the rock, today called Ravana Vettu ‚Äì meaning Ravana's Cleft. Upon her death, her last rites were performed at the Kanniya Hot water springs in the Kanniya suburb of Trincomalee city. The Siva-worshipping Siddhar Patanjali's birth at the city in 180 BCE and its connections to another Siddhar Agastya from at least the 5th‚Äì4th century BCE suggests that Yoga Sun Salutation originated on the promontory of Trincomalee. One of Trincomalee's suburbs, Kankuveli is home to ruins of the Tamil Siddhar medical university established by Agastya, the \\"Agathiyar Thapanam\\", which alongside his other shrines at Sivan Oli Padam Malai, helped spread Tamraparniyan science across the continent during the pre-classical era. The Vayu Purana refers to the Siva temple on Trikuta hill on the eastern coast of Lanka once again in the 3rd century. Another mention is found in the 5th century CE Mahavamsa where King Vijaya brought his nephew Panduvasdeva to land at the bay in the 4th century BC. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai asserts that Vijaya restored the Koneswaram temple and the other four Eswarams upon arrival. Mahasena of Anuradhapura, according to the Mahavamsa and the later Culavamsa, destroyed the devalaya temple compound in Trincomalee housing Siva lingas in it, and built a Mahayana Buddhist edifice in its stead. He destroyed the Hindu temple to appease monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya who themselves had been antagonized by Mahasen. He worked under the tutelage of Sangamitta, the Tamil Buddhist monk from the early Chola country, who had intervened to avenge the persecution of Vetullavada adherents during the Tamraparniyan Abhayagiri versus Maha Viharaya sectarianism in Anuradhapura.Mahavamsa. Chapter 35. Verses 40‚Äì47 This explains some of the Buddhist archeological remains in the region. By the reign of Silakala Ambosamanera of Anuradhapura, Trincomalee bay again is mentioned as the furthest spot down the river Mahavalli Ganga which must be protected from \\"the enemy in Rohana\\"; and Trincomalee is noted as a theatre of magic, where Naga snakes were manifested to foretell the consecration of Maha Naga of Anuradhapura.Culavamsa: Being the More Recent Part of Mahavamsa. pp59-60 It was not long before the Siva temple's concurrent re-establishment on the promontory by the 6th century following the rise of the Pallava dynasty. The Mattakallappu Manmiyam of Batticaloa confirms Trincomalee's sacred status for all Hindus.Sivaratnam, C (1964). An outline of the cultural history and principles of Hinduism (1 ed.).

The date of building the original temple is given as 1580 B.C., according to a Tamil poem by Kavi Raja Virothayan translated into English in 1831 by Simon Cassie Chitty... Middle Ages Early Tamil dynasties continued to employ the city as the prefectural capital of the Trincomalee District, allowing administrative duties to be handled by elected Vanniar chiefs. Inscriptions of Kassapa IV, Udaya III and Mahinda IV of Anuradhapura, reveal that lands and villages of Tamils in the island's northeast were prospering, particularly following Srimara Srivallabha's intervention against Sena I of Anuradhapura.Ci PatmanƒÅtan, S. Pathmanathan (1978). The Kingdom of Jaffna, Volume 1. pp. 26‚Äì27 The Pallava kings, including Simhavishnu and Narasimhavarman I were important in the early history of Trincomalee because of the increased significance of the city to Hinduism and trade in the early centuries of the common era, making sure to contribute elements of their unique style of Dravidian architecture to the city. During the reign of Mahendravarman I in 600, as one Aggabodhi II of Anuradhapura took steps to attack the Vanniar chiefs between Trincomalee and Mannar, Tevaram hymns were composed on the two holy cities, one of which, written by Sambandar, lauded the deity of the temples in each and lamented the schemes of other heretical faiths encroaching on Trincomalee.Thirunanacamptanta Cuvamikal Arulicceyta Tevarattiruppatikankal, Saiva Siddhanta publishing works Ltd, Madras, 1927 Mahendravarman I gave much assistance and military aid to his friend Manavanna of Anuradhapura, and he proceeded to build a twin temple called Kokarneswarar Temple, Thirukokarnam in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p412 Following the conquest of Parantaka I in 950, Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I oversaw the city's development when under their empire. A significant expansion of the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee by Rajendra Chola I increased pilgrimage to the city. Trincomalee was used by Chola king Ilankesvarar Tevar as his eastern port in the 11th century and prospered under the Vannimai chieftaincies of the Jaffna kingdom.N. Parameswaran (2003). Medieval Tamils in Lanka = Ilankai. pp. 13 Two powerful merchant guilds of the time ‚Äì the Manigramam and the Five Hundred Lords of Ayyavolu emerged in the region during Chola trade with the far east and conquest of Srivijaya of the Malay archipelago and Indonesia.Chola-era inscriptions record the activities of Tamil mercantile communities in Padavikulam. The mercantile groups referred to were the Ticai Aayirattu Ain Nurruvar (Velupillai, Ceylon Tamil Inscriptions, 1971) and the Ayyavole. Taniyappan, a merchant from Padavikulam, laid a foundation stone for a Siva temple there. A Tamil inscription by Raja Raja Chola refers to Ravi Kulamanikkeswaram Siva Temple in Padavikulam. (K. Indrapala, Epigraphia Tamilica, Jaffna Archeological Society, 1971 ‚Äì page 34). A 13th century Sanskrit inscription excavated here mentions a Brahmin village in the area. The paddy fields of Padavikulam were watered by the Per Aru river.Abraham, Meera (1988). Two medieval merchant guilds of south India. pp. 132 The Koneswaram temple compounds, the city and its adjacent region, from Periyakulam and Manankerni in the north, Kantalai and Pothankadu in the west, and Verugal in the south, formed a great Saiva Tamil principality of the island's state Mummudi Chola Mandalam. Residents in this collective community were allotted services, which they had to perform at the Koneswaram temple. A Jain sect in Nilaveli had even complained to Gajabahu II about the priests of Koneswaram. Following some benefaction of the shrine by Gajabahu II, his successor King Parakramabahu I used Trincomalee as his eastern port, to launch a successful invasion of Burma in the 12th century. Kalinga Magha used the city as a garrison point during his rule. The city was governed by Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I and Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I of the Pandyans in the 13th century, despite invasions from and the eventual subduing of Chandrabhanu and Savakanmaindan of Tambralinga of Thailand; it then remained in the Pandyan empire of Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I and remnants of Pandyan art and architecture still stand in Trincomalee. Magha's reign ousted Parakrama Pandyan II and re-consolidated Tamil sovereign power in the island's north, north west and north east in Trincomalee by 1215; during Magha's reign, the temple and city underwent rich development in the name of a Chodaganga Deva on Puthandu, 1223. After the fall of the Pandyans of Tamilakam due to invasions by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate, Trincomalee rose in status in the Jaffna kingdom, often visited by King Singai Pararasasegaram and his successor King Cankili I in the following centuries. Trincomalee served a similar purpose to its west coast sister city, Mannar. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the Koneswaram temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, titled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram Temple. Mariners were particularly excited when observing the massive shrine from afar in the sea. Building blocks from the city were used to expand the Kovil at Rameswaram under the patronage of king Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan.Gnanaprakasar,A Critical History of Jaffna, p.99-102Kunarasa,The Jaffna Dynasty, p.67-68 At this time, Trincomalee was trading pearls, precious stones, vessels, elephants, muslins, baqam and cinnamon, and was passed by Chinese voyager Ma Huan by ship, eight days from the Nicobar islands, on his way to Tenavaram temple.J R Sinnatamby (1968). Ceylon in Ptolemy's geographyGerolamo Emilio Gerini. (1974). Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (reprint). Ma Huan calls the headland hill as being Ying-ko tsui Shan or Ying- Ko Tswei Shan ‚Äì a hawk-beak shaped hill on the east coast The Tamil country had established a strong alliance with Yemen and the Delhi Sultinate under Martanda Cinkaiariyan which attracted seafaring merchants from East Africa and the Middle East to its ports.Ci PatmanƒÅtan, S. Pathmanathan (1978). The Kingdom of Jaffna, Volume 1. pp. 237 An inlet of Trincomalee, Nicholson Cove became the site of a small Arab settlement by the 13th and 14th century. The Nicholson Cove Tombstone inscriptions at Trincomalee refer to the deceased as the daughter of the chief Badriddin Husain Bin Ali Al- Halabi, showing that her family hailed from Halab (Aleppo) in Syria.Asiff Hussein (2007). Sarandib: an ethnological study of the Muslims of Sri Lanka The Tamil Bell of New Zealand assigned to the Pandyan era belonged to sea traders that likely originated from Trincomalee. The city even attracted Arunagirinathar in 1468, who traversed the Pada Yatra pilgrimage route from Nallur Kandaswamy temple to Katirkamam while stopping to pay homage to Koneswaram's Murukan shrine. By the late 16th century, Portuguese Ceylon was beginning to influence the operations of the now princely Trincomalee district. Despite it being one of the smaller states of the island, given as an appenage to younger sons of royal houses and still being dependent on the Jaffna kingdom, the city had become one of the richest and the most visited place of Hindu worship in the world, declared the \\"Rome of the Pagans of the Orient\\" and \\"Rome of the Gentiles\\" by the Portuguese.M. G. Francis. History of Ceylon: An Abridged Translation of Professor Peter Courtenay's Work. pp.80 It hosted the Hindu funeral of Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte. The death of one of its kings, Vanniana Raja of Trincomalee, left his young son, the Prince of Trincomalee under the guardianship of his uncle. Trincomalee was annexed by Cankili I to bring it back under Jaffna control, forcing the boy king into exile. He was eventually baptised as Raja Alphonsus of Trincomalee and taken under the wing of the missionary Francis Xavier. The rise of Francis Xavier and the migration of Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee, conversions to Christianity by some residents and royals in the 1500s saw the erection of churches in the city. Koneswaram is described by Jesuit priests at this time as being a \\"... massive structure, a singular work of art. It is of great height, constructed with wonderful skill in blackish granite, on a rock projecting into the sea, and occupies a large space on the summit\\".Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. II, p. 366. The Trincomalee and Batticaloa chiefdoms starting paying direct tributes to the Portuguese commander in Mannar from 1582 as Portuguese influence over the entire North east gained momentum. An annual sum of 1280 fanams was levied from the Koneswaram temple, and they collected a duty on areca nuts exported through the Trincomalee and Batticaloa ports.Jorge Manuel Flores; Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian. (2007). Re-exploring the links : history and constructed histories between Portugal and Sri Lanka. pp.36 Jaffna had given minimal logistical access to its Trincomalee and Batticaloa seaports to the Kandyan kingdom to secure military advantages against its enemies; this was used by their influential European overlords to consolidate power in the region. In 1603, the first Dutch fleet arrives at Trincomalee and Batticaloa ports.Robert Montgomery Martin. (1839). Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire,... . pp.370 In 1612, D. Hieronymo de Azevedo, after great difficulties due to torrential rains, arrived at Trincomalee with a Portuguese contingent from Kandy. Here de Azevedo \\"was keen on building a fort\\" to the scope; he called in aid from King Ethirimana Cinkam of Jaffna but not seeing him, he abandoned the enterprise and he marched towards Jaffna.Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. IIPerniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. III The early death of Cankili I brought upon by the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom saw all the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprising both Trincomalee and Batticaloa, assigned to the \\"spiritual cures of the Franciscans\\". The Jesuits followed the Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee and Batticaloa when they occupied the two localities.This decision was taken by the bishop of Cochin, Dom Sebasti√£o de S. Pedro. Later, another decree of the same bishop dated 11 November 1622, tracing the one indicated in 1602, entrusted newly to the Jesuits the spiritual cure in the districts of Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, giving to them possibility to build churches, to train the sacraments and to convert souls. Early modern The buildings of Trincomalee were of masonry, thatched with leaves of bamboo and rattan, although the Pagodas and the Palace of the King were covered with copper, silver and gold. The metropolis had grown with well-built houses and streets that were cleaned regularly and were well adorned. The Danish arrived in Trincomalee to the end of 1619 with a first ship, called \\"√òresund\\" under the command of Roelant Crape. This small expedition was the vanguard of another Danish fleet, composed of four vessels and 300 soldiers, commanded by Ove Giedde, that reached the island in May 1620. They wanted to try their fortune in the Asian seas; the Danish expedition occupied Koneswaram temple. It was here that the Danes began the works for the fortification of the peninsula.Barner Jensen, U. \\"Danish East India. Trade coins and the coins of Tranquebar, 1620‚Äì1845\\", pp. 11‚Äì12; Holden Furber \\"Imperi rivali nei mercati d‚Äôoriente, 1600‚Äì1800\\", note n¬∞ 66, p. 326: \\"Senarat of Kandy sent to Trincomalee 60 Sinhala men in order to help the Danes in the construction of their fort. During their permanence in Trincomalee, the Danesh coined also some \\"Larins\\", on which were recorded the words 'Don Erich Grubbe', of these coins, today do not remain trace, if not in the diary of Ove Giedde.\\" Following the destruction of the Koneswaram compound and the Fort of Triquinimale built from its ruins, Trincomalee had a Portuguese force during the reign of Rajasinghe II of Kandy. Constantino de S√° de Noronha who destroyed one of the temples had a copy of the oldest inscription in Tamil Brahmi sent to Portugal for the purpose of identification. The Tamil inscription contains a prophecy on the city and its temple, a copy of which was sent and is retained in The Hague. In a 1638 letter to Dutch Colonial Governor Anthony van Diemen, an officer mentions that Trincomalee is a \\"fort built rather strongly of hard stones from an old pagoda round the hillock. On each side there is a sandy and rocky bay and it is like a peninsula\\". Rajasinghe finally formed an alliance with the Dutch, who captured the Fort of Triquinimale in 1639 and handed it to the Kandyans for destruction in 1643. In 1660, the Dutch built the present Fort Fredrick at the foot of the promontory which they called Pagoda Hill, and another fort at the mouth of the harbour home to Dutch officers, Fort Ostenburg. An English sea captain and his son, the writer named Robert Knox, came ashore by chance near Trincomalee and were captured and held in captivity by the Kandyan king in 1659. The Kandyans then pursued a scorched earth policy to try and oust the Dutch and take Trincomalee and Batticaloa on the east coast. The French set up base in Trincomalee in the Spring of 1672, and tried to make overtures to the Kandyans, but an alliance was not sealed; by July 1672, Trincomalee was retaken by the Dutch fleet.Professor Jeremy Black, Jeremy Black. From Louis XIV to Napoleon: The Fate of a Great Power. pp.1678 The city had rejoined the Coylot Vanni Country by the start of the 18th century, with much of the city's population having moved across the district following the temple's destruction. It was about three centuries after Norochcho and Knox that serious attempts at translating the temple's ancient writings were made. The Dutch ruled the Tamil country with increased focus on districts like the Vannimai, Trincomalee and Batticaloa; the Vanniar chiefs of Trincomalee and the rest of the Vanni became subordinates and were put back under the commandment of Jaffna with a large degree of autonomy, but forced to pay forty elephants a year to the Dutch company.Alicia Schrikker. (2006). Dutch and British colonial intervention in Sri Lanka c. 1780‚Äì1815: expansion and reform. Proefschrift Universiteit Leiden. pp.86 As tributaries, they recovered from Portuguese rule slowly under Dutch rule, and the Batticaloa district served as a dependency of the Fort of Trincomalee until 1782. The state of the region and the Tamils fears for the town and the Kantalai tank is described in considerable detail by the Dutch Governor of Trincomalee, J. F. Van Senden, in the diary of his visit in June 1786 with a view to revitalising agricultural production around the Trincomalee district. The population was a shadow of what it had been in times of prosperity. What he saw were people who had lost much of their traditional skill and often living close to subsistence level. Van Senden made the first record of the Kankuveli Tamil inscription dealing with a large field dedicated to Koneswaram temple. He was struck by the contrast between the prosperity signified by the inscription and what he then saw in the village. Trincomalee town remained under Vanni administration.J. Burnand helps with the suppression of the revolt against the Indian amildars, administrators brought from Madras to Ceylon. He drafts another 'memoir' on the North and Northeast, in which he locates the origins of the Sinhalese in Siam and mentions that from time immemorial Sinhalese and Tamils had divided the rule of the island between the two of them. The English translation of Burnand's memoir of 1798 becomes known as the 'Cleghorn minute'. Late modern and contemporary Trincomalee WWII War Cemetery Jacob Burnand, a Swiss soldier in the service of the Dutch and the Governor of Batticaloa, composed a memoir on his administration there in 1794, noting Trincomalee to be an important fortified town in the Tamil nation.J. Burnand helps with the suppression of the revolt against the Indian amildars, administrators brought from Madras to Ceylon. He drafts another 'memoir' on the North and Northeast, in which he locates the origins of the Sinhalese in Siam and mentions that from time immemorial Sinhalese and Tamils had divided the rule of the island between the two of them. The English translation of Burnand's memoir of 1798 becomes known as the Cleghorn minute. Trincomalee's fort was occupied by the Dutch for most of the 18th century, and subsequently by the French who fought and won the Battle of Trincomalee as part of the American Revolutionary War in 1782 at the city. On 8 January 1782 the British captured Trincomalee's forts from the Dutch, the first place on the island they captured. The French recaptured it on 29 August of the same year after the Battle of Trincomalee. In 1783 the French ceded it to the British and subsequently, Britain ceded Trincomalee back to the Dutch Republic under the Peace of Paris (1783 Treaty of Versailles). In 1795 the British recaptured the city and held it until Sri Lanka's independence in 1948, with a claimed aim of \\"preventing Napoleon invading the colony\\" if left under the Dutch. Their rule is sealed with the Treaty of Amiens, and the last Vanniar, Pandara Vannian is executed by the British ‚Äì a pension is paid to his widow, the Vannichi, until the late 19th century. The British officer Alexander Johnston discovered a stone epigraph, the oldest of the province of Trincomalee District, in ancient characters concerning the traditional founder of Trincomalee and the temple, Kullakottan Chola. The French admiral Pierre Andr√© de Suffren de Saint Tropez, when with his fleet in the city in 1781 had sent a copy of the inscription to Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron of France for translation.Johnston, Alexander (1827). An Account of an Inscription Found Near Trincomalee in the Island of Ceylon. The ship was built during the early 19th century by Indian workers to aid them in the Napoleonic Wars, and named after the city. The importance of Fort Fredrick was due to Trincomalee's natural harbour. Through Trincomalee, it was believed a strong naval force could secure control of India's Coromandel Coast and the rest of the Indian Ocean. The British admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson called Trincomalee \\"the finest harbour in the world\\", while the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger called the city \\"the most valuable colonial possession on the globe, as giving to our Indian Empire a security which it had not enjoyed from its establishment\\" and the harbour \\"the finest and most advantageous Bay in the whole of India\\". In the 19th century, the Trincomali Channel of British Columbia, Canada was built and named after the city's name.G. Philip V. Akrigg, Helen B. Akrigg (1997). British Columbia place names. A Tamil press is established in Jaffna in 1820; a report on Trincomalee laments its sorry, poverty-stricken state and recommends 'colonization with intelligent settlers'. By 1827, The Return of the Population 1824 is published, giving the total population figures for Trincomalee as 19,158 ‚Äì Tamils and among them 317 Sinhalese. The Vanni, counted under Mannar, has 22,536 inhabitants, among them 517 Sinhalese. Before the Second World War, the British built a large airfield to house their RAF base, called the RAF China Bay and fuel storage and support facilities for the British fleets there. After the fall of Singapore, Trincomalee became the home port of the Eastern Fleet of the Royal Navy, and submarines of the Dutch Navy. Trincomalee harbour and airfield were attacked by a carrier fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy in April 1942 in the Indian Ocean Raid of the war. However, the installation later served as an important launching point for British naval operations in 1944 and 1945.Brian Lavery, Churchill's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organisation, 1939‚Äì1945, page 183, 2006. One of the places inhabited by the British was Fort Fredrick, now occupied by the Sri Lankan Army. Some of the old buildings in the fort were used as residences, including one previously occupied by the Duke of Wellington. In the early 1950s the British Government built groups of bungalows within the fort specifically for their employees. These bungalows today provide accommodation for the Sri Lankan Army. There was a large Naval Hospital which catered for sick and injured British naval personnel from all over the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. With the turn of the modern era, English authors and poets used Trincomalee as inspiration for literature and poetry and became connected with the city. Arthur C. Clarke, who discovered the temple's underwater ruins with photographer Mike Wilson, described the city and the ruins in Reefs of Taprobane and would go on to write 2001: A Space Odyssey based on his experiences in the city. Trincomalee's Bhadrakali Amman temple provides a setting in Wilbur Smith's novel Birds of Prey. Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories feature multiple settings in the city, including in A Scandal in Bohemia and A Singular Affair at Trincomalee. Jane Austen's younger brother Charles Austen of the British Royal Navy is buried in Trincomalee. Post independence Sri Lankan naval ship at Trincomalee In 1950, one of the original shrine's gold and copper alloy bronze statues from the 10th century CE of a seated figure of Shiva (in the form of Somaskanda), Shiva as Chandrasekhar, his consort goddess Parvati, a statue of the goddess Mathumai Ambal and later Lord Ganesh were found by the Urban Council of Trincomalee buried 500 yards from the promontory's end while digging for a water well. They were taken in procession around the region before being reinstalled amid opening ceremonies in one of the newly restored shrines of the compound on 3 March 1963. The naval and air bases were taken over by Sri Lanka in 1957. Following independence from Britain, the political relationship between Tamils and Sinhalese deteriorated across the island. Interest surrounding Trincomalee was increased due to its geostrategic position and the discovery of its underwater and land Hindu ruins. In 1968, the unity government of majority Sinhalese dominated United National Party and the minority Tamil dominated ITAK Federal Party collapsed over disagreements about declaring the holy Hindu site a protected area. A committee appointed by a Federal Party Minister to study the viability of declaring the site protected was disbanded without consultation by the Prime Minister at the time, Dudley Senanayake. The Federal Party withdrew its support to the government following that action. According to journalists like T. Sabaratnam, this incident had severe repercussions alongside the contributing factors of the civil war. The city and its district were severely affected by the 30-year civil war that followed. In the mid 1980s, India became concerned that the US Navy might gain access to Trincomalee. India was suspicious about goodwill visits by the US Navy to the port and Sri Lankan proposals to contract out the refurbishment of oil storage tanks and modernisation of port facilities at Trincomalee. Today SLNS Tissa and SLN Dockyard are used by the Sri Lankan Navy, while the Sri Lanka Air Force is based at China Bay Airport. The Sri Lanka Army has its Security Forces Headquarters - East in Trincomalee. The Trincomalee War Cemetery is one of the six commonwealth war cemeteries in Sri Lanka. It is maintained by Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The base is home to a naval museum called the Hoods Tower Museum. The name refers to a watchtower built on a hill commanding a 360-degree view of the harbor and the bay. In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Trincomalee was a focal point for relief efforts on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka.http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&artid;=14006 Canadian Red Cross  Historical sites  Lover's Leap was suicide spot to failed lovers. They jumped from the edge of Swami Rock into Indian Ocean Trincomalee is sacred to Sri Lankan Tamils and Hindus around the world. The city has many Hindu sites of historical importance. These sites are sacred to the Hindus and some Buddhists also worship at these Hindu sites. Prominent sites include the Koneswaram temple compound, its Bhadrakali temple on Konesar Road, and the Salli Muthumariamman Kovil of Uppuveli beach in the Trincomalee suburb of Sambalativu.  Hindu historical sites  The Koneswaram temple, with a recorded history from the 3rd century BCE and legends attesting to classical antiquity attracted pilgrims from all parts of India. The shrine itself was demolished in 1622 by the Portuguese (who called it the Temple of a Thousand Columns), and who fortified the heights with the materials derived from its destruction. Some of the artifacts from the demolished temple were kept in the Lisbon Museum including the stone inscription by Kulakottan (Kunakottan). The site's ruins include an emblem including two fish and is engraved with a prophecy stating that, after the 16th century, westerners with different eye colours will rule the country for 500 years and, at the end of it, rule will revert to the northerners (Vadukkus. The Hindu temple was also documented in several medieval texts such as the Konesar Kalvettu and the Dakshina Kailasa Puranam.C.S. Navaratnam, A Short History of Hinduism in Ceylon, Jaffna, 1964. Pages 43‚Äì47  The Dutch Fort  The entrance to the roadway leading to Koneswaram is actually the entrance to what used to be Fort Fredrick. The fort was built in 1623 by the Portuguese and captured in 1639 by the Dutch. It then went through a phase of dismantling and reconstruction and was attacked and captured by the French in 1672. Harbour Trincomalee's strategic importance has shaped its recent history. The great European powers vied for mastery of the harbour. The Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the British, each held it in turn, and there have been many sea battles nearby. The harbour, the fifth largest natural harbour in the world, is overlooked by terraced highlands, its entrance is guarded by two headlands, and there is a carriage road along its northern and eastern edges. Trincomalee's location, in a less well developed and sparsely populated area, has in the past hampered its own development. Nevertheless, plans are under way to develop Trincomalee as a commercial seaport. Oil depot In 2015, India and Sri Lanka agreed to develop South Asia's largest oil depot at a port near Trincomalee. Indian Oil Corporation will work with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to develop the Upper Tank Farm at the abandoned World War II port, known as China Bay. Beaches Marble beach, Trincomalee Trincomalee has some of the most picturesque and scenic beaches found in Sri Lanka, relatively unspoilt and clean. The area is famous for bathing and swimming, owing to the relative shallowness of the sea, allowing one to walk out over a hundred meters into the sea without the water reaching the chest. Whale watching is a common pastime in the seas off Trincomalee, and successful sightings are on the rise with the increase of tourism in the area. If the weather is fine you may observe the process of fishing right on the beach. Marble Beach is located in 16 km (10 miles) from Trincomalee. Hot springs There are the seven hot springs of Kanniya (Kan = stone; niya = land), on the road to Trincomalee. A high wall bounds the rectangular enclosure which includes all seven springs. Each is in turn enclosed by a dwarf wall to form a well. The water is warm, the temperature of each spring being slightly different. Climate Trincomalee features a tropical wet and dry climate (As) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The city features a dry season from March through June and a wet season for the remainder of the year. The city sees on average roughly of precipitation annually. Average temperatures in Trincomalee range from around in December and January to approximately during the warmest months of the year from April through September. Extreme temperatures in the city range from in 28 February 1947 to in 13 May 1890. Transport and communications Road and rail Trincomalee is on the eastern end of the A6 and A12 highways in Sri Lanka, as well as the northern end of the A15. The city is also served by Sri Lanka Railways. Trincomalee Railway Station is the terminus of Trincomalee-bound rail services, the majority of which originate from Colombo Fort.\\"Sri Lanka Railways Timetable\\" The station lies close to the northern coast and beaches of the city. Broadcasting German broadcaster Deutsche Welle operated a shortwave and mediumwave relay station in Trincomalee, which was handed over to the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in 2013. It was not adversely affected by the tsunami of 2004 because of the sea terrain around Trincomalee. Deutsche Welle started broadcasting from Trincomalee Relay Station in 1984. Education The Naval and Maritime Academy of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Air Force Academy of the Sri Lanka Air Force is situated in Trincomalee. It was first established in 1967, and gained university status in 2001. The Eastern University of Sri Lanka, which has its main campus in Batticaloa, also has a campus in Trincomalee.

Candidates for the examination, or agr√©gatifs, become agr√©g√©s once they are admitted to the position of professeur agr√©g√©. In France, professeurs agr√©g√©s are distinguished from professeurs certifi√©s recruited through the CAPES training. The agr√©g√©s are usually expected to teach at high schools (lyc√©es) and universities, while the certifi√©s usually teach in junior high schools (coll√®ges), although there is a significant overlap. The examination may require more than a year of preparation. The difficulty and selectivity (quota) vary from one discipline to another: there are about 300 such positions open each year for mathematics alone, but usually fewer positions are made available for humanities and social sciences (for example, 61 positions for philosophy were offered in 2018) and perhaps only one seat in some rarely taught foreign languages such as Japanese. In addition to the vast majority of agr√©g√©s teaching in lyc√©es, some agr√©g√©s teach in the preparatory classes to the grandes √©coles or at the university level. Some agr√©g√©s teach in regular universities but do not, nominally, do scientific research as other university academics do; the positions are known as PRAG. Some positions (agr√©g√© pr√©parateur, AGPR), including research, exist in the √©coles normales sup√©rieures, but they are very few. The agr√©gation is typically open only to holders of a five-year university diploma (master's degree) or above. There is also an internal agr√©gation for professeurs certifi√©s, but it lacks the prestige of the external one although it remains selective (90 laureate/215 who passed the writing exams/873 who tried the writing exams/2001 candidates in 2010 in History-Geography). The following discusses the external one. The competitive exam generally consists of a written session (admissibility), composed, for humanities and social sciences, of numerous dissertations and analysis of documents, when most candidates are eliminated. The remaining candidates then have to go through an oral part (admission), composed of different oral exams in which candidates must demonstrate their ability to prepare and give lessons on any topic within the scope of his discipline. The oral exams provide the opportunity to verify that the candidates possess the appropriate oral skills and have mastered the main exercises of their discipline: for example, in the Agr√©gation of Classics (French, Greek, Latin), candidates have to translate and comment on classical texts and texts from French literature. It is a way to establish whether candidates are able to fulfill requirements that they are going to need to satisfy if they make the cut. In most disciplines, the lessons expected extend well above the secondary education level; indeed, the candidate may even have to present a lesson appropriate for the second, third, or even fourth years of specialized courses at the university level. One reason is that the agr√©g√©s should be able to teach in special undergraduate sections of high schools, known as preparatory classes to the grandes √©coles and very similar in nature to grammar schools, and the level may be far above the normal level of the first or second year of college education. The agr√©gation is also used as an unofficial national ranking system for students, giving a fair comparison between students of different universities. That is especially true in the humanities, for which the agr√©gation is highly selective and supposedly demonstrates erudition of the candidate.

Life The name may be Celtic and generic title for a prophetess (from Proto-Celtic *welet- \\"seer\\", a derivative of the root *wel- \\"to see\\").Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, 2nd ed., Errance, 2003, p. 311Koch, John (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1728 The ancient Germanic peoples discerned a divinity of prophecy in women and regarded prophetesses as true and living goddesses. In the latter half of the 1st century AD Veleda was regarded as a deity by most of the tribes in central Germany and enjoyed wide influence.Harry Thurston Peck, Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities, 2nd edition, p. 1640. New York: Cooper Square Publishers, Inc., 1965. Originally published in this form in 1897. She lived in a tower near the Lippe River, a tributary of the Rhine.Sir James George Frazer, The Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion, One-volume abridged edition, p. 97. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1947. Originally published in this form in 1922. The inhabitants of the Roman settlement of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (now Cologne) accepted her arbitration in a conflict with the Tencteri, an unfederated tribe of Germany (i.e., one outside the boundary of the Roman Empire). In her role as arbitrator, the envoys were not admitted to her presence; an interpreter conveyed their messages to her and reported her pronouncements.  Batavian Uprising  The Batavian leader Civilis originally raised his force as an ally of Vespasian during the Roman power struggle in AD 69, but when he saw the weakened condition of the legions in Romanized Germany he openly revolted. It is not clear whether Veleda merely prophesied the rebellion or actively incited it; given the Germans' adoration of her as a goddess, remote in her tower, the distinction may not have been clear at the time. Early in AD 70 the revolt was joined by Julius Classicus and Julius Tutor, leaders of the Treviri who like Civilis were Roman citizens. The Roman garrison at Novaesium (now Neuss) surrendered without a fight, as did the one at Castra Vetera (near modern Xanten in Niederrhein, Germany).Michael Grant, The Army of the Caesars, pp. 207-208. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1974. The commander of the Roman garrison, Munius Lupercus, was sent to Veleda, though he was killed en route, evidently in an ambush. Later, when the praetorian trireme was captured, it was rowed upriver on the Lippe as a gift to Veleda. A strong show of force by nine Roman legions under Gaius Licinius Mucianus caused the rebellion to collapse. Civilis was cornered on his home island of Batavia on the lower Rhine by a force commanded by Quintus Petillius Cerialis; his fate is unknown, but in general Cerialis treated the rebels with surprising lenience, so as to reconcile them to Roman rule and military service. In Veleda's case, she was left at liberty for several years. In AD 77 the Romans either captured her, perhaps as a hostage, or offered her asylum. According to Statius, her captor was then-Governor of Germania Inferior Rutilius Gallicus.Statius, Silvae 1.4, line 90; J.G.W. Henderson, A Roman Life: Rutilius Gallicus On Paper and In Stone. Exeter, UK: University of Exeter Press, 1998. A Greek epigram has been found at Ardea, a few kilometres south of Rome, that satirizes her prophetic powers.Ann√©e √âpigraphique 1953, 25. Veleda may have acted in the interest of Rome by negotiating the acceptance of a pro-Roman king by the Bructeri in AD 83 or 84. She was evidently long since deceased by the time Tacitus wrote his Germania in AD 98.Tacitus, Germany, 8.2. Translation with Commentary by Herbert W. Benario. Warminster, UK: Aris & Phillips Ltd., 1999. Legacy Velleda, as imagined in a 19th-century painting by Charles Voillemot. In her 1795 novel Velleda, ein Zauberroman (Velleda, a Magic Novel), Benedikte Naubert conflated the lives of two contemporaries, Boudica and Veleda, whom she romanticized as Boadicea and Velleda. In Naubert's work, Velleda is portrayed as a sorceress who offers Boadicea's daughters access to immortality in the magical world of Germanic goddesses, while Boadicea draws her daughters back to the real world. A large extract from Naubert's novel appeared in Shawn C. Jarvis and Jeannine Blackwell's The Queen's Mirror, as did Amalie von Helwig's 1814 story \\"Die Symbole\\" (The Symbols), in which she was called Welleda.Shawn C. Jarvis and Jeannine Blackwell (eds. and trans.), The Queen's Mirror. Fairy Tales by German Women, 1780‚Äì1900, pp. 33‚Äì74, 117‚Äì125. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2001. The forms \\"Velleda\\" and \\"Welleda\\" appear to be attempts to render the name in modern German (much as Richard Wagner rendered Odin or W≈çden as Wotan in his Ring cycle). Other 19th-century works incorporating Veleda/Velleda/Welleda included Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqu√©'s 1818 novel, Welleda und Gemma; Eduard Sobolewski's 1835 opera Velleda; E.H. Maindron's 1843‚Äì44 marble sculpture Velleda; Franz Sigret's drawing Veleda, Prophetess of the Bructeri, and Paul Dukas' cantata Vell√©da. More recently, Veleda's story was fictionalized by Poul Anderson in Star of the Sea (1991), and by Lindsey Davis in The Iron Hand of Mars (1992) and Saturnalia (2007). Veleda is also referenced as a prophetess turned saint/goddess in The Veil of Years (2001) by L. Warren Douglas. She is also a character in The Dragon Lord (1979), by David Drake. On November 5, 1872, Paul Henry of Paris discovered an asteroid which was named 126 Velleda in honor of Veleda.

Bozrah ( ; also Botsra, Botzrah) is a biblical city identified by some researchers with an archaeological site situated in the village of Busaira. In biblical narrative Bozrah in Edom Bozrah means sheepfold or enclosure in Hebrew and was a pastoral city in Edom southeast of the Dead Sea. According to the biblical narrative, it was the home city of one of Edom's kings, Jobab son of Zerah () and the homeland of Jacob's twin brother, Esau. :And these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before the reigning of a king over the sons of Israel ... And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah, from Bozrah, reigned in his place. () The prophets Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah predicted Bozrah's destruction: :But I will send a fire against Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. (). :The Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. (). :\\"I swear by myself\\", declares the Lord, \\"that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruin forever\\". (). According to Isaiah 63:1‚Äì6, the Lord will come from Edom (modern-day Jordan) and Bozrah in blood-stained clothing on \\"the day of vengeance\\" and \\"the year of My redeemed\\" (cf. : He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood). Christian \\"Bozrah\\" of the end times According to one Christian interpretation of , Bozrah, (or a place the Bible cryptically refers to as Bozrah), will also be the scene of a magnificent \\"break-out\\" of God's covenant people. According to this interpretation, the deliverance will come at an Edomite controlled place of exile and incarceration in the end times. This epic event referred to in Micah 2:12‚Äì13 has been referred to by Dr Gavin Finley as \\"the Bozrah deliverance\\".‚ÄúThe Bozrah Deliverance‚Äù. Finley, Gavin. End Times Pilgrim. August 2006. Retrieved October 29, 2017. Bozrah is in Hebrew, but most translators render it as \\"fold\\"‚Äîsheep in the fold. This \\"break-out\\" could be tied to , when Yahweh fights against the nations, stands on the Mount of Olives (east of Jerusalem), and splits the Mount in two as a valley, so that the remnant of Israel trapped in Jerusalem can escape those who would kill them. If so, Micah 2:12‚Äì13 would not relate to the locale of Bozrah. The notion of a remnant in Jerusalem fleeing through a split Mount of Olives derives from the Masoretic reading of Zechariah 14:5. The Septuagint (LXX) translation states in Zechariah 14:5 that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King Uzziah's reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in Antiquities of the Jews that the valley in the area of the King's Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake.Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, book 9, chapter 10, paragraph 4, verse 225, William Whiston Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area.Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte, Earthquake Risk and Slope Stability in Jerusalem, Environmental Geology and Water Sciences, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 183‚Äì186, 1984 Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archaeologist in Palestine, postulated that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal,Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine, Vol. 1. pg. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, April 1874, pg. 102 the location mentioned in Zechariah 14:5 to which the remnant in Jerusalem is to flee supposedly. This location accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5, which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. If Clermont-Ganneau is correct, the notion of people fleeing east through the Mount of Olives to Azal is impossible because the valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies south of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.

According to Centrum Informatie en Documentatie Israel (CIDI) a think tank established by the Jewish community in the Netherlands in 1974: > In April 2002 the Antwerp-based Arab European League (AEL) leader Dyab Abou > Jahjah (1971) performed for the first time at a pro-Palestine demonstration > in Antwerp that got completely out of hand, \\"Where flags of Israel were set > on fire and demonstrators shouted anti-Semitic chant\\" (De Volkskrant, > 11/5/02). \\"Jews are dogs,\\" was heard in the streets (Reformatorisch Dagblad, > March 1, 2003). In June 2002, the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism lodged a complaint against the Arab European League for infringing the anti- racist law. A demonstration tookplace the same month co-organized with the Flemish Green party and NGO's such as 11.11.11 and Kif Kif, during which a puppet representing an orthodox Jew was burned publicly.

On February 2006 AEL posted anti-Semitic cartoons on its website, included one showing Anne Frank in bed with Adolf Hitler.Paul Belien \\"On Morality, Hate Crimes and War Mongering,\\" The Brussels Journal: The Voice of the Conservatism in Europe (2006-02-09). In late September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands- Posten published several controversial Muhammad cartoons in which the prophet Muhammad was associated with terrorism. After Belgian and Dutch newspapers republished the cartoons and politicians defended the publication with the argument of free speech, both denouncing the protests of Muslims and the AEL, the AEL issued statements and posted cartoons on the subject of Holocaust denial on its web pages using the same argument of \\"free speech\\" and denouncing official protests against them in return. The cartoons were called antisemitic and negationist by De Standaard, a Belgian newspaper. A Dutch pro- Israel organization \\"\\" (CIDI) filed a formal complaint in Amsterdam against the AEL following the publication of the cartoons. In response to the charge, the AEL stated not to \\"endorse any anti-Semitic, homophobic or sexist stands.\\" (and added something like:) \\"All we are trying to do is to confront Europe with its own hypocrisy using sarcasm and cartoons.\\"Important points on the Cartoon riot, AEL, 7 February 2006 In January 2009, the AEL was reported to be the driving force behind Anti- Jewish violence during anti-Israel protests in Antwerp. On August 19, 2010 the organisation was fined by a Dutch appeals court 2,500 euros ($3,200) for publishing a cartoon which suggested the Holocaust was made up or exaggerated by Jews. Homophobia Salon.com states that an AEL official called for the death penalty for homosexuals prior to assuming a leadership position within the group. In 2003, the political party Agalev (currently known as Groen!) attempted to place posters in Antwerp of gay and lesbian couples kissing while dressed in Islamic attire. The AEL considered it blasphemous and as an insult to Islam because according to them, the Qur'an explicitly forbids homosexuality.

This strategy enables the video signal to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances. In general, video modulation means that a higher frequency carrier wave is modified according to the original video signal. In this way, carrier wave contains the information in the video signal. Then, the carrier will \\"carry\\" the information in the form of radio frequency (RF) signal. When carrier reaches its destination, the video signal is extracted from the carrier by decoding. In other words, the video signal is first combined with a higher frequency carrier wave so that carrier wave contains the information in video signal. The combined signal is called radio-frequency signal. At the end of this transmitting system, the RF signals stream from a light sensor and hence, the receivers can obtain the initial data in the original video signal. There are many application of video modulation: * Broadcasting music and speech * Two way radio systems (a radio that can both transmit and receive) * Aircraft band (radio communication in civil aviation) * Computer modems (a device that modulates Wi-Fi) These applications all utilized the efficiency of video modulation in order to minimize costs.  Key Concepts  There are some important concepts needed to be understand in order to fully comprehend the video modulation.  Circuit  Video signals are usually encoded into binary digit (0, 1) or seven digit pulse-code modulation (PCM), which is a method used to digitally represent original video signal. The video signal converted to binary digit PCM at the point of origin can be then transmitted over existing telephone cable or wire directly to the destination. If the distance between origin and destination is too long, a repeater is needed to receive the signal and retransmit it at higher power so that the signal can cover longer distances. The circuit designed for the transmission should gather as many advantages as possible in order to be efficient. In other words, the circuit should be built with high quality and reliability and with minimum cost. The most common cable used to build the circuit is the 51-pair cable. This type of cable is often utilized in house phone because of the low price and good functionality. Also, signals can be transmitted efficiently since the distance between two adjacent repeaters can be 6000 feet rather than only 3000 feet compared to other cable.  Coding  Coding is the process during which the video inputs are transferred into binary digit (0, 1) because digits can be much more easily transmitted. A crystal oscillator is used in coding. It is an electronic oscillator that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal or piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. Inside the crystal oscillator, there is usually a crystal or elastic material whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are in a regular order. For example, the quartz is often used in crystal oscillators due to its elasticity. After a crystal is accurately installed, electric field can be distorted by a change in the voltage due to an electrode near or on the crystal. This characteristic is called electrostriction or inverse piezoelectricity. When the video signals are inputted into the oscillators, the crystal with electrodes attaching to it starts to vibrate as a resonator. The crystal's piezoelectric property converts the mechanical vibrations into an oscillating voltage and then the voltage is picked up by the attached electrodes. Thus, the electric field is distorted due to the potential differences between the electrodes. Since the original video signal exists as a time-varying voltage on a wire, the distorted electric field is also time-varying. The changing electric field is converted into waveform, a signal in the shape/form of wave. Finally, the output signals are combined with a carrier wave and transferred into RF signals, then transmitted to the receiver.  Decoding  After the RF signals arrive the destination, the receiver can not obtain the data directly from the RF signals because there are coded and multiplied RF signals existing at the same time. As for the multiple RF signals problem, an electric filter is used. The frequency of each RF signal is usually different from other RF signals. An electronic filter can select only one RF signal on the basis of its carrier frequency, while rejecting all other RF signals. One example of this operation is selecting a channel on a television receiver. With only one RF signal that passes through the electric filter, only the one corresponding video signal is received, with no interference from the other RF signals. For the coded RF signals, a light sensor is utilized. Generally, a light sensor is a device that detects changes of light in quantities and provides a corresponding output. One application of light sensors is the compensated light sensor system. This system can control the level of light at a workplace. The ratio of the light at the light sensors to the level of controlled light at the workplace is maintained substantially constant as daylight entering the room varies. In decoding process, a light sensor is used to detect the RF signal and then output the decoded signal. In general, the RF signals steamed from electric filters are first converted from binary digit to octal digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The octal signals are then detected by the light sensors. The sensors respond by developing corresponding digital, electrical signals which are hence decoded to apprise the viewer of the transmitted message or are applied to external equipment such as a calculator, a computer, a hard copy machine or other devices appropriate for the particular occasion.  Types of video modulation  The types of video modulation can be classified by the way that a carrier wave is combined with video signal. The video signal and carrier wave both exist in waveform and when the carrier wave \\"carries\\" the video signal, the shape of carrier wave is changed and the changed carrier wave is the RF signal. Hence, how the shape of carrier wave is changed is the key to classify the types of video modulation.  Amplitude modulation (AM)  Amplitude modulation works by varying the amplitude of the carrier wave according to the bent waveform of original video signal. In other words, when the carrier wave is combined with the video signal, frequency of the combined signal is the same as the frequency of the carrier wave while the amplitude is varied. The picture above can more directly explain how the shape is changed. In the combining process, if the video signal is at its peak (highest amplitude value), the amplitude of the varied carrier wave will be the highest and as for trough (lowest amplitude value), the amplitude of varied carrier wave will be the lowest. In other words, at the point in carrier wave that corresponds to the peak of video signal, the shape of wave will be most bulged and at the point corresponding to the trough, the shape will be most sunk. In fact, the change in amplitude of carrier wave is proportional to the amplitude of the video signal.  Frequency modulation (FM)  In frequency modulation, the carrier wave is combined with video signal by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave (the frequency of wave at a particular point). (Compare with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency remains constant.) From the picture above, if the video signal is at its peak, the instantaneous frequency of carrier wave will increase and as for the trough, the instantaneous frequency will decrease. More visually, the carrier wave becomes densest at the point corresponding to the peak in video signal and thinnest at the point corresponding to the trough.  Applications  Various types of video modulation can be applied in various areas due to their unique advantages and disadvantages.  Application of AM  * Radio or television (broadcasting) * Aircraft band AM is applied in these areas because video amplitude modulated signal can be easily coded and decoded since the change in amplitude of the carrier wave and the amplitude of original video signal is proportional. However, amplitude modulation is sensitive to noise and electromagnetic interference. Hence, the AM techniques are mainly utilized in less technical fields that tolerate noise and electromagnetic interference, such as broadcasting.  Application of FM  * Magnetic tape data storage * VCR systems FM is applied in these fields because it is less sensitive to the noise and electromagnetic interference and when the data is collected or the signal is recorded, it is really important to minimize the effects of outside interference, such as noise and electromagnetic interference.

In visible light, this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end.  Doppler blueshift  Doppler redshift and blueshift Doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the naked eye, but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel. Doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion: * The Andromeda Galaxy is moving toward our own Milky Way galaxy within the Local Group; thus, when observed from Earth, its light is undergoing a blueshift. * Components of a binary star system will be blueshifted when moving towards Earth * When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning toward us will have a slight blueshift relative to the side spinning away from us (see Tully‚ÄìFisher relation). * Blazars are known to propel relativistic jets toward us, emitting synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung that appears blueshifted. * Nearby stars such as Barnard's Star are moving toward us, resulting in a very small blueshift. * Doppler blueshift of distant objects with a high z can be subtracted from the much larger cosmological redshift to determine relative motion in the expanding universe.  Gravitational blueshift  Matter waves (protons, electrons, photons, etc.) falling into a gravity well become more energetic and undergo observer-independent blueshifting. Unlike the relative Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is absolute and does not depend on the received angle of the photon: It is a natural consequence of conservation of energy and mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment. Gravitational blueshift contributes to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy via the Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of gravitational redshift as it leaves the region.  Blue outliers  There are faraway active galaxies that show a blueshift in their [O III] emission lines. One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line quasar, PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of -1150 km/s. These types of galaxies are called \\"blue outliers\\". Cosmological blueshift In a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway Big Crunch contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted‚Äîthe exact opposite of the actually observed cosmological redshift in the present expanding universe.

During the trip, they had stopped at Bari in Italy; Valona in Albania; Thessaloniki, Greece; Izmir, Aydin, and Antalya in Turkey; Aleppo, Baghdad, and Basrah in Mesopotamia; Bushehr, Bandar Abbas, and Chabar in Persia; and in rural Baluchistan (for repairs), Hyderabad, at an unnamed place (for repairs), and in Karachi, and Delhi in British India. At Delhi, Masiero's SVA-9 had been destroyed in a hard landing, so he and his mechanic had taken a train to Calcutta, while Ferrarin and his mechanic had flown on to Calcutta, stopping at Allahabad and flying over the Taj Mahal at Agra along the way. From Calcutta, the two pilots had switched to new SVA-9s and flown on to Rangoon in Burma; Bangkok and Ubon in Siam; Hanoi in French Indochina; Portuguese Macao; and Canton and Foochow in China, where Masiero's SVA-9 had been destroyed in a crash. Masiero and his mechanic had then traveled to Shanghai by boat while Ferrarin flew there. At Shanghai, Masiero had taken possession of a new SVA-9 and the two pilots had flown on to Tsingtao and Mukden in China; Sinuiju, Seoul, and Taegu in Chosen; and then across the Sea of Japan to a stop at Osaka, Japan, before arriving at Yoyogi Army Field in Tokyo.
