Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8‚Äì4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. The traditional shape of the molds used for pig iron ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or \\"runner\\", resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the \\"pigs\\") were simply broken from the runner (the \\"sow\\"), hence the name \\"pig iron\\". As pig iron is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand caused only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them. History Casting pig iron, Iroquois smelter, Chicago, between 1890 and 1901 Smelting and producing wrought iron was known in ancient Europe and the Middle East, but it was produced in bloomeries by direct reduction. Pig iron was not produced in Europe before the Middle Ages. The Chinese were making pig iron by the later Zhou dynasty (which ended in 256 BC).Wagner, Donald. Iron and Steel in Ancient China. Leiden 1996: Brill Publishers Furnaces such as Lapphyttan in Sweden may date back to the 12th century; and some in Mark (today part of Westphalia, Germany) to the 13th.Several papers in The importance of ironmaking: technical innovation and social change: papers presented at the Norberg Conference, May 1995 ed. Gert Magnusson (Jernkontorets Berghistoriska Utskott H58, 1995), 143-179. It remains to be established whether these northern European developments derive from Chinese ones. Wagnerhttps://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_1995_num_82_1_2347 has postulated a possible link via Persian contacts with China along the Silk Road and Viking contacts with Persia, but there is a chronological gap between the Viking period and Lapphyttan. The phase transition of the iron into liquid in the furnace was an avoided phenomenon, as decarburizing the pig iron into steel was an extremely tedious process using medieval technology. Uses Traditionally, pig iron was worked into wrought iron in finery forges, later puddling furnaces, and more recently, into steel.R. F. Tylecote, A history of metallurgy (2nd edition, Institute of Materials, London, 1992). In these processes, pig iron is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated. This causes the dissolved impurities (such as silicon) to be thoroughly oxidized. An intermediate product of puddling is known as refined pig iron, finers metal, or refined iron. Pig iron can also be used to produce gray iron. This is achieved by remelting pig iron, often along with substantial quantities of steel and scrap iron, removing undesirable contaminants, adding alloys, and adjusting the carbon content. Some pig iron grades are suitable for producing ductile iron. These are high purity pig irons and depending on the grade of ductile iron being produced these pig irons may be low in the elements silicon, manganese, sulfur and phosphorus. These types of pig iron are used to dilute all the elements (except carbon) in a ductile iron charge which may be harmful to the ductile iron process. = Modern uses = Until recently, pig iron was typically poured directly out of the bottom of the blast furnace through a trough into a ladle car for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as hot metal. The hot metal was then poured into a steelmaking vessel to produce steel, typically an electric arc furnace, induction furnace or basic oxygen furnace, where the excess carbon is burned off and the alloy composition controlled. Earlier processes for this included the finery forge, the puddling furnace, the Bessemer process, and the open hearth furnace. Modern steel mills and direct-reduction iron plants transfer the molten iron to a ladle for immediate use in the steel making furnaces or cast it into pigs on a pig-casting machine for reuse or resale. Modern pig casting machines produce stick pigs, which break into smaller 4‚Äì10 kg piglets at discharge.

This is said verbally, \\"Twenty divided by four equals five.\\" Division is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the ways that numbers are combined to make new numbers. The other operations are addition, subtraction, and multiplication (which can be viewed as the inverse of division). The division sign , a symbol consisting of a short horizontal line with a dot above and another dot below, is often used to indicate mathematical division. This usage, though widespread in anglophone countries, is neither universal nor recommended: the ISO 80000-2 standard for mathematical notation recommends only the solidus or fraction bar for division, or the colon for ratios; it says that this symbol \\"should not be used\\" for division.ISO 80000-2, Section 9 \\"Operations\\", 2-9.6 At an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is ‚Äì among other possible interpretations ‚Äì the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one. This number of times is not always an integer (a number that can be obtained using the other arithmetic operations on the natural numbers), which led to two different concepts. The division with remainder or Euclidean division of two natural numbers provides a quotient, which is the number of times the second one is contained in the first one, and a remainder, which is the part of the first number that remains, when in the course of computing the quotient, no further full chunk of the size of the second number can be allocated. For a modification of this division to yield only one single result, the natural numbers must be extended to rational numbers (the numbers that can be obtained by using arithmetic on natural numbers) or real numbers. In these enlarged number systems, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is means , as long as is not zero. If , then this is a division by zero, which is not defined. Both forms of division appear in various algebraic structures, different ways of defining mathematical structure. Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called Euclidean domains and include polynomial rings in one indeterminate (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called fields and division rings. In a ring the elements by which division is always possible are called the units (for example, 1 and ‚Äì1 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the quotient group, in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number. Introduction The simplest way of viewing division is in terms of quotition and partition: from the quotition perspective, means the number of 5s that must be added to get 20\\\\. In terms of partition, means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into five groups of four apples, meaning that twenty divided by five is equal to four. This is denoted as , or . What is being divided is called the dividend, which is divided by the divisor, and the result is called the quotient. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient. Unlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a remainder that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a fractional part, so is equal to or , but in the context of integer division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (exceptionally, discarded or rounded). When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a rational number. The set of all rational numbers is created by extending the integers with all possible results of divisions of integers. Unlike multiplication and addition, division is not commutative, meaning that is not always equal to .http://www.mathwords.com/c/commutative.htm Retrieved October 23, 2018 Division is also not, in general, associative, meaning that when dividing multiple times, the order of division can change the result.http://www.mathwords.com/a/associative_operation.htm Retrieved October 23, 2018 For example, , but (where the use of parentheses indicates that the operations inside parentheses are performed before the operations outside parentheses). However, division is traditionally considered as left- associative. That is, if there are multiple divisions in a row, the order of calculation goes from left to right:George Mark Bergman: Order of arithmetic operations Education Place: The Order of Operations : a / b / c = (a / b) / c = a / (b \\\\times c) e a/(b/c)= (a\\\\times c)/b. Division is right-distributive over addition and subtraction, in the sense that : \\\\frac{a \\\\pm b}{c} = (a \\\\pm b) / c = (a/c)\\\\pm (b/c) =\\\\frac{a}{c} \\\\pm \\\\frac{b}{c}. This is the same for multiplication, as (a + b) \\\\times c = a \\\\times c + b \\\\times c. However, division is not left-distributive, as : \\\\frac{a}{b + c} = a / (b + c) e (a/b) + (a/c) = \\\\frac{ac+ab}{bc}. This is unlike the case in multiplication, which is both left-distributive and right-distributive, and thus distributive.  Notation  Plus and minuses. An obelus used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called ¬´N√¶ringsoppgave 1¬ª for the taxation year 2010. Division is often shown in algebra and science by placing the dividend over the divisor with a horizontal line, also called a fraction bar, between them. For example, \\"a divided by b\\" can written as: :\\\\frac ab which can also be read out loud as \\"divide a by b\\" or \\"a over b\\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the dividend (or numerator), then a slash, then the divisor (or denominator), as follows: :a/b This is the usual way of specifying division in most computer programming languages, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of ASCII characters. Some mathematical software, such as MATLAB and GNU Octave, allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the backslash as the division operator: :b\\\\backslash a A typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a solidus (fraction slash), but elevates the dividend and lowers the divisor: :{}^{a}/{}_{b} Any of these forms can be used to display a fraction. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers (typically called the numerator and denominator), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the division sign (√∑, also known as obelus though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner: :a \\\\div b This form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. ISO 80000-2-9.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician Johann Rahn in 1659 in Teutsche Algebra. The √∑ symbol is used to indicate subtraction in some European countries, so its use may be misunderstood. In some non-English-speaking countries, a colon is used to denote division: :a : b This notation was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in his 1684 Acta eruditorum. Leibniz disliked having separate symbols for ratio and division. However, in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios. Since the 19th century, US textbooks have used b)a or b \\\\overline{)a} to denote a divided by b, especially when discussing long division. The history of this notation is not entirely clear because it evolved over time.  Computing  =Manual methods= Division is often introduced through the notion of \\"sharing out\\" a set of objects, for example a pile of lollies, into a number of equal portions. Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of 'chunking' a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. By allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well. More systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the multiplication tables can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of short division, if the divisor is small, or long division, if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a fractional part (expressed as a decimal fraction), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction. A person can calculate division with an abacus by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset. A person can use logarithm tables to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result. A person can calculate division with a slide rule by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point. =By computer or with computer assistance= Modern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For division with remainder, see Division algorithm. In modular arithmetic (modulo a prime number) and for real numbers, nonzero numbers have a multiplicative inverse. In these cases, a division by may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of . This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic. Division in different contexts = Euclidean division = Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, a, the dividend, and b, the divisor, such that b ‚â† 0, there are unique integers q, the quotient, and r, the remainder, such that a = bq + r and 0 ‚â§ r < , where denotes the absolute value of b. = Of integers = Integers are not closed under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches: # Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a partial function. # Give an approximate answer as a \\"real\\" number. This is the approach usually taken in numerical computation. # Give the answer as a fraction representing a rational number, so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is \\\\tfrac{26}{11} (or as a mixed number, so \\\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\\\tfrac 4{11}.) Usually the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also \\\\tfrac{26}{11}. This simplification may be done by factoring out the greatest common divisor. # Give the answer as an integer quotient and a remainder, so \\\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\\\mbox{ remainder } 4. To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called Euclidean division, because it is the basis of the Euclidean algorithm. # Give the integer quotient as the answer, so \\\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2. This is sometimes called integer division. Dividing integers in a computer program requires special care. Some programming languages, such as C, treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as MATLAB and every computer algebra system return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3. Names and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\\\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward ‚àí‚àû (F-division); rarer styles can occur ‚Äì see Modulo operation for the details. Divisibility rules can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another. = Of rational numbers = The result of dividing two rational numbers is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers p/q and r/s can be computed as :{p/q \\\\over r/s} = {p \\\\over q} \\\\times {s \\\\over r} = {ps \\\\over qr}. All four quantities are integers, and only p may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. = Of real numbers = Division of two real numbers results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that a/b = c if and only if a = cb and b ‚â† 0. = Of complex numbers = Dividing two complex numbers (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator: :{p+iq \\\\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\\\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\\\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\\\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\\\over r^2+s^2}. This process of multiplying and dividing by r-is is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) rationalisation. All four quantities p, q, r, s are real numbers, and r and s may not both be 0. Division for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above: :{p e^{iq} \\\\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\\\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\\\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. Again all four quantities p, q, r, s are real numbers, and r may not be 0. = Of polynomials = One can define the division operation for polynomials in one variable over a field. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See Euclidean division of polynomials, and, for hand-written computation, polynomial long division or synthetic division. = Of matrices = One can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define , where denotes the inverse of B, but it is far more common to write out explicitly to avoid confusion. An elementwise division can also be defined in terms of the Hadamard product.  Left and right division  Because matrix multiplication is not commutative, one can also define a left division or so-called backslash-division as . For this to be well defined, need not exist, however does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by is sometimes called right division or slash-division in this context. Note that with left and right division defined this way, is in general not the same as , nor is the same as . However, it holds that and .  Pseudoinverse  To avoid problems when and/or do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the pseudoinverse. That is, and , where and denote the pseudoinverses of A and B. = Abstract algebra = In abstract algebra, given a magma with binary operation ‚àó (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of b by a (written ) is typically defined as the solution x to the equation , if this exists and is unique. Similarly, right division of b by a (written ) is the solution y to the equation . Division in this sense does not require ‚àó to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element). \\"Division\\" in the sense of \\"cancellation\\" can be done in any magma by an element with the cancellation property. Examples include matrix algebras and quaternion algebras. A quasigroup is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses. In an integral domain, where not every element need have an inverse, division by a cancellative element a can still be performed on elements of the form ab or ca by left or right cancellation, respectively. If a ring is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the pigeonhole principle, every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and division by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when algebras (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on division algebras. In particular Bott periodicity can be used to show that any real normed division algebra must be isomorphic to either the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, the quaternions H, or the octonions O. = Calculus = The derivative of the quotient of two functions is given by the quotient rule: :{\\\\left(\\\\frac fg\\\\right)}' = \\\\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.  Division by zero  Division of any number by zero in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a product of zero.http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html Retrieved October 23, 2018 Entry of such an expression into most calculators produces an error message. However, in certain higher level mathematics division by zero is possible by the zero ring and algebras such as wheels.Jesper Carlstr√∂m. \\"On Division by Zero\\" Retrieved October 23, 2018 In these algebras, the meaning of division is different from traditional definitions.

In this capacity, Keitel signed a number of criminal orders and directives that led to a war of unprecedented brutality and criminality. Keitel's rise to the Wehrmacht high command began with his appointment as the head of the Armed Forces Office at the Reich Ministry of War in 1935. After Hitler took command of the Wehrmacht in 1938, he replaced the ministry with the OKW, with Keitel as its chief. Keitel was reviled among his military colleagues as Hitler's habitual \\"yes-man\\". After the war, Keitel was indicted by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg as one of the \\"major war criminals\\". He was found guilty on all counts of the indictment: crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, criminal conspiracy, and war crimes. Keitel was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1946.  Early life and pre-Wehrmacht career  Keitel was born in the village of Helmscherode near Gandersheim in the Duchy of Brunswick, Germany. The eldest son of Carl Keitel (1854‚Äì1934), a middle-class landowner, and his wife Apollonia Vissering (1855‚Äì1888), he planned to take over his family's estates after completing his education at a gymnasium but this foundered on his father's resistance. Instead, he embarked on a military career in 1901, becoming an officer cadet of the Prussian Army. As a commoner, he did not join the cavalry, but a field artillery regiment in Wolfenb√ºttel, serving as adjutant from 1908. On 18 April 1909, Keitel married Lisa Fontaine, a wealthy landowner's daughter at W√ºlfel near Hanover. During World War I, Keitel served on the Western Front and took part in the fighting in Flanders, where he was severely wounded. After being promoted to captain, Keitel was then posted to the staff of an infantry division in 1915. After the war, Keitel was retained in the newly created Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic and played a part in organizing the paramilitary Freikorps units on the Polish border. In 1924, Keitel was transferred to the Ministry of the Reichswehr in Berlin, serving with the Truppenamt ('Troop Office'), the post-Versailles disguised German General Staff. Three years later, he returned to field command. Now a lieutenant-colonel, Keitel was again assigned to the Ministry of War in 1929 and was soon promoted to Head of the Organizational Department (\\"T-2\\"), a post he held until Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. Playing a vital role in the German re-armament, he traveled at least once to the Soviet Union to inspect secret Reichswehr training camps. In the autumn of 1932, he suffered a heart attack and double pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, in October 1933, Keitel was appointed as deputy commander of the 3rd Infantry Division; in 1934, he was given command of the 22nd Infantry Division at Bremen. Rise to the Wehrmacht High Command In 1935, at the recommendation of General Werner von Fritsch, Keitel was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed chief of the Reich Ministry of War's Armed Forces Office (Wehrmachtsamt), which oversaw the army, navy, and air force. After assuming office, Keitel was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 January 1936. On 21 January 1938, Keitel received evidence revealing that the wife of his superior, War Minister Werner von Blomberg, was a former prostitute. Upon reviewing this information, Keitel suggested that the dossier be forwarded to Hitler's deputy, Hermann G√∂ring, who used it to bring about Blomberg's resignation. Hitler took command of the Wehrmacht in 1938 and replaced the War Ministry with the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), with Keitel as its chief. As a result of his appointment, Keitel assumed the responsibilities of Germany's War Minister. When after von Blomberg was asked by Hitler (out of respect for him, after his dismissal in 1938) who he would recommend to replace him he had not suggested anyone, and suggested that Hitler himself should take over the job. But he said to Hitler about Keitel (who was his son-in-law) that \\"he's just the man who runs my office\\". Hitler snapped his fingers and exclaimed \\"That‚Äôs exactly the man I‚Äôm looking for\\". So on 4 February 1938 when Hitler became Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Keitel (to the astonishment of the General Staff, including himself) became Chief of Staff. He was 6 ft. 1 in. (1.85 m), a solidly built and square-jawed Prussian. Soon after his promotion, Keitel convinced Hitler to appoint Walther von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, replacing von Fritsch. He became a full general in November 1938.  World War II  Keitel (far left) and other members of the German high command with Adolf Hitler at a military briefing, (c. 1940). Field Marshal Ewald von Kleist labelled Keitel nothing more than a \\"stupid follower of Hitler\\" because of his servile \\"yes man\\" attitude with regard to Hitler. His sycophancy was well known in the army, and he acquired the nickname 'Lakeitel', a pun derived from (\\"lackey\\") and his surname. Hermann G√∂ring's description of Keitel as having \\"a sergeant's mind inside a field marshal's body\\" was a feeling often expressed by his peers. He had been promoted because of his willingness to function as Hitler's mouthpiece. He was known by his peers as a \\"blindingly loyal toady\\" of Hitler, nicknamed \\"Laikeitel\\"; or \\"Nichgeselle\\" after a popular metal toy nodding donkey. During the war he was subject to verbal abuse from Hitler, who said to other officers (according to von Runstedt) that \\"you know he has the brains of a movie usher ... (but he was made the highest ranking officer in the Army) ... because the man‚Äôs as loyal as a dog\\" (said by Hitler with a sly smile). Keitel was predisposed to manipulation because of his limited intellect and nervous disposition; Hitler valued his hard work and obedience. On one occasion, asked who Keitel was: upon finding out he became horrified at his own failure to salute his superior. Franz Halder, however, told him: \\"Don't worry, it's only Keitel\\". German officers consistently bypassed him and went directly to Hitler. After Germany defeated France in the Battle of France in six weeks, Keitel described Hitler as ‚Äúthe greatest warlord of all time‚Äù. The planning for Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, was begun tentatively by Halder with the redeployment of the 18th Army into an offensive position against the Soviet Union. On 31 July 1940, Hitler held a major conference that included Keitel, Halder, Alfred Jodl, Erich Raeder, Brauchitsch and Hans Jeschonnek which further discussed the invasion. The participants did not object to the invasion. Hitler asked for war studies to be completed and Georg Thomas was given the task of completing two studies on economic matters. The first study by Thomas detailed serious problems with fuelling and rubber supplies. Keitel bluntly dismissed the problems, telling Thomas that Hitler would not want to see it. This influenced Thomas' second study which offered a glowing recommendation for the invasion based upon fabricated economic benefits. Keitel played an important role after the failed 20 July plot in 1944. He sat on the Army \\"court of honour\\" that handed over many officers who were involved, including Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, to Roland Freisler's notorious People's Court. Around 7,000 people were arrested, many of whom were tortured by the Gestapo, and around 5,000 were executed. Keitel, signing the ratified surrender terms for the German Army in Berlin, 8/9 May 1945 In April and May 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Keitel called for counterattacks to drive back the Soviet forces and relieve Berlin. However, there were insufficient German forces to carry out such counterattacks. After Hitler's suicide on 30 April, Keitel stayed on as a member of the short-lived Flensburg government under Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz. Upon arriving in Flensburg, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production, said that Keitel grovelled to D√∂nitz in the same way as he had done to Hitler. On 7 May 1945, Alfred Jodl, on behalf of D√∂nitz, signed Germany's unconditional surrender on all fronts. Joseph Stalin considered this an affront, so a second signing was arranged at the Berlin suburb of Karlshorst 8 May. There, Keitel signed the German surrender to the Soviet Union. Five days later he was arrested along with the rest of the Flensburg Government, at the request of the U.S. Role in crimes of the Wehrmacht and the Holocaust Keitel had full knowledge of the criminal nature of the planning and the subsequent Invasion of Poland, agreeing to its aims in principle. The Nazi plans included mass arrests, population transfers and mass murder. Keitel did not contest the regime's assault upon basic human rights or counter the role of the Einsatzgruppen in the murders. The criminal nature of the invasion was now obvious; local commanders continued to express shock and protest over the events they were witnessing. Keitel continued to ignore the protests among the officer corps while they became morally numbed to the atrocities. Keitel issued a series of criminal orders from April 1941. The orders went beyond established codes of conduct for the military and broadly allowed the execution of Jews, civilians and non-combatants for any reason. Those carrying out the murders were exempted from court-martial or later being tried for war crimes. The orders were signed by Keitel; however, other members of the OKW and the OKH, including Halder, wrote or changed the wording of his orders. Commanders in the field interpreted and carried out the orders. In the summer and autumn of 1941, German military lawyers unsuccessfully argued that Soviet prisoners of war should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Keitel rebuffed them, writing: \\"These doubts correspond to military ideas about wars of chivalry. Our job is to suppress a way of life.\\" In September 1941, concerned that some field commanders on the Eastern Front did not exhibit sufficient harshness in implementing the May 1941 order on the \\"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\\", Keitel issued a new order, writing: \\"[The] struggle against Bolshevism demands ruthless and energetic action especially also against the Jews, the main carriers of Bolshevism\\". Also in September, Keitel issued an order to all commanders, not just those in the occupied Soviet Union, instructing them to use \\"unusual severity\\" to stamp out resistance. In this context, the guideline stated that execution of 50 to 100 \\"Communists\\" was an appropriate response to a loss of a German soldier. Such orders and directives further radicalised the army's occupational policies and enmeshed it in the genocide of the Jews. Plaque commemorating French victims at the Hinzert concentration camp, using the expressions \\"Nacht und Nebel\\" and \\"NN-Deported.\\" The inscription translates to: \\"No hate, but also no forgetting.\\" In December 1941, Hitler instructed the OKW to subject, with the exception of Denmark, Western Europe (which was under military occupation) to the Night and Fog Decree. Signed by Keitel, the decree made it possible for foreign nationals to be transferred to Germany for trial by special courts, or simply handed to the Gestapo for deportation to concentration camps. The OKW further imposed a blackout on any information concerning the fate of the accused. At the same time, Keitel increased pressure on Otto von St√ºlpnagel, the military commander in France, for a more ruthless reprisal policy in the country. In October 1942, Keitel signed the Commando Order that authorized the killing of enemy special operations troops even when captured in uniform. In the spring and summer of 1942, as the deportations of the Jews to extermination camps progressed, the military initially protested when it came to the Jews that laboured for the benefit of the Wehrmacht. The army lost control over the matter when the SS assumed command of all Jewish forced labour in July 1942. Keitel formally endorsed the state of affairs in September, reiterating for the armed forces that \\"evacuation of the Jews must be carried out thoroughly and its consequences endured, despite any trouble it may cause over the next three or four months\\".  Trial, conviction, and execution  Wilhelm Keitel's detention report from June 1945 17 October 1946 Newsreel of Nuremberg Trials Sentencing After the war, Keitel faced the International Military Tribunal (IMT), which indicted him on all four counts before it: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Most of the case against him was based on his signature being present on dozens of orders that called for soldiers and political prisoners to be killed or 'disappeared'. In court, Keitel admitted that he knew many of Hitler's orders were illegal. His defence relied almost entirely on the argument he was merely following orders in conformity to \\"the leader principle\\" (F√ºhrerprinzip) and his personal oath of loyalty to Hitler. The IMT rejected this defence and convicted him on all charges. Although the tribunal's charter allowed \\"superior orders\\" to be considered a mitigating factor, it found Keitel's crimes were so egregious that \\"there is nothing in mitigation\\". In its judgment against him, the IMT wrote, \\"Superior orders, even to a soldier, cannot be considered in mitigation where crimes as shocking and extensive have been committed consciously, ruthlessly and without military excuse or justification.\\" It was also pointed out that while he claimed the Commando Order, which ordered Allied commandos to be shot without trial, was illegal, he had reaffirmed it and extended its application. It also noted several instances where he issued illegal orders on his own authority. In his statement before the Tribunal, Keitel said: \\"As these atrocities developed, one from the other, step by step, and without any foreknowledge of the consequences, destiny took its tragic course, with its fateful consequences.\\" To underscore the criminal rather than military nature of Keitel's acts, the Allies denied his request to be shot by firing squad. Instead, he was executed at Nuremberg Prison by hanging. Keitel's body after execution Keitel was executed by American Army Sergeant John C. Woods. His last words were: \\"I call on God Almighty to have mercy on the German people. More than 2 million German soldiers went to their death for the fatherland before me. I follow now my sons ‚Äì all for Germany.\\" The trap door was small, causing head injuries to Keitel and several other condemned men as they dropped. Many of the executed Nazis fell from the gallows with insufficient force to snap their necks, resulting in a suffocating death struggle that in Keitel's case lasted 24 minutes. The corpses of Keitel and the other nine executed men were, like Hermann G√∂ring's, cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.  Memoirs  Before his execution, Keitel published his memoirs which were titled in English as In the Service of the Reich. It was later re-edited as The Memoirs of Field-Marshal Keitel by Walter G√∂rlitz . Another work by Keitel later published in English was named Questionnaire on the Ardennes offensive.

The TEU forms the basis of EU law, by setting out general principles of the EU's purpose, the governance of its central institutions (such as the Commission, Parliament, and Council), as well as the rules on external, foreign and security policy. History While the current version of the TEU entered into force in 2009, following the Treaty of Lisbon (2007), the older form of the same document was implemented by the Treaty of Maastricht (1992).  Provisions  After the preamble the consolidated treaty text is divided into six parts. =Title I: Common Provisions= The first deals with common provisions. Article 1 establishes the European Union on the basis of the European Community and lays out the legal value of the treaties. Article 2 states that the EU is \\"founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\\". The member states share a \\"society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\\". Article 3 then states the aims of the EU in six points. The first is simply to promote peace, European values and its citizens' well-being. The second relates to free movement with external border controls in place. Point 3 deals with the internal market. Point 4 establishes the euro. Point 5 states the EU shall promote its values, contribute to eradicating poverty, observe human rights and respect the charter of the United Nations. The final sixth point states that the EU shall pursue these objectives by \\"appropriate means\\" according with its competences given in the treaties. Article 4 relates to member states' sovereignty and obligations. Article 5 sets out the principles of conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality with respect to the limits of its powers. Article 6 binds the EU to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 7 deals with the suspension of a member state and article 8 deals with establishing close relations with neighbouring states. =Title II: Provisions on democratic principles= Article 9 establishes the equality of national citizens and citizenship of the European Union. Article 10 declares that the EU is founded in representative democracy and that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to citizens. It makes reference to European political parties and how citizens are represented: directly in the Parliament and by their governments in the Council and European Council ‚Äì accountable to national parliaments. Article 11 establishes government transparency, declares that broad consultations must be made and introduces provision for a petition where at least 1 million citizens may petition the Commission to legislate on a matter. Article 12 gives national parliaments limited involvement in the legislative process. =Title III: Provisions on the institutions= Article 13 establishes the institutions in the following order and under the following names: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the Court of Auditors. It obliges co-operation between these and limits their competencies to the powers within the treaties. Article 14 deals with the workings of Parliament and its election, article 15 with the European Council and its president, article 16 with the Council and its configurations and article 17 with the Commission and its appointment. Article 18 establishes the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and article 19 establishes the Court of Justice. =Title IV: Provisions on enhanced co-operation= Title 4 has only one article which allows a limited number of member states to co-operate within the EU if others are blocking integration in that field. =Title V: General provisions on the Union's external action= Chapter 1 of this title includes articles 21 and 22. Article 21 deals with the principles that outline EU foreign policy; including compliance with the UN charter, promoting global trade, humanitarian support and global governance. Article 22 gives the European Council, acting unanimously, control over defining the EU's foreign policy. Chapter 2 is further divided into sections. The first, common provisions, details the guidelines and functioning of the EU's foreign policy, including establishment of the European External Action Service and member state's responsibilities. Section 2, articles 42 to 46, deal with military co-operation (including mutual defence). On 17 November 2015, France called other member states for military assistance, on the basis of the Article 42. This was the first time the article had ever been applied and all of the member states were reported to respond in agreement (ibid). However at least one member state (Finland) made a conclusion that due to conflicting national law, military assistance was excluded. =Title VI: Final provisions= Article 47 establishes a legal personality for the EU. Article 48 deals with the method of treaty amendment; specifically the ordinary and simplified revision procedures. Article 49 deals with applications to join the EU and article 50 with withdrawal. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote in Britain on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 in March 2017, giving notice that it would leave the EU within two years. Article 51 deals with the protocols attached to the treaties and article 52 with the geographic application of the treaty. Article 53 states the treaty is in force for an unlimited period, article 54 deals with ratification and 55 with the different language versions of the treaties.

It was founded in 1960 by Raymond Queneau and Fran√ßois Le Lionnais. Other notable members have included novelists Georges Perec and Italo Calvino, poets Oskar Pastior, Jean Lescure and poet/mathematician Jacques Roubaud. The group defines the term litt√©rature potentielle as (rough translation): \\"the seeking of new structures and patterns which may be used by writers in any way they enjoy\\". Queneau described Oulipians as \\"rats who construct the labyrinth from which they plan to escape.\\" Constraints are used as a means of triggering ideas and inspiration, most notably Perec's \\"story-making machine\\", which he used in the construction of Life: A User's Manual. As well as established techniques, such as lipograms (Perec's novel A Void) and palindromes, the group devises new methods, often based on mathematical problems, such as the knight's tour of the chess-board and permutations.  History  Oulipo was founded on November 24, 1960, as a subcommittee of the Coll√®ge de 'Pataphysique and titled S√©minaire de litt√©rature exp√©rimentale. At their second meeting, the group changed its name to Ouvroir de litt√©rature potentielle, or Oulipo, at Albert-Marie Schmidt's suggestion. The idea had arisen two months earlier, when a small group met in September at Cerisy-la- Salle for a colloquium on Queneau's work. During this seminar, Queneau and Fran√ßois Le Lionnais conceived the society. During the subsequent decade, Oulipo (as it was commonly known) was only rarely visible as a group. As a subcommittee, they reported their work to the full Coll√®ge de 'Pataphysique in 1961. In addition, ' devoted an issue to Oulipo in 1964, and Belgian radio broadcast one Oulipo meeting. Its members were individually active during these years and published works which were created within their constraints. The group as a whole began to emerge from obscurity in 1973 with the publication of ', a collection of representative pieces. Martin Gardner helped to popularize the group in America when he featured Oulipo in his February 1977 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.Playing with Poetry: using mathematics to discover new verses by JoAnne GrowneyReview of Imaginary Numbers by William Frucht Mathematical Association of America press release In 2012 Harvard University Press published a history of the movement, Many Subtle Channels: In Praise of Potential Literature, by Oulipo member Daniel Levin Becker. Oulipo was founded by a group of men in 1960 and it took 15 years before the first woman was allowed to join; this was Mich√®le M√©tail who became a member in 1975 and has since distanced herself from the group. Since 1960 only six women have joined Oulipo, with Cl√©mentine M√©lois last to join in June 2017.  Oulipian works  Ambigram Oulipo Some examples of Oulipian writing: * Queneau's Exercices de Style is the recounting ninety-nine times of the same inconsequential episode, in which a man witnesses a minor altercation on a bus trip; each account is unique in terms of tone and style. * Queneau's Cent Mille Milliards de Po√®mes is inspired by children's picture books in which each page is cut into horizontal strips that can be turned independently, allowing different pictures (usually of people: heads, torsos, waists, legs, etc.) to be combined in many ways. Queneau applies this technique to poetry: the book contains 10 sonnets, each on a page. Each page is split into 14 strips, one for each line. The author estimates in the introductory explanation that it would take approximately 200 million years to read all possible combinations. * Perec's novel La disparition, translated into English by Gilbert Adair and published under the title \\"A Void\\", is a 300-page novel written without the letter \\"e\\", an example of a lipogram. The English translation, A Void, is also a lipogram. The novel is remarkable not only for the absence of \\"e\\", but it is a mystery in which the absence of that letter is a central theme. * Singular Pleasures by Harry Mathews describes 61 different scenes, each told in a different style (generally poetic, elaborate, or circumlocutory) in which 61 different people (all of different ages, nationalities, and walks of life) masturbate.  Constraints  Some Oulipian constraints: ; S+7, sometimes called N+7 : Replace every noun in a text with the seventh noun after it in a dictionary. For example, \\"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...\\" becomes \\"Call me islander. Some yeggs ago...\\". Results will vary depending upon the dictionary used. This technique can also be performed on other lexical classes, such as verbs. ; Snowball : A poem in which each line is a single word, and each successive word is one letter longer. ; Lipogram : Writing that excludes one or more letters. The previous sentence is a lipogram in B, F, J, K, Q, V, Y, and Z (it does not contain any of those letters). ; Prisoner's constraint, also called Macao constraint : A type of lipogram that omits letters with ascenders and descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y). ; Palindromes: Sonnets and other poems constructed using palindromic techniques. ; Univocalism: A poem using only one vowel letter. In English and some other languages the same vowel letter can represent different sounds, which means that, for example, \\"born\\" and \\"cot\\" could both be used in a univocalism. (Words with the same American English vowel sound but represented by different 'vowel' letters could not be used ‚Äì e.g. \\"blue\\" and \\"stew\\".) ; Mathews' Algorithm: Elements in a text are moved around by a set of predetermined rulesrules for the algorithm  Members  =Founding members= The founding members of Oulipo represented a range of intellectual pursuits, including writers, university professors, mathematicians, engineers, and \\"pataphysicians\\":  Jacques Bens * Claude Berge  (\\"Latis\\") * Fran√ßois Le Lionnais * Jean Lescure * Raymond Queneau * Jean Queval * Albert-Marie Schmidt =Living members= * Mich√®le Audin  Marcel B√©nabou * Eduardo Berti * Bernard Cerquiglini  Paul Fournel * Anne F.

It has been used to criticise exploitation of labour and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labour and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops). and the latter as a lack of workers' self- management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a hierarchical society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their \\"species character\\". not only under threat of starvation or poverty, but also of social stigma and status diminution... Historically, some socialist organisations and activists have espoused workers' self-management or worker cooperatives as possible alternatives to wage labour. Similarities between wage labour and slavery were noted as early as Cicero in Ancient Rome, such as in De Officiis. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labour and slavery,.. while Luddites emphasised the dehumanisation brought about by machines. The introduction of wage labour in 18th-century Britain was met with resistance, giving rise to the principles of syndicalism and anarchism..... Before the American Civil War, Southern defenders of African American slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favourably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North... The United States abolished most forms of slavery after the Civil War, but labour union activists found the metaphor useful ‚Äì according to historian Lawrence Glickman, in the Gilded Age \\"[r]eferences abounded in the labour press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase\\".  History  Emma Goldman denounced wage slavery by saying: \\"The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves\\". The view that working for wages is akin to slavery dates back to the ancient world.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia. Geoffrey W. Bromiley. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995. . p. 543. In ancient Rome, Cicero wrote that \\"the very wage [wage labourers] receive is a pledge of their slavery\\". In 1763, the French journalist Simon Linguet published an influential description of wage slavery: The view that wage work has substantial similarities with chattel slavery was actively put forward in the late 18th and 19th centuries by defenders of chattel slavery (most notably in the Southern states of the United States) and by opponents of capitalism (who were also critics of chattel slavery).. Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the Southern slave states, argued that Northern workers were \\"free but in name ‚Äì the slaves of endless toil\\" and that their slaves were better off.Wage Slavery, PBS. This contention has been partly corroborated by some modern studies that indicate slaves' material conditions in the 19th century were \\"better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time\\"... In this period, Henry David Thoreau wrote that \\"[i]t is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave- driver of yourself\\".. Some abolitionists in the United States regarded the analogy as spurious.. They believed that wage workers were \\"neither wronged nor oppressed\\".. Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans argued that the condition of wage workers was different from slavery as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving self-employment.. The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass initially declared \\"now I am my own master\\", upon taking a paying job. However, later in life he concluded to the contrary, saying \\"experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other\\". Douglass went on to speak about these conditions as arising from the unequal bargaining power between the ownership/capitalist class and the non- ownership/laborer class within a compulsory monetary market: \\"No more crafty and effective devise for defrauding the southern laborers could be adopted than the one that substitutes orders upon shopkeepers for currency in payment of wages. It has the merit of a show of honesty, while it puts the laborer completely at the mercy of the land-owner and the shopkeeper\\". African American wage workers picking cotton on a plantation in the South Self- employment became less common as the artisan tradition slowly disappeared in the later part of the 19th century. In 1869, The New York Times described the system of wage labor as \\"a system of slavery as absolute if not as degrading as that which lately prevailed at the South\\". E. P. Thompson notes that for British workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the \\"gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted degradation were in the right\\". A \\"Member of the Builders' Union\\" in the 1830s argued that the trade unions \\"will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined together in the hands of workmen and work-women\\". This perspective inspired the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union of 1834 which had the \\"two-fold purpose of syndicalist unions ‚Äì the protection of the workers under the existing system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society\\" when the unions \\"take over the whole industry of the country\\". \\"Research has shown\\", summarises William Lazonick, \\"that the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth century ‚Äì even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to agricultural wage labour ‚Äì tenaciously resisted entry into the capitalist workshop\\". The use of the term \\"wage slave\\" by labor organizations may originate from the labor protests of the Lowell mill girls in 1836.. The imagery of wage slavery was widely used by labor organizations during the mid-19th century to object to the lack of workers' self-management. However, it was gradually replaced by the more neutral term \\"wage work\\" towards the end of the 19th century as labor organizations shifted their focus to raising wages. Karl Marx described capitalist society as infringing on individual autonomy because it is based on a materialistic and commodified concept of the body and its liberty (i.e. as something that is sold, rented, or alienated in a class society). According to Friedrich Engels:. = Similarities of wage work with slavery = Critics of wage work have drawn several similarities between wage work and slavery: # Since the chattel slave is property, his value to an owner is in some ways higher than that of a worker who may quit, be fired or replaced. The chattel slave's owner has made a greater investment in terms of the money paid for the slave. For this reason, in times of recession chattel slaves could not be fired like wage laborers. A \\"wage slave\\" could also be harmed at no (or less) cost. American chattel-slaves in the 19th century had improved their standard of living from the 18th century and ‚Äì according to historians Fogel and Engerman ‚Äì plantation records show that slaves worked less, were better fed and whipped only occasionally ‚Äì their material conditions in the 19th century being \\"better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time\\". This was partially due to slave psychological strategies under an economic system different from capitalist wage-slavery. According to Mark Michael Smith of the Economic History Society, \\"although intrusive and oppressive, paternalism, the way masters employed it, and the methods slaves used to manipulate it, rendered slaveholders' attempts to institute capitalistic work regimens on their plantation ineffective and so allowed slaves to carve out a degree of autonomy\\".. # Unlike a chattel slave, a wage laborer can (barring unemployment or lack of job offers) choose between employers, but those employers usually constitute a minority of owners in the population for which the wage laborer must work while attempts to implement workers' control on employers' businesses may be considered an act of theft or insubordination and thus be met with violence, imprisonment or other legal and social measures. The wage laborer's starkest choice is to work for an employer or to face poverty or starvation. If a chattel slave refuses to work, a number of punishments are also available; from beatings to food deprivation ‚Äì although economically rational slave-owners practiced positive reinforcement to achieve best results and before losing their investment by killing an expensive slave. # Historically, the range of occupations and status positions held by chattel slaves has been nearly as broad as that held by free persons, indicating some similarities between chattel slavery and wage slavery as well.\\"The sociology of slavery: Slave occupations\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. \\"The highest position slaves ever attained was that of slave minister [...] A few slaves even rose to be monarchs, such as the slaves who became sultans and founded dynasties in IslƒÅm. At a level lower than that of slave ministers were other slaves, such as those in the Roman Empire, the Central Asian Samanid domains, Ch'ing China, and elsewhere, who worked in government offices and administered provinces. [...] The stereotype that slaves were careless and could only be trusted to do the crudest forms of manual labor was disproved countless times in societies that had different expectations and proper incentives\\". # Like chattel slavery, wage slavery does not stem from some immutable \\"human nature\\", but represents a \\"specific response to material and historical conditions\\" that \\"reproduce[s] the inhabitants, the social relations‚Ä¶ the ideas‚Ä¶ [and] the social form of daily life\\".. # Similarities became blurred when proponents of wage labor won the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, in which they competed for legitimacy with defenders of chattel slavery. Each side presented an over-positive assessment of their own system while denigrating the opponent. Noam Chomsky has written in support of labour movements According to American anarcho-syndicalist philosopher Noam Chomsky, workers themselves noticed the similarities between chattel and wage slavery. Chomsky noted that the 19th-century Lowell mill girls, without any reported knowledge of European Marxism or anarchism, condemned the \\"degradation and subordination\\" of the newly-emerging industrial system and the \\"new spirit of the age: gain wealth, forgetting all but self\\", maintaining that \\"those who work in the mills should own them\\"... They expressed their concerns in a protest song during their 1836 strike: :Oh! isn't it a pity, such a pretty girl as I :Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die? :Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave, :For I'm so fond of liberty, :That I cannot be a slave. Defenses of both wage labor and chattel slavery in the literature have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to nature ‚Äì arguing that hierarchy and a social system's particular relations of production represent human nature and are no more coercive than the reality of life itself. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change the status quo is naively utopian and will result in more oppressive conditions.; ; . Bosses in both of these long-lasting systems argued that their respective systems created a lot of wealth and prosperity. In some sense, both did create jobs, and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave-owners risked losing money by buying chattel slaves who later became ill or died; while bosses risked losing money by hiring workers (wage slaves) to make products that did not sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. The \\"rags to riches\\" story occasionally comes to pass in capitalism; the \\"slave to master\\" story occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave-owners themselves.. Thus critics of the concept of wage slavery do not regard social mobility, or the hard work and risk that it may entail, as a redeeming factor.McKay, Iain. B.7.2 Does social mobility make up for class inequality? An Anarchist FAQ: Volume 1 Anthropologist David Graeber has noted that historically the first wage-labor contracts we know about ‚Äì whether in ancient Greece or Rome, or in the Malay or Swahili city-states in the Indian Ocean ‚Äì were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money and the slaves another, with which to maintain their living expenses). According to Graeber, such arrangements were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or in Brazil. C. L. R. James (1901-1989) argued that most of the techniques of human organization employed on factory workers during the Industrial Revolution first developed on slave plantations. . Subsequent work \\"traces the innovations of modern management to the slave plantation\\". = Decline in use of term = By the end of the 19th century, both the use of the term wage slavery and its meaning declined The usage of the term \\"wage slavery\\" shifted to \\"wage work\\" at the end of the 19th century as groups like the Knights of Labor and American Federation of Labor shifted to a more reformist, trade union ideology instead of worker's self-management. Much of the decline was caused by the rapid increase in manufacturing after the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent dominance of wage labor as a result. Another factor was immigration and demographic changes that led to ethnic tension between the workers. As Hallgrimsdottir and Benoit point out:  Treatment in various economic systems  Adam Smith Some anti-capitalist thinkers claim that the elite maintain wage slavery and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry, educational institutions, unjust laws, nationalist and corporate propaganda, pressures and incentives to internalize values serviceable to the power structure, state violence, fear of unemployment, and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulation/transfer under prior systems, which shaped the development of economic theory. Adam Smith noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low and have the upper hand in conflicts between workers and employers: = Capitalism = Pinkerton guards escort strikebreakers in Buchtel, Ohio, 1884 Red Army troops attack Kronstadt libertarian socialist \\"wage slavery\\" critics who had demanded among other things that \\"handicraft production be authorized provided it does not utilize wage labour\\". The concept of wage slavery could conceivably be traced back to pre-capitalist figures like Gerrard Winstanley from the radical Christian Diggers movement in England, who wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, The New Law of Righteousness, that there \\"shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man\\" and \\"there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of himself\\".. Aristotle stated that \\"the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil (for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics)\\",Aristotle, Politics 1328b‚Äì1329a, H. Rackham trans. often paraphrased as \\"all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind\\". Cicero wrote in 44 BC that \\"vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery\\". Somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of liberalism, like Silvio Gesell and Thomas Paine; Henry George, who inspired the economic philosophy known as Georgism; and the Distributist school of thought within the Catholic Church. To Karl Marx and anarchist thinkers like Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, wage slavery was a class condition in place due to the existence of private property and the state. This class situation rested primarily on: # The existence of property not intended for active use; # The concentration of ownership in few hands; # The lack of direct access by workers to the means of production and consumption goods; and # The perpetuation of a reserve army of unemployed workers. And secondarily on: # The waste of workers' efforts and resources on producing useless luxuries; # The waste of goods so that their price may remain high; and # The waste of all those who sit between the producer and consumer, taking their own shares at each stage without actually contributing to the production of goods, i.e. the middle man. = Fascism = Fascist economic policies were more hostile to independent trade unions than modern economies in Europe or the United States.. Fascism was more widely accepted in the 1920s and 1930s, and foreign corporate investment (notably from the United States) in Germany increased after the fascists took power.: \\"General Motors' involvement in Germany's military preparations was the logical outcome of its forthright export philosophy of seeking profits wherever and however they might be made, irrespective of political circumstances. [...] By April 1939, G.M. had applied its credo to its fullest limits, for Opel, its wholly owned subsidiary, was (along with Ford) Germany's largest tank producer. [...] The details of additional American business involvement with German industry fill dozens of volumes of government hearings\\". Fascism has been perceived by some notable critics, like Buenaventura Durruti, to be a last resort weapon of the privileged to ensure the maintenance of wage slavery:  Psychological effects  Wilhelm von Humboldt According to Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the Enlightenment era. In his 1791 book The Limits of State Action, classical liberal thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt explained how \\"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\\" and so when the laborer works under external control, \\"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is\\".. Because they explore human authority and obedience, both the Milgram and Stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.. = Self-identity problems and stress = According to research,. modern work provides people with a sense of personal and social identity that is tied to: # The particular work role, even if unfulfilling; and # The social role it entails e.g. family bread-winning, friendship forming and so on. Thus job loss entails the loss of this identity. Erich Fromm argued that if a person perceives himself as being what he owns, then when that person loses (or even thinks of losing) what he \\"owns\\" (e.g. the good looks or sharp mind that allow him to sell his labor for high wages) a fear of loss may create anxiety and authoritarian tendencies because that person's sense of identity is threatened. In contrast, when a person's sense of self is based on what he experiences in a ‚Äústate of being‚Äù with a less materialistic regard for what he once had and lost, or may lose, then less authoritarian tendencies prevail. In his view, the state of being flourishes under a worker-managed workplace and economy, whereas self-ownership entails a materialistic notion of self, created to rationalize the lack of worker control that would allow for a state of being.. You can see Fromm discussing these ideas here. Investigative journalist Robert Kuttner analyzed the work of public-health scholars Jeffrey Johnson and Ellen Hall about modern conditions of work and concludes that \\"to be in a life situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health, physically as well as mentally\\". Under wage labor, \\"a relatively small elite demands and gets empowerment, self-actualization, autonomy, and other work satisfaction that partially compensate for long hours\\" while \\"epidemiological data confirm that lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to experience the most clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because they have less control over their work\\".. Wage slavery and the educational system that precedes it \\"implies power held by the leader. Without power the leader is inept. The possession of power inevitably leads to corruption ... in spite of ... good intentions ... [Leadership means] power of initiative, this sense of responsibility, the self-respect which comes from expressed manhood, is taken from the men, and consolidated in the leader. The sum of their initiative, their responsibility, their self-respect becomes his ... [and the] order and system he maintains is based upon the suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into being 'the men' ... In a word, he is compelled to become an autocrat and a foe to democracy\\". For the \\"leader\\", such marginalisation can be beneficial, for a leader \\"sees no need for any high level of intelligence in the rank and file, except to applaud his actions. Indeed such intelligence from his point of view, by breeding criticism and opposition, is an obstacle and causes confusion\\".. Wage slavery \\"implies erosion of the human personality ... [because] some men submit to the will of others, arousing in these instincts which predispose them to cruelty and indifference in the face of the suffering of their fellows\\".quoted by Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 2, p. 76 = Psychological control =  Higher wages  In 19th-century discussions of labor relations, it was normally assumed that the threat of starvation forced those without property to work for wages. Proponents of the view that modern forms of employment constitute wage slavery, even when workers appear to have a range of available alternatives, have attributed its perpetuation to a variety of social factors that maintain the hegemony of the employer class.Gramsci, A. (1992) Prison Notebooks. New York : Columbia University Press, pp. 233‚Äì38 In an account of the Lowell mill girls, Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote that generously high wages were offered to overcome the degrading nature of the work: In his book Disciplined Minds, Jeff Schmidt points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained to \\"ensure that each and every detail of their work favors the right interests‚Äìor skewers the disfavored ones\\" in the absence of overt control: Parecon (participatory economics) theory posits a social class \\"between labor and capital\\" of higher paid professionals such as \\"doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers and others\\" who monopolize empowering labor and constitute a class above wage laborers who do mostly \\"obedient, rote work\\".  Lower wages  The terms \\"employee\\" or \\"worker\\" have often been replaced by \\"associate\\". This plays up the allegedly voluntary nature of the interaction while playing down the subordinate status of the wage laborer as well as the worker-boss class distinction emphasized by labor movements. Billboards as well as television, Internet and newspaper advertisements consistently show low-wage workers with smiles on their faces, appearing happy.. Job interviews and other data on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries ‚Äì particularly in the growing service sector ‚Äì indicate that the more workers depend on low wages and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation.. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage- dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity. At the same time, employers in the service industry have justified unstable, part-time employment and low wages by playing down the importance of service jobs for the lives of the wage laborers (e.g. just temporary before finding something better, student summer jobs and the like).. In the early 20th century, \\"scientific methods of strikebreaking\\". were devised ‚Äì employing a variety of tactics that emphasized how strikes undermined \\"harmony\\" and \\"Americanism\\"..  Workers' self-management  Some social activists objecting to the market system or price system of wage working historically have considered syndicalism, worker cooperatives, workers' self-management and workers' control as possible alternatives to the current wage system. = Labor and government = The American philosopher John Dewey believed that until \\"industrial feudalism\\" is replaced by \\"industrial democracy\\", politics will be \\"the shadow cast on society by big business\\".\\"As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance\\", in \\"The Need for a New Party\\" (1931), Later Works 6, p. 163 Thomas Ferguson has postulated in his investment theory of party competition that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.. Noam Chomsky has argued that political theory tends to blur the 'elite' function of government: In this regard, Chomsky has used Bakunin's theories about an \\"instinct for freedom\\", the militant history of labor movements, Kropotkin's mutual aid evolutionary principle of survival and Marc Hauser's theories supporting an innate and universal moral faculty,. to explain the incompatibility of oppression with certain aspects of human nature. = Influence on environmental degradation = Loyola University philosophy professor John Clark and libertarian socialist philosopher Murray Bookchin have criticized the system of wage labor for encouraging environmental destruction, arguing that a self-managed industrial society would better manage the environment. Like other anarchists, they attribute much of the Industrial Revolution's pollution to the \\"hierarchical\\" and \\"competitive\\" economic relations accompanying it.; ; ; . = Employment contracts = Some criticize wage slavery on strictly contractual grounds, e.g. David Ellerman and Carole Pateman, arguing that the employment contract is a legal fiction in that it treats human beings juridically as mere tools or inputs by abdicating responsibility and self-determination, which the critics argue are inalienable. As Ellerman points out, \\"[t]he employee is legally transformed from being a co-responsible partner to being only an input supplier sharing no legal responsibility for either the input liabilities [costs] or the produced outputs [revenue, profits] of the employer's business\\".. Such contracts are inherently invalid \\"since the person remain[s] a de facto fully capacitated adult person with only the contractual role of a non-person\\" as it is impossible to physically transfer self-determination.. As Pateman argues: In a modern liberal capitalist society, the employment contract is enforced while the enslavement contract is not; the former being considered valid because of its consensual/non-coercive nature and the latter being considered inherently invalid, consensual or not. The noted economist Paul Samuelson described this discrepancy: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: Others like Murray Rothbard allow for the possibility of debt slavery, asserting that a lifetime labour contract can be broken so long as the slave pays appropriate damages:  Schools of economics  In the philosophy of mainstream, neoclassical economics, wage labor is seen as the voluntary sale of one's own time and efforts, just like a carpenter would sell a chair, or a farmer would sell wheat. It is considered neither an antagonistic nor abusive relationship and carries no particular moral implications.. Austrian economics argues that a person is not \\"free\\" unless they can sell their labor because otherwise that person has no self-ownership and will be owned by a \\"third party\\" of individuals.. Post-Keynesian economics perceives wage slavery as resulting from inequality of bargaining power between labor and capital, which exists when the economy does not \\"allow labor to organize and form a strong countervailing force\\".. See also . The two main forms of socialist economics perceive wage slavery differently: # Libertarian socialism sees it as a lack of workers' self-management in the context of substituting state and capitalist control with political and economic decentralization and confederation. # State socialists view it as an injustice perpetrated by capitalists and solved through nationalization and social ownership of the means of production.  Criticism  Some abolitionists in the United States regarded the analogy of wage workers as wage slaves to be spurious.Foner, Eric. 1998. The Story of American Freedom. W. W. Norton & Company. p. 66 They believed that wage workers were \\"neither wronged nor oppressed\\". The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass declared \\"Now I am my own master\\" when he took a paying job. Later in life, he concluded to the contrary \\"experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other\\".Douglass, Frederick. Three Addresses on the Relations Subsisting Between the White and Colored People of the United States. p. 13 However, Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans \\"did not challenge the notion that those who spend their entire lives as wage laborers were comparable to slaves\\", though they argued that the condition was different, as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving self-employment.p.181-184 Democracy's Discontent By Michael J. Sandel Some advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, have said that inalienable rights can be waived if done so voluntarily: > The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will > allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.Ellerman, > David. Translatio versus Concessio. p. 2 Others such as the anarcho-capitalist Walter Block go further and maintain that all rights are in fact alienable, stating voluntary slavery and by extension wage slavery is legitimate.\\"Toward a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein\\".

It is the fifth-largest Indian state by area and the ninth-largest state by population. Gujarat is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. The Gujarati people of India are indigenous to the state, and their language Gujarati, is the state's official language. The economy of Gujarat is the third-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of and has the country's 11th-highest GSDP per capita of . Gujarat ranks 21st among Indian states in human development index. The state traditionally has low unemployment and is widely considered one of the most industrially developed states of India and a manufacturing hub.   The state encompasses some sites of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro. Lothal is believed to be one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat, served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, and during the succession of royal Saka dynasties from the Western Satraps era. Along with Bihar and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of the four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world.  Etymology  Gujarat is derived from the Sanskrit term Gurjaradesa, meaning \\"The Land of the Gurjaras (also called Gujjars)\\", who ruled Gujarat in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. Parts of modern Rajasthan and Gujarat have been known as Gurjaratra or Gurjarabhumi (land of the Gujjars) for centuries before the Mughal period.  History  = Ancient history = Gujarat was one of the main central areas of the Indus Valley Civilisation. It contains ancient metropolitan cities from the Indus Valley such as Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro. The ancient city of Lothal was where India's first port was established. The ancient city of Dholavira is one of the largest and most prominent archaeological sites in India, belonging to the Indus Valley Civilisation. The most recent discovery was Gola Dhoro. Altogether, about 50 Indus Valley settlement ruins have been discovered in Gujarat. The ancient history of Gujarat was enriched by the commercial activities of its inhabitants. There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with Egypt, Bahrain and Sumer in the Persian Gulf during the time period of 1000 to 750 BCE.S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 11. There was a succession of Hindu and Buddhist states such as the Mauryan Dynasty, Western Satraps, Satavahana dynasty, Gupta Empire, Chalukya dynasty, Rashtrakuta Empire, Pala Empire and Gurjara-Pratihara Empire, as well as local dynasties such as the Maitrakas and then the Chaulukyas. The early history of Gujarat reflects the imperial grandeur of Chandragupta Maurya who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed the governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day Junagadh) (322 BCE to 294 BCE) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at Junagadh but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was an Indo-Greek defeat in Gujarat of Demetrius. In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with Apostle Thomas. The incident of the cup- bearer torn apart by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.The Acts of Judas Thomas, M.R. James, Tr. by M.R. James, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924.Medlycott, A. E. India and the Apostle Thomas For nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century CE, Saka rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler Rudradaman I (100 CE) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the south Indian Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. The greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99 The Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the Gupta Empire with the conquest of Gujarat by Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (450 CE) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 he set up what came to be known as the Maitraka state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining Malwa. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted Nalanda University. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler Xuanzang/ I Tsing visited in 640 along the Silk Road. Gujarat was known to the ancient Greeks and was familiar with other Western centers of civilisation through the end of the European Middle Ages. The oldest written record of Gujarat's 2,000-year maritime history is documented in a Greek book titled The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century. = Medieval history = In the early 8th century, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate established an empire in the name of the rising religion of Islam, which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan in the east. Al-Junaid, the successor of Qasim, finally subdued the Hindu resistance within Sindh and established a secure base. The Arab rulers tried to expand their empire southeast, which culminated in the Caliphate campaigns in India fought in 730; they were defeated and expelled west of the Indus river, probably by a coalition of the Hindu rulers Nagabhata I of the Pratihara Dynasty, Vikramaditya II of the Chalukya dynasty and Bappa Rawal of Guhila dynasty. After this victory, the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. General Pulakeshin, a Chalukya prince of Lata, received the title Avanijanashraya (refuge of the people of the earth) and honorific of \\"Repeller of the unrepellable\\" by the Chalukya emperor Vikramaditya II for his victory at the battle at Navsari, where the Arab troops suffered a crushing defeat. In the late 8th century, the Kannauj Triangle period started. The three major Indian dynasties ‚Äì the northwest Indian Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty, the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty and the east Indian Pala Empire dominated India from the 8th to 10th centuries. During this period the northern part of Gujarat was ruled by the north Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty and the southern part of Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty.Ancient India by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar p. 366 However, the earliest epigraphical records of the Gurjars of Broach attest that the royal bloodline of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty of Dadda I-II-III (650‚Äì750) ruled south Gujarat. Southern Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the south Indian ruler Tailapa II of the Western Chalukya Empire.History, Religion and Culture of India, by S. Gajrani p.32 Zoroastrians from Greater Iran migrated to the western borders of South Asia (Gujarat and Sindh) during the 8th or 10th century, to avoid persecution by Muslim invaders who were in the process of conquering Iran. The descendants of those Zoroastrian refugees came to be known as the Parsi. Subsequently, LƒÅ·π≠a in southern Gujarat was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Western Chalukya ruler Tailapa II. The Chaulukya dynasty ruled Gujarat from c. 960 to 1243. Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and their capital at Anhilwara (Patan) was one of the largest cities in India, with population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. After 1243, the Solankis lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, of whom the Vaghela chiefs of Dholka came to dominate Gujarat. In 1292 the Vaghelas became tributaries of the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in the Deccan. Karandev of the Vaghela dynasty was the last Hindu ruler of Gujarat. He was defeated and overthrown by the superior forces of Alauddin Khalji from Delhi in 1297. With his defeat, Gujarat became part of the Muslim empire, and the Rajput hold over Gujarat would never be restored. According to Barnes (2017), fragments of printed kinds of cotton made in Gujarat, India were discovered in Egypt, which provides evidence for medieval trade in the western Indian Ocean. These fragments represent the Indian cotton traded to Egypt during the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods from tenth to sixteenth centuries. Similar Gujarati kinds of cotton were traded as far east as Indonesia, and this is contextualised under the medieval trades of the wider Indian Ocean. = Muslim rule =  Islamic conquests, 1197‚Äì1614  After the Ghoris had assumed a position of Muslim supremacy over North India, Qutbuddin Aibak attempted to conquer Gujarat and annexe it to his empire in 1197 but failed in his ambitions. An independent Muslim community continued to flourish in Gujarat for the next hundred years, championed by Arab merchants settling along the western coast belonging to the Shafi'ite madhhab. From 1297 to 1300, Alauddin Khalji, the Turko-Afghan Sultan of Delhi, destroyed the Hindu metropolis of Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur's sacking of Delhi at the end of the 14th century weakened the Sultanate, Gujarat's Muslim Rajput governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar (Muzaffar Shah I) asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmed Shah (ruled 1411 to 1442), established Ahmedabad as the capital. Khambhat eclipsed Bharuch as Gujarat's most important trade port. Gujarat's relations with Egypt, which was then the premier Arab power in the Middle East remained friendly over the next century and the Egyptian scholar, Badruddin-ad- Damamimi, spent several years in Gujarat in the shade of the Sultan before proceeding to the Bahmani Sultanate of the Deccan. Shah e Alam, a famous Sufi- saint of the Chishti order who was the descendant of Makhdoom Jahaniyan Jahangasht from Bukhara soon arrived among other luminaries such as Arab theologian Ibn Suwaid, several Sayyid Sufi members of the Aydarus family of Tarim in Yemen,J. Spencer Trimingham, John O. Voll, The Sufi Orders in Islam, pg 73 Iberian court interpreter Ali al-Andalusi from Granada, and the Arab jurist Bahraq from Hadramaut who was appointed a tutor of the prince. Among the illustrious names who arrived during the reign of Mahmud Begada was the philosopher Haibatullah Shah Mir from Shiraz, and the scholar intellectual Abu Fazl Ghazaruni from Persia who tutored and adopted Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the Akbarnama. Later, a close alliance between the Ottoman Turks and Gujarati sultans to effectively safeguard Jeddah and the Red Sea trade from Portuguese imperialism, encouraged the existence of powerful Rumi elites within the kingdom who took the post of viziers in Gujarat keen to maintain ties with the Ottoman state. Humayun had also briefly occupied the province in 1536, but fled due to the threat Bahadur Shah, the Gujarat king, imposed. The Sultanate of Gujarat remained independent until 1572, when the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great conquered it and annexed it to the Mughal Empire. The Surat port (the only Indian port facing westwards) then became the principal port of India during Mughal rule to gain widespread international repute. The city of Surat, famous for its cargo export of silk and diamonds had come on a par with contemporary Venice and Beijing which were some of the great mercantile cities of Europe and Asia, and earned the distinguished title, Bab al-Makkah (Gate of Mecca). Drawn by the religious renaissance taking place under Akbar, Mohammed Ghaus moved to Gujarat and established spiritual centers for the Shattari Sufi order from Iran, founding the Ek Toda Mosque and producing such devotees as Wajihuddin Alvi of Ahmedabad whose many successors moved to Bijapur during the height of the Adil Shahi dynasty. At the same time, Zoroastrian high priest Azar Kayvan who was a native of Fars, immigrated to Gujarat founding the Zoroastrian school of illuminationists which attracted key Shi'ite Muslim admirers of the Safavid philosophical revival from Isfahan. Early 14th-century Maghrebi adventurer, Ibn Batuta, who famously visited India with his entourage, recalls in his memoirs about Cambay, one of the great emporia of the Indian Ocean that indeed: Many of these \\"foreign merchants\\" were transient visitors, men of South Arabian and Persian Gulf ports, who migrated in and out of Cambay with the rhythm of the monsoons. But others were men with Arab or Persian patronyms whose families had settled in the town generations, even centuries earlier, intermarrying with Gujarati women, and assimilating everyday customs of the Hindu hinterland. The Age of Discovery heralded the dawn of pioneer Portuguese and Spanish long-distance travel in search of alternative trade routes to \\"the East Indies\\", moved by the trade of gold, silver and spices. In 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama is said to have discovered the Europe-to-India sea route which changed the course of history, thanks to Kutchi sailor Kanji Malam, who showed him the route from the East African coasts of Mozambique sailing onwards to Calicut off the Malabar coast in India. Later, the Gujarat Sultanate allied with the Ottomans and Egyptian Mamluks naval fleets led by governor-generals Malik Ayyaz and Amir Husain Al- Kurdi, vanquished the Portuguese in the 1508 Battle of Chaul resulting in the first Portuguese defeat at sea in the Indian Ocean. To 16th-century European observers, Gujarat was a fabulously wealthy country. The customs revenue of Gujarat alone in the early 1570s was nearly three times the total revenue of the whole Portuguese empire in Asia in 1586‚Äì87, when it was at its height. Indeed, when the British arrived on the coast of Gujarat, houses in Surat already had windows of Venetian glass imported from Constantinople through the Ottoman empire. In 1514, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa described the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Rander known otherwise as City of Mosques in Surat province, which gained the fame and reputation of illustrious Islamic scholars, Sufi-saints, merchants and intellectuals from all over the world: The conquest of the Kingdom of Gujarat marked a significant event of Akbar's reign. Being the major trade gateway and departure harbour of pilgrim ships to Mecca, it gave the Mughal Empire free access to the Arabian sea and control over the rich commerce that passed through its ports. The territory and income of the empire were vastly increased.  The Sultanate of Gujarat and the merchants  A modern Zoroastrian Agiary in Western India For the best part of two centuries, the independent Rajput Sultanate of Gujarat was the cynosure of its neighbours on account of its wealth and prosperity, which had long made the Gujarati merchant a familiar figure in the ports of the Indian Ocean. Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specialising in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as commodity trade, brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking. By the 17th century, Chavuse and Baghdadi Jews had assimilated into the social world of the Surat province, later on their descendants would give rise to the Sassoons of Bombay and the Ezras of Calcutta, and other influential Indian- Jewish figures who went on to play a philanthropical role in the commercial development of 19th-century British Crown Colony of Shanghai. Spearheaded by Khoja, Bohra, Bhatiya shahbandars and Moorish nakhudas who dominated sea navigation and shipping, Gujarat's transactions with the outside world had created the legacy of an international transoceanic empire which had a vast commercial network of permanent agents stationed at all the great port cities across the Indian Ocean. These networks extended to the Philippines in the east, East Africa in the west, and via maritime and the inland caravan route to Russia in the north. As Tome Pires, a Portuguese official at Malacca, writing of conditions during the reigns of Mahmud I and Mozaffar II, expressed it: \\"Cambay stretches out two arms; with her right arm she reaches toward Aden and with the other towards Malacca\\" (Pires, I, p. 41) and also described Gujarat's active trade with Goa, Deccan and the Malabar. His contemporary, Duarte Barbosa, describing Gujarat's maritime trade, recorded the import of horses from the Middle East and elephants from Malabar, and lists exports which included muslins, chintzes and silks, carnelian, ginger and other spices, aromatics, opium, indigo and other substances for dyeing, cereals and legumes (Barbosa, I, pp. 108‚Äì58). Persia was the destination for many of these commodities, and they were partly paid for in horses and pearls taken from Hormuz (Barbosa, I, p. 82). It was the latter item, in particular, which led Sultan Sikandar Lodi of Delhi, according to Ali-Muhammad Khan, author of the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, to complain that the \\"support of the throne of Delhi is wheat and barley but the foundation of the realm of Gujarat is coral and pearls\\" (apud Bayley, p. 20). Hence, the sultans of Gujarat possessed ample means to sustain lavish patronage of religion and the arts, to build madrasas and ·∏µƒÅnaqƒÅhs, and to provide douceurs for the literati, mainly poets and historians, whose presence and praise enhanced the fame of the dynasty.GUJARAT ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Iranica .

Jama Masjid, Ahmedabad Even at the time of Tom Pires' travel to the East Indies in the early 16th century, Gujarati merchants had earned an international reputation for their commercial acumen and this encouraged the visit of merchants from Cairo, Armenia, Abyssinia, Khorasan, Shiraz, Turkestan and Guilans from Aden and Hormuz. Pires noted in his Suma Orientale:  Gujarat in the Mughal Empire  Portrait of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Gujarat was one of the twelve original subahs (imperial top-level provinces) established by Mughal padshah (emperor) Akbar the Great, with seat at Ahmedabad, bordering on Thatta (Sindh), Ajmer, Malwa and later Ahmadnagar subahs. Aurangzeb, who was better known by his imperial title Alamgir (\\"Conqueror of the World\\"), was born at Dahod, Gujarat, and was the sixth Mughal Emperor ruling with an iron fist over most of the Indian subcontinent. He was the third son and sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, Jehangir, was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at Ahmedabad. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was among the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers, with an annual yearly tribute of ¬£38,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100‚Äì150 million subjects. Aurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, Muhammad Azam Shah, asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat. In his letter, Aurangzeb wrote: = Maratha Empire = Peshwa Baji Rao I riding a horse When the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the Mughal Empire in the mid-17th century, the Marathas were consolidating their power in the west, Chatrapati Shivaji, the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat in southern Gujarat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672. These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, with the Portuguese leading them, followed by the Dutch and the English. The Peshwas had established their sovereignty over parts of Gujarat and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa's territory between them, with Damaji establishing the sway of Gaekwad over Gujarat and made Baroda (present day Vadodara in southern Gujarat) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas was fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas. In Saurashtra, as elsewhere, the Marathas were met with resistance. The decline of the Mughal Empire helped form larger peripheral states in Saurashtra, including Junagadh, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar and a few others, which largely resisted the Maratha incursions. = European colonialism, 1614‚Äì1947 = In the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and Portuguese all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and after the Battle of Diu, acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli. These enclaves were administered by Portuguese India under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961 by military conquest. The British East India Company established a factory in Surat in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir, which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by Bombay after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial outpost in India was in Gujarat.WINGS Birding Tours to India: the West ‚Äì Gujarat and the Rann of Kutch ‚Äì Itinerary .

Most notably, from 1705 to 1716, Senapati Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Pilaji Gaekwad, first ruler of Gaekwad dynasty, established the control over Baroda and other parts of Gujarat. The British East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1802‚Äì1803. Many local rulers, notably the Maratha Gaekwad Maharajas of Baroda (Vadodara), made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule. An epidemic outbreak in 1812 killed half the population of Gujarat. Mahatma Gandhi picking salt at Dandi beach, South Gujarat ending the Salt satyagraha on 5 April 1930 Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the Bombay Presidency, with the exception of Baroda State, which had a direct relationship with the Governor-General of India. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar, Kutch and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely Ahmedabad, Broach (Bharuch), Kaira (Kheda), Panchmahal and Surat, were governed directly by British officials. = Post independence = After Indian independence and the partition of India in 1947, the new Indian government grouped the former princely states of Gujarat into three larger units; Saurashtra, which included the former princely states on the Kathiawad peninsula, Kutch, and Bombay state, which included the former British districts of Bombay Presidency together with most of Baroda State and the other former princely states of eastern Gujarat. Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra (Kathiawar) and parts of Hyderabad state and Madhya Pradesh in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Agitation by Gujarati nationalists, the Mahagujarat Movement, and Marathi nationalists, the Samyukta Maharashtra, for their own states led to the split of Bombay state on linguistic lines; on 1 May 1960, it became the new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In 1969 riots, at least 660 died and properties worth millions were destroyed. The first capital of Gujarat was Ahmedabad; the capital was moved to Gandhinagar in 1970. Nav Nirman Andolan was a socio-political movement of 1974. It was a students' and middle-class people's movement against economic crisis and corruption in public life. This was the first and last successful agitation after the Independence of India that ousted an elected government. The Morvi dam failure, in 1979, resulted in the death of thousands of people and large economic loss. In the 1980s, a reservation policy was introduced in the country, which led to anti- reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake was located about 9 km south-southwest of the village of Chobari in Bhachau Taluka of Kutch District. This magnitude 7.7 shock killed around 20,000 people (including at least 18 in South-eastern Pakistan), injured another 167,000 and destroyed nearly 400,000 homes.

Geography  Gujarat borders the Tharparkar, Badin and Thatta districts of Pakistan's Sindh province to the northwest, is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the southwest, the state of Rajasthan to the northeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and by Maharashtra, the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south. Historically, the north was known as Anarta, the Kathiawar peninsula, \\"Saurastra\\", and the south as \\"Lata\\".P. Page xvii Historical and Cultural Chronology of Gujarat edited by Manjulal Ranchholdlal Majmudar Gujarat was also known as Pratichya and Varuna.P. 391 The Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism by Benjamin Walker The Arabian Sea makes up the state's western coast. The capital, Gandhinagar is a planned city. Gujarat has an area of with the longest coastline (24% of Indian sea coast) , dotted with 41 ports: one major, 11 intermediate and 29 minor. The Sabarmati is the largest river in Gujarat followed by the Tapi, although the Narmada covers the longest distance in its passage through the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project is built on the Narmada River, one of the major rivers of peninsular India with a length of around . It is one of only three rivers in peninsular India that run from east to west ‚Äì the others being the Tapi River and the Mahi River. A riverfront project has been built on the Sabarmati River. Gujarat has some of the major mountain ranges of India, including Aravalli, Sahyadri (Western Ghats), Vindhya and Saputara. Apart from this Gir hills, Barda, Jessore, Chotila, etc. are situated in different parts of Gujarat. Girnar is the tallest peak and Saputara is the only hill-station in the state. = Rann of Kutch = The Rann of Kutch is a seasonally marshy saline clay desert located in the Thar Desert biogeographic region in between the province of Sindh and the state of Gujarat. Situated from the village of Kharaghoda in the Surendranagar District and Pakistan's Sindh province. The name \\"Rann\\" comes from the Gujarati word rann (‡™∞‡™£) meaning \\"desert\\".

The population density is 308 km‚àí2 (797.6/sq mi), lower than other Indian states. As per the census of 2011, the state has a sex ratio of 918 females for every 1000 males, one of the lowest (ranked 24) among the 29 states in India. While Gujarati speakers constitute a majority of Gujarat's population, the metropolitan areas of Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat are cosmopolitan, with numerous other ethnic and language groups. Marwaris compose large minorities of economic migrants; smaller communities of people from the other states of India has also migrated to Gujarat for employment. Luso-Indians, Anglo-Indians, Jews and Parsis also live in the areas. Sindhi presence is traditionally important here following the Partition of India in 1947. = Religion = According to 2011 census, the religious makeup in Gujarat was 88.6% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim, 1.0% Jain, 0.5% Christian, 0.1% Sikh, 0.05% Buddhist and 0.03% others. Around 0.1% did not state any religion. Hinduism is the major religion of the state, as about 89% population of the state is Hindu. Muslims are the biggest minority in the state accounting for 9.5% of the population. Gujarat has the third-largest population of Jains in India, following Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Zoroastrians, also known in India as Parsi and Irani, are believed to have migrated to Gujarat to escape adverse conditions in Persia and maintain their traditions. They have also played an instrumental role in economic development, with several of the best-known business conglomerates of India run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the Tata, Godrej, and Wadia families.

It is spoken natively by 86% of the state's population, or 52 million people (as of 2011). Other major languages, according to the 2001 census, are Bhili (4.8%), Hindi (4.7%, includes speakers of the Rajasthani varieties), Sindhi (1.9%, includes figures for Kutchi), Marathi (1.5%) and Urdu (1.1%). People from the Kutch region of Gujarat also speak in the Kutchi mother tongue, and to a great extent appreciate Sindhi as well. Memoni is the mother tongue of Kathiawar and Sindhi Memons, most of them who are exclusively Muslims. Almost 88% of the Gujarati Muslims speak Gujarati as their mother tongue, whilst the other 12% speak Urdu. A sizeable proportion of Gujarati Muslims are bilingual in both languages; Islamic academic institutions (Darul Uloom) place a high prestige on learning Urdu and Arabic, with students' memorising the Quran and ahadith, and emphasising the oral and literary importance of mastering these languages as a compulsory rite of religion. Other native languages spoken in low proportions are Bhili and Gamit. Apart from this, English, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marwari, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and others are spoken by a considerable number of economic migrants from other states of India seeking employment.

Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of adult suffrage from one of 182 constituencies, of which 13 are reserved for scheduled castes and 27 for scheduled tribes. The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the President of India, and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly. The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister. Swarnim Sankul 2, Office of Gujarat Government After the independence of India in 1947, the Indian National Congress (INC) ruled the Bombay State (which included present-day Gujarat and Maharashtra). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960. During and after India's State of Emergency of 1975‚Äì1977, public support for the INC eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995 with the brief rule of nine months by Janata Morcha. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Keshubhai Patel who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by Shankersinh Vaghela. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister. On 1 June 2007, Narendra Modi became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat. BJP retained the power in subsequent elections in 2007 and 2012 and Narendra Modi continued as the Chief Minister. After Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India in 2014, Anandiben Patel became the first female Chief Minister of the state. Vijay Rupani took over as Chief Minister and Nitin Patel as Dy. Chief Minister on 7 August 2016 after Anandiben Patel resigned earlier on 3 August.  Economy  During the British Raj, Gujarati businesses served to play a major role to enrich the economy of Karachi and Mumbai. Major agricultural produce of the state includes cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), dates, sugar cane, milk and milk products. Industrial products include cement and petrol. According to a 2009 report on economic freedom by the Cato Institute, Gujarat is the most free state in India (the second one being Tamil Nadu). Reliance Industries operates the oil refinery at Jamnagar, which is the world's largest grass-roots refinery at a single location. The world's largest shipbreaking yard is in Gujarat near Bhavnagar at Alang. India's only Liquid Chemical Port Terminal at Dahej, developed by Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal Co Ltd. Gujarat has two of the three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the country (Dahej and Hazira). Two more LNG terminals are proposed, at Pipavav and Mundra. Mundra Port, Kutch Gujarat has 85% village connectivity with all‚Äêweather roads. Nearly 100% of Gujarat's 18,000 villages have been connected to the electrical grid for 24-hour power to households and eight hours of power to farms, through the Jyotigram Yojana. , Gujarat ranks first nationwide in gas-based thermal electricity generation with a national market share of over 8%, and second nationwide in nuclear electricity generation with national market share of over 1%. The state registered 12.8% agricultural growth in the last five years against the national average of 2%. Gujarat records highest decadal agricultural growth rate of 10.97%. Over 20% of the S&P; CNX 500 conglomerates have corporate offices in Gujarat. As per RBI report, in year 2006‚Äì07, 26% out of total bank finance in India was in Gujarat. As per a recent survey report of the Chandigarh Labour Bureau, Gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate of 1% against the national average of 3.8%. Legatum Institute's Global Prosperity Index 2012 has recognised Gujarat as one of the two highest-scoring among all states of India on matters of social capital. The state ranks 15th alongside Germany in a list of 142 nations worldwide: higher than several developed nations. = Infrastructure = GIFT One. Tallest tower in Gujarat, GIFT One was inaugurated on 10 January 2013. One other tower called GIFT Two has been finished and more towers are planned. = Industrial growth = Shown here is the Tata Nano, the world's least expensive car. Sanand, Gujarat, is home to Tata Nano. Surat is one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Alang Ship Breaking Gujarat's major cities include Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar. In 2010, Forbes list of the world's fastest growing cities included Ahmedabad at number 3 after Chengdu and Chongqing from China. The state is rich in calcite, gypsum, manganese, lignite, bauxite, limestone, agate, feldspar, and quartz sand, and successful mining of these minerals is done in their specified areas. Jamnagar is the hub for manufacturing brass parts. Gujarat produces about 98% of India's required amount of soda ash, and gives the country about 78% of the national requirement of salt. It is one of India's most prosperous states, having a per-capita GDP significantly above India's average. Kalol, Khambhat, and Ankleshwar are today known for their oil and natural gas production. Dhuvaran has a thermal power station, which uses coal, oil, and gas. Also, on the Gulf of Khambhat, southeast of Bhavnagar, is the Alang Ship Recycling Yard (the world's largest). MG Motor India manufactures its cars at Halol near Vadodara, Tata Motors manufactures the Tata Nano from Sanand near Ahmedabad, and AMW trucks are made near Bhuj. Surat, a city by the Gulf of Khambhat, is a hub of the global diamond trade. In 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in Surat. The diamond industry employs 500,000 people in Gujarat. At an investor's summit entitled \\"Vibrant Gujarat Global Investor Summit\\", arranged between 11 and 13 January 2015, at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, the state government signed 21000 Memoranda of Understanding for Special Economic Zones worth a total of 2.5 million crores (short scale). However, most of the investment was from domestic industry. In the fourth Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summit held at Science City, Ahmedabad, in January 2009, there were 600 foreign delegates. In all, 8668 MOUs worth 12500 billion were signed, estimated to create 2.5 million new job opportunities in the state. In 2011, Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summit MOUs worth 21 trillion ( 463 billion) were signed. Gujarat is a state with surplus electricity. The Kakrapar Atomic Power Station(KAPS) is a nuclear power station run by NPCIL that lies in the proximity of the city of Surat. According to the official sources, against demand of 40,793 million units during the nine months since April 2010, Gujarat produced 43,848 million units. Gujarat sold surplus power to 12 states: Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal. = Energy = Astonfield's 11.5 MW solar plant in Gujarat Gujarat invests in development of solar energy in the state and has had India's largest solar power plant . It has allotted 716 MW of solar power capacity to 34 national and international solar project developers in 2009, against the planned 500 MW capacity under its solar power policy. This is expected to bring in investments of INR 120 billion and generate employment for 5,000 people. By 2014, Gujarat plans on producing 1000MW of energy by solar power. = Agriculture = Traditional farming The total geographical area of Gujarat is 19,602,400 hectares, of which crops take up 10,630,700 hectares. The three main sources of growth in Gujarat's agriculture are from cotton production, the rapid growth of high-value foods such as livestock, fruits and vegetables, and from wheat production, which saw an annual average growth rate of 28% between 2000 and 2008 (According to the International Food Policy Research Institute). Other major produce includes bajra, groundnut, cotton, rice, maize, wheat, mustard, sesame, pigeon pea, green gram, sugarcane, mango, banana, sapota, lime, guava, tomato, potato, onion, cumin, garlic, isabgul and fennel. Whilst, in recent times, Gujarat has seen a high average annual growth of 9% in the agricultural sector, the rest of India has an annual growth rate of around 3%. This success was lauded by former President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. The strengths of Gujarat's agricultural success have been attributed to diversified crops and cropping patters; climatic diversity (8 climatic zones for agriculture); the existence of 4 agricultural universities in the state, which promote research in agricultural efficiency and sustainability; co-operatives; adoption of hi-tech agriculture such as tissue culture, green houses and shed-net houses; agriculture export zones; strong marketing infrastructure, which includes cold storage, processing units, logistic hubs and consultancy facilities. Gujarat is the main producer of tobacco, cotton, and groundnuts in India. Other major food crops produced are rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, tur, and gram. The state has an agricultural economy; the total crop area amounts to more than one-half of the total land area. Animal husbandry and dairying have played vital roles in the rural economy of Gujarat. Dairy farming, primarily concerned with milk production, functions on a co-operative basis and has more than a million members. Gujarat is the largest producer of milk in India. The Amul milk co-operative federation is well known all over India, and it is Asia's biggest dairy. Among the livestock raised are, buffaloes and other cattle, sheep, and goats. As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002‚Äì03, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries. The adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy cooperatives. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers. An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited). Amul Plant at Anand Amul Was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946, in the city of Anand, Gujarat. The cooperative, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF), is jointly owned by around 2.6 million milk producers in Gujarat. Amul has been seen as one of the best examples of cooperative achievement and success in a developing economy and the Amul pattern of growth has been taken as a model for rural development, particularly in the agricultural sector of developing economies. The company stirred the White Revolution of India (also known as Operation Flood), the world's biggest dairy development program, and made the milk- deficient nation of India the largest milk producer in the world, in 2010. The \\"Amul Model\\" aims to stop the exploitation by middlemen and encourage freedom of movement since the farmers are in control of procurement, processing and packaging of the milk and milk products. The company is worth 2.5 billion US dollars (). 70% of Gujarat's area is classified as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply. Of the total gross irrigated area, 16‚Äì17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83‚Äì84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \\"safe\\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. One megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year. The Government of Gujarat, to improve soil management and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a Soil Health Card. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, soil fertility status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation, State Fertiliser Corporation and Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative. 1,200,000 soil test data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer's field villages have gone into a database. Assistance and advice for this project was given by local agricultural universities and crop and soil-specific data was added to the database. This allows the soil test data to be interpreted and recommendations or adjustments made in terms of fertiliser requirements, which are also added to the database.  Culture  Gujarat is home for the Gujarati people. Gujarat was also the home of Mahatma Gandhi, a worldwide figure known for his non-violent struggle against British rule, and Vallabhbhai Patel, a founding father of the Republic of India. = Literature = Hemchandra acharya with his disciple Kumarpal Raja. He is regarded as the father of the Gujarati language. Gujarati literature's history may be traced to 1000 CE. Well known laureates of Gujarati literature are Hemchandracharya, Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, Akho, Premanand Bhatt, Shamal Bhatt, Dayaram, Dalpatram, Narmad, Govardhanram Tripathi, Mahatma Gandhi, K. M. Munshi, Umashankar Joshi, Suresh Joshi, Swaminarayan, Pannalal Patel and Rajendra Shah. Kavi Kant, Zaverchand Meghani and Kalapi are famous Gujarati poets. Gujarat Vidhya Sabha, Gujarat Sahitya Sabha, and Gujarati Sahitya Parishad are Ahmedabad based literary institutions promoting the spread of Gujarati literature. Saraswatichandra is a landmark novel by Govardhanram Tripathi. Writers like Aanand Shankar Dhruv, Ashvini Bhatt, Balwantray Thakore, Bhaven Kachhi, Bhagwatikumar Sharma, Chandrakant Bakshi, Gunvant Shah, Harindra Dave, Harkisan Mehta, Jay Vasavada, Jyotindra Dave, Kanti Bhatt, Kavi Nanalal, Khabardar, Sundaram, Makarand Dave, Ramesh Parekh, Suresh Dalal, Tarak Mehta, Vinod Bhatt, Dhruv Bhatt and Varsha Adalja have influenced Gujarati thinkers. A notable contribution to Gujarati language literature came from the Swaminarayan paramhanso, like Bramhanand, Premanand, with prose like Vachanamrut and poetry in the form of bhajans. Shrimad Rajchandra Vachnamrut and Shri Atma Siddhi Shastra, written in 19th century by philosopher Shrimad Rajchandra (Mahatma Gandhi's guru) are very well known. Gujarati theatre owes a lot to Bhavai. Bhavai is a folk musical performance of stage plays. Ketan Mehta and Sanjay Leela Bhansali explored artistic use of bhavai in films such as Bhavni Bhavai, Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Dayro (gathering) involves singing and conversation reflecting on human nature. Mumbai theatre veteran, Alyque Padamsee, best known in the English-speaking world for playing Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Sir Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, was from a traditional Gujarati-Kutchi family from Kathiawar. = Cuisine = Gujarati Thali Gujarati food is primarily vegetarian. The typical Gujarati thali consists of rotli or bhakhari or thepala or rotlo, dal or kadhi, khichdi, Bhat and shak. Athanu (Indian pickle) and chhundo are used as condiments. The four major regions of Gujarat all bring their own styles to Gujarati food. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy at the same time. In Saurashtra region, chhash (buttermilk) is believed to be a must-have in their daily food. = Cinema = The Gujarati film industry dates back to 1932, when the first Gujarati film, Narsinh Mehta, was released. After flourishing through the 1960s to 1980s, the industry saw a decline. The industry is revived in recent times. The film industry has produced more than one thousand films since its inception. The Government of Gujarat announced a 100% entertainment tax exemption for Gujarati films in 2005 and a policy of incentives in 2016. = Music = Gujarati folk music, known as Sugam Sangeet, is a hereditary profession of the Barot, Gadhvi and Charan communities. The omnipresent instruments in Gujarati folk music include wind instruments, such as turi, bungal, and pava, string instruments, such as the ravan hattho, ektaro, and jantar and percussion instruments, such as the manjira and zanz pot drum. = Festivals = File:Navratri Garba.jpgGarba during Navaratri in Ahmedabad File:Navratri garba at Ambaji temple.jpgNavratri Garba at Ambaji temple File:Dandiya Raas.jpgTourists playing Dandiya Raas File:International Kite Festival,India.JPGInternational Kite Festival, Ahmedabad The folk traditions of Gujarat include bhavai and raas-garba. Bhavai is a folk theatre; it is partly entertainment and partly ritual, and is dedicated to Amba. The raas-garba is a folk dance done as a celebration of Navratri by Gujarati people. The folk costume of this dance is chaniya choli for women and kedia for men. Different styles and steps of garba include dodhiyu, simple five, simple seven, popatiyu, trikoniya (hand movement which forms an imagery triangle), lehree, tran taali, butterfly, hudo, two claps and many more Sheri garba is one of the oldest form of garba where all the ladies wear red patola sari and sing along while dancing. It is a very graceful form of garba. Makar Sankranti is a festival where people of Gujarat fly kites. In Gujarat, from December through to Makar Sankranti, people start enjoying kite flying. Undhiyu, a special dish made of various vegetables, is a must-have of Gujarati people on Makar Sankranti. Surat is especially well known for the strong string which is made by applying glass powder on the row thread to provide it a cutting edge. Apart from Navratri and Uttarayana, Diwali, Holi, Tazia and others are also celebrated. = Diffusion of culture = Due to close proximity to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of seafaring, long-distance trade, and overseas contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati diaspora was a logical outcome of such a tradition. During the pre-modern period, various European sources have observed that these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and in many parts of the world, such as the Persian Gulf, Middle East, Horn of Africa, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Philippines. long before the internal rise of the Maratha Dynasty, and the British Raj colonial occupation. Early 1st- century Western historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius are testament to Gujarati people's role in the spread of Buddhism in the Mediterranean, when it was recorded that the sramana monk Zarmanochegas (ŒñŒ±œÅŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœáŒ∑Œ≥·Ω∞œÇ) of Barygaza met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch while Augustus was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death in an act to demonstrate his faith.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 15 December 1852 ‚Äì 25 August 1908) was a French engineer, physicist, Nobel laureate, and the first person to discover evidence of radioactivity. For work in this field he, along with Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie (Marie Curie) and Pierre Curie, received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics. The SI unit for radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named after him. Biography =Early life= Becquerel was born in Paris into a wealthy family which produced four generations of physicists: Becquerel's grandfather (Antoine C√©sar Becquerel), father (Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel), and son (Jean Becquerel). Henri started off his education by attending the Lyc√©e Louis-le- Grand school, a prep school in Paris. He studied engineering at the √âcole Polytechnique and the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es. In 1874, Henri married Lucie Zo√© Marie Jamin, who would die while giving birth to their son, Jean. In 1890 he married Louise D√©sir√©e Lorieux. =Career= In Becquerel's early career, he became the third in his family to occupy the physics chair at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in 1892. Later on in 1894, Becquerel became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways before he started with his early experiments. Becquerel's earliest works centered on the subject of his doctoral thesis: the plane polarization of light, with the phenomenon of phosphorescence and absorption of light by crystals.Henri Becquerel ‚Äì Biographical. Nobelprize.org. Early in his career, Becquerel also studied the Earth's magnetic fields. Becquerel's discovery of spontaneous radioactivity is a famous example of serendipity, of how chance favors the prepared mind. Becquerel had long been interested in phosphorescence, the emission of light of one color following a body's exposure to light of another color. In early 1896, there was a wave of excitement following Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen's discovery of X-rays on 5 January. During the experiment, R√∂ntgen \\"found that the Crookes tubes he had been using to study cathode rays emitted a new kind of invisible ray that was capable of penetrating through black paper\\". Learning of R√∂ntgen's discovery from earlier that year during a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences caused Becquerel to be interested, and soon \\"began looking for a connection between the phosphorescence he had already been investigating and the newly discovered x-rays\\" of R√∂ntgen, and thought that phosphorescent materials, such as some uranium salts, might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation when illuminated by bright sunlight. By May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source. There followed a period of intense research into radioactivity, including the determination that the element thorium is also radioactive and the discovery of additional radioactive elements polonium and radium by Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie. The intensive research of radioactivity led to Becquerel publishing seven papers on the subject in 1896. Becquerel's other experiments allowed him to research more into radioactivity and figure out different aspects of the magnetic field when radiation is introduced into the magnetic field. \\"When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field, they deflected in different directions or not at all, showing that there were three classes of radioactivity: negative, positive, and electrically neutral.\\" As often happens in science, radioactivity came close to being discovered nearly four decades earlier in 1857, when Abel Ni√©pce de Saint-Victor, who was investigating photography under Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that could darken photographic emulsions.Niepce de Saint-Victor (1857) \\"M√©moire sur une nouvelle action de la lumi√®re\\" (On a new action of light), Comptes rendus ... , vol. 45, pages 811‚Äì815.Niepce de Saint-Victor (1858) \\"Deuxi√®me m√©moire sur une nouvelle action de la lumi√®re\\" (Second memoir on a new action of light), Comptes rendus ... , vol. 46, pages 448‚Äì452. By 1861, Niepce de Saint-Victor realized that uranium salts produce \\"a radiation that is invisible to our eyes\\". Niepce de Saint-Victor knew Edmond Becquerel, Henri Becquerel's father. In 1868, Edmond Becquerel published a book, La lumi√®re: ses causes et ses effets (Light: Its causes and its effects). On page 50 of volume 2, Edmond noted that Niepce de Saint-Victor had observed that some objects that had been exposed to sunlight could expose photographic plates even in the dark. Niepce further noted that on the one hand, the effect was diminished if an obstruction were placed between a photographic plate and the object that had been exposed to the sun, but \\" ‚Ä¶ d'un autre c√¥t√©, l'augmentation d'effet quand la surface insol√©e est couverte de substances facilement alt√©rables √† la lumi√®re, comme le nitrate d'urane ‚Ä¶ \\" ( ... on the other hand, the increase in the effect when the surface exposed to the sun is covered with substances that are easily altered by light, such as uranium nitrate ... ).Edmond Becquerel, La lumi√®re: ses causes et ses effets, vol. 2 (Paris, France: F. Didot, 1868), page 50.  Experiments  Describing them to the French Academy of Sciences on 27 February 1896, he said: > One wraps a Lumi√®re photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets > of very thick black paper, such that the plate does not become clouded upon > being exposed to the sun for a day. One places on the sheet of paper, on the > outside, a slab of the phosphorescent substance, and one exposes the whole > to the sun for several hours.

Accessed 02 March 2019. =Late career= Later in his life in 1900, Becquerel measured the properties of Beta Particles, and he realized that they had the same measurements as high speed electrons leaving the nucleus. In 1901 Becquerel made the discovery that radioactivity could be used for medicine. Henri made this discovery when he left a piece of radium in his vest pocket and noticed that he had been burnt by it. This discovery led to the development of radiotherapy which is now used to treat cancer. Becquerel did not survive much longer after his discovery of radioactivity and died on 25 August 1908, at the age of 55, in Le Croisic, France. His death was caused by unknown causes, but was reported that \\"he had developed serious burns on his skin, likely from the handling of radioactive materials.\\" Honors and awards fogged by exposure to radiation from a uranium salt. The shadow of a metal Maltese Cross placed between the plate and the uranium salt is clearly visible. In 1889, Becquerel became a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences. In 1900, Becquerel won the Rumford Medal for his discovery of the radioactivity of uranium and he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour. The Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities awarded him the Helmholtz Medal in 1901. In 1903, Henri shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity. In 1905, he was awarded the Barnard Medal by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. In 1906, Henri was elected Vice Chairman of the academy, and in 1908, the year of his death, Becquerel was elected Permanent Secretary of the Acad√©mie des Sciences. During his lifetime, Becquerel was honored with membership into the Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Academy of Berlin. Becquerel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1908. Becquerel has been honored with being the namesake of many different scientific discoveries. The SI unit for radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named after him. There is a crater named Becquerel on the Moon and also a crater named Becquerel on Mars. The uranium-based mineral becquerelite was named after Henri. See also * Antoine C√©sar Becquerel (his grandfather) * A. E.

In digital audio, the sound wave of the audio signal is typically encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence. For example, in CD audio, samples are taken 44,100 times per second, each with 16-bit sample depth. Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in digital form. Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s and 1980s, it gradually replaced analog audio technology in many areas of audio engineering and telecommunications in the 1990s and 2000s. In a digital audio system, an analog electrical signal representing the sound is converted with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) into a digital signal, typically using pulse-code modulation (PCM). This digital signal can then be recorded, edited, modified, and copied using computers, audio playback machines, and other digital tools. When the sound engineer wishes to listen to the recording on headphones or loudspeakers (or when a consumer wishes to listen to a digital sound file), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs the reverse process, converting a digital signal back into an analog signal, which is then sent through an audio power amplifier and ultimately to a loudspeaker. Digital audio systems may include compression, storage, processing, and transmission components. Conversion to a digital format allows convenient manipulation, storage, transmission, and retrieval of an audio signal. Unlike analog audio, in which making copies of a recording results in generation loss and degradation of signal quality, digital audio allows an infinite number of copies to be made without any degradation of signal quality. Overview sampling and 4-bit quantization). Digital audio technologies are used in the recording, manipulation, mass-production, and distribution of sound, including recordings of songs, instrumental pieces, podcasts, sound effects, and other sounds. Modern online music distribution depends on digital recording and data compression. The availability of music as data files, rather than as physical objects, has significantly reduced the costs of distribution. Before digital audio, the music industry distributed and sold music by selling physical copies in the form of records and cassette tapes. With digital-audio and online distribution systems such as iTunes, companies sell digital sound files to consumers, which the consumer receives over the Internet. An analog audio system converts physical waveforms of sound into electrical representations of those waveforms by use of a transducer, such as a microphone. The sounds are then stored on an analog medium such as magnetic tape, or transmitted through an analog medium such as a telephone line or radio. The process is reversed for reproduction: the electrical audio signal is amplified and then converted back into physical waveforms via a loudspeaker. Analog audio retains its fundamental wave-like characteristics throughout its storage, transformation, duplication, and amplification. Analog audio signals are susceptible to noise and distortion, due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices. Disturbances in a digital system do not result in error unless the disturbance is so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturb the sequence of symbols. It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely error-free digital audio system in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format and conversion back to analog. A digital audio signal may optionally be encoded for correction of any errors that might occur in the storage or transmission of the signal. This technique, known as channel coding, is essential for broadcast or recorded digital systems to maintain bit accuracy. Eight-to-fourteen modulation is a channel code used in the audio compact disc (CD). =Conversion process= The lifecycle of sound from its source, through an ADC, digital processing, a DAC, and finally as sound again. A digital audio system starts with an ADC that converts an analog signal to a digital signal.Some audio signals such as those created by digital synthesis originate entirely in the digital domain, in which case analog to digital conversion does not take place. The ADC runs at a specified sampling rate and converts at a known bit resolution. CD audio, for example, has a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (44,100 samples per second), and has 16-bit resolution for each stereo channel. Analog signals that have not already been bandlimited must be passed through an anti-aliasing filter before conversion, to prevent the aliasing distortion that is caused by audio signals with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate). A digital audio signal may be stored or transmitted. Digital audio can be stored on a CD, a digital audio player, a hard drive, a USB flash drive, or any other digital data storage device. The digital signal may be altered through digital signal processing, where it may be filtered or have effects applied. Sample-rate conversion including upsampling and downsampling may be used to conform signals that have been encoded with a different sampling rate to a common sampling rate prior to processing. Audio data compression techniques, such as MP3, Advanced Audio Coding, Ogg Vorbis, or FLAC, are commonly employed to reduce the file size. Digital audio can be carried over digital audio interfaces such as AES3 or MADI. Digital audio can be carried over a network using audio over Ethernet, audio over IP or other streaming media standards and systems. For playback, digital audio must be converted back to an analog signal with a DAC. According to the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem, with some practical and theoretical restrictions, a bandlimited version of the original analog signal can be accurately reconstructed from the digital signal. History =Coding= Pulse-code modulation (PCM) was invented by British scientist Alec Reeves in 1937. In 1950, C. Chapin Cutler of Bell Labs filed the patent on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), a data compression algorithm. Adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) was introduced by P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant and James L. Flanagan at Bell Labs in 1973.P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant, and J. L. Flanagan, \\"Adaptive quantization in differential PCM coding of speech\\", Bell Syst. Tech. J., vol. 52, pp. 1105‚Äî1118, Sept. 1973 Perceptual coding was first used for speech coding compression, with linear predictive coding (LPC). Initial concepts for LPC date back to the work of Fumitada Itakura (Nagoya University) and Shuzo Saito (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) in 1966. During the 1970s, Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs developed a form of LPC called adaptive predictive coding (APC), a perceptual coding algorithm that exploited the masking properties of the human ear, followed in the early 1980s with the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) algorithm. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding, a lossy compression method first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, provided the basis for the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), which was developed by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley in 1987.J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson und A. B. Bradley: Subband/transform coding using filter bank designs based on time domain aliasing cancellation, IEEE Proc. Intl. Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2161‚Äì2164, 1987. The MDCT is the basis for most audio coding standards, such as Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3 (MPEG Layer III), Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and Vorbis (Ogg). =Recording= PCM was used in telecommunications applications long before its first use in commercial broadcast and recording. Commercial digital recording was pioneered in Japan by NHK and Nippon Columbia and their Denon brand, in the 1960s. The first commercial digital recordings were released in 1971. The BBC also began to experiment with digital audio in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, it had developed a 2-channel recorder, and in 1972 it deployed a digital audio transmission system that linked their broadcast center to their remote transmitters. The first 16-bit PCM recording in the United States was made by Thomas Stockham at the Santa Fe Opera in 1976, on a Soundstream recorder. An improved version of the Soundstream system was used to produce several classical recordings by Telarc in 1978. The 3M digital multitrack recorder in development at the time was based on BBC technology. The first all-digital album recorded on this machine was Ry Cooder's Bop till You Drop in 1979. British record label Decca began development of its own 2-track digital audio recorders in 1978 and released the first European digital recording in 1979. Popular professional digital multitrack recorders produced by Sony/Studer (DASH) and Mitsubishi (ProDigi) in the early 1980s helped to bring about digital recording's acceptance by the major record companies. The 1982 introduction of the CD popularized digital audio with consumers. =Telephony= The rapid development and wide adoption of PCM digital telephony was enabled by metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) switched capacitor (SC) circuit technology, developed in the early 1970s. This led to the development of PCM codec-filter chips in the late 1970s. The silicon-gate CMOS (complementary MOS) PCM codec-filter chip, developed by David A. Hodges and W.C. Black in 1980, has since been the industry standard for digital telephony. By the 1990s, telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) had been largely digitized with VLSI (very large-scale integration) CMOS PCM codec-filters, widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges, user-end modems and a range of digital transmission applications such as the integrated services digital network (ISDN), cordless telephones and cell phones. Technologies  Sony digital audio tape recorder PCM-7030 Digital audio is used in broadcasting of audio. Standard technologies include Digital audio broadcasting (DAB), Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), HD Radio and In-band on-channel (IBOC). Digital audio in recording applications is stored on audio-specific technologies including CD, Digital Audio Tape (DAT), Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) and MiniDisc. Digital audio may be stored in a standard audio file formats and stored on a Hard disk recorder, Blu-ray or DVD-Audio. Files may be played back on smartphones, computers or MP3 player.

The company is currently active in open-pit, large-scale alluvial, coastal and deep sea mining. It operates in 35 countries and mining takes place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Canada and Australia. From its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century, De Beers controlled 80% to 85% of rough diamond distribution and is a monopoly. Competition has since dismantled the complete monopoly, though the De Beers Group still sells approximately 35% of the world's rough diamond production through its global sightholder and auction sales businesses, an effectual monopoly, as this still allows it to control prices, inflating them dramatically.The Incredible Story Of How De Beers Created And Lost The Most Powerful Monopoly Ever, Business Insider The company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild & Sons bank. In 1926, Ernest Oppenheimer, a German immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American with American financier J.P. Morgan, was elected to the board of De Beers. He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until his death in 1957. During this time, he was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing and trust behaviour, and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the U.S. war effort during World War II. In 2011, Anglo American took control of De Beers after buying the Oppenheimer's family stake of 40 percent for US$5.1 billion (¬£3.2 billion) and increasing its stake to 85 percent, ending the 80-year Oppenheimer control of the company. History =Foundation= Cecil Rhodes founded De Beers in 1888 Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, of the Rothschild family, funded the development of De Beers Preference share of the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., issued 1 March 1902 The name 'De Beers' was derived from the two Dutch settlers, brothers Diederik Arnoldus De Beer (25 December 1825 ‚Äì 1878) and Johannes Nicolaas De Beer (6 December 1830 ‚Äì 20 June 1883), who owned a South African farm named Vooruitzicht (Dutch for \\"prospect\\" or \\"outlook\\") near Zandfontein in the Boshof District of Orange Free State. After they discovered diamonds on their land, the increasing demands of the British government forced them to sell their farm on 31 July 1871 to merchant Alfred Johnson Ebden (1820‚Äì1908) for ¬£6,600. Vooruitzicht would become the site of the Big Hole and the De Beers mine, two successful diamond mines. Their name, which was given to one of the mines, subsequently became associated with the company.Famous people, Cape Town Diamond Museum Cecil Rhodes, the founder of the British South Africa Company, got his start by renting water pumps to miners during the diamond rush that started in 1869, when an 83.5 carat diamond called the 'Star of South Africa' was found at Hopetown near the Orange River in South Africa. He invested the profits of this operation into buying up claims of small mining operators, with his operations soon expanding into a separate mining company. He soon secured funding from the Rothschild family, who would finance his business expansion. De Beers Consolidated Mines was formed in 1888 by the merger of the companies of Barney Barnato and Cecil Rhodes, by which time the company was the sole owner of all diamond mining operations in the country. In 1889, Rhodes negotiated a strategic agreement with the London-based Diamond Syndicate, which agreed to purchase a fixed quantity of diamonds at an agreed price, thereby regulating output and maintaining prices. The agreement soon proved to be very successful ‚Äì for example, during the trade slump of 1891‚Äì1892, supply was simply curtailed to maintain the price. Rhodes was concerned about the break-up of the new monopoly, stating to shareholders in 1896 that the company's \\"only risk is the sudden discovery of new mines, which human nature will work recklessly to the detriment of us all\\". The Second Boer War proved to be a challenging time for the company. Kimberley was besieged as soon as war broke out, thereby threatening the company's valuable mines. Rhodes personally moved into the city at the onset of the siege in order to put political pressure on the British government to divert military resources towards relieving the siege rather than more strategic war objectives. Despite being at odds with the military, Rhodes placed the full resources of the company at the disposal of the defenders, manufacturing shells, defences, an armoured train and a gun named Long Cecil in the company workshops. =Oppenheimer control= In 1898, diamonds were discovered on farms near Pretoria, Transvaal. One led to the discovery of the Premier Mine. The Premier Mine was registered in 1902 and the Cullinan Diamond, the largest rough diamond ever discovered, was found there in 1905. (The Premier Mine was renamed the Cullinan Mine in 2003). However, its owner refused to join the De Beers cartel. Instead, the mine started selling to a pair of independent dealers named Bernard and Ernest Oppenheimer, thereby weakening the De Beers stronghold. Francis Oats, who became Chairman of De Beers in 1908, was dismissive of the threats from the Premier mine and the finds in German South West Africa. However, production soon equalled all of the De Beers mines combined. Ernest Oppenheimer was appointed the local agent for the powerful London Syndicate, rising to the position of mayor of Kimberley within 10 years. He understood the core principle that underpinned De Beers' success, stating in 1910 that \\"common sense tells us that the only way to increase the value of diamonds is to make them scarce, that is to reduce production\\". During World War I, the Premier mine was finally absorbed into De Beers. When Rhodes died in 1902, De Beers controlled 90% of the world's diamond production. Ernest Oppenheimer took over the chairmanship of the company in 1929, after buying shares and being appointed to the board in 1926. Oppenheimer was very concerned about the discovery of diamonds in 1908 in German South West Africa, fearing that the increased supply would swamp the market and force prices down. Former CIA chief Admiral Stansfield Turner claimed that De Beers restricted US access to industrial diamonds needed for the country's war effort during World War II. In May 1955, Ernest Oppenheimer opened the new headquarters which combined the operations of Anglo American and the De Beers group. After Ernest died in November 1957, he passed on the operations of Anglo and De Beers to his son, Harry Oppenheimer. Under Harry, the company expanded to several different countries around the globe, including Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Portugal, Zambia, and Tanzania. In South Africa, Harry opposed apartheid, arguing that it hindered economic growth. Of course, they were blamed anyway, for De Beers has been criticized for profiting from the system during the apartheid period . By 1973, Anglo and De Beers accounted for 10 percent of South Africa's gross national product and 30 percent of the country's exports. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, De Beers attempted to secretly enter the United States' diamond market, being forced to divest its American assets in 1975 to avoid the risk of violating anti-trust laws. Harry Oppenheimer stepped down as the chairman and director of Anglo- American and De Beers in December 1982. =21st-century changes = Russian president Vladimir Putin meeting former De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer in South Africa in 2006 During the 20th century, De Beers used several methods to leverage its dominant position to influence the international diamond market. Firstly, it convinced independent producers to join its single channel monopoly. When that did not work, it flooded the market with diamonds similar to those of producers who refused to join in. It purchased and stockpiled diamonds produced by other manufacturers as well as surplus diamonds in order to control prices by limiting supply. Finally, it bought diamonds when prices fell considerably, such as during the Great Depression.William Boyes; Michael Melvin (1 January 2012). Microeconomics. Cengage Learning. pp. 219‚Äì. . In 2000, the De Beers business model changed because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel, as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced De Beers to \\"avoid the risk of bad publicity\\" by limiting sales to its own mined products. De Beers' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to 29.5% in 2019, because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition, as well as more transparency and greater liquidity. In November 2011, the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40% stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc, thereby increasing Anglo American's ownership of the company to 85% (the other 15% is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana). The transaction was worth ¬£3.2 billion (US$5.1 billion) in cash and ended the Oppenheimer dynasty's 80-year ownership of De Beers. =Marketing= De Beers successfully advertised diamonds to manipulate consumer demand. One of the most effective marketing strategies has been the marketing of diamonds as a symbol of love and commitment. A copywriter working for N. W. Ayer & Son, Frances Gerety (1916‚Äì1999), coined the famous advertising slogan, 'A Diamond is Forever', in 1947. In 2000, Advertising Age magazine named 'A Diamond is Forever' the best advertising slogan of the 20th century. Other successful campaigns include the 'eternity ring' (meant as a symbol of continuing affection and appreciation), the 'trilogy ring' (meant to represent the past, present, and future of a relationship) and the 'right hand ring' (meant to be bought and worn by women as a symbol of independence). De Beers ran television advertisements featuring silhouettes of people wearing diamonds, set to the music of 'Palladio' by Karl Jenkins. The campaign, titled \\"Shadows and Lights\\" first ran in the spring of 1993. The song would later inspire a compilation album, 'Diamond Music,' released in 1996, which features the 'Palladio' suite. A 2010 commercial for Verizon Wireless parodied the De Beers spots. In May 2018, De Beers introduced a new brand called \\"Lightbox\\" that are made with synthetic diamonds. The synthetic stones start at $200 for a quarter carat to $800 for full carat diamond. The new lab-grown diamond retail for about one-tenth the cost of naturally occurring diamonds. The new brand began selling in September 2018 and are produced in Gresham, Oregon, a $94 million facility using the region's cheap electricity, which opened in 2018 with the capacity for 500,000 rough carats of diamonds per year. Operations De Beers Mine shaft Premier Mine shaft The De Beers Snap Lake Mine in Canada Mining in Botswana takes place through the mining company Debswana, a 50‚Äì50 joint venture with the Government of the Republic of Botswana. It operates four mines‚ÄîJwaneng, Orapa, Letlhakane and Damtshaa, though Damtshaa was put on care and maintenance in 2015. In Namibia, mining is carried out through Namdeb Holdings, a 50‚Äì50 joint venture with the Government of the Republic of Namibia. Namdeb Holdings is made up of Debmarine Namibia (covering offshore mining) and Namdeb Diamond Corporation (land-based coastal mining). For offshore mining, motor vessels are used, including the sixth and latest, the N$2.3 billion SS Nujoma, the world's most advanced diamond exploration and sampling vessel, which began full operations in June 2017. De Beers Consolidated Mines is responsible for the De Beers mining in South Africa. It is 74% owned by De Beers and 26% by a broad-based black economic empowerment partner, Ponahalo Investments. There are two mines‚ÄîVenetia and Voorspoed. Transnational Corporations (TNCs) employ a myriad of crooked tactics in this regard, including mis-invoicing inputs, transfer pricing and other trading scams, tax avoidance and evasion of royalties, bribery, \\"round-tripping\\" investment through tax havens, and outright theft of profits. Examples abound: in South Africa, Sarah Bracking and Khadija Sharife reported that De Beers mis-invoiced $2.83 billion of diamonds over six years.Sarah Bracking and Khadija Sharife, \\"Diamond Pricing and Valuation in South Africa‚Äôs Extractive Political Economy\\", 150 (2016): 556‚Äì75. In 2008, De Beers began production at the Snap Lake mine in Northwest Territories, Canada; this was the first De Beers mine outside Africa and was Canada's first completely underground diamond mine. However, production was suspended when the mine was put on care and maintenance in 2015. De Beers opened the Victor mine in Ontario, Canada, the same year, a day after Snap Lake. This was followed by the opening of the company's third mine in Canada, Gahcho Ku√©, in September 2016. Trading of rough diamonds takes place through two channels ‚Äì De Beers Global Sightholder Sales (GSS) and De Beers Auction Sales. GSS sells about 90% of De Beers' rough diamonds, by value, and features wholly owned and joint venture operations in South Africa (De Beers Sightholder Sales South Africa), Botswana (DTCB), and Namibia (NDTC). They sort, value and sell 33% (2013) of the world's rough diamonds by value. There are two main types of customer for rough diamonds ‚Äì Sightholders and Accredited Buyers. Sightholders have a term contract. Accredited Buyers (a customer type introduced in 2014‚Äì15) have a more ad hoc arrangement. De Beers also sells about 10% of its rough diamonds through online auction sales. The company pioneered the approach in 2008 when it broke with 44 years of direct sales to hold the diamond industry's first online international auction sale. It is now the world's leader in this kind of auction sale. De Beers employs more than 30,000 people around the globe on five continents, with more than 17,000 employees in Africa. Almost 8,000 people are employed in Botswana, around 6,200 in South Africa, nearly 2,900 in Namibia, some 1,260 in Canada and about 320 in exploration. In February 2020, De Beers reported its worst set of earnings since the company was bought by miner Anglo American in 2012. =Business structure and brands= On 4 November 2011, Anglo American plc and CHL Holdings announced their agreement for Anglo American to acquire an incremental interest in De Beers, increasing Anglo American's 45% shareholding in the world's leading diamond company to 85%. De Beers plc was originally incorporated as De Beers Soci√©t√© Anonyme in 2000 in Luxembourg. Following the closure of this office, the company was reclassified as De Beers plc in 2017, with its head office now in Jersey. It is made up of two shareholdings: Anglo American plc has an 85% shareholding and the Government of the Republic of Botswana owns 15% directly. De Beers plc is the holding company of The De Beers Group of Companies. It is involved in many parts of the diamond value chain, from mining to sales, and is made up of a series of joint ventures and wholly owned operations. The joint ventures are: * Debmarine Namibia * Debswana * DTCB * Namdeb * NDTC The wholly owned operations are in southern Africa and Canada. Also wholly owned are Forevermark, De Beers Jewellers, the International Institute of Diamond Valuation, De Beers Ventures, the International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research and Element Six (Umicore has a 40% stake in Element Six's abrasives division). Forevermark Forevermark was launched in 2008 as one of the two diamond brands from The De Beers Group of Companies. According to the company website, \\"Each Forevermark diamond is inscribed with a promise: that it is beautiful, rare and responsibly sourced.\\" Forevermark diamonds are inscribed with an icon and unique identification number, albeit invisibly to the naked eye: the Forevermark inscription is 1/20th of a micron deep. This inscription helps distinguish Forevermark diamonds from other natural diamonds though, similarly to when distinguishing natural diamonds from synthetic diamonds, it requires specialist detection equipment to view. The inscription also helps maintain scarcity: the Forevermark website boasts that only a tiny percentage of diamonds qualify for the Forevermark brand. De Beers Jewellers De Beers Diamond Jewellers (DBDJ) was established in 2001 as a 50:50 joint venture between The De Beers Group of Companies and LVMH, the French luxury goods company. The first De Beers boutique opened in 2002 on London's Old Bond Street as the brand's flagship store. Since then, stores have opened in various cities around the world. In March 2017, The De Beers Group of Companies acquired LVMH's 50% shareholding in DBDJ and new name De Beers Jewellers was unveiled. De Beers Ventures De Beers Ventures was established by De Beers Group in June 2017 to consider minority stake investments in start- ups and growth companies that could be of benefit to De Beers Group or the broader diamond sector. The International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research The International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research (IIDGR) was set up by De Beers in 2008, with the aim of providing a range of services and equipment in the field of diamond verification. It is based in London, Antwerp and, from 2015, in Surat, India. The IIDGR works only on diamonds that meet the requirements of the United Nations' World Diamond Council Kimberley Process. =Blood diamonds and the Kimberley Process= In 1999, a campaign by Global Witness to highlight the role of diamonds in international conflicts led to a review by the United Nations. The initial focus of the UN's investigation was on Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola, which was found to have bartered uncut diamonds for weaponry despite international economic and diplomatic sanctions being in effect through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173. In 1999, De Beers Group stopped all outside buying of diamonds in order to guarantee the conflict-free status of their diamonds effective from 26 March 2000.De Beers Group De Beers Report to Stakeholders 2005/6 ‚Äì Ethics, \\"Conflict and Instability\\" De Beers Group. Retrieved 11 February 2007. In December 2000, following the recommendations of the Fowler Report, the UN adopted the landmark General Assembly Resolution A/RES/55/56 supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry, led by De Beers, and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), which sets out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade and became effective in 2003. De Beers states that 100% of the diamonds it now sells are conflict-free and that all De Beers diamonds are purchased in compliance with national law, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and its own Diamond Best Practice Principles.Best Practice Principles ‚Äì The De Beers Group The Kimberley process has helped restore the reputation of the industry, as well as eliminating sources of excess supply. In 2018, De Beers used blockchain technology to successfully track 100 high-value diamonds. The diamonds were tracked through the manufacturing process from the mine to the retailer in order to ensure their quality and conflict-free status. In 2019, they launched their own end-to-end traceability platform called Tracr to enable all diamonds to be identified and traced as they move from the mine to the store. Signet and the Russian-based Alrosa are using the technology.  Corporate affairs  In August 2017, De Beers partnered with the Stanford Graduate School of Business to accelerate business ventures to market in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. As part of two programs, the partnership is set to help teach early entrepreneurs how to commercialize their business ideas. The partnership is a 3-year, $3 million deal. In September 2017, De Beers partnered with UN Women to help the advancement of women within the company and the countries it operates in. In 2018, the two entities launched a program to support 500 women micro- entrepreneurs in Blouberg and Musina communities, near De Beers' Venetia diamond mine. In May 2018, De Beers partnered with Element Six to create lab- grown diamonds.  Former Operations  International Institute of Diamond Valuation The International Institute of Diamond Valuation (IIDV) was launched by De Beers Group in March 2016. Operating in partnership with diamond jewellery retailers, it provides a reselling service for all diamonds, regardless of value. On April 2019, De Beers closed its IIDV division. Legal issues =Sherman Antitrust Act= During World War II, Ernest Oppenheimer attempted to negotiate a way around the Sherman Antitrust Act by proposing that De Beers register a US branch of the Diamond Syndicate Incorporated. In this way, his company could provide the US with the industrial diamonds it desperately sought for the war effort in return for immunity from prosecution after the war; however his proposal was rejected by the US Justice Department when it was discovered that De Beers had no intention of stockpiling any industrial diamonds in the US. In 1945, the Justice Department finally filed an antitrust case against De Beers, but the case was dismissed as the company had no presence on US soil. =Relocation of indigenous San people in Botswana= In Botswana, a long dispute has existed between the interests of the mining company, De Beers, and the San (Bushman) tribe. The San have been facing threats of forcible relocation since 1980s, when the diamond resources were discovered. A campaign was fought in an attempt to bring an end to what the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International, considers to be a genocide of a tribe that has been living in those lands for tens of thousands of years. Several international fashion models, including Iman, Lily Cole and Erin O'Connor, who were previously involved with advertising for the companies' diamonds, supported the campaign. De Beers sold its mine in Botswana to Gem Diamonds in 2007. =Industrial diamonds= In 2004, De Beers pled guilty and paid a US$10 million fine to the United States Department of Justice to settle a 1994 charge that De Beers had colluded with General Electric to fix the price of industrial diamonds. In 2008, De Beers agreed to pay US$295 million class-action settlement after accusations of price fixing. The company appealed the decision but ended up paying the settlement in 2013. =European Commission= In February 2006, De Beers entered into legally binding commitments with the European Commission to cease purchasing rough diamonds from Russian mining company Alrosa as of the end of 2008 in order to ensure competition between the two companies.Alrosa Purchasing Commitments ‚Äì The De Beers Group =South Africa's rough diamond trade= In 2014, the Leverhulme Centre for the Study of Value, based at the University of Manchester, published a report authored by Sarah Bracking and Khadija Sharife, identifying over US$3 billion in price fixing of South African rough diamond trade from 2005 to 2012. The report found significant evidence of profit shifting through volume and value manipulation.Sarah Bracking and Khadija Sharife http://thestudyofvalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WP4-Bracking- Sharife-Rough-and-polished-15May.pdf Sharife simultaneously published an articleKhadija Sharife, 100 Reporters http://100r.org/2014/05/rough-and- polished/ disclosing the political system that cultivated revenue leakage, including the donation of De Beers staff to the State Diamond Trader (SDT). The report, like the article, utilised aggregated data produced by the Kimberley Process (KP) certificates of import-exports, relying on figures listed by the diamond companies themselves, in which De Beers was the dominant player. The South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) disclosed that De Beers did not authorise them to publish figures involving values, sales, pricing and other data, preventing transparency of the industry.

It lies about north of the modern city of Taos, New Mexico. The pueblos are considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.\\"Taos Pueblo\\", Taos website This has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Taos Pueblo is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos. The Taos community is one of the most private, secretive, and conservative pueblos. Natives will almost never speak of their religious customs to outsiders, and because their language has never been written down, much of the culture remains unknown to the rest of the world. A Tribal Lands of is attached to the pueblo, and about 4,500 people live in this area. Setting The pueblo was constructed in a setting backed by the Taos Mountains of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The settlement was built on either side of Rio Pueblo de Taos, also called Rio Pueblo and Red Willow Creek, a small stream that flows through the middle of the pueblo compound. Its headwaters come from the nearby mountains. Taos Pueblo's most prominent architectural feature is a multi-storied residential complex of reddish-brown adobe, built on either side of the Rio Pueblo. The Pueblo's website states it was probably built between 1000 and 1450. The pueblo was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 9, 1960. In 1992 it was designated as a UNESCO Heritage Site. As of 2006, about 150 people live in the historic complex full-time. Name =Taos language= In the Tanoan language of Taos (Northern Tiwa), the pueblo is referred to as \\"the village\\" in either t…ôÃÇotho \\"in the village\\" (t…ôÃÇo- \\"village\\" + -tho \\"in\\") or t…ôÃÇobo \\"to/toward the village\\" (t…ôÃÇo- \\"village\\" + -bo \\"to, toward\\"). The proper name of the pueblo is »âa≈Çoph√°ym≈≥p‚Äô»çh…ôÃÅoth…ôÃÄolbo \\"at red willow canyon mouth\\" (or »âa≈Çoph√°ybo \\"at the red willows\\" for short). This name is more commonly used in ceremonial contexts and is less common in everyday speech. =Spanish language= The name Taos in English was borrowed from Spanish Taos. Spanish Taos is probably a borrowing of Taos t…ôÃÇo- \\"village\\" which was heard as tao to which the plural -s was added although in the modern language Taos is no longer a plural noun. The idea that the Spanish Taos is from tao, \\"cross of the order of San Juan de los Caballeros\\" (from Greek tau), is unlikely.Jones, William. (1960). \\"Origin of the place name Taos\\", Anthropological Linguistics, 2 (3), 2‚Äì4; Trager, George L. (1960). \\"The name of Taos, New Mexico\\", Anthropological Linguistics, 2 (3), 5‚Äì6. History =Pre-Columbian= Most archeologists believe that the Taos Indigenous people, along with other Pueblo Indigenous people, settled along the Rio Grande after migrating south from the Four Corners region. The dwellings of that region were inhabited by the Ancestral Puebloans. A long drought in the area in the late 13th century may have caused them to move to the Rio Grande, where the water supply was more dependable. However, their reason for migrating is still disputed and there is evidence that a violent struggle took place. Ultimately, archeological clues point to the idea that the Natives may have been forced to leave. Throughout its early years, Taos Pueblo was a central point of trade between the native populations along the Rio Grande and their Plains Tribes neighbors to the northeast. Taos Pueblo hosted a trade fair each fall after the agricultural harvest. =Post-contact= The first Spanish visitors to Taos Pueblo arrived in 1540; they were members of the Francisco V√°squez de Coronado expedition, which stopped at many of New Mexico's pueblos in search of the rumored Seven Cities of Gold. Around 1620, Spanish Jesuits oversaw construction of the first Catholic Church in the pueblo, the mission of San Geronimo de Taos. Reports from the period indicate that the native people of Taos resisted the building of the church and imposition of the Catholic religion. Throughout the 1600s, cultural tensions grew between the native populations of the Southwest and the increasing Spanish colonial presence. Taos Pueblo was no exception. By 1660, the native people killed the resident priest and destroyed the church. Several years after it was rebuilt, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 began; the Taos destroyed the church and killed two resident priests. In 1924-25 the Taos Pueblo culture was studied by German psychiatrist Carl Jung, who visited the Pueblo led by Ochwiay Biano. He was very interested in indigenous societies as he believed they were more closely in touch with archetypes. Taos Mountain Taos Mountain pictured on an old postcard, circa 1930-1945. The Pueblo's of mountain land was taken by President Theodore Roosevelt and designated as the Carson National Forest early in the 20th century. It was finally returned in 1970 by the United States when President Nixon signed Public Law 91-550.Julyan, B: New Mexico's Wilderness Areas: The Complete Guide, page 73. Big Earth Publishing, 1999 An additional south of the ridge between Simpson Peak and Old Mike Peak and west of Blue Lake were transferred back to the Pueblo in 1996. Blue Lake Blue Lake, which the people of the Pueblo consider sacred, was included in this return of Taos land. The Pueblo notably involved non-native people in lobbying the federal government for the return of Blue Lake, as they argued that their unrestricted access to the lake and the surrounding region was necessary to ensure their religious freedom. The Pueblo's web site names the reacquisition of the sacred Blue Lake as the most important event in its history due to the spiritual belief that the Taos people originated from the lake. It is believed that their ancestors live there, and the pueblos themselves only ascend the mountain twice a year. Architecture Church, Pueblo de Taos (Ansel Adams‚Äî1941) At the time of the Spaniards' initial contact, Hernando de Alvarado described the pueblo as having adobe houses built very close together and stacked five or six stories high. The homes became narrower as they rose, with the roofs of each level providing the floors and terraces for those above. The buildings at Taos originally had few windows and no standard doorways. Instead, access to rooms was through square holes in the roof that the people reached by climbing long, wooden ladders. Engelmann Spruce logs (or vigas) supported roofs that had layers of branches, grass, mud, and plaster covering them. The architecture and the building materials were well suited for the rigors of the environment and the needs of the people in the Taos Valley. Prior to the arrival of Coronado, all Taos Pueblo walls were constructed using balls of adobe (clay) about the size of a 'soft ball', Coronado introduced the technique of the formed mud brick, this technique revolutionized adobe construction in the new world. Coronado also changed the roof structure, to use 2\\" to 4\\" inch aspen saplings branches installed at a right angle to the Engelmann Spruce vigas, then 2\\" to 3\\" inches of adobe plaster was applied, topped off with up to half a meter of loose soil ( about 18\\" inches thick ) for insulation and structural strength. Thus indigenous architecture evolved. The first Spanish-influenced architecture appeared in Taos Pueblo after Fray Francisco de Zamora came there in 1598 to establish a mission, under orders from Spanish Governor, Don Juan de O√±ate. =Main structure= Pueblo de Taos ‚Äî north side structure, circa 2005. The north-side Pueblo is said to be one of the most photographed and painted buildings in North America. It is the largest multistoried Pueblo structure still existing. It is made of adobe walls that are often several feet thick. Its primary purpose was for defense. Up to as late as 1900, access to the rooms on lower floors was by ladders on the outside to the roof, and then down an inside ladder. In case of an attack, outside ladders could easily be pulled up. =Homes= The homes in this structure usually consist of two rooms, one of which is for general living and sleeping, and the second of which is for cooking, eating, and storage. Each home is self-contained; there are no passageways between the houses. Taos Indians made little use of furniture in the past, but today they have tables, chairs, and beds. In the pueblo, electricity, running water, and indoor plumbing are prohibited. Spiritual community cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides) (Ansel Adams‚Äî1941) =Religious practices= Two spiritual practices are represented in the Pueblo: the original indigenous spiritual and religious tradition and Roman Catholicism. The majority of Taos Indians practice their still-vital, ancient indigenous religion. Most (90%) members of the Taos Pueblo community are baptized as Roman Catholics. Saint Jerome, or San Geronimo, is the patron saint of the pueblo. Culture = Traditions Involving the Land = Since Spanish colonization, the native Taos people have resisted cultural change and influence with European ideas. Many ethnographers observe a high level of \\"interconnectedness and mutual dependence\\" between the Taos Pueblo and their surrounding land, where they derive many of their cultural traditions. Consequently, a historical rivalry exits between the people on the South side of the river (summer people) and the North side (winter people). Foot races, which have significant religious meaning in the tribe, are a common way for these two group to express their rivalry, and there is a long held tradition in their tribe that was possibly created before the pyramids. In addition, the Taos Pueblo attribute great value to Blue Lake in regards to their \\"living culture and agricultural sustainability.\\" = Death Traditions = According to Wood, the Taos Pueblo people never turn strangers away from their doors because they value both courtesy and hospitality. However, on All Souls' Day, the Taos Pueblo spend a day with their families and close their village to any non-Indian. The Taos Pueblo approach death with an air of \\"stoicism,\\" and they are only allowed to visit cemeteries on All Souls' Day or the day of someone's burial. = Gender = In the cultural fabric of the Taos Pueblo, the ethnographic data suggests that women are considered to be subordinate to men. The Pueblo social structure is dictated by kiva memberships, and women are not allowed to take part in the rituals held in these sacred spaces because they \\"are not trained\\" to do so. Despite the exclusion of women from some spiritual activities, the women in the Taos Pueblo society \\"exercised a considerable degree of influence economically, politically, and interpersonally.\\" For example, single women can run their own households, and married women control their own finances because they traditionally work as cooks or maids. Additionally, women have informal decision making power, using their abilities to influence the men around them.  Conservation  The Taos Pueblo preservation program received a $800,000 grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The fund aims to hire more workers, especially those who are trained in traditional construction techniques for conservation work, as well as workshop assistants who help pueblo homeowners with maintenance of traditional adobe homes. Supervisors teach trainees about traditional construction methods while rebuilding the majority of an 11-unit house which was in a state of near- collapse. The first phase of the conservation of Taos Pueblo is the construction of the training center, restoration of 120-150 houses, training of the local people in the community, creation of a detailed assessment of the structure of the compound, and establishment of a cultural center and tribal archives. The second phase was financed by the World Monument Fund. It's listed on its watchlist because of its endangered nature, both culturally and structurally. By the end of the conservation efforts, twenty-one adobe houses are expected to be restored. The previous fund has also covered the cost of a laser scanning of the structures. The main characteristics of the conservation of Taos Pueblo aim to encourage a community-based approach. They include the training of local people to manage their own property, as well as the establishment of partnerships with government and non-government entities. The project resolves to preserve the traditional way of life in the community and sustain cultural traditions.

It was launched in 1995 with joint efforts of leading producers of video camera recorders. It is the foundation of the MiniDV format. DVC compatibility mark The original DV specification, known as Blue Book, was standardized within the IEC 61834 family of standards. These standards define common features such as physical videocassettes, recording modulation method, magnetization, and basic system data in part 1. Part 2 describes the specifics of video systems supporting 525-60 for NTSC and 625-50 for PAL.Recording ‚Äì Helical-scan digital videocassette recording system using 6,35 mm magnetic tape for consumer use The IEC standards are available as publications sold by IEC and ANSI. In 2003, DV was joined by a successor format HDV, which used the same tape format with a different video codec. Some cameras at the time had the ability to switch between DV and HDV recording modes. All tape-based and optical disc-based video formats have become obsolete as cameras recording on memory cards and solid-state drives have become the norm since they offer increased ruggedness, speed and storage space which allows for higher bitrate and resolution video, although the DV encoding standard is sometimes still used.  DV compression  DV uses lossy compression of video while audio is stored uncompressed. An intraframe video compression scheme is used to compress video on a frame-by-frame basis with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Closely following the ITU-R Rec. 601 standard, DV video employs interlaced scanning with the luminance sampling frequency of 13.5 MHz. These results in 480 scanlines per complete frame for the 60 Hz system, and 576 scanlines per complete frame for the 50 Hz system. In both systems the active area contains 720 pixels per scanline, with 704 pixels used for content and 16 pixels on the sides left for digital blanking. The same frame size is used for 4:3 and 16:9 frame aspect ratios, resulting in different pixel aspect ratios for fullscreen and widescreen video. Prior to the DCT compression stage, chroma subsampling is applied to the source video in order to reduce the amount of data to be compressed. Baseline DV uses 4:1:1 subsampling in its 60 Hz variant and 4:2:0 subsampling in the 50 Hz variant. Low chroma resolution of DV (compared to higher-end digital video formats) is a reason this format is sometimes avoided in chroma keying applications, though advances in chroma keying techniques and software have made producing quality keys from DV material possible.fxguide.com Audio can be stored in either of two forms: 16-bit Linear PCM stereo at 48 kHz sampling rate (768 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit PCM channels at 32 kHz sampling rate (384 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 MBit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1 kHz (706 kbit/s per channel, 1.4 Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio. In practice, the 48 kHz stereo mode is used almost exclusively.  Digital Interface Format  The audio, video, and metadata are packaged into 80-byte Digital Interface Format (DIF) blocks which are multiplexed into a 150-block sequence. DIF blocks are the basic units of DV streams and can be stored as computer files in raw form or wrapped in such file formats as Audio Video Interleave (AVI), QuickTime (QT) and Material Exchange Format (MXF). One video frame is formed from either 10 or 12 such sequences, depending on scanning rate, which results in a data rate of about 25 Mbit/s for video, and an additional 1.5 Mbit/s for audio. When written to tape, each sequence corresponds to one complete track. Baseline DV employs unlocked audio. This means that the sound may be +/- ‚Öì frame out of sync with the video. However, this is the maximum drift of the audio/video synchronization; it is not compounded throughout the recording. Variants Sony and Panasonic created their proprietary versions of DV aimed toward professional & broadcast users, which use the same compression scheme, but improve on robustness, linear editing capabilities, color rendition and raster size. All DV variants except for DVCPRO Progressive are recorded to tape within interlaced video stream. Film-like frame rates are possible by using pulldown. DVCPRO HD supports native progressive format when recorded to P2 memory cards. =DVCPRO= DVCPRO compatibility mark DVCPRO, also known as DVCPRO25, is a variation of DV developed by Panasonic and introduced in 1995 for use in electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment. Unlike baseline DV, DVCPRO uses locked audio and 4:1:1 chroma subsampling for both 50 Hz and 60 Hz variants to decrease generation losses. Audio is available in 16-bit/48 kHz precision. When recorded to tape, DVCPRO uses wider track pitch - 18 Œºm vs. 10 Œºm of baseline DV, which reduces the chance of dropout errors during recording. Two extra longitudinal tracks provide support for audio cue and for timecode control. Tape is transported 80% faster compared to baseline DV, resulting in shorter recording time. Long Play mode is not available. = DVCAM = DVCAM compatibility mark In 1996 Sony responded with its own professional version of DV called DVCAM.https://cvp.com/pdf/sony_dvcam_family.pdf Like DVCPRO, DVCAM uses locked audio, which prevents audio synchronization drift that may happen on DV if several generations of copies are made. When recorded to tape, DVCAM uses 15 Œºm track pitch, which is 50% wider compared to baseline. Accordingly, tape is transported 50% faster, which reduces recording time by one third compared to regular DV. Because of the wider track and track pitch, DVCAM has the ability to do a frame-accurate insert edit, while regular DV may vary by a few frames on each edit compared to the preview. =DVCPRO50= DVCPRO50 compatibility mark DVCPRO50 was introduced by Panasonic in 1997 for high-value electronic news gathering and digital cinema, and is often described as two DV codecs working in parallel. The DVCPRO50 doubles the coded video data rate to 50 Mbit/s. This has the effect of cutting total record time of any given storage medium in half. Chroma resolution is improved by using 4:2:2 chroma subsampling. DVCPRO50 was used in many productions where high definition video was not required. For example, BBC used DVCPRO50 to record high-budget TV series, such as Space Race (2005) and Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire (2006). A similar format, D-9, offered by JVC, uses videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS. Comparable high quality standard definition digital tape formats include Sony's Digital Betacam, launched in 1993, and MPEG IMX, launched in 2001. =DVCPRO Progressive= DVCPRO Progressive mark DVCPRO Progressive was introduced by Panasonic for news gathering, sports journalism and digital cinema. It offered 480 or 576 lines of progressive scan recording with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and four 16-bit 48 kHz PCM audio channels. Like HDV-SD, it was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video.480p production systems The format offered six modes for recording and playback: 16:9 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (25 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (25 Mbit/s). The format has been superseded with DVCPRO HD. =DVCPRO HD= DVCPRO HD compatibility mark DVCPRO HD, also known as DVCPRO100 is a high-definition video format that can be thought of as four DV codecs that work in parallel. Video data rate depends on frame rate and can be as low as 40 Mbit/s for 24 frame/s mode and as high as 100 Mbit/s for 50/60 frame/s modes. Like DVCPRO50, DVCPRO HD employs 4:2:2 color sampling. DVCPRO HD uses smaller raster size than broadcast high definition television: 960x720 pixels for 720p, 1280x1080 for 1080/59.94i and 1440x1080 for 1080/50i. Similar horizontal downsampling is used in many other HD formats. To maintain compatibility with HDSDI, DVCPRO100 equipment upsamples video during playback. Variable framerates (from 4 to 60 frame/s) are available on VariCam camcorders. DVCPRO HD equipment offers backward compatibility with older DV/DVCPRO formats. When recorded to tape in standard-play mode, DVCPRO HD uses the same 18 Œºm track pitch as other DVCPRO flavors. A long play variant, DVCPRO HD-LP, doubles the recording density by using 9 Œºm track pitch. DVCPRO HD is codified as SMPTE 370M; the DVCPRO HD tape format is SMPTE 371M, and the MXF Op-Atom format used for DVCPRO HD on P2 cards is SMPTE 390M. While technically DVCPRO HD is a direct descendant of DV, it is used almost exclusively by professionals. Tape-based DVCPRO HD cameras exist only in shoulder mount variant. A similar format, Digital-S (D-9 HD), was offered by JVC and used videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS. The main competitor to DVCPRO HD was HDCAM, offered by Sony. It uses a similar compression scheme but at higher bitrate.  Progressive recording  Tape- based DV variants, except for DVCPRO Progressive, do not support native progressive recording, therefore progressively acquired video is recorded within interlaced video stream using pulldown. The same technique is used in television industry to broadcast movies. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 60 Hz market record 24-frame/s video using 2-3 pulldown and 30-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 50 Hz market record 25-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown. Progressive video can be recorded with interlaced delivery in mind, in which case high-frequency information between fields is blended to suppress interline twitter. If the goal is progressive- scan distribution like Web videos, progressive-scan DVD-video or filmout, then no filtering is applied. Video recorded with 2-2 pulldown and no vertical filtering is conceptually identical to progressive segmented frame. Consumer- grade DV camcorders capable of progressive recording usually offer only 2-2 pulldown scheme because of its simplicity. Such a video can be edited as either interlaced or progressive and does not require additional processing aside of treating every pair of fields as one complete frame. Canon and Panasonic call this format Frame Mode, while Sony calls it Progressive Scan recording. 24 frame/s recording is available only on professional DV camcorders and requires pulldown removal if editing at native frame rate is required. DVCPRO HD supports native progressive recording at 50 or 60 frame/s in 720p mode. To record video acquired at 24, 25 or 30 frame/s frame repeating is used. Frame repeating is similar to field repeating used in interlaced video, and is also called pulldown sometimes.  Recording media  = Magnetic tape = DV was originally designed for recording onto magnetic tape. Tape is enclosed into videocassette of four different sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large. All DV cassettes use ¬º inch (6.35 mm) wide tape. Small cassettes, also known as S-size or MiniDV cassettes, had been intended for amateur use, but have become accepted in professional productions as well. MiniDV cassettes are used for recording baseline DV, DVCAM, and HDV. Each tape holds about 13 GB for one hour of video. Medium or M-size cassettes are used in professional Panasonic equipment and are often called DVCPRO tapes. Panasonic video recorders that accept medium cassette can play back from and record to medium cassette in different flavors of DVCPRO format; they will also play small cassettes containing DV or DVCAM recording via an adapter. Large or L-size cassettes are accepted by most standalone DV tape recorders and are used in many shoulder-mount camcorders. The L-size cassette can be used in both Sony and Panasonic equipment; nevertheless, they are often called DVCAM tapes. Older Sony decks would not play large cassettes with DVCPRO recordings, but newer models can. Extra-large cassettes or XL-size have been designed for use in Panasonic equipment and are sometimes called DVCPRO XL. These cassettes are not widespread, and only two models of standalone Panasonic tape recorders can accept them. Technically, any DV cassette can record any variant of DV video. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate recording time with regards to the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate recording time of baseline DV; another number can indicate recording time of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the recording time is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long. Panasonic stipulated use of a particular magnetic-tape formulation‚Äîmetal particle (MP)‚Äîas an inherent part of its DVCPRO family of formats. Regular DV tape uses Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation (which, as the name suggests, uses physical vapor deposition to deposit metal onto the tapehttp://www.totalmedia.com/content/trivia-and- tips/what-is-metal-evaporated-tape.html), which was pioneered for use in Hi8 camcorders. Early Hi8 ME tape was plagued with excessive dropouts, which forced many shooters to switch to more expensive MP tape. After the technology improved, the dropout rate was greatly reduced, nevertheless Panasonic deemed ME formulation not robust enough for professional use. Tape-based professional Panasonic camcorders (with the exception of the handheld DVC80, DVX100 and HVX200 cameras) do not use small DV cassettes, effectively preventing use of ME tape.

Quarter for scale. = File-based media = With proliferation of tapeless camcorder video recording, DV video can be recorded on optical discs, solid state flash memory cards and hard disk drives and used as computer files. In particular: * Sony XDCAM family of cameras can record DV onto either Professional Disc or SxS memory cards. * Panasonic DVCPRO HD and AVC-Intra camcorders can record DV (as well as DVCPRO) onto P2 cards. * Some Panasonic AVCHD camcorders (AG-HMC80, AG-AC130, AG-AC160) record DV video onto Secure Digital memory cards. * JVC GY-HM750 can be set to standard definition mode and in this case will record '.AVI or .MOV SD legacy format' video onto SDHC cards. For clarity - and contrary to what has previously been written, the camera does not natively support SxS memory cards, has no slots for them and requires an optional add-on recorder (or 'adapter' as JVC call it) to achieve this - basically this camera is an 'XDCAM EX' High definition unit and the add-on SxS recorder was only made available to achieve better compatibility in facilities which were Sony based. * Most DV and HDV camcorders can feed live DV stream over IEEE 1394 interface to an external file-based recorder. Video is stored either as native DIF bitstream or wrapped into an audio/video container such as AVI, QuickTime or MXF. * DV-DIF is the raw form of DV video. The files usually have extensions *.dv or *.dif. * DV- AVI is Microsoft's implementation of DV video file, which is wrapped into an AVI container. Two variants of wrapping are available: with Type 1 the multiplexed audio and video is saved into the video section of a single AVI file, with Type 2 video and audio are saved as separate streams in an AVI file (one video stream and one to four audio streams). This container is used primarily on Windows-based computers, though Sony offers two tapeless recorders, the HDD-based HVR-DR60 and the CompactFlash-based HVR-MRC1K, for use with DV/HDV camcorders that can record in DV-AVI format either making a file-based copy of the tape or bypassing tape recording altogether. Panasonic AVCHD camcorders use Type 2 DV-AVI for recording DV video onto Secure Digital memory card. * QuickTime-DV is DV video wrapped into QuickTime container. This container is used primarily on Apple computers. * MXF-DV wraps DV video into MXF container, which is presently used on P2-based camcorders (Panasonic) and on XDCAM/XDCAM EX camcorders (Sony). Connectivity Nearly all DV camcorders and decks have IEEE 1394 (FireWire, i.LINK) ports for digital video transfer. This is usually a two-way port, so that DV video data can be output to a computer (DV-out), or input from either a computer or another camcorder (DV- in). The DV-in capability makes it possible to copy edited DV video from a computer back onto tape, or make a lossless copy between two mutually connected DV camcorders. However, models made for sale in the European Union usually had the DV-in capability disabled in the firmware by the manufacturer because the camcorder would be classified by the EU as a video recorder and would therefore attract higher duty; a model which only had DV-out could be sold at a lower price in the EU. When video is captured onto a computer it is stored in a container file, which can be either raw DV stream, AVI, WMV or QuickTime. Whichever container is used, the video itself is not re-encoded and represents a complete digital copy of what has been recorded onto tape. If needed, the video can be recorded back to tape to create a full and lossless copy of the original footage. Some camcorders also feature a USB 2.0 port for computer connection. This port is usually used for transferring still images, but not for video transfer. Camcorders that offer video transfer over USB usually do not deliver full DV quality - usually it is 320x240 video, except for the Sony DCR-PC1000 camcorder and some Panasonic camcorders that provide transfer of a full-quality DV stream via USB by using the UVC protocol. Full- quality DV can also be captured via USB by using separate hardware that receives DV data from the camcorder over a FireWire cable and forwards it without any transcoding to the computer via a USB cable  this can be particularly useful for capturing on modern laptop computers which frequently do not have a FireWire port or expansion slot but always have USB ports. High end cameras and VTRs may have additional professional outputs such as SDI, SDTI or analog component video. All DV variants have a time code, but some older or consumer computer applications fail to take advantage of it. Usage The high quality of DV images, especially when compared to Video8 and Hi8 which were vulnerable to an unacceptable number of video dropouts and \\"hits\\", prompted the acceptance by mainstream broadcasters of material shot on DV. The low costs of DV equipment and their ease of use put such cameras in the hands of a new breed of videojournalists. Programs such as TLC's Trauma: Life in the E.R. and ABC News's Hopkins: 24/7 were shot on DV. DVCPRO HD was the preferred high definition standard of BBC Factual.HD at BBC  Application software support  Most DV players, editors and encoders only support the basic DV format, but not its professional versions. The exception to this being that most (not all) consumer Sony miniDV equipment will play mini-DVCAM tapes. DV Audio/Video data can be stored as raw DV data stream file (data is written to a file as the data is received over FireWire, file extensions are .dv and .dif) or the DV data can be packed into container files (ex: Microsoft AVI, Apple MOV). The DV meta-information is preserved in both file types. Most Windows video software only supports DV in AVI containers, as they use Microsoft's avifile.dll, which only supports reading avi files. Mac OS X video software support both AVI and MOV containers. * Apple Inc.'s iMovie: iMovie allows importing from HDV cameras since iMovie HD, which import in full quality, and DV cameras since iMovie 1, which decodes to half of the original quality, to preserve processing power. * Apple Inc.'s Final Cut Pro: Final Cut Pro allows importing from all DV, HDV, and AVCHD (using the Apple Intermediate Codec or ProRes) cameras. It supports rewinding, fast-forwarding, pausing, stopping and playing from the computer. * Apple Inc.'s QuickTime Player: QuickTime by default only decodes DV to half of the resolution to preserve processing power for editing capabilities. However, in the \\"Pro\\" version the setting \\"High Quality\\" under \\"Show Movie Properties\\" enables full resolution playback. * The VLC media player (Free software): full decoding quality * MPlayer (also with GUI under Windows and Mac OS X): full decoding quality * muvee Technologies autoProducer 4.0: Allows editing using FireWire IEEE 1394 * Quasar DV codec (libdv) - open source DV codec for Linux * DVswitch - open source linear editor for DV streams, with live streaming capabilities * DV Analyzer - open source tool to analyze and detect errors and inconsistencies in DV streams (also extracts and reports the original recording date/time):  Mixing tapes from different manufacturers  There was considerable controversy solely based on hearsay over whether or not using tapes from different manufacturers could lead to dropouts. Initially this was suggested around the conception of mostly MiniDV tapes in the mid to late 90s as the only two manufacturers of MiniDV tapes (Sony, who produce their tapes solely under the Sony brand; and Panasonic, who produce their own tapes under their Panasonic brand and outsources for TDK, Canon, etc.) used two different lubrication types for their cameras - Sony uses a 'wet' lubricant ('ME' or 'Metal Evaporated'), while Panasonic uses a 'dry' lubricant ('MP' or 'Metal Particle'). Though the controversy still remain standard practice for encouraging casual and professional camera operators alike not to mix brands of tapes (as the different lubrication formulations can cause or encourage tape wear if not cleaned by a cleaning cassette), no significant problems have occurred for the last few years - meaning that switching tapes is acceptable, though sticking to one brand (and cleaning the heads with a cleaning cassette before doing so) is highly recommended. A research undertaken by Sony claimed that there was no hard evidence of the above statement. The only evidence claimed was that using ME tapes in equipment designed for MP tapes can cause tape damage and hence dropouts.The Truth About Tape Lubricant Sony has done a significant amount of internal testing to simulate head clogs as a result of mixing tape lubricants, and has been unable to recreate the problem. Sony recommends using cleaning cassettes once every 50 hours of recording or playback. For those who are still skeptical, Sony recommends cleaning video heads with a cleaning cassette before trying another brand of tape.

In addition to individual members, 70 national Esperanto organizations are affiliated with UEA. Its current president is the professor Duncan Charters. The magazine Esperanto is the main organ used by UEA to inform its members about everything happening in the Esperanto community. The UEA was founded in 1908 by the Swiss journalist Hector Hodler and others and is now headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The organization has an office at the United Nations building in New York City.  Structure and affiliated organizations  The Komitato, the highest organ of UEA, gathering in 2008 at the World Congress of Esperanto According to its 1980 statutes (Statuto de UEA), the Universal Esperanto Association has two kinds of members: * individual members join the association directly, paying a fee to the Rotterdam headquarters or to the chief delegate in their country. These members receive the UEA Yearbook and receive the UEA services. * asociaj membroj, those members of the organizations that joined UEA. These members are administered by their respective organizations. It can be a national or a specialist organization. This kind of membership is for the person in question a mere symbolical membership. The highest organ of UEA, the Komitato, has members (komitatanoj) elected in three different ways: * An organization sends at least one komitatano, plus one more for every 1,000 national members, to the Komitato. Most national organizations have only one komitatano. * Per 1,000 individual members, the individual members can choose one member to the Komitato. * Both previous groups by-elect more komitatanoj, up to one third of their numbers. The Komitato elects a board, the Estraro. The Estraro installs a general director and sometimes additionally a director. The general director and his staff work at the UEA headquarters, Oficejo de UEA, in Rotterdam. An individual member can become a delegito, a 'delegate'. This means that he serves as a local contact person for Esperanto and UEA members in his town. A ƒâefdelegito (chief delegate) is someone installed also by the UEA headquarters, but with the task to collect the member fees in a given country. = Youth section = TEJO, the World Esperanto Youth Organization, is the youth section of the UEA. Similar to the World Congress, TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress of Esperanto (Internacia Junulara Kongreso) each year in a different location. The IJK is a week-long event of concerts, presentations, excursions attended by hundreds of young people from all over the world. The youth section has a Komitato and national and specialist affiliated organizations, just as UEA itself. A TEJO volunteer works at the Rotterdam headquarters. = National organizations = National organizations of Esperanto, in green those that joined UEA UEA board members and other distinct UEA members at the inauguration of the 2015 congress The first national Esperanto organization was founded in 1898 in France, originally as a potential international association. In 1903 the second one followed, in Switzerland. Within a couple of years, many of the now still existing national organizations came into existence. Since 1933/1934 they send representatives into the UEA Komitato (a kind of parliament), making it a federation of national organizations. The term in Esperanto was initially mostly Naciaj Societoj (national societies), since 1933 Landaj Asocioj (country associations). When UEA accepted national organizations in 1933/1934 for the first time, it required them to * have at least 100 national members, * be 'organized in an orderly manner', * be neutral, meaning having no political or religious aims, and being open to all citizens of the country.Sikosek, Marcus: Die neutrale Sprache. Eine politische Geschichte des Esperanto-Weltbundes. Diss. Utrecht 2006. Skonpres, Bydgoszcz 2006, p. 126. Especially the last prerequisite caused serious problems, e.g. to the German national association coming in those months under national socialist rule. Later, for example, the Cuban association was refused because its statutes claimed to respect the leading role of the communist party in Cuba. In 1980, the UEA statutes were altered. Since then, a national organization need not be neutral itself, but must respect the neutrality of UEA. = Specialist organizations = Specialist organizations are similar to the national organizations. They are divided into two groups: * neutral organizations, that can join UEA in the same way as a national organizations. In Esperanto they are called aliƒùintaj fakaj asocioj (affiliated specialist associations). Examples are the Esperanto physicians and the Esperanto teachers. * other organizations in (official) collaboration with UEA. They do not send representatives to the Komitato but are mentioned in the Yearbook and can have a room at the World Congress. Some of them refuse to be affiliated because of financial reasons, others because they are non-neutral and cannot join UEA. Examples are the Esperanto vegetarians, the Esperanto Catholics and the Esperanto communists. The youth section TEJO has two affiliated specialist groups, the cyclists and the lovers of rock music.  Activities  = Publications = UEA is the publisher of Esperanto, the most important Esperanto periodical. It was started in 1905 by Paul Berthelot, three years before UEA was founded. UEA founder Hector Hodler took it over in 1907 and made it the official UEA magazine in 1908. In 1920 he left the magazine to the association. Since the 1950s it has a paid editor-in- chief. Next to Esperanto, the Yearbook (Jarlibro de UEA) is the oldest continuous publication of the association. UEA book shop at the 2008 World Congress of Esperanto UEA publishes books and has the largest mail-order Esperanto bookstore in the world (with over 6000 books, CDs and other items). It also maintains an information center and an important Esperanto library, called the Hector Hodler Library. The organisation has a network of local representatives from around the world, the Delegita Reto, who are available to provide information about their geographical area or professional field. = Conventions = The yearly World Esperanto Congress (Universala Kongreso de Esperanto), which attracts 1500-3000 people to a different city each year, is held under the direction of UEA. The first congress took place in 1905, and since 1933/1934 the association is in charge of it. Twice a year, in spring and autumn, UEA headquarters in Rotterdam holds an Open Day. = International organizations = In addition to the UN and UNESCO, UEA also has consultative relations with UNICEF and the Council of Europe, and a general working relationship with the Organization of American States. It works in an official capacity with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an A-liaison to ISO/TC37. UEA is active in public information in the European Union and as necessary at other interstate and international organizations and conferences. The organisation is a member of the European Language Council, a common forum of universities and language associations for the awareness of languages and cultures inside and outside the European Union. In May 2011, UEA officially became an Associate Member of the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm).  History  = The founding years of the Esperanto movement, 1888‚Äì1914 = The modern UEA is the result of a decades- long process of several attempts to give the Esperanto movement a proper organization. The first Esperanto associations were local clubs, of which the one in Nuremberg, Germany, is considered the first (1888). From 1898, national Esperanto associations were found in several countries, with the French one being the first. In 1903 followed the Swiss association, in 1904 the British, in 1906 the German and Swedish etc. The founder of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, wished that an international association came to existence, but the first world congress of 1905 produced only a general manifesto about the essence and neutrality of the movement. The organizing team passed the torch to organizers of a next congress the year after, this eventually created a Konstanta Kongresa Komitato (Permanent Congress Committee). It consisted of two members representing the last congress, two for the current, and two for the following congress. The Esperantists agreed that the whole movement must support two common international tasks: international documentation, propaganda in countries without movements of their own, lobbying at international organizations, organizing the world congresses, etc. The Esperantists did disagree on which or what organization should be responsible for these tasks, how it should collect the money and how it should decide on spending the money. In 1906, the French general Hyppolyte Sebert created his Esperantista Centra Oficejo (Central Office of the Esperantists) in Paris. It collected information on the movement and published an Oficiala Gazeto. In spite of this 'official' name, the office was a purely private enterprise of Sebert, but he tried to reach support from the national associations. One year later, at the Geneva world congress, Zamenhof created a Lingva Komitato (Language Committee, the basis of the later Akademio de Esperanto). It consisted of some eminent speakers from several countries and had to guard the evolution of the language Esperanto. The members of this committee were consequently elected by cooptation. Hector Hodler, son of famous Swiss national painter Ferdinand Hodler, in 1920 In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers around Hector Hodler founded an international association based on individual, direct membership: Universala Esperanto-Asocio, seated in Geneva. According to Hodler and his followers, an international cause such as Esperanto must be supported by a unitary, truly international association. UEA members should found organizations on national and local levels. The national (and local) associations saw UEA as a threat, as an undesirable concurrence.Sikosek, Marcus: Die neutrale Sprache. Eine politische Geschichte des Esperanto- Weltbundes. Diss. Utrecht 2006. Skonpres, Bydgoszcz 2006, pp. 73-76. They were afraid of a division in the movement between the traditional groups on the one hand and the UEA members on the other. Also, propaganda and lessons were the task of the national associations (often federations of local groups). They did not like the perspective that new Esperantists, created by the traditional groups, would be picked up by UEA. So the national associations tried to build up an international organizational level by their own. A first attempt were the rajtigitaj delegitoj of the congresses in 1911 and 1912 (not to be confused with the UEA delegitoj); an Internacia Unuiƒùo de Esperantistaj Societoj (International Union of Esperanto associations, 1913/1914) was a second attempt. This string in the evolution ceased in 1914 with the breakout of World War I, which forced the movement as a whole to pause many of its activities. = UEA in its first years = The original UEA was purely based on individual membership. The members in a given locality, e.g. a town, were supposed to have UEA member conventions and elect a delegito (plural delegitoj), a delegate. The delegate had the task to collect the member fees and send them to the Geneva headquarters, and he represented his members on the international level. The totality of delegates held referenda, and they elected the Komitato (committee), the highest organ of the association. The Komitato was a board with initially eight (since 1910: ten) members. It had a president and a vice president. One of the board members was the director, from 1908 to 1920 this was Hector Hodler. The director was the one who installed delegates in towns where there were less than 20 members. These were 94 percent of the delegates, so in certain way UEA was not so much a democracy but ruled by a circular co-option.Sikosek, Marcus: Die neutrale Sprache. Eine politische Geschichte des Esperanto-Weltbundes. Diss. Utrecht 2006. Skonpres, Bydgoszcz 2006, pp. 63/64. (Since 1920, the Komitato became larger and a kind of parliament, and a board with the name Estraro was established.) Hodler was still the owner and publisher of his magazine Esperanto, published every second week. From the beginning, UEA had a Yearbook - Jarlibro - with basic information about the association and with the addresses of the delegates. Esperanto speakers are divided by different subjects they are interested in. In those early years, there came some specialist organizations into existence, for example the Universala Medicina Esperanto-Asocio of 1908. Hodler tried to give those 'specialists' a home in his UEA. Instead of founding associations of their own, with separate bulletins and conventions, he wanted them to be UEA members and have 'fakoj' (compartments). He also thought of partner organizations, for example hotels who would give a discount to UEA members in change for an advertisement in the UEA Yearbook. Hodler projected an organization fit to contain ten thousands or hundreds of thousands of members, the so-called esperantianoj (UEA members, in opposition to the simple esperantistoj, Esperanto speakers). In fact, UEA had never more than 10,000 members. The association adopted several new statutes until 1920. = Attempts at organization in the interbellum, 1920‚Äì1933 = Meeting of the international Esperanto leaders, in 1926 in the Swiss town of Locarno (some months after the famous Locarno Conference of the European political leaders) In 1920, the Esperanto movement gathered again since the war, at the Hague congress. The discussions eventually created the so-called Helsinki system, on which UEA and the national associations agreed at the congress of 1922 in the Finnish capital. This system defined the movement to consist of these 'official' entities: * Universala Esperanto Asocio (UEA), the international members' association in Geneva; it paid contributions to a common budget * Konstanta Komitato de la Naciaj Societoj (Ko-Ro, Permanent Committee of the National Associations), a newly created organ to represent the national associations; it collected contributions from the national associations for the common budget * Internacia Centra Komitato de la Esperanto-Movado (ICK, International Central Committee of the Esperanto Movement), a newly created organ elected by UEA and Ko-Ro together; administering the common budget and doing the operational business for the international common tasks, also representing the movement as a whole. It consisted of six persons and had a paid secretary. * the congress committee, administered and subsidized by the ICK * the language committee (later the Academy of Esperanto), subsidized by the ICK This Helsinki system lasted for only a couple of years. The heads of the movement saw that on the world congresses three organs gathered discussing essentially the same subjects: the Komitato of UEA, the Ko-Ro of the national associations and the six members of the ICK. From 1929, they all had a joint gathering called ƒúenerala Estraro (general board). A number of proprosals came up in the movement to reform the organization. But the final blow to the Helsinki system came in 1932 when UEA did not pay its contributions for the common budget, and the same was true for some of the national associations. The British, German and French associations, the largest ones, took up the initiative to found a new organization, Universala Federacio Esperantista (World Federation of Esperantists), as a federation of national associations. This new organization came hardly into existence, because in early 1933 UEA and the national organizations agreed on a complete reform of the movement. = The 'new UEA' and the schism of 1936 = In 1933, at the Cologne congress, UEA and the national organizations made UEA the common or umbrella organization of the international Esperanto movement. In 1934 the UEA members accepted new UEA statutes. The 'new UEA', as it was called, was (and still is) a federation of national associations but also of individual members directly administered by UEA. Highest organ of UEA was the Komitato. It gathered representatives from the national organizations, the numbers depended on the size of the national organization. Other representatives were elected by the delegates, depending on the number of delegates. A third group of representatives was elected by the two first groups, this opened the possibility to include 'experts' who were not linked to a national organization or popular among the delegates. Since 1947, one speaks of the komitatanoj A (from the national organizations), the komitatanoj B (from the delegates, later members) and the komitatanoj C (those by-elected). Front page of the IEL organ in 1937, announcing a house in Heronsgate becoming the IEL headquarters As the representatives of the national organizations by far outnumbered the others, it is right to call UEA in essence a federation. But all office holders of UEA had to be individual members, and the core services of the association such as the Yearbook were still reserved to the individual members. UEA since then is the legal heir of the former Helsinki organizations, such as the International Central Committee. The association since then is also organizing the annual World Congress of Esperanto. Although in 1933/1934 it first seemed that the transition could happen in harmony, at the 1934 congress in Stockholm some UEA functionaries were not re-elected. In anger, UEA president Eduard Stettler and others resigned. The new board with president Louis Bastien faced a very difficult, if not catastrophal financial situation and decided in early 1936 to leave Geneva for London. In London, the capable activist Cecil C. Goldsmith wanted to become the new director (secretary), and for certain currency reasons UEA could exist significantly more cheaply in Britain than in Switzerland. Suddenly, a campaign secretly led by Stettler made it the Bastien board impossible to legally move the headquarters away from Switzerland. After discussions taking several months and a referendum, the Bastien board members and the Komitato members left UEA and erected in September 1936 a new association, the Internacia Esperanto-Ligo (IEL). Nearly all national organizations and individual members followed. In Geneva stayed a deserted UEA, in which the old leaders took power again, the so-called Genevan UEA. = UEA after World War II = The international Esperanto movement survived World War II with its IEL headquarters in Heronsgate, a small place in the vicinity of London. Hans Jakob from the Genevan UEA tricked the IEL board into a fusion of IEL and Genevan UEA, lying that the rich Eduard Stettler had left a huge capital to UEA.Sikosek, Marcus: Die neutrale Sprache. Eine politische Geschichte des Esperanto-Weltbundes. Diss. Utrecht 2006. Skonpres, Bydgoszcz 2006, pp. 234, 325. Ivo Lapenna, a London law professor originally coming from Croatia, in the 1950s reshaped the association significantly. The office moved from Heronsgate to Rotterdam, the board since then has a general secretary, the Esperanto editor is a paid position. After 1956, the association in 1980 was again (and since then for the last time) given new statutes. The decades after the war brought with them a notable growth of the staff. After having had usually a director and one, two employees to support him, UEA at times employed ten people or more, among them e.g. a congress manager, a book seller, a librarian. Lapenna introduced a prestige policy,Forster, Peter Glover: The Esperanto Movement, Diss. Hull 1977, The Hague et al. 1982 (Hull 1977), pp. 233/234. for which he was willing to spend considerable funds. This included signature campaigns for Esperanto and efforts to make UNESCO support Esperanto in a moral way, which Lapenna accomplished in 1954 at the Unesco conference in Montevideo, Uruguay. This made him famous in the Esperanto circles as the hero of Montevideo. After having served for more than thirty years on the UEA board, Lapenna left the association in 1974 and created a rival organization (Ne≈≠trala Esperanto-Movado). During the Cold War, UEA had to deal with the difficulty of having national organizations and individual members in communist countries. Additionally, the Esperanto work in Western countries was sometimes influenced by the Cold War: in the early 50s, the American Esperanto leader George Allan Connor denounced dissenting members of his national organization as communists. His national organization and he as an individual were finally thrown out of UEA. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its allied states between 1989 and 1991 completely changed the international situation.

Of Basque descent, he served as an expeditionary leader, military officer, and politician primarily in California and New Mexico under the Spanish Empire. He is credited as one of the founding fathers of Spanish California and served as an official within New Spain as Governor of the Province of New Mexico. Early life Juan Bautista de Anza, from a portrait in oil by Fray Orsi in 1774 Juan Bautista de Anza Bezerra Nieto was born in Fronteras, New Navarre, New Spain (today Sonora, Mexico) in 1736 (near Arizpe), most probably at Cuquiarachi, Sonora, but possibly at the Presidio of Fronteras. His family was a part of the military leadership in Nueva Espa√±a, as his father and maternal grandfather, Captain Antonio Bezerra Nieto, had both served Spain, their families living on the frontier of Nueva Navarre. He was the son of Juan Bautista de Anza I. It is traditionally thought that he may have been educated at the College of San Ildefonso in Mexico City, and later at the military academy there. In 1752 he enlisted in the army at the Presidio of Fronteras. He advanced rapidly and had become a captain by 1760. He married in 1761. His wife was Ana Mar√≠a P√©rez Serrano (b. January 1744/45, d. date unknown), the daughter of Spanish mine owner Francisco P√©rez Serrano. They had no children. His military duties mainly consisted of forays against hostile Native Americans, such as the Apache, during the course of which he explored much of what is now Arizona. California expeditions Map of the route that Juan Bautista de Anza traveled in 1775‚Äì76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco The Spanish began colonizing Alta California with the Portol√° expedition of 1769‚Äì1770. The two-pronged Portol√° effort involved both a long sea voyage against prevailing winds and the California Current, and a difficult land route from Baja California. Colonies were established at San Diego and Monterey, with a presidio and Franciscan mission at each location. A more direct land route and further colonization were desired, especially at present-day San Francisco, which Portol√° saw but was not able to colonize. By the time of Juan Bautista de Anza's expedition, three more missions had been established, including Mission San Antonio de Padua in the Salinas Valley. In 1772, AnzaWeb de Anza. The Basque surname was simply Anza, without \\"de\\" proposed an expedition to Alta California to the Viceroy of New Spain. This was approved by the King of Spain and on January 8, 1774, with 3 padres, 20 soldiers, 11 servants, 35 mules, 65 cattle, and 140 horses, Anza set forth from Tubac Presidio, south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. Anza heard of a California Native American called Sebastian Tarabal who had fled from Mission San Gabriel to Sonora, and took him as guide. The expedition took a southern route along the Rio Altar (Sonora y Sinaloa, New Spain), then paralleled the modern Mexico/California border, crossing the Colorado River at its confluence with the Gila River. This was in the domain of the Yuma tribe, with which he established good relations. Anza reached Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel, near the California coast, on March 22, 1774, and Monterey, California, Alta California's capital, on April 19. He returned to Tubac by late May, 1774. This expedition was closely watched by Viceroy and King, and on October 2, 1774, Anza was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and ordered to lead a group of colonists to Alta California. The Spanish were desirous of reinforcing their presence in Alta California as a buffer against Russian colonization of the Americas advancing from the north, and possibly establish a harbor that would give shelter to Spanish ships. The expedition got under way on October 23, 1775, and arrived at Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel in January, 1776, the colonists having suffered greatly from the winter weather en route. Today this route is marked as the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. The expedition continued on to Monterey with the colonists. Having fulfilled his mission from the Viceroy, he continued on with Father Pedro Font and a party of twelve others exploring north and found an inland route to the San Francisco Bay described by Portol√†. In Anza's diary on March 25, 1776, he states that he \\"arrived at the arroyo of San Joseph Cupertino (now Stevens Creek), which is useful only for travelers. Here we halted for the night, having come eight leagues in seven and a half hours. From this place we have seen at our right the estuary which runs from the port of San Francisco.\\"de Anza, Juan Bautista (1776). Diary of Juan Bautista de Anza October 23, 1775 ‚Äì June 1, 1776. Accessed September 8, 2009 University of Oregon Web de Anza pages Pressing on, Anza located the sites for the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de Asis in present-day San Francisco, California on March 28, 1776. He did not establish the settlement; it was established later by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga. While returning to Monterey, he located the original sites for Mission Santa Clara de Asis and the town of San Jos√© de Guadalupe (modern day San Jose, California), but again did not establish either settlement. (In 1781 the Yuma revolted against the Spanish. Although there were punitive expeditions, they could not re-establish their position at the Yuma crossing and de Anza's route was blocked, preventing him from continuing his expedition further north). Governor of New Mexico Gerald Cassidy. On his return from this successful expedition in 1777 he journeyed to Mexico City with the chief of the lower Colorado River area Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe who requested the establishment of a mission. On August 24, 1777, the Viceroy of New Spain appointed Anza as the Governor of the Province of Nuevo M√©xico, the present day U.S. state of New Mexico. Governor Anza led a punitive expedition against the Comanche group of Native Americans, who had been repeatedly raiding Taos during 1779. With his Ute and Apache Native American allies, and around 800 Spanish soldiers, Anza went north through the San Luis Valley, entering the Great Plains at what is now Manitou Springs, Colorado. Circling \\"El Capitan\\" (current day Pikes Peak), he surprised a small force of the Comanche near present-day Colorado Springs. Pursuing them south down Fountain Creek, he crossed the Arkansas River near present-day Pueblo, Colorado. He found the main body of the Comanche on Greenhorn Creek, returning from a raid in Nuevo M√©xico, and won a decisive victory. Chief Cuerno Verde, for whom Greenhorn Creek is named, and many other leaders of the Comanche were killed.Thomas, Alfred Barnaby (ed.) (1932) \\"Governor Anza's Expedition against the Comanche 1779\\" Forgotten Frontiers: A Study of the Spanish Indian Policy of Don Juan Bautista de Anza, Governor of New Mexico, 1777‚Äì1787 University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, pp. 66‚Äì71 In late 1779, Anza and his party found a route from Santa Fe to Sonora, west of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. His various local military expeditions against tribes defending their homelands were often successful, but the Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe which he had established peace with earlier rebelled, and he fell out of favor with the military commander of the Northern Frontier, the frontier-general. In 1783 Anza led a campaign against the Comanche on the eastern plains and by 1784 they were suing for peace. The last of the Comanche chiefs eventually acceded and a formal treaty was concluded on 28 February 1786 at Pecos Pueblo.A full translation of the treaty is set out at Thomas, Alfred Barnaby (ed.) (1932) \\"The Spanish-Comanche Peace Treaty of 1786\\" Forgotten Frontiers: A Study of the Spanish Indian Policy of Don Juan Bautista de Anza, Governor of New Mexico, 1777‚Äì1787 University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, pp. 329‚Äì332 This paved the way for traders and the development of the Comanchero trade. Juan Bautista de Anza remained as governor of Nuevo Mexico (New Mexico) until 1787 when he returned to Sonora. He was appointed commander of the Presidio of Tucson in 1788 but died before he could depart and take office. Anza was survived by his wife. Juan Bautista de Anza died in Arizpe, in what is now the State of Sonora, Mexico, and was buried in the Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n de Arizpe. In 1963, with the participation of delegations from the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco, he was disinterred and reburied in a new marble memorial mausoleum at the same Church. Legacy Statue by Dorr Bothwell in Riverside, California. Juan Bautista de Anza's burial site in Arizpe, Sonora. The primary legacy is the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail in California and Arizona, administered by the US National Park Service, for hiking and driving the route of his expedition exploring Las CaliforniasNational Park Service: Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail In the San Fernando Valley the trail crosses the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, and in the San Gabriel Valley the trail is in the Puente Hills just north of Whittier, California.Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space: de Anza TrailPuente Hills Habitat Authority Also named for Anza is Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, located mostly in eastern San Diego County, California. The park contains a long and difficult stretch of the Anza trail, traveling west from the Imperial Valley to the coastal mountain passes north- east of San Diego. The de Anza Country Club and its 18-hole championship Golf course is located within the village of Borrego Springs, California, which is entirely surrounded by the park. A building named the Juan de Anza House in San Juan Bautista, California is a National Historic Landmark. However, it was constructed c. 1830 with its connection unclear. The \\"Juan Bautista de Anza Community Park\\" is in Calabasas, California, and \\"De Anza Park\\" is in Ontario. A statue of Anza, built in 1939, is located in Riverside, California at the corner of Magnolia Ave. and 14th Street.Patterson, Tom. Landmarks of Riverside, and the Stories Behind Them.

Another statue stands in Lake Merced park, San Francisco.Statue in Lake Merced The de Anza and De Anza spellings are also the namesake of streets, schools, and buildings in his honor including: De Anza Boulevards in San Mateo and Cupertino, De Anza Park in Sunnyvale, De Anza College in Cupertino, De Anza High School in Richmond, Juan De Anza K-5 in the Wiseburn Elementary School District of Hawthorne, De Anza Middle School in Ontario, De Anza Middle School in Ventura, De Anza Elementary School in El Centro, and the De Anza School in Baldwin Park, the landmark De Anza Hotel in San Jose, and the historic De Anza Hotel in Calexico‚Äîall in California. Using just Anza in his honor are: Anza Vista Avenue within the Anza Vista neighborhood of San Francisco, Anza Street in that city's Richmond District, and Lake Anza in Tilden Regional Park above Berkeley in the Berkeley Hills. The town of Anza, California, is a small town of 7,000 people on State Route 371 in the mountains south of Palm Springs. Also named in his honor is Juan Bautista Circle in the Parkmerced development in San Francisco. Footnotes Further reading * J. N. Bowman and R. F.

Digital media means any media that are encoded in machine-readable formats. Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified and preserved on digital electronics devices. Digital can be defined as any data represented with a series of digits, and Media refers to a method of broadcasting or communicating information together digital media refers to any information that is broadcast to us through a screen. This includes text, audio, video, and graphics that is transmitted over the internet, for viewing on the internet. Digital media  Examples of digital media include software, digital images, digital video, video games, web pages and websites, social media, digital data and databases, digital audio such as MP3, electronic documents and electronic books. Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as photographic film, audio tapes or video tapes. Digital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the Internet and personal computing, digital media has caused disruptive innovation in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to copyright and intellectual property laws, fostering an open content movement in which content creators voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the Information Age, perhaps leading to a paperless society in which all media are produced and consumed on computers. However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, censorship, the digital divide, and the spectre of a digital dark age, in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture. History Codes and information by machines were first conceptualized by Charles Babbage in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations. Between 1822 and 1823, Ada Lovelace, mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program. Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. \\"For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched [‚Ä¶] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached.\\" Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and weaving machines. Binary Code shown here which can used to represent the whole alphabet It is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1% of the world's media storage capacity was digital and in 2007 it was already 94%. especially Supporting online material The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog media (the \\"beginning of the digital age\\"). =Digital computers= binary, can be changed without reconfiguring mechanical parts Though they used machine-readable media, Babbage's engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many other early calculating machines were themselves analog computers, with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media came into existence with the rise of digital computers. Digital computers use binary code and Boolean logic to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the Manchester Mark 1 and the EDSAC, were independently invented between 1948 and 1949. Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their logical operations. They were encoded in binary, a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the \\"digits\\" of digital media. In 1959, the metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsilicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET led to the development of microprocessors, memory chips, and digital telecommunication circuits. This led to the development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, and the beginning of the microcomputer revolution and the Digital Revolution. =\\"As We May Think\\"= While digital media did not come into common use until the late 20th century, the conceptual foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer Vannevar Bush and his celebrated essay \\"As We May Think,\\" published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1945. Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, historians and others, store, analyze and communicate information. Calling this then-imaginary device a \\"memex\\", Bush wrote: > The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and > properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short > Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the > skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and > articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an > interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected.

He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus > he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to > him. Bush hoped that the creation of this memex would be the work of scientists after World War II. Though the essay predated digital computers by several years, \\"As We May Think,\\" anticipated the potential social and intellectual benefits of digital media and provided the conceptual framework for digital scholarship, the World Wide Web, wikis and even social media. It was recognized as a significant work even at the time of its publication. =Digital multimedia= Practical digital multimedia distribution and streaming was made possible by advances in data compression, due to the impractically high memory, storage and bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media. The most important compression technique is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression algorithm that was first proposed as an image compression technique by Nasir Ahmed at Kansas State University in 1972. The DCT algorithm was the basis for the first practical video coding format, H.261, in 1988. It was followed by more DCT-based video coding standards, most notably the MPEG video formats from 1991 onwards. The JPEG image format, also based on the DCT algorithm, was introduced in 1992. The development of the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) algorithm led to the MP3 audio coding format in 1994, and the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format in 1999. Impact = The digital revolution = Motorola phones in their first generation of production Since the 1960s, computing power and storage capacity have increased exponentially, largely as a result of MOSFET scaling which enables MOS transistor counts to increase at a rapid pace predicted by Moore's law. Personal computers and smartphones put the ability to access, modify, store and share digital media in the hands of billions of people. Many electronic devices, from digital cameras to drones have the ability to create, transmit and view digital media. Combined with the World Wide Web and the Internet, digital media has transformed 21st century society in a way that is frequently compared to the cultural, economic and social impact of the printing press. The change has been so rapid and so widespread that it has launched an economic transition from an industrial economy to an information- based economy, creating a new period in human history known as the Information Age or the digital revolution. The transition has created some uncertainty about definitions. Digital media, new media, multimedia, and similar terms all have a relationship to both the engineering innovations and cultural impact of digital media. The blending of digital media with other media, and with cultural and social factors, is sometimes known as new media or \\"the new media.\\" Similarly, digital media seems to demand a new set of communications skills, called transliteracy, media literacy, or digital literacy. These skills include not only the ability to read and write‚Äîtraditional literacy‚Äîbut the ability to navigate the Internet, evaluate sources, and create digital content. The idea that we are moving toward a fully digital, paperless society is accompanied by the fear that we may soon‚Äîor currently‚Äîbe facing a digital dark age, in which older media are no longer accessible on modern devices or using modern methods of scholarship. Digital media has a significant, wide- ranging and complex effect on society and culture. A senior engineer at Motorola named Martin Cooper was the first person to make a phone call on April 3, 1973. He decided the first phone call should be to a rival telecommunications company saying \\"I'm speaking via a mobile phone\\". However the first commercial mobile phone was released in 1983 by Motorola. In the early 1990s Nokia came into succession, with their Nokia 1011 being the first mass-produced mobile phone. The Nokia Communicator 9000 became the first smartphone as it was inputed with an Intel 24 MHz CPU and had 8 MB of RAM. Smartphone users have increased by a lot over the years currently the highest countries with users include China with over 850 million users, India with over 350 million users, and in third place The United States with about 260 million users as of 2019. While Android and iOS both dominate the smartphone market. A study By Gartner found that in 2016 about 88% of the worldwide smartphones were Android while iOS had a market share of about 12%. About 85% of the mobile market revenue came from the mobile games. The impact of the digital revolution can also be assessed by exploring the amount of worldwide mobile smart device users there are. This can be split into 2 categories; smart phone users and smart tablet users. Worldwide there are currently 2.32 billion smartphone users across the world. This figure is to exceed 2.87 billion by 2020. Smart tablet users reached a total of 1 billion in 2015, 15% of the world's population. The statistics evidence the impact of digital media communications today. What is also of relevance is the fact that the numbers of smart device users is rising rapidly yet the amount of functional uses increase daily. A smartphone or tablet can be used for hundreds of daily needs. There are currently over 1 million apps on the Apple App store. These are all opportunities for digital marketing efforts. A smartphone user is impacted with digital advertising every second they open their Apple or Android device. This further evidences the digital revolution and the impact of revolution. This has resulted in a total of 13 billion dollars being paid out to the various app developers over the years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications. Most of these apps are able to generate income via in app advertising. Gross revenue for 2020 is projected to be about $189 million. =Disruption in industry= Compared with print media, the mass media, and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far-reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie-making, the transition from analog film cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete. The transition has economic benefits to Hollywood, making distribution easier and making it possible to add high-quality digital effects to films. At the same time, it has affected the analog special effects, stunt, and animation industries in Hollywood. It has imposed painful costs on small movie theaters, some of which did not or will not survive the transition to digital. The effect of digital media on other media industries is similarly sweeping and complex. Between 2000‚Äì2015, the print newspaper advertising revenue has fallen from $60 billion to a nearly $20 billion. Even one of the most popular days for papers, Sunday, has seen a 9% circulation decrease the lowest since 1945. In journalism, digital media and citizen journalism have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers. But the rise of digital journalism has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations. E-books and self-publishing are changing the book industry, and digital textbooks and other media-inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education. In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, also called digital scholarship, making open access and open science possible thanks to the low cost of distribution. New fields of study have grown, such as digital humanities and digital history. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society. Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media. Often time the magazine or publisher have a Digital edition which can be referred to an electronic formatted version identical to the print version. There is a huge benefit to the publisher here and its the cost, avoiding the expense to print and deliver brings an additional benefit for the company Decline of Print ads over the years of 2008 US economic problem Since 2004, there has been a decrease in newspaper industry employment, with only about 40,000 people working in the workforce currently. Alliance of Audited Media & Publishers information during the 2008 recession, over 10% of print sales are diminished for certain magazines, with a hardship coming from only 75% of the sales advertisements as before. However, in 2018, major newspapers advertising revenue was 35% from digital ads. In contrast, mobile versions of newspapers and magazines came in second with a huge growth of 135%. The New York Times has noted a 47% year of year rise in their digital subscriptions. 43% of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49% for television. Pew Research also asked respondents if they got news from a streaming device on their TV ‚Äì 9% of U.S. adults said that they do so often. =Individual as content creator= Average camera of a YouTube blogger, a Canon EOS Digital media has also allowed individuals to be much more active in content creation. Anyone with access to computers and the Internet can participate in social media and contribute their own writing, art, videos, photography and commentary to the Internet, as well as conduct business online. The dramatic reduction in the costs required to create and share content have led to a democratization of content creation as well as the creation of new types of content, like blogs, memes and video essays. Some of these activities have also been labelled citizen journalism. This spike in user created content is due to the development of the internet as well as the way in which users interact with media today. The release of technologies such mobile devices allow for easier and quicker access to all things media. Many media creation tools that were once available to only a few are now free and easy to use. The cost of devices that can access the Internet is steadily falling, and personal ownership of multiple digital devices is now becoming the standard. These elements have significantly affected political participation. Digital media is seen by many scholars as having a role in Arab Spring, and crackdowns on the use of digital and social media by embattled governments are increasingly common. Many governments restrict access to digital media in some way, either to prevent obscenity or in a broader form of political censorship. Over the years YouTube has grown to become a website with user generated media. This content is oftentimes not mediated by any company or agency, leading to a wide array of personalities and opinions online. Over the years YouTube and other platforms have also shown their monetary gains, as the top 10 YouTube performers generating over 10 million dollars each year. Many of these YouTube profiles over the years have a multi camera set up as we would see on TV. Many of these creators also creating their own digital companies as their personalities grow. Personal devices have also seen an increase over the years. Over 1.5 billion users of tablets exist in this world right now and that is expected to slowly grow About 20% of people in the world regularly watch their content using tablets in 2018 User- generated content raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions. The spread of digital media, and the wide range of literacy and communications skills necessary to use it effectively, have deepened the digital divide between those who have access to digital media and those who don't. The rising of digital media has made the consumer's audio collection more precise and personalized. It is no longer necessary to purchase an entire album if the consumer is ultimately interested in only a few audio files. =Web-only news= See also: Web television, streaming television.

Users are spending an average of 1:55 with digital video each day, and only 1:44 on social networks. 6 out of 10 people report viewing their television shows and news via a streaming service. Platforms such as Netflix have gained attraction due to their adorability, accessibility, and for its original content. Companies such as Netflix have even bought previously cancelled shows such as Designated Survivor, Lucifer, and Arrested Development.

MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&context;=ripl pose several challenges to the current copyright and intellectual property laws. The ease of creating, modifying and sharing digital media makes copyright enforcement a challenge, and copyright laws are widely seen as outdated. For example, under current copyright law, common Internet memes are probably illegal to share in many countries. Legal rights are at least unclear for many common Internet activities, such as posting a picture that belongs to someone else to a social media account, covering a popular song on a YouTube video, or writing fanfiction. Over the last decade the concept of fair use has been applied to many online medias. Copyright challenges have gotten to all parts of digital media. Even as a personal content creator on YouTube, they must be careful and follow the guidelines set by copyright and IP laws. As YouTube creators very easily get demonetized for their content. Oftentimes we see digital creators loose monetization in their content, get their contend deleted, or get criticized for their content. Most times this has to do with accidnelty using a copyrighted audio track or background scenes that are copyright by another company. To resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt open or copyleft licenses, giving up some of their legal rights, or they can release their work to the public domain. Among the most common open licenses are Creative Commons licenses and the GNU Free Documentation License, both of which are in use on Wikipedia. Open licenses are part of a broader open content movement that pushes for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data and other digital media. To facilitate the collection and consumption of such licensing information and availability status, tools have been developed like the Creative Commons Search engine (mostly for images on the web) and Unpaywall (for scholarly communication). Additional software has been developed in order to restrict access to digital media. digital rights management (DRM) is used to lock material and allows users to use that media for specific cases. For example, DRM allows a movie producer to rent a movie at a lower price than selling the movie, restricting the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized sharing or modification of media. Digital Media is numerical, networked and interactive system of links and databases that allows us to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another. One form of digital media that is becoming a phenomenon is in the form of an online magazine or digital magazine. What exactly is a digital magazine? Due to the economic importance of digital magazines, the Audit Bureau of Circulations integrated the definition of this medium in its latest report (March 2011): a digital magazine involves the distribution of a magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica. This is an outdated definition of what a digital magazine is. A digital magazine should not be, in fact, a replica of the print magazine in PDF, as was common practice in recent years. It should, rather, be a magazine that is, in essence, interactive and created from scratch to a digital platform (Internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad or other device). The barriers for digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. At the same time digitizing platforms are broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published, such as within websites and on smartphones. With the improvements of tablets and digital magazines are becoming visually enticing and readable magazines with it graphic arts.

The name \\"New Mexico\\", the capital in Santa Fe, the government building (Palace of the Governors), militia or citizen- soldiers (vecinos), and rule of law were retained when the New Mexico Territory, later the U.S. State of New Mexico, became a part of the United States. The New Mexican citizenry, primarily consisting of Hispano, Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, and Comanche peoples, became citizens of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. ' is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico. However, it was named by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy Amerindian cultures similar to those of the Aztec Empire (centered in the Valley of Mexico), and called the land the \\"Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico\\". Geography Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east of Santa Fe: a winter sunset after a snowfall Nuevo M√©xico was centered on the upper valley of the Rio Grande (R√≠o Bravo del Norte): from the crossing point of O√±ate on the river south of Ciudad Ju√°rez, it extended north, encompassing an area that included most of the present-day U.S. state of New Mexico. It had variably defined borders, and included sections of present-day U.S. states: western Texas, southern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and the Oklahoma panhandle. Actual Spanish settlements were centered at Santa Fe, and extended north to Taos pueblo and south to Albuquerque. Except for the first decade of the province's existence, its capital was in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at the ancient city of La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As√≠s (modern day Santa Fe). = Regions and Municipalities = Many of these regions are now US counties and metropolitan areas. { valign=top * Bernalillo * Mesilla * Mora * Rio Arriba * Rio Abajo (Santa Fe) * Santa Ana * San Miguel * Socorro * Taos * Tiquex (Albuquerque) * Valencia * Ysleta (actual north of El Paso). } History =Spanish colonial province= ;16th century On July 12, 1598, Don Juan de O√±ate Salazar established the New Spain colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©jico at the new village of San Juan de los Caballeros adjacent to the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo at the confluence of the R√≠o Bravo (Rio Grande) and the R√≠o Chama. The expedition had been authorized by Philip II to survey the region. Though the Spanish believed that cities of gold such as the ones of the Aztecs, whom they had previously conquered, lay to the north in the unexplored territory, the major goal was to spread Catholicism. Other expeditions had taken place before O√±ate's 1598 expedition. He was unable to find any riches, however. As governor, he mingled with the Pueblo people and was responsible for the establishment of Spanish rule in the area. O√±ate served as the first governor of the Nuevo M√©xico Province from 1598 to 1610. He hoped to make it a separate viceroyalty from New Spain in an original agreement made in 1595, but the terms failed when the Viceroy changed hands in 1596. After a two-year delay and lengthy vetting by the new viceroy, O√±ate was finally allowed to cross the Rio Grande River into modern day Texas and New Mexico. ;17th century Most of the Spanish missions in Nuevo M√©xico were established during the early 17th century with varying degrees of success and failure, oftentimes building directly atop ancient pueblo ruins, and in the centers of pueblos. Some pueblos were friendly to the foreigners, but after cultural differences and the banishment of local religions tensions against the Spanish rose significantly. After compounding misdeeds and overbearing taxes by the Spanish invaders, the indigenous communities rebelled in what is now referred to as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This rebellion saw the Spanish expelled from Nuevo M√©xico for a period of 12 years and the pueblo people were able to regain lost lands. They returned to battle against the Spanish who sought restoration in 1692 of the conquered holdings. The reoccupation of Santa Fe was accomplished by Diego de Vargas. The province came under the jurisdiction of the Real Audiencia of Guadalajara, with oversight by the Viceroy of New Spain at Mexico City. ;18th century In 1777, with the creation of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas, the Nuevo M√©xico Province was removed from the oversight of the Viceroy and placed solely in the jurisdiction of the Commandant General of the Provincias Internas. This caused much unrest, due to the sudden lack of representation in Santa Fe for the region of Nuevo M√©xico. =Mexican territory= Map of Mexico in 1824 showing the Province of Nuevo M√©xico 1824 The province remained in Spanish control until Mexico's declaration of independence in 1821. Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, it became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico. The part of the former province east of the Rio Grande was claimed by the Republic of Texas which won its independence in 1836. This claim was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texans sent the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, ostensibly for trade but with hopes of occupying the claimed area, but the expedition was captured by New Mexican troops under New Mexico governor Manuel Armijo.Carroll, H.

Originally active from 1976 to 1986, the label was reactivated in 2007. Established at the outset of the punk rock boom, Stiff signed various punk and new wave acts such as Nick Lowe, the Damned, Lene Lovich, Wreckless Eric, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, and Devo. In the 1980s, with most of their early signings having moved on, the label found commercial success with Madness, The Pogues, Tracey Ullman, The Belle Stars, Kirsty MacColl and others. In December 2017, Universal Music Group acquired Stiff Records and ZTT Records. Razor & Tie, a division of the Concord Music Group, holds the American rights to the Stiff catalogue. Meanwhile, the British rights to the Stiff catalogue are held by BMG Rights Management under Union Square Music. History Robinson and Riviera were well-known London music business characters. Robinson had briefly worked for Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s and also managed minor pub rock band Brinsley Schwarz in the early 1970s, in which Nick Lowe was the bassist, vocalist and main songwriter; while Jakeman had been an early manager for another pub rock band, Dr. Feelgood, from Essex. The label was started with a loan of ¬£400 from Lee Brilleaux of Dr. Feelgood. Stiff found quick success. Its first release, on 14 August 1976, was a single (in the normal 7\\" vinyl 45 rpm format) by Nick Lowe, \\"So It Goes\\", B-side \\"Heart Of The City\\", with the striking catalogue number BUY 1. That record sold 10,000 copies, but Stiff's next release, \\"Between The Lines\\" by Pink Fairies, sold only around half of that.Dave Robinson International Times, Issue 4, Number 15 Robinson and Riviera used money from their Advancedale management company to finance the release of what is generally accepted as the United Kingdom's first punk single, \\"New Rose\\" by The Damned, on 22 October 1976. Early in 1977, Stiff Records picked up speed, signing Wreckless Eric, Ian Dury, and Elvis Costello, who had once been a part-time roadie for Brinsley Schwarz. Bigger sales followed, and a distribution deal with Island Records through EMI was set up. After arranging for Costello and Lowe to be signed directly to CBS Records' Columbia label, a similar deal was made with Arista who released Ian Dury's first album and the Live Stiffs Live album. The deal was short-lived and Stiff then made a deal with CBS Records for Stiff releases in the United States, at both the Columbia and Epic subsidiaries on the Stiff/Columbia and Stiff/Epic labels. Robinson and Riviera were a fiery management combination, and after a series of disagreements, Riviera left Stiff in early 1978 to form the short- lived Radar Records, taking Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and Yachts with him as a settlement package. Riviera's departure coincided with the end of the \\"5 Live Stiffs Tour\\", which showcased emerging star Ian Dury. Dury's album New Boots & Panties!! had raced up the charts and its sales kept the label in business over the following months. In 1979, Robinson signed Madness, and Madness released albums from 1979 to 1984.\\"The Madness Timeline: 1979\\". Archived from the original on 28 September 2007. Retrieved on 10 February 2020. The next few years were the halcyon period, with many Top 20 single chart placings, including the label's first No. 1 single, \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" by Ian Dury, and a number of other big-selling albums. Stiff expanded rapidly and moved its premises twice. It also continued to release dozens of obscure and uncommercial releases. For example, Stiff Records released parody album The Wit & Wisdom of Ronald Reagan. That LP was completely silent on both sides, on Magic Records, with Reagan's own slogan, \\"If it's a success it must be Magic!\\". At the end of 1983, Island Records bought 50% of Stiff, and Robinson ran both labels. Island was very short of money at the time and Robinson had to lend it ¬£1,000,000 to fund the share purchase and pay the payroll. In 1984 Island Records released hit single \\"Relax\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\\"Relax ‚Äì Frankie Goes To Hollywood\\". MusikBloggNo. Retrieved 11 February 2020. Stiff signed The Pogues, but then Madness left under a cloud. The Island deal failed and Dave Robinson regained control of the newly independent label in 1985. Hits by The Pogues and Furniture helped Stiff to survive another twenty months, but the underlying causes for the failure of the Island deal finally became too burdensome for Stiff and it was sold to ZTT in 1987. In 2007, ZTT and its parent company SPZ Group reactivated the label. Stiff quickly broke one of the UK's hottest new indie acts, The Enemy. It then released a string of well-received albums of new work from legacy Stiff artists, including as Wreckless Eric, Henry Priestman, Any Trouble, and Chris Difford. Brand new acts signed to the label included The Tranzmitors and Eskimo Disco. Swedish designer Tobbe Stuhre was appointed official Stiff Records designer. In 2008, Union Square Music released The Big Stiff Box Set. The Stiffs Tours Robinson and Riviera had arranged package tours ‚Äí such as the 1975 Naughty Rhythms tour ‚Äí for acts they managed before forming Stiff. The first tour, known as the Live Stiffs Tour or 5 Live Stiffs (3 October ‚Äì 5 November 1977), comprised five bands: Elvis Costello and The Attractions, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, Wreckless Eric and The New Rockets, Nick Lowe's Last Chicken in the Shop, and Larry Wallis's Psychedelic Rowdies. Having signed all the named artists as individuals, bands had to be formed in order to tour: these were largely based on the session musicians used for the artists' solo records. There were 18 musicians on the tour, several doubling up, e.g. Dury playing drums for Wreckless Eric while the last two \\"bands\\" had the same line up (Nick Lowe, Larry Wallis, Dave Edmunds, Terry Williams, Pete Thomas and Penny Tobin). The original idea was that the running order would rotate each night, but Dury and Costello were clearly the strongest acts. Costello played mostly new material and cover versions, rather than numbers from his recently released album My Aim is True, so the gigs usually ended with most of the artists on stage performing Dury's \\"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\\". A live album entitled Live Stiffs Live and a video of the tour were produced, but the tour only covered the UK. After the departure of Riviera, Robinson arranged a second tour, the Be Stiff or the Be Stiff Route 78 tour, from October to November 1978 (UK), again comprising five acts; Wreckless Eric, Lene Lovich, Jona Lewie, Mickey Jupp, and Rachel Sweet. The mainland section of the UK tour was undertaken by train and the Irish section by coach, and then continued on to the USA, without Jupp, who was afraid of flying. The artists contributed to an EP with cover versions of the Devo song, and early Stiff single, \\"Be Stiff\\". The final tour, the Son of Stiff Tour 1980, comprised Ten Pole Tudor, Any Trouble, Dirty Looks, Joe \\"King\\" Carrasco and the Crowns, and The Equators. Undertaken by bus, this European tour was not successful. The tour led to a 12\\" EP Son of Stiff Tour 1980 (SON 1) and a short movie directed by Jeff Baynes. The movie has not been released for sale, but was shown on BBC4 in September 2006. Marketing and design The label's marketing and advertising was often provocative and witty, billing itself as \\"The World's Most Flexible Record Label\\". Other slogans were \\"We came. We saw. We left\\", \\"If It Ain't Stiff, It Ain't Worth a Fuck\\", and \\"When You Kill Time, You Murder Success\\" (printed on promotional wall clocks). On the label of Stiff's sampler compilation Heroes & Cowards was printed: \\"In '78 everyone born in '45 will be 33-1/3\\". A very early Stiff sampler album, A Bunch of Stiff Records, introduced the slogan, \\"If they're dead, we'll sign them\\" and \\"Undertakers to the Industry\\". Stiff also produced eccentric but highly effective promotional campaigns, such as the three package tours in 1977 (Live Stiffs), 1978 (Be Stiff) and 1980 (Son Of Stiff), Elvis Costello's \\"street performance outside CBS Records. Barney Bubbles was responsible for much of the graphic art associated with the early Stiff releases.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a (personal assistant) who served under the commanders Ardabur and his son Aspar for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor Theodosius II on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations Pulcheria, Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. Flavius Zeno, a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450. Marcian reversed many of the actions of TheodosiusII in the Eastern Roman Empire's relationship with the Huns under Attila and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the Western Roman Empire, Marcian launched expeditions across the Danube into the Great Hungarian Plain, defeating the Huns in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula. After Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling Germanic tribes within Roman lands as (\\"federates\\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the Council of Chalcedon, which declared that Jesus had two \\"natures\\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, as many of them were miaphysites, rejecting the new official Christology. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million solidi coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, Anthemius, and had a military commander, Leo I, elected as emperor. Early life Marcian was born in 392, in either Thrace or Illyria. The ancient historian John Malalas describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment. Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at Philippopolis in Thrace. By the time of the Roman‚ÄìSassanian War of 421‚Äì422, Marcian had likely reached the military rank of tribune‚Äîthe historian Theophanes the Confessor mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in Lycia. There he was cared for by Tatianus, who would be made (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother Iulius. Marcian eventually rose to become the (personal assistant) of Aspar, the (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-Alanic and half-Gothic, Aspar held much influence in the empire. In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in Roman Africa, where he was captured by Vandals. Evagrius Scholasticus, Procopius and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king Gaiseric, who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, Theodosius II. Background =Reign of Theodosius II= The Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the Huns, who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled many of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and Attila, who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439. On 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of Carthage. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa; sending away so many of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the Danube could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of Margus led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of Viminacium, Singidunum, and Sirmium. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450. =Rise to the throne= After Theodosius II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first succession crisis in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor. Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election. Marcian had served Aspar and his father Ardabur loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity. There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian; it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius IIs religious policies and convoke a Church council. Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the Theodosian dynasty, had direct ties to the throne. Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of virginity she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him. Historian Doug Lee proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and Flavius Zeno, who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of patrician upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself; Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcians accession. Aspar son, Ardabur, was promoted to command the army of the Perfecture of the East as the new , soon after Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected on 25 August 450, Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further. Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation. The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. Chrysaphius, the eunuch and (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. Byzantist Constance Head considers Marcian to be an \\"an independent-minded emperor.\\" Lee states that Marcian \\"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\\", but notes that \\"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\\" Reign =Conflict with the Huns= alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 451 A.D., showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in purple, and the Hunnic Confederation by name Almost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor Valentinian III against the Visigoths. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from Pannonia in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire. Flavius Aetius, who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as , organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians, Alans, Saxons, Celtic Armoricans, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of Gepids, Alans, Scirii, Heruli, Rugians, along with some Franks, Burgundians, and Ostrogoths. Attila sacked Metz and attempted a siege of Orl√©ans, before meeting Aetius' forces at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, in northeast Gaul. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of Aquileia after a long and difficult siege, and sacked it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking Mediolanum (Milan) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack Rome itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his lines of communication and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila. Despite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. As well, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns. The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the breadbasket of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely. Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from hemorrhaging or alcoholic suffocation, after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths. This fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king Ardaric came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders Theodemir, Valamir and Videmir, decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, Ellac, at the Battle of Nedao in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in Pannonia Prima and Valeria‚Äînominally two Western Roman provinces‚Äîas . This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a rigid Danube barrier, which had previously been manned by Roman , barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the had been replaced by , although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in Lower Moesia and Scythia, Gepids in Dacia. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties. After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the Saracens in Syria and against the Blemmyes in Egypt. =Religious policy= Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon, 1876 painting by alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones. During the time period of the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ were associated, following the Arian controversy. The School of Alexandria, including theologians such as Athanasius, asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The School of Antioch, including theologians such as Theodore of Mopsuestia, determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity. Shortly before Marcian became emperor, the Second Council of Ephesus was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called ; this was rejected by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople due to disputes on the matter of Christology, as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as heretical. To repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass universally respected canons, in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of Nicaea, which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the First Council of Nicaea in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to Chalcedon. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The Council of Chalcedon met in October 451. About 500 bishops attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by Pope Leo I attended. This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature () and a human nature, united in one person (), \\"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\\" The council also agreed to condemn the Coptic Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of Ibas of Edessa and Theodoret, which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the See of Constantinople, placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I; the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople. The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous edicts confirming the outcomes of the council; showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted. One such edict ordered the repression of Eutychianists, who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the Nestorians, to be burned. The anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch; as well as sending the military to suppress monks in Palestine and placing troops in Alexandria to ensure the installation of Proterius of Alexandria, who was to replace the deposed Pope Dioscorus I. According to the Byzantist Alexander Vasiliev, even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the Arabs. Another result of the council and the subsequent edicts was that many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the Sassanian Empire. The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor Justinian I (), the Miaphysites splitting the Oriental Orthodox Churches from the main body of Christians. Marcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453. All of them focused on the construction of religious buildings, including the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae and the Hodegon Monastery. Marcian was compared to both Paul the Apostle and the Biblical king David, by the legates at the Council of Chalcedon. =Economic and legal policy= At the beginning of Marcian's reign, the Eastern Roman treasury was almost bankrupt, the result of the huge tributes paid to Attila by Theodosius. Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure. Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state. Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways. Marcian laid out legal reforms in his novels, or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full. Marcian mandated that the office of praetorship (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to senators who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that consuls should be responsible for the maintenance of Constantinople's aqueducts. He repealed the , a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum. Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the consuls and praetors, held since the time of the Roman Republic, to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. He further decreed that only a (a high-ranking man) could hold either office. He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by Constantine I, which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, freedwoman, actress, or woman of no social status (), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth. By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of of gold. In 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed pagan rites would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law. =Politics= When Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451, and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire. This influence was enhanced by the promotion of his son Ardabur to . It is unknown if Aspar and Ardabur influenced Marcians policies directly, but if so, they were extremely careful to avoid upsetting the ruling elites of Constantinople. Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti- German sentiment. Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, Euphemius the (master of offices), Palladius the praetor, and Anatolius of Constantinople. In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, Marcia Euphemia, marry Anthemius, an aristocrat and talented general. Marcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the two circus teams, the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens. =Foreign relations= The Armenian king Vardan II Mamikonian, who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother Hmayeak Mamikonian, along with Atom Gnuni, Vardan Amatuni, and Meruzhan Artsruni, to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian. Marcian was counseled by the diplomat Anatolius and Florentius not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them. King Gubazes I of Lazica‚Äîa Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty‚Äîwas attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456. Marcian's troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule. In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them. =Relationship with the Western Roman Empire= Marcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian III‚Äîa clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign. Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452, whereas historian Timothy E. Gregory states that Marcian was recognized by Valentinian on 30 March 451. Marcians appointment marked a further stage of separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. One source, John of Antioch's , even suggest that Valentinian would have attempted to depose Marcian, but for Aetius opposition. Valentinian also did not recognize the Eastern Roman consuls for 451 or 452. The Western Roman chronicler Hydatius suggests that Marcian made Eastern Roman troops available to Valentinian to repel the Huns, confusingly led by a man named Aetius, which may simply be a muddling of Aetius' campaign against Attila and Marcian's campaign against the Huns on the Danube. When Marcian granted part of Pannonia to the Ostrogoths, and Tisza to the Gepids, he was accused of encroaching upon the border of Western Roman land. Marcian avoided involving himself with the affairs of the Western Roman Empire when possible. When the Vandals sacked Rome in 455, after Petronius Maximus assassinated Valentinian III and broke an engagement treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the Dowager Empress, Licinia Eudoxia and her daughters by Valentinian III, Placidia and Eudocia. A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcian pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor. This account originates from Priscus, who served as an advisor to Marcian's confidant, Euphemius. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as Edward Arthur Thompson, have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent. Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death. The historian Frank Clover has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to Huneric, the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian Theodorus Lector speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and Evagrius Scholasticus, a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 456 or early 457. Marcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize Avitus, who succeeded Maximus. Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian Hydatius states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \\"for the sake of unanimity of power,\\" and that, \\"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\\". The exact usage of concord ( in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as Thomas Hodgkin, J. B. Bury, and William Bayless consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; Ernst Stein suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas Norman Baynes believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly. Classicist Courtenay Edward Stevens interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states. The historian Geoffrey Nathan suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the East‚ÄìWest Schism. Death Marcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of gangrene. Theodorus Lector and Theophanes the Confessor say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the Grand Palace to the Hebdomon, where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot inflammation, possibly gout. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the . He left the Eastern Empire with seven million solidi in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius. Although Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected Leo I, a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies‚Äîtwo field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the Eastern Roman Senate offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \\"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an Arian, or else to his Alanic heritage. Anthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the Western Roman emperor; Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor Libius Severus since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by Marcellinus, the of Dalmatia; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467. Legacy The Column of Marcian in 2011 Marcian was regarded favorably by Eastern Roman and Byzantine sources, often compared to Emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I. Marcian's reign was seen by many later Byzantine writers, such as Theophanes the Confessor, as a golden age: Marcian secured the Eastern Empire both politically and financially, set an orthodox religious line that future emperors would follow, and stabilized the capital city politically. Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck. Not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, but for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems. Further, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign. He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \\"Reign like Marcian!\\" at the installation of future emperors. The Prefect of Constantinople Tatianus built a column dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452. It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the Mese, though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost. Marcian also had a statue in the Forum of Arcadius, which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor Arcadius. Marcian may have been the sponsor of the Chrysotriklinos of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia states that Emperor Justin II built it, a view with which most historians agree. The Byzantine historian Joannes Zonaras states that Justin II actually rebuilt an older construction, which some historians identify as the Heptaconch Hall of Emperor Justinian.

The area is best known for the production of the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term \\"Champagne\\" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, C√¥te des Blancs, C√¥te de S√©zanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vall√©e de la Marne. The towns of Reims and √âpernay are the commercial centers of the area. Reims is famous for its cathedral, the venue of the coronation of the French Kings and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located at the northern edges of France, the history of the Champagne wine region has had a significant role in the development of this unique terroir. The area's proximity to Paris promoted the region's economic success in its wine trade but also put the villages and vineyards in the path of marching armies on their way to the French capital. Despite the frequency of these military conflicts, the region developed a reputation for quality wine production in the early Middle Ages and was able to continue that reputation as the region's producers began making sparkling wine with the advent of the great Champagne houses in the 17th and 18th centuries. The principal grapes grown in the region include Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier. Pinot noir is the most widely planted grape in the Aube region and grows very well in Montagne de Reims. Pinot Meunier is the dominant grape in the Vall√©e de la Marne region. The C√¥te des Blancs is dedicated almost exclusively to Chardonnay.K. Gargett, P. Forrestal, & C. Fallis (2004). The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine. Global Book Publishing. p. 164. .  Geography and climate  The Champagne province is located near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high latitude and mean annual temperature of 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully ripen. Ripening is aided by the presence of forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.K. Gargett, P. Forrestal, & C. Fallis The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 163 Global Book Publishing 2004 During the growing season, the mean July temperature is 18 ¬∞C (66 ¬∞F). The average annual rainfall is 630 mm (25 inches), with 45 mm (1.8 inches) falling during the harvest month of September. Throughout the year, growers must be mindful of the hazards of fungal disease and early spring frost.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 79 Octopus Publishing Group 2005 Ancient oceans left behind chalk subsoil deposits when they receded 70 million years ago. Earthquakes that rocked the region over 10 million years ago pushed the marine sediments of belemnite fossils up to the surface to create the belemnite chalk terrain. The belemnite in the soil allows it to absorb heat from the sun and gradually release it during the night as well as providing good drainage. This soil contributes to the lightness and finesse that is characteristic of Champagne wine. The Aube area is an exception with predominately clay based soil. The chalk is also used in the construction of underground cellars that can keep the wines cool through the bottle maturation process. History Statue of Pope Urban II in Champagne The Carolingian reign saw periods of prosperity for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement for the area to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to the reputation of the wines that came from this area.R. Phillips A Short History of Wine pg 75 Harper Collins 2000 The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories. = Military conflicts = The location of Champagne played a large role in its historical prominence as it served as a \\"crossroads\\" for both military and trade routes. This also made the area open to devastation and destruction during military conflicts that were frequently waged in the area. In 451 A.D. near Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne Attila and the Huns were defeated by an alliance of Roman legions, Franks and Visigoths. This defeat was a turning point in the Huns' invasion of Europe.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 96‚Äì97 Simon & Schuster 1989 During the Hundred Years' War, the land was repeatedly ravaged and devastated by battles. The Abbey of Hautvillers, including its vineyards, was destroyed in 1560 during the War of Religion between the Huguenots and Catholics. This was followed by conflicts during the Thirty Year War and the Fronde Civil War where soldiers and mercenaries held the area in occupation. It was not until the 1660s, during the reign of Louis XIV, that the region saw enough peace to allow advances in sparkling wine production to take place.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 210‚Äì211 Simon & Schuster 1989 = History of wine production = Champagne wine The region's reputation for wine production dates back to the Middle Ages when Pope Urban II ( ruled 1088-1099 AD/CE ), a native Champenois, declared that the wine of A√ø in the Marne d√©partement was the best wine produced in the world. For a time A√ø was used as a shorthand designation for wines from the entire Champagne region, similar to the use of Beaune for the wines of Burgundy.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 211 Simon & Schuster 1989 The poet Henry d'Andeli's work La Bataille des Vins rated wines from the towns of √âpernay, Hautvillers and Reims as some of the best in Europe. As the region's reputation grew, popes and royalty sought to own pieces of the land with Pope Leo X, Francis I of France, Charles V of Spain, and Henry VIII of England all owning vineyard land in the region. A batch of wine from A√ø received in 1518 by Henry VIII's chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, is the first recorded export of wine from the Champagne region to England.K. Gargett, P. Forrestal, & C. Fallis The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 162 Global Book Publishing 2004 The still wines of the area were highly prized in Paris under the designation of vins de la rivi√®re and vins de la montagne- wines of the river and wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 80 Octopus Publishing Group 2005 The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 212 Simon & Schuster 1989 The Champagne house of Gosset was founded as a still wine producer in 1584 and is the oldest Champagne house still in operation today. Ruinart was founded in 1729 and was soon followed by Chanoine Fr√®res (1730), Taittinger (1734), Mo√´t et Chandon (1743) and Veuve Clicquot (1772). The nineteenth century saw an explosive growth in Champagne production going from a regional production of 300,000 bottles a year in 1800 to 20 million bottles in 1850.R. Phillips A Short History of Wine pg 241 Harper Collins 2000 Rivalry with Burgundy A strong influence on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between the region and Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine with the support of his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy- Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pg 32 Harper Collins Publisher This development had a ripple effect throughout both regions and in the Paris markets. Both Champagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the \\"healthiness\\" reputation of their wines, even to the extent of paying medical students to write theses touting the health benefit of their wines. These theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers. The Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon's claim that Burgundy wine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-Baptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, to speak to a packed auditorium at the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine's deep color and robust nature and compared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the \\"instability\\" of the wine to travel long distances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text of his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging effect on Champagne sales.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pg 33‚Äì34 Harper Collins Publisher The war of words would continue for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were on the brink of civil war.D. & P. Kladstrup Champagne pg 36 Harper Collins Publisher A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned. Classifications and vineyard regulations Grand Cru Champagne from the village of Ambonnay Vineyard in Champagne In 1927, viticultural boundaries of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts: The Aube, C√¥te des Blancs, C√¥te de S√©zanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vall√©e de la Marne. This area covered in 2008 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that were home to 5,000 growers who made their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sold grapes. The different districts produce grapes of varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses to create their distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes are known for their high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vall√©e de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The C√¥te des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby C√¥te de S√©zanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits. In 1941, the Comit√© Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) was formed with the purpose of protecting Champagne's reputation and marketing forces as well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and vinification methods. Champagne is the only region that is permitted to exclude AOC or Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e from their labels. For each vintage, the CIVC rated the villages of the area based on the quality of their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to determine the price and the percentage of the price that growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90‚Äì99% ratings while Deuxi√®me Crus received 80‚Äì89% ratings. Under appellation rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) of grapes can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuv√©e and the next 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine is a blend of vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expensive to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped. =Revision of the Champagne region= Grand Cru Champagne from the village of Bouzy The worldwide demand for Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles was set in 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500 kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) and the possibility of revising the production region was investigated. After an extensive review of vineyard conditions in and around the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005.Wine- pages.com: Champagne's ‚Ç¨6 billion expansion , by Tom Stevenson; written November 2007 and accessed on March 17, 2008 The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne d√©partment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye. The proposed 40 new Champagne villages are located in four d√©partments: * 22 in Marne: Baslieux-les-Fismes, Blacy, Boissy-le-Repos, Bouvancourt, Breuil-sur-Vesle, Bussy-le-Repos, Champfleury, Courlandon, Courcy, Courdemanges, Fismes, Huiron, La Ville-sous- Orbais, Le Thoult-Trosnay, Loivre, Montmirail, Mont-sur-Courville, Peas, Romain, Saint-Loup, Soulanges, and Ventelay. * 15 in Aube: Arrelles, Balnot- la-Grange, Bossancourt, Bouilly, √âtourvy, Fontvannes, Javernant, Laines-aux- Bois, Macey, Messon, Prugny, Saint-Germain-l'√âpine, Souligny, Torvilliers and Villery. * Two in Haute-Marne: Champcourt and Harricourt. * One, Marchais-en- Brie, in Aisne. The INAO proposal was to be subject to review before being made into law and was immediately questioned in numerous public comments. The mayor of one the villages to be delisted, Germaine, immediately appealed against INAO's proposal, with the possibility of additional appeals by vineyard owners. The initial review process is expected to be finished by early 2009. This will be followed by another review of the specific parcels that will be added or deleted from the appellation. The earliest vineyard plantings are expected around 2015, with their product being marketed from around 2021. However, the price of land that are allowed to be used for Champagne production is expected to immediately rise from 5,000 to one million euro per hectare. While some critics have feared the revision of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson has pointed out that the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion. The villages under discussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions rather than outside it.  Production other than sparkling wine  While totally dominating the region's production, sparkling Champagne is not the only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a ros√© appellation in the region, Ros√© des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small. The pomace from the grape pressing is used to make Marc de Champagne, and in this case the production does not compete with that of Champagne, since the pomace is a by-product of wine production.  Traditions  The end of harvest in Champagne is marked by a celebration known as la F√™te du Cochelet.

His many roles included Squadron Leader Peter Carter in A Matter of Life and Death, Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days, and Sir Charles Lytton (\\"the Phantom\\") in The Pink Panther. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Separate Tables (1958). He also played James Bond in Casino Royale (1967). Born in London, Niven attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe School before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Having developed an interest in acting, he left the army, travelled to Hollywood and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film There Goes the Bride (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non- speaking role in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Mutiny on the Bounty. This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant. In 1942 he co- starred in the morale-building film about the development of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter, The First of the Few (American title Spitfire), which was enthusiastically endorsed by Winston Churchill. Niven resumed his acting career after his demobilisation, and was voted the second-most popular British actor in the 1945 Popularity Poll of British film stars. He appeared in A Matter of Life and Death (1946), The Bishop's Wife (1947) with Cary Grant, and Enchantment (1948), all of which received critical acclaim. Niven later appeared in The Elusive Pimpernel (1950), The Toast of New Orleans (1950), Happy Go Lovely (1951), Happy Ever After (1954) and Carrington V.C. (1955) before scoring a big success as Phileas Fogg in Michael Todd's production of Around the World in 80 Days (1956). Niven appeared in nearly a hundred films, and many shows for television. He also began writing books, with considerable commercial success. In 1982 he appeared in Blake Edwards' final \\"Pink Panther\\" films Trail of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther, reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton. Early life James David Graham Niven was born on 1 March 1910 at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, London, to William Edward Graham Niven (1878‚Äì1915) and his wife, Henrietta Julia (n√©e Degacher) Niven. He was named David after his birth on St David's Day. Niven later claimed he was born in Kirriemuir, in the Scottish county of Angus in 1909, but his birth certificate disproves this. He had two older sisters and a brother: Margaret Joyce Niven (1900 - 1981), Henry Degacher Niven (1902 - 1953), and the sculptor Grizel Rosemary Graham (1906 ‚Äì 2007), who created the bronze sculpture Bessie that is presented to the annual winners of the Women's Prize for Fiction. David Niven's father, William Niven, was of Scottish descent; his paternal grandfather, David Graham Niven, (1811‚Äì1884) was from St Martin's, a village in Perthshire. He was killed in the First World War serving with the Berkshire Yeomanry during the Gallipoli campaign on 21 August 1915. He was buried in Green Hill Cemetery, Turkey, in the Special Memorial Section in Plot F. 10. Niven's mother, Henrietta, who was born in Wales, was of French and Welsh ancestry. Her father was Captain (and acting-major) William Degacher (1841‚Äì1879) of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot was married to Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of Lieutenant General James Webber Smith. He was killed at the Battle of Isandlwana (1879) during the Anglo-Zulu War.The Times, \\"Marriages\\", 26 October 1888 Although born William Hitchcock, both he and his brother Lieutenant Colonel Henry Degacher, had followed their father, Walter Henry Hitchcock, in taking their mother's maiden name of Degacher in 1874.The Times, 18 February 1874, p. 1 Following the death of her husband, Henrietta Niven remarried Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt in London in 1917. Graham Lord, author and biographer, suggested in Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven, that Comyn-Platt and Mrs Niven had been having an affair for some time before her husband's death. Furthermore, some believe that Sir Thomas may well have been David Niven's biological father. This supposition has some support among Henrietta's children. Hugh Massingberd, reviewing Lord's book in The Spectator, stated that its photographic evidence showing a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt \\"would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading.\\"Massingberd, Hugh. It's being so cheerful that keeps me going. 15 November 2003. Spectator Book Club. Accessed 25 May 2009 Stowe School When Niven began attending school - as was customary for the time - he received many instances of corporal punishment owing to his inclination for pranks, which finally led to his expulsion from Heatherdown Preparatory School at the age of 10¬Ω. This ended his chances for Eton College, a significant blow to his family. After failing to pass the naval entrance exam because of his difficulty with maths, Niven attended Stowe School, a newly created public school led by headmaster J. F. Roxburgh, who was unlike any of Niven's previous headmasters. Thoughtful and kind, he addressed the boys by their first names, allowed them bicycles, and encouraged and nurtured their personal interests. Niven later wrote, \\"How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he said and what he did were of real importance to the headmaster.\\" Military service In 1928 Niven attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He graduated in 1930 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the British Army. He did well at Sandhurst, which gave him the \\"officer and gentleman\\" bearing that was his trademark. He requested assignment to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders or the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), then jokingly wrote on the form, as his third choice, \\"anything but the Highland Light Infantry\\" (because that regiment wore tartan trews rather than the kilt). He was assigned to the HLI, with whom he served for two years in Malta and then for a few months in Dover. In Malta, he became friends with Roy Urquhart, future commander of the British 1st Airborne Division. Niven grew tired of the peacetime army. Though promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1933, he saw no opportunity for further advancement. His ultimate decision to resign came after a lengthy lecture on machine guns, which was interfering with his plans for dinner with a particularly attractive young lady. At the end of the lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions. Showing the typical rebelliousness of his early years, Niven asked, \\"Could you tell me the time, sir? I have to catch a train.\\" After being placed under close-arrest for this act of insubordination, Niven finished a bottle of whisky with the officer who was guarding him: Rhoddy Rose (later Colonel R. L. C. Rose, DSO, MC). With Rose's assistance, Niven was allowed to escape from a first-floor window. He then headed for America. While crossing the Atlantic, Niven resigned his commission by telegram on 6 September 1933. Niven then moved to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful career in whisky sales, after which he had a stint in horse rodeo promotion in Atlantic City. After detours to Bermuda and Cuba, he arrived in Hollywood in 1934. Early film career =As an extra= When Niven presented himself at Central Casting, he learned that he needed a work permit to reside and work in the United States. This meant that Niven had to leave the US, so he went to Mexico, where he worked as a \\"gun-man\\", cleaning and polishing the rifles of visiting American hunters. He received his resident alien visa from the American consulate when his birth certificate arrived from Britain. He returned to the US and was accepted by Central Casting as \\"Anglo-Saxon Type No. 2,008.\\" Among the films in which he can be glimpsed are Barbary Coast (1935) and Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). He had a small role in A Feather in Her Hat (1935) at Columbia and back to Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer for a bit role, billed as David Nivens in Rose Marie (1936). =Sam Goldwyn= Niven's role in Mutiny on the Bounty brought him to the attention of independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn, who signed him to a contract and established his career. For Goldwyn, Niven had a small role in Splendor (1935). He was lent to MGM for a small part in Rose Marie (1936) then had a larger one in Palm Springs (1936) at Paramount. His first sizeable part for Goldwyn came in Dodsworth (1936), playing a man who flirts with Ruth Chatterton. He was loaned to 20th Century Fox to play Bertie Wooster in Thank You, Jeeves! (1936), then had a good part as a soldier in The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) at Warners, an Imperial adventure film starring his one- time housemate Errol Flynn. Niven was fourth billed in Beloved Enemy (1936) for Goldwyn, supporting Merle Oberon with whom he became romantically involved. Universal used him in We Have Our Moments (1937) then he had another good support part in David O. Selznick's The Prisoner of Zenda (1937). Fox gave him the lead in a B picture, Dinner at the Ritz (1938) and he had a support part in Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) directed by Ernst Lubitsch at Paramount. Niven was one of the four heroes in John Ford's Four Men and a Prayer (1938) at Fox. He remained at that studio to play a fake love interest in Three Blind Mice (1938). Niven joined what became known as the Hollywood Raj, a group of British actors in Hollywood which included Rex Harrison, Boris Karloff, Stan Laurel, Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, Leslie Howard,Eforgan, E. (2010) Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor. London: Vallentine Mitchell; p. 94 and C. Aubrey Smith. According to his autobiography, Errol Flynn and he were firm friends and rented Rosalind Russell's house at 601 North Linden Drive as a bachelor pad. =Leading man= Niven graduated to star parts in \\"A\\" films with The Dawn Patrol (1938) remake at Warners; he was billed after Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone but it was a leading role and the film did excellent business. Niven was reluctant to take a support part in Wuthering Heights (1939) for Goldwyn, but eventually relented and the film was a big success. RKO borrowed him to play Ginger Rogers' leading man in the romantic comedy, Bachelor Mother (1939), which was a big hit. Goldwyn used him to support Gary Cooper in an adventure tale The Real Glory (1939), and Walter Wanger cast him opposite Loretta Young in Eternally Yours (1939). Goldwyn finally gave Niven a lead part, the title role as the eponymous gentleman safe-cracker in Raffles (1939). Second World War The day after Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Niven returned home and rejoined the British Army. He was alone among British stars in Hollywood in doing so; the British Embassy advised most actors to stay. Niven was recommissioned as a lieutenant into the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) on 25 February 1940, and was assigned to a motor training battalion. He wanted something more exciting, however, and transferred to the Commandos. He was assigned to a training base at Inverailort House in the Western Highlands. Niven later claimed credit for bringing future Major General Sir Robert E. Laycock to the Commandos. Niven commanded \\"A\\" Squadron GHQ Liaison Regiment, better known as \\"Phantom\\". =Film work= Niven also worked with the Army Film and Photographic Unit. His work included a small part in the deception operation that used minor actor M. E. Clifton James to impersonate General Sir Bernard Montgomery. During his work with the AFPU, Peter Ustinov, one of the script-writers, had to pose as Niven's batman. Niven explained in his autobiography that there was no military way that he, a lieutenant-colonel, and Ustinov, who was only a private, could associate, other than as an officer and his subordinate, hence their strange \\"act\\". Ustinov later appeared with Niven in Death on the Nile (1978). He acted in two wartime films not formally associated with the AFPU, but both made with a firm view to winning support for the British war effort, especially in the United States. These were The First of the Few (1942), directed by Leslie Howard, and The Way Ahead (1944), directed by Carol Reed. Peter Ustinov also played a large supporting role as a Frenchman in The Way Ahead. =Europe= Niven took part in the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, although he was sent to France several days after D-Day. He served in \\"Phantom,\\" a secret reconnaissance and signals unit which located and reported enemy positions, and kept rear commanders informed on changing battle lines. Niven was posted at one time to Chilham in Kent. He remained close-mouthed about the war, despite public interest in celebrities in combat and a reputation for storytelling. He once said: > I will, however, tell you just one thing about the war, my first story and > my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of > their son near Bastogne. > I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and > I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your > mouth shut after the war. Niven had particular scorn for those newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, \\"Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one‚Äîthey go crack!\\" He gave a few details of his war experience in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon: his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, and what it was like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, \\"Young man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so ‚àí it would have been despicable.\\" A few stories have surfaced. About to lead his men into action, Niven eased their nervousness by telling them, \\"Look, you chaps only have to do this once. But I'll have to do it all over again in Hollywood with Errol Flynn!\\" Asked by suspicious American sentries during the Battle of the Bulge who had won the World Series in 1943, he answered, \\"Haven't the foggiest idea, but I did co-star with Ginger Rogers in Bachelor Mother!\\" Niven ended the war as a lieutenant-colonel. On his return to Hollywood after the war, he received the Legion of Merit, an American military decoration. It honoured Niven's work in setting up the BBC Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme, a radio news and entertainment station for the Allied forces. Postwar career Niven in the 1948 film Enchantment Niven resumed his career while still in England, playing the lead in A Matter of Life and Death (1946), from the team of Powell and Pressburger. The movie was critically acclaimed, popular in England and was selected as the first Royal Film Performance. =Return to Hollywood= Niven returned to Hollywood, and encountered tragedy when his first wife died after falling down a flight of stairs at a party. Goldwyn loaned him to play Aaron Burr in Magnificent Doll (1946) opposite Ginger Rogers, then to Paramount for The Perfect Marriage (1947) with Loretta Young and Enterprise Productions for The Other Love (1947). For Goldwyn he supported Cary Grant and Young in The Bishop's Wife (1947). He returned to England when Goldwyn loaned him to Alexander Korda to play the title role in Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948), a notorious box office flop. Back in Hollywood, Niven was in Goldwyn's Enchantment (1948). At Warner Bros he was in a comedy A Kiss in the Dark (1948) then he appeared opposite Shirley Temple in the comedy A Kiss for Corliss (1949). None of these films were successful at the box office and Niven's career was struggling. He returned to Britain to play the title role in The Elusive Pimpernel (1950) from Powell and Pressberger, which was to have been financed by Korda and Goldwyn. Goldwyn pulled out, and the film did not appear in the US for three years. Niven had a long, complex relationship with Goldwyn, who gave him his first start, but the dispute over The Elusive Pimpernel and Niven's demands for more money led to a long estrangement between the two in the 1950s. =Career decline= From the trailer for The Toast of New Orleans (1950) Niven struggled for a while to recapture his former position. He supported Mario Lanza in a musical at MGM, The Toast of New Orleans (1950). He then went to England and appeared in a musical with Vera-Ellen, Happy Go Lovely (1951); it was little seen in the US but was a big hit in Britain. He had a support role in MGM's Soldiers Three (1951) similar to those early in his career. Niven had a far better part in the British war film, Appointment with Venus (1952) which was popular in England. The Lady Says No (1952) was a poorly received American comedy. =Comeback= Niven decided to try Broadway, appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in Nina (1951‚Äì52). The play only ran for 45 performances but it was seen by Otto Preminger who decided to cast Niven in the film version of the play The Moon Is Blue (1953). As preparation, Preminger, who had directed the play in New York, insisted that Niven appear on stage in the West Coast run. The Moon Is Blue, a sex comedy, became notorious when it was released without a Production Code Seal of Approval; it was a big hit and Niven won a Golden Globe Award for his role. Niven also became heavily involved in American TV as a partner in Four Star Television, a company he established with Dick Powell and Charles Boyer. It ended up producing a considerable number of shows, in several of which Niven appeared. Niven's next few films were made in England: The Love Lottery (1954), a comedy; Carrington V.C. (1954), a drama which earned Niven a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor; Happy Ever After (1954), a comedy with Yvonne de Carlo which was hugely popular in Britain. In Hollywood he had a thankless role as the villain in an MGM swashbuckler The King's Thief (1955). He had a better part in The Birds and the Bees (1956), playing a conman, and in the British The Silken Affair (1956). =Around the World in 80 Days= Niven's professional fortunes were completely restored when cast as Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days (1956), a huge hit at the box office. He followed it with Oh, Men! Oh, Women! (1957); The Little Hut (1957), from the writer of The Moon is Blue and a success at the box office; My Man Godfrey (1957), a screwball comedy; and Bonjour Tristesse (1958), for Preminger. Niven worked in television. He appeared several times on various short-drama shows, and was one of the \\"four stars\\" of the dramatic anthology series Four Star Playhouse, appearing in 33 episodes. The show was produced by Four Star Television, which was co-owned and founded by Niven, Ida Lupino, Dick Powell and Charles Boyer. The show ended in 1955, but Four Star TV became a highly successful TV production company. =Separate Tables= Drawing of Niven commemorating his 1958 Oscar win for Separate Tables. Niven is the only person to win an Academy Award at the ceremony he was hosting. He won the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Major Pollock in Separate Tables, his only nomination for an Oscar. Appearing on-screen for only 23 minutes in the film, this was the briefest performance ever to win a Best Actor Oscar, until Anthony Hopkins' award for his appearance in the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which is a little over 16 minutes. He was also a co-host of the 30th, 31st, and 46th Academy Awards ceremonies. After Niven had won the Academy Award, Goldwyn called with an invitation to his home. In Goldwyn's drawing room, Niven noticed a picture of himself in uniform which he had sent to Goldwyn from Britain during the Second World War. In happier times with Goldwyn, he had observed this same picture sitting on Goldwyn's piano. Now years later, the picture was still in exactly the same spot. As he was looking at the picture, Goldwyn's wife Frances said, \\"Sam never took it down.\\" With an Academy Award to his credit, Niven's career continued to thrive. In 1959, he became the host of his own TV drama series, The David Niven Show, which ran for 13 episodes that summer. He played the lead in some comedies: Ask Any Girl (1959), with Shirley MacLaine; Happy Anniversary (1959) with Mitzi Gaynor; and Please Don't Eat the Daisies (1960) with Doris Day, a big hit. =International star= Even more popular was the action film The Guns of Navarone (1961). This seemed to lead to him being cast in war and/or action movies: The Captive City (1962); The Best of Enemies (1962); Guns of Darkness (1962); 55 Days at Peking (1963) with Charlton Heston. Niven returned to comedy with The Pink Panther (1963), another huge success at the box office. Less so was the comedy Bedtime Story (1964) with Marlon Brando. In 1964, Boyer and he appeared in the Four Star series The Rogues. Niven played Alexander 'Alec' Fleming, one of a family of retired con-artists who now fleece villains in the interests of justice. This was his only recurring role on television. The Rogues ran for only one season, but won a Golden Globe award. In 1965, he made two films for MGM: Lady L, supporting Paul Newman and Sophia Loren, and Where the Spies Are, as a doctor-turned-secret agent - MGM hoped it would lead to a series, but this did not happen. After a horror film Eye of the Devil (1966), Niven appeared as James Bond 007 in Casino Royale (1967). Niven had been Bond creator Ian Fleming's first choice to play Bond in Dr. No. Casino Royale co-producer Charles K. Feldman said later that Fleming had written the book with Niven in mind, and therefore had sent a copy to Niven. Niven was the only James Bond actor mentioned by name in the text of a Fleming novel. In chapter 14 of You Only Live Twice, the pearl diver Kissy Suzuki refers to Niven as \\"the only man she liked in Hollywood\\", and the only person who \\"treated her honourably\\" there. Niven made some popular comedies, Prudence and the Pill (1968) and The Impossible Years (1968). Less widely seen was The Extraordinary Seaman (1969). The Brain (1969), a French comedy with Bourvil and Jean-Paul Belmondo, was the most popular film at the French box office in 1969 but was not widely seen in English-speaking countries. He did a war drama Before Winter Comes (1969) then returned to comedy in The Statue (1971). =Later career= Niven was in demand throughout the last decade of his life: King, Queen, Knave (1972); Vampira (1974); Paper Tiger (1975); No Deposit, No Return (1976), a Disney comedy; Murder by Death (1976), one of several stars in a popular comedy; Candleshoe (1977), again for Disney; Death on the Nile (1978), one of many stars and another hit; A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (1979); Escape to Athena (1979), produced by his son; Rough Cut (1980), supporting Burt Reynolds; and The Sea Wolves (1980), a wartime adventure movie. In 1974, while Niven was co-hosting the 46th Annual Oscars ceremony, a naked man (Robert Opel) appeared behind him, \\"streaking\\" across the stage. Niven responded \\"Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?\\" That same year, he hosted David Niven's World for London Weekend Television, which profiled contemporary adventurers such as hang gliders, motorcyclists, and mountain climbers: it ran for 21 episodes. In 1975, he narrated The Remarkable Rocket, a short animation based on a story by Oscar Wilde. =Last films= Niven's last sizeable film part was in Better Late Than Never (1983). In July 1982, Blake Edwards brought Niven back for cameo appearances in two final \\"Pink Panther\\" films (Trail of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther), reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton. By this time, Niven was having serious health problems. When the raw footage was reviewed, his voice was inaudible, and his lines had to be dubbed by Rich Little. Niven only learned of it from a newspaper report. This was his last film appearance. =Writing= Niven wrote four books. The first, Round the Rugged Rocks (published simultaneously in the US under the title Once Over Lightly), was a novel that appeared in 1951 and was forgotten almost at once. The plot was plainly autobiographical (although not recognised as such at the time of publication), involving a young soldier, John Hamilton, who leaves the British army, becomes a liquor salesman in New York, is involved in indoor horse racing, goes to Hollywood, becomes a deckhand on a fishing boat, and finally ends up as a highly successful film star. In 1971, he published his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon, which was well received, selling over five million copies. He followed this with Bring On the Empty Horses in 1975, a collection of entertaining reminiscences from Hollywood's \\"Golden Age\\" in the 1930s and 1940s. It now appears that Niven recounted many incidents from a first-person perspective that actually happened to other people, especially Cary Grant, which he borrowed and embroidered. Niven's penchant for exaggeration and embroidery is particularly clearly demonstrated when comparing his written descriptions of his early film appearances (especially Barbary Coast and A Feather in her Hat), and his Oscar acceptance speech, with the actual filmed evidence. In all three examples, the reality is significantly different to Niven's heavily fictionalised accounts as presented in The Moon's a Balloon and related in various chat show appearances. In 1981 Niven published a second and much more successful novel, Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly, which was set during and after the Second World War, and which drew on his experiences during the war and in Hollywood. He was working on a third novel at the time of his death. Personal life Niven with his family at Copenhagen Airport (5 August 1958) Niven with his wife Hj√∂rdis Genberg (Hj√∂rdis Tersmeden), 1960 While on leave in 1940, Niven met Primula \\"Primmie\\" Susan Rollo (18 February 1918, London ‚Äì 21 May 1946), the daughter of London lawyer William H.C. Rollo. After a whirlwind romance, they married on 16 September, 1940. A son, David, Jr., was born in December 1942 and a second son, James Graham Niven, on 6 November 1945. Primmie died at the age of 28, only six weeks after the family moved to the US. She fractured her skull in an accidental fall in the Beverly Hills, California home of Tyrone Power, while playing a game of hide-and-seek. She had walked through a door believing it to be a closet, but instead it led to a stone staircase to the basement.Karin J. Fowler (1995) David Niven: a Bio-Biography, Greenwood Press. Sunday Times (Perth, WA: 1902‚Äì1954) \\"David Niven's wife in death crash\\" 26 May 1946, P.3 Retrieved 12 January 2016 In 1948, Niven met Hj√∂rdis Paulina Tersmeden (n√©e Genberg, 1919‚Äì1997), a divorced Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting: > I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life‚Äîtall, slim, auburn hair, > up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had ever > seen. It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady > novelists ... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my > knees. In New York, Niven and Hj√∂rdis were next-door neighbours with Audrey Hepburn, who made her debut on Broadway that season. In 1960, while filming Please Don't Eat the Daisies with Doris Day, Niven and Hj√∂rdis separated for a few weeks, but later reconciled, although their alcoholism, his frequent adultery and her violent temper made the marriage rather miserable. In 1960, Niven moved to Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx near Gstaad in Switzerland for financial reasons, living near close friends in that country including Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov, and No√´l Coward. Niven's status as a tax exile in Switzerland is believed to have been one of the reasons why he never received a British honour. He divided his time in the 1960s and 1970s between Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx and Cap Ferrat on the C√¥te d'Azur in the south of France. A 2009 biography of Niven contained assertions, based on information from his widow and a good friend of Niven, that he had an affair with Princess Margaret, who was 20 years his junior.Munn, Michael (24 May 2009).\\"Oh God, I wanted her to die\\", The Sunday Times, Retrieved 29 May 2009. Illness and death In 1980, Niven began experiencing fatigue, muscle weakness, and a warble in his voice. His 1981 interviews on the talk shows of Michael Parkinson and Merv Griffin alarmed family and friends; viewers wondered if Niven had either been drinking or suffered a stroke. He blamed his slightly slurred voice on the shooting schedule on the film he had been making, Better Late Than Never. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") later that year. His final appearance in Hollywood was hosting the 1981 American Film Institute tribute to Fred Astaire. In February 1983, using a false name to avoid publicity, Niven was hospitalised for 10 days, ostensibly for a digestive problem; afterwards he returned to his chalet at Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx. His condition continued to worsen, but he refused to return to the hospital, and his family supported his decision. He died at his chalet from ALS on 29 July 1983, aged 73. Niven's body was buried in Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx cemetery, Switzerland. Legacy A Thanksgiving service for Niven was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 27 October 1983. The congregation of 1,200 included Prince Michael of Kent, Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, Sir John Mills, Sir Richard Attenborough, Trevor Howard, David Frost, Joanna Lumley, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Lord Olivier.Niv by Graham Lord, Orion, 2004, p. 420 Biographer Graham Lord wrote, \\"the biggest wreath, worthy of a Mafia Godfather's funeral, was delivered from the porters at London's Heathrow Airport, along with a card that read: 'To the finest gentleman who ever walked through these halls. He made a porter feel like a king.'\\" In 1985, Niven was included in a series of British postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir Charles Chaplin, Peter Sellers and Vivien Leigh, to commemorate \\"British Film Year\\".Walker, Alexander. Vivien: The Life of Vivien Leigh, pp. 303, 304. Grove Press, 1987. Niven's countenance appears to have been used as inspiration for the character and puppet of Commander Norman in the Thunderbirds franchise, as well as for Sinestro, the DC Comics supervillain in Green Lantern comic books and film.

An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana. The Senufo languages constitute their own branch of the Atlantic‚ÄìCongo sub-family of the Niger‚ÄìCongo languages. Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million. The Senufo languages are bounded to the west by Mande languages, to the south by Kwa languages, and to the north and east by Central Gur languages. The Senufo languages are like the Gur languages in that they have a suffixal noun class system and that verbs are marked for aspect. Most Gur languages to the north of Senufo have a two tone downstep system, but the tonal system of the Senufo languages is mostly analysed as a three level tone system (High, Mid, Low). The Senufo languages have been influenced by the neighbouring Mande languages in numerous ways. Many words have been borrowed from the Mande languages Bambara and Jula. Carlson (1994:2) notes that ‚Äòit is probable that several grammatical constructions are calques on the corresponding Bambara constructions‚Äô. Like Mande languages, the Senufo languages have a subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (SOV) constituent order, rather than the subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject (SVO) order which is more common in Gur and in Niger‚ÄìCongo as a whole. Classification Delafosse (1904:192-217) was the first linguist to write on the Senufo languages. He noted that the Senufo were often confused with the Mande, partly because use of Mande languages by the Senufo was widespread: :[L]a langue mand√© s'est r√©pandue parmi eux, des alliances nombreuses ont eu lieu... C'est l√† l'origine de la confusion que l'on a faite souvent entre Mand√© et S√©noufo ... alors que, au triple point de vue ethnographique, antropologique et linguistique, la diff√©rence est profonde entre ces deux familles. (p. 193) In the influential classifications of Westermann (1927, 1970[1952]) and Bendor-Samuel (1971), the Senufo languages were classified as Gur languages. Starting with Manessy (1975) however, this classification was called into doubt. In 1989, John Naden, in his overview of the Gur family, stated that ‚Äò[t]he remaining languages, especially Senufo, may well be no more closely related to Central Gur than to Guang or Togo Remnant, or than these to Central Gur or Volta-Comoe‚Äô (1989:143). Subclassification Early Senufo classifications (e.g. Bendor-Samuel 1971) were mainly geographically motivated, dividing the Senufo languages into Northern, Central, and Southern Senufo. In subsequent years, this terminology was adopted by several linguists working on Senufo languages (Garber 1987; Carlson 1983, 1994). Mensah (1983) and Mills (1984) avoided this geographical terms but used mainly the same grouping, according to Garber 1987. SIL International in its Ethnologue subdivides the Senufo languages in six groups. Combining the two classifications results in the grouping below.

Other names for it include mackinaw, namaycush, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, it can also be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish. Those caught with dark coloration may be called mud hens. Range From a zoogeographical perspective, lake trout have a relatively narrow distribution. They are native only to the northern parts of North America, principally Canada, but also Alaska and, to some extent, the northeastern United States. Lake trout have been widely introduced into non-native waters in North America and into many other parts of the world, mainly Europe, but also into South America and certain parts of Asia. Although lake trout were introduced into Yellowstone National Park's Shoshone, Lewis and Heart lakes legally in the 1890s, they were illegally or accidentally introduced into Yellowstone Lake in the 1980s where they are now considered invasive. Description A lake trout Lake trout are the largest of the chars; the record weighed almost (netted) with a length of , and fish are not uncommon. The average length is . The largest caught on a rod and reel according to the IGFA was , caught in Great Bear Lake in 1995 with a length of . Life history Lake trout inhabit cold, oxygen- rich waters. They are pelagic during the period of summer stratification in dimictic lakes, often living at depths of . The lake trout is a slow-growing fish, typical of oligotrophic waters. It is also very late to mature. Populations are extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many native lake trout populations have been severely damaged through the combined effects of hatchery stocking (planting) and over harvest. Another threat to lake trout is acidification, which can have longterm effects on their populations through both direct harm and reduced prey populations (e.g. Mysis relicta). There are three subspecies of lake trout. There is the common lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush namaycush), the siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet), and the less common rush lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush huronicus). Some lakes do not have pelagic forage fish during the period of summer stratification. In these lakes, lake trout take on a life history known as planktivory. Lake trout in planktivorous populations are highly abundant, grow very slowly and mature at relatively small sizes. In those lakes that do contain deep-water forage, lake trout become piscivorous. Piscivorous lake trout grow much more quickly, mature at a larger size and are less abundant. Notwithstanding differences in abundance, the density of biomass of lake trout is fairly consistent in similar lakes, regardless of whether the lake trout populations they contain are planktivorous or piscivorous. A lake trout in spawning dress. In Lake Superior, common lake trout (S. n. namaycush) and siscowet lake trout (S. n. siscowet) live together. Common lake trout tend to stay in shallower waters, while siscowet lake trout stay in deeper water. Common lake trout (also called \\"lean\\" lake trout) are slimmer than the relatively fat siscowet. Siscowet numbers have become greatly depressed over the years due to a combination of the extirpation of some of the fish's deep water coregonine prey and to overexploitation. Siscowet tend to grow extremely large and fat and attracted great commercial interest in the last century. Their populations have rebounded since 1970, with one estimate putting the number in Lake Superior at 100 million. Professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, James Kitchell, credits effective constraint of commercial fisheries and persistent sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control for the successful recovery of Lake Superior's lake trout. \\"Looking at what has happened in the lake and the results of computer simulations, it is clear that lamprey control needs to continue if Lake Superior is to keep its lake trout.\\" Hybrids Lake trout are known to hybridize in nature with the brook trout; such hybrids, known as \\"splake\\", are normally sterile but self- sustaining populations exist in some lakes. Splake are also artificially propagated in hatcheries, and then stocked into lakes in an effort to provide sport-fishing opportunities. Commercial fishing mural in the Sturgeon Bay Post Office. Lake trout were fished commercially in the Great Lakes until lampreys, overharvest and pollution extirpated or severely reduced the stocks. Commercial fisheries still exist in some areas of the Great Lakes and smaller lakes in northern Canada. Commercial fishing by Ojibwe for Lake Trout in Lake Superior is permitted under various treaties and regulated by the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC). Origin of name The specific epithet namaycush derives from namekush, a form of the word used in some inland Southern East Cree communities in referring to this species of fish.

The photograph shows a DES Cracker circuit board fitted on both sides with 64 Deep Crack chips. In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search. A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner). Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier. When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones. Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it. Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. Basic concept Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially. [by;walpauji_135] Theoretical limits The resources required for a brute-force attack grow exponentially with increasing key size, not linearly. Although U.S. export regulations historically restricted key lengths to 56-bit symmetric keys (e.g. Data Encryption Standard), these restrictions are no longer in place, so modern symmetric algorithms typically use computationally stronger 128- to 256-bit keys. There is a physical argument that a 128-bit symmetric key is computationally secure against brute-force attack. The so-called Landauer limit implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of per bit erased in a computation, where T is the temperature of the computing device in kelvins, k is the Boltzmann constant, and the natural logarithm of 2 is about 0.693. No irreversible computing device can use less energy than this, even in principle. Thus, in order to simply flip through the possible values for a 128-bit symmetric key (ignoring doing the actual computing to check it) would, theoretically, require 2128 ‚àí 1 bit flips on a conventional processor. If it is assumed that the calculation occurs near room temperature (~300 K), the Von Neumann-Landauer Limit can be applied to estimate the energy required as ~1018 joules, which is equivalent to consuming 30 gigawatts of power for one year. This is equal to 30√ó109 W√ó365√ó24√ó3600 s = 9.46√ó1017 J or 262.7 TWh (about 0.1% of the yearly world energy production). The full actual computation ‚Äì checking each key to see if a solution has been found ‚Äì would consume many times this amount. Furthermore, this is simply the energy requirement for cycling through the key space; the actual time it takes to flip each bit is not considered, which is certainly greater than 0. However, this argument assumes that the register values are changed using conventional set and clear operations which inevitably generate entropy. It has been shown that computational hardware can be designed not to encounter this theoretical obstruction (see reversible computing), though no such computers are known to have been constructed. GPUs are well-suited to the repetitive tasks associated with hardware-based password cracking As commercial successors of governmental ASIC solutions have become available, also known as custom hardware attacks, two emerging technologies have proven their capability in the brute-force attack of certain ciphers. One is modern graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, the other is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. GPUs benefit from their wide availability and price-performance benefit, FPGAs from their energy efficiency per cryptographic operation. Both technologies try to transport the benefits of parallel processing to brute-force attacks. In case of GPUs some hundreds, in the case of FPGA some thousand processing units making them much better suited to cracking passwords than conventional processors. Various publications in the fields of cryptographic analysis have proved the energy efficiency of today's FPGA technology, for example, the COPACOBANA FPGA Cluster computer consumes the same energy as a single PC (600 W), but performs like 2,500 PCs for certain algorithms. A number of firms provide hardware-based FPGA cryptographic analysis solutions from a single FPGA PCI Express card up to dedicated FPGA computers. WPA and WPA2 encryption have successfully been brute-force attacked by reducing the workload by a factor of 50 in comparison to conventional CPUs and some hundred in case of FPGAs. A single COPACOBANA board boasting 6 Xilinx Spartans ‚Äì a cluster is made up of 20 of these AES permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. One of the fastest supercomputers in 2019 has a speed of 100 petaFLOPS which could theoretically check 100 million million (1014) AES keys per second (assuming 1000 operations per check), but would still require 3.67√ó1055 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space. An underlying assumption of a brute-force attack is that the complete keyspace was used to generate keys, something that relies on an effective random number generator, and that there are no defects in the algorithm or its implementation. For example, a number of systems that were originally thought to be impossible to crack by brute force have nevertheless been cracked because the key space to search through was found to be much smaller than originally thought, because of a lack of entropy in their pseudorandom number generators. These include Netscape's implementation of SSL (famously cracked by Ian Goldberg and David Wagner in 1995}}) and a Debian/Ubuntu edition of OpenSSL discovered in 2008 to be flawed. A similar lack of implemented entropy led to the breaking of Enigma's code. Credential recycling Credential recycling refers to the hacking practice of re-using username and password combinations gathered in previous brute-force attacks. A special form of credential recycling is pass the hash, where unsalted hashed credentials are stolen and re-used without first being brute forced. Unbreakable codes Certain types of encryption, by their mathematical properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An example of this is one-time pad cryptography, where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer ‚Äì but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the Venona project, generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation: the key pads not being truly random, intercepted keypads, operators making mistakes ‚Äì or other errors. Countermeasures In case of an offline attack where the attacker has access to the encrypted material, one can try key combinations without the risk of discovery or interference. However database and directory administrators can take countermeasures against online attacks, for example by limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, by introducing time delays between successive attempts, increasing the answer's complexity (e.g. requiring a CAPTCHA answer or verification code sent via cellphone), and/or locking accounts out after unsuccessful login attempts. Website administrators may prevent a particular IP address from trying more than a predetermined number of password attempts against any account on the site. Reverse brute-force attack In a reverse brute-force attack, a single (usually common) password is tested against multiple usernames or encrypted files. The process may be repeated for a select few passwords. In such a strategy, the attacker is generally not targeting a specific user.

Technique A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. Such attacks originally used words one would find in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack); Jeff Atwood. \\"Dictionary Attacks 101\\". however, now there are much larger lists available on the open Internet that contain hundreds of millions of passwords recovered from past data breaches.CrackStation's list. e.g., with over 1.4 billion words. There is also cracking software that can use such lists and produce common variations, such as substituting numbers for similar-looking letters. In contrast to a brute force attack, where a large proportion of the key space is searched systematically, a dictionary attack tries only those possibilities which are deemed most likely to succeed. Dictionary attacks often succeed because many people have a tendency to choose short passwords that are ordinary words or common passwords, or variants obtained, for example, by appending a digit or punctuation character. Dictionary attacks are difficult to defeat, since most common password creations techniques are covered by the available lists, combined with cracking software pattern generation. A safer approach is to randomly generate a long password (15 letters or more) or a multiword passphrase, using a password manager program or a manual method. Pre- computed dictionary attack/Rainbow table attack It is possible to achieve a time‚Äìspace tradeoff by pre-computing a list of hashes of dictionary words and storing these in a database using the hash as the key. This requires a considerable amount of preparation time, but this allows the actual attack to be executed faster. The storage requirements for the pre-computed tables were once a major cost, but now they are less of an issue because of the low cost of disk storage. Pre-computed dictionary attacks are particularly effective when a large number of passwords are to be cracked. The pre-computed dictionary needs be generated only once, and when it is completed, password hashes can be looked up almost instantly at any time to find the corresponding password. A more refined approach involves the use of rainbow tables, which reduce storage requirements at the cost of slightly longer lookup-times. See LM hash for an example of an authentication system compromised by such an attack. Pre-computed dictionary attacks, or \\"rainbow table attacks\\", can be thwarted by the use of salt, a technique that forces the hash dictionary to be recomputed for each password sought, making precomputation infeasible, provided that the number of possible salt values is large enough.

In parabolic antennas such as satellite dishes, a feed horn (or feedhorn) is a small horn antenna used to convey radio waves between the transmitter and/or receiver and the parabolic reflector. In transmitting antennas, it is connected to the transmitter and converts the radio frequency alternating current from the transmitter to radio waves and feeds them to the rest of the antenna, which focuses them into a beam. In receiving antennas, incoming radio waves are gathered and focused by the antenna's reflector on the feed horn, which converts them to a tiny radio frequency voltage which is amplified by the receiver. Feed horns are used mainly at microwave (SHF) and higher frequencies. The feedhorn also selects the polarization of the waves to be received, which helps to attenuate unwanted signals from adjacent channels and transponders, and from other communications satellites at nearby orbital positions. This can be either horizontal or vertical if the polarization is linear, or clockwise or counterclockwise (also called left- and right-handed) if it is circular. Certain devices can also allow a feedhorn to accept both linear and circular, though these cause a slight insertion loss to all incoming signals. When used with a parabolic reflector or lens antenna, the phase center of the horn is usually placed at the focal point of the reflector, with the of the horn's radiation pattern set to be at the edge of the reflector. On a satellite dish, the feedhorn is what is mounted at the end of a mast from the center of the dish, or on tripod legs mounted to the edge of the dish. In satellite dishes, part of the receiver electronics, the RF front end, is usually mounted in a box just behind the feed horn. This converts the high satellite microwave downlink frequencies to a lower frequency so it can be more easily sent through the coaxial cable feedline to the receiver inside the building. This is called the low-noise block downconverter (LNB), and the unit consisting of the horn plus the converter is called the LNB with feedhorn (LNBF). Feed horn on a military radar antenna.

Players take turns to remove any number of contiguous pieces from a grid of playing pieces, alternating until the last piece is removed. The game can be played in its misere and non-misere forms. The strategies listed here render the non-misere gameplay trivial. At the time of its founding, TacTix was played on a 6x6 board, but is now usually played on a 4x4 board. TacTix is essentially a two-dimensional version of Nim. Game play TacTix is played on a NxN grid of squares. Players alternate removing pieces from a square (or rectangular) grid, as many contiguous pieces as desired. Players alternate doing this until the last piece removes. The player who takes the last piece loses (mis√®re play convention). The game is often used as a programming exercise, and many versions are available on the web as Java applets. Strategy First Player If N Is Odd (non-misere): The player takes the center piece and symmetrically imitates every one of the opponent's moves. Second Player If N Is Even (non-misere): Player copies opponent's moves symmetrically. You will eventually take the last piece and win. Variations The hexagonal variation of the game, played on a six by six by six board, is called TacTex. TacTix can also be played on any size NxN board. A Non Misere version of TacTix, where the player who makes the last move is the winner, is also playable. Analysis On the 4 √ó 4 grid originally proposed by Hein, the second player will always win with correct play (HAKMEM item #74). If the game is instead played with the normal play convention (player who takes the last piece wins), the second player can always win by symmetrically mirroring the first player's moves. (Or on an odd √ó odd size grid, the first player can win by choosing the center piece and subsequently mirroring.) Tac Tix has 65,536 reachable positions.

There was dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period, so in June 1746 a group of London booksellers contracted Johnson to write a dictionary for the sum of 1,500 guineas (¬£1,575), equivalent to about ¬£ in . Johnson took seven years to complete the work, although he had claimed he could finish it in three. He did so single- handedly, with only clerical assistance to copy the illustrative quotations that he had marked in books. Johnson produced several revised editions during his life. Until the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary 173 years later, Johnson's was viewed as the pre-eminent English dictionary. According to Walter Jackson Bate, the Dictionary \\"easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time\\".Bate, Walter Jackson. Samuel Johnson, Ch. 15, \\"Storming the Main Gate: The Dictionary\\". New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975.  Background  In earlier times, books had been regarded with something approaching veneration, but by the mid-eighteenth century this was no longer the case. The rise of literacy among the general public, combined with the technical advances in the mechanics of printing and bookbinding, meant that for the first time, books, texts, maps, pamphlets and newspapers were widely available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Such an explosion of the printed word demanded a set pattern of grammar, definition, and spelling for those words. This could be achieved by means of an authoritative dictionary of the English language. In 1746, a consortium of London's most successful printers, including Robert Dodsley and Thomas Longman ‚Äì none could afford to undertake it alone ‚Äì set out to satisfy and capitalise on this need by the ever-increasing reading and writing public. Johnson's dictionary was not the first English dictionary, nor even among the first dozen. Over the previous 150 years more than twenty dictionaries had been published in England, the oldest of these being a Latin-English \\"wordbook\\" by Sir Thomas Elyot published in 1538. The next to appear was by Richard Mulcaster, a headmaster, in 1583. Mulcaster compiled what he termed \\"a generall table [of eight thousand words] we commonlie use...[yet] It were a thing verie praise worthy...if som well learned...would gather all words which we use in the English tung...into one dictionary...\\"Hitchings 2005, London p. 48; New York p. 53 In 1598, an Italian‚ÄìEnglish dictionary by John Florio was published. It was the first English dictionary to use quotations (\\"illustrations\\") to give meaning to the word; in none of these dictionaries so far were there any actual definitions of words. This was to change, to a small extent, in schoolmaster Robert Cawdrey's Table Alphabeticall, published in 1604. Though it contained only 2,449 words, and no word beginning with the letters W, X, or Y, this was the first monolingual English dictionary. Several more dictionaries followed: in Latin, English, French and Italian. Benjamin Martin's Lingua Britannica Reformata (1749) and Ainsworth's Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (1737) are both significant, in that they define entries in separate senses, or aspects, of the word. In English (among others), John Cowell's Interpreter, a law dictionary, was published in 1607, Edward Phillips' The new world of English words came out in 1658 and a dictionary of 40,000 words had been prepared in 1721 by Nathan Bailey, though none was as comprehensive in breadth or style as Johnson's. The problem with these dictionaries was that they tended to be little more than poorly organised and poorly researched glossaries of \\"hard words\\": words that were technical, foreign, obscure or antiquated. But perhaps the greatest single fault of these early lexicographers was, as historian Henry Hitchings put it, that they \\"failed to give sufficient sense of [the English] language as it appeared in use.\\"Hitchings 2005, London p. 49; New York p. 55 In that sense Dr. Johnson's dictionary was the first to comprehensively document the English lexicon. = Johnson's preparation = Johnson's dictionary was prepared at 17 Gough Square, London, an eclectic household, between the years of 1746 and 1755. By 1747 Johnson had written his Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language, which spelled out his intentions and proposed methodology for preparing his document. He clearly saw benefit in drawing from previous efforts, and saw the process as a parallel to legal precedent (possibly influenced by Cowell): Johnson's Plan received the patronage of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield but not to Johnson's pleasure.Lane pp. 117‚Äì118 Chesterfield did not care about praise, but was instead interested by Johnson's abilities.Lane p. 118 Seven years after first meeting Johnson to discuss the work, Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in The World that recommended the Dictionary. He complained that the English language was lacking structure and argued: However, Johnson did not appreciate the tone of the essay, and he felt that Chesterfield had not made good on his promise to be the work's patron. In a letter, Johnson explained his feelings about the matter: The text A Dictionary of the English Language was somewhat large and very expensive. Its pages were tall and nearly wide. The paper was of the finest quality available, the cost of which ran to nearly ¬£1,600; more than Johnson had been paid to write the book. Johnson himself pronounced the book \\"Vasta mole superbus\\" (\\"Proud in its great bulk\\").Hitchings 2005, London p. 195; New York p. 209 No bookseller could possibly hope to print this book without help; outside a few special editions of the Bible no book of this heft and size had even been set to type. The title page reads: > A > DICTIONARY > of the > ENGLISH LANGUAGE: > in which > The WORDS are deduced from their ORIGINALS, > and > ILLUSTRATED in their DIFFERENT SIGNIFICATIONS > by > EXAMPLES from the best WRITERS. > To which are prefixed, > A HISTORY of the LANGUAGE, > and AN ENGLISH GRAMMAR. > By SAMUEL JOHNSON, A.M. > In TWO Volumes > VOL. I The words \\"Samuel Johnson\\" and \\"English Language\\" were printed in red; the rest was printed in black. The preface and headings were set in 4.6 mm \\"English\\" type, the text‚Äîdouble columned‚Äîwas set in 3.5 mm pica. This first edition of the dictionary contained a 42,773-word list, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions. One of Johnson's important innovations was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there are around 114,000. The authors most frequently cited by Johnson include Shakespeare, Milton and Dryden. For example: :OPULENCE :Wealth; riches; affluence :\\"There in full opulence a banker dwelt, :Who all the joys and pangs of riches felt; :His sideboard glitter'd with imagin'd plate, :And his proud fancy held a vast estate.\\" : Jonathan Swift Furthermore, Johnson, unlike Bailey, added notes on a word's usage, rather than being merely descriptive. Unlike most modern lexicographers, Johnson introduced humour or prejudice into quite a number of his definitions. Among the best-known are: *\\"Excise: a hateful tax levied upon commodities and adjudged not by the common judges of property but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid\\"See online copy of sixth edition *\\"Lexicographer: a writer of dictionaries; a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original and detailing the signification of words\\"See online copy of sixth edition *\\"Oats: a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people\\"See online copy of sixth edition A couple of less well-known examples are: *\\"Monsieur: a term of reproach for a Frenchman\\"See online copy of sixth edition *\\"Patron: One who countenances, supports, or protects. Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery.\\" See onlike copy of sixth edition which some have understood to be a jab at his patron Philip Stanhope. Winchester, Simon. The Professor and the Madman. HarperCollins Publishers, 1998. He included whimsical little-known words, such as: *\\"Writative ‚Äì A word of Pope's, not to be imitated: \\"Increase of years makes men more talkative but less writative; to that degree I now write letters but of plain how d'ey's.\\"\\"Kacirk, Jeffrey, Forgotten English, 21 May (page) On a more serious level, Johnson's work showed a heretofore unseen meticulousness. Unlike all the proto-dictionaries that had come before, painstaking care went into the completeness when it came not only to \\"illustrations\\" but also to definitions as well: *\\"Turn\\" had 16 definitions with 15 illustrations *\\"Time\\" had 20 definitions with 14 illustrations *\\"Put\\" ran more than 5,000 words spread over 3 pages *\\"Take\\" had 134 definitions, running 8,000 words, over 5 pagesHitchings 2005, London p. 87; New York p. 93 The original goal was to publish the dictionary in two folio volumes: A‚ÄìK and L‚ÄìZ. But that soon proved unwieldy, unprofitable, and unrealistic. Subsequent printings ran to four volumes; even these formed a stack tall, and weighed in at nearly . In addition to the sheer physical heft of Johnson's dictionary, came the equally hefty price: ¬£4/10/‚Äì (equivalent to approximately ¬£ in ). So discouraging was the price that by 1784, thirty years after the first edition was published, when the dictionary had by then run through five editions, only about 6,000 copies were in circulation‚Äîan average sale of 200 books a year for thirty years. Johnson's etymologies would be considered poor by modern standards, and he gave little guide to pronunciation; one example being \\"Cough: A convulsion of the lungs, vellicated by some sharp serosity. It is pronounced coff\\". Much of his dictionary was prescriptivist. It was also linguistically conservative, advocating traditional spellings such as publick rather than the simpler spellings that would be favoured 73 years later by Noah Webster. In spite of its shortcomings, the dictionary was far and away the best of its day. Its scope and structure were carried forward in dictionaries that followed, including Noah Webster's Webster's Dictionary in 1828 and the Oxford English Dictionary later in the same century.  Reception history  = Initial reception = From the beginning there was universal appreciation not only of the content of the Dictionary but also of Johnson's achievement in single- handedly creating it: \\"When Boswell came to this part of Johnson's life, more than three decades later, he pronounced that 'the world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a work achieved by one man, while other countries had thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies'.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 198 \\"The Dictionary was considered, from the moment of its inception, to be Johnson's, and from the time of its completion it was Johnson's Dictionary‚Äîhis book and his property, his monument, his memorial.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 200 Immediately after publication \\"The Dictionary was enthusiastically written up in important periodicals such as the London Magazine and‚Äînone too surprisingly‚Äîthe Gentleman's Magazine. In the latter it received an eight-page notice\\".Hitchings 2005, p. 198‚Äì9 Reviews, such as they were, proved generous in tone: \\"Of the less positive assessments the only properly judicious one came from Adam Smith in the pro-Whig Edinburgh Review ... he wished that Johnson 'had oftener passed his own censure upon those words which are not of approved use, though sometimes to be met with in authors of no mean name'. Furthermore, Johnson's approach was not 'sufficiently grammatical'\\".Hitchings 2005, p. 199 Despite the Dictionary's critical acclaim, Johnson's general financial situation continued in its dismal fashion for some years after 1755: \\"The image of Johnson racing to write Rasselas to pay for his mother's funeral, romantic hyperbole though it is, conveys the precariousness of his existence, almost four years after his work on the Dictionary was done. His financial uncertainties continued. He gave up the house in Gough Square in March 1759, probably for lack of funds. Yet, just as Johnson was plunging into another trough of despondency, the reputation of the Dictionary at last brought reward. In July 1762 Johnson was granted a state pension of ¬£300 a year by the twenty-four-year-old monarch, George III. The pension did not make him rich, but it ensured he would no longer have to grub around for the odd guinea.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 203 = Criticism = As lexicography developed, faults were found with Johnson's work: \\"From an early stage there were noisy detractors. Perhaps the loudest of them was John Horne Tooke ... Not content to pronounce it 'imperfect and faulty', he complained that it was 'one of the most idle performances ever offered to the public', that its author 'possessed not one single requisite for the undertaking', that its grammatical and historical parts were 'most truly contemptible performances', and that 'nearly one third ... is as much the language of the Hottentots as of the English'.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 221 \\"Horace Walpole summed up for the unbelievers when he pronounced at the end of the eighteenth century, 'I cannot imagine that Dr Johnson's reputation will be very lasting.' His dictionary was 'a surprising work for one man', but 'the task is too much for one man, and ... a society should alone pretend to publish a standard dictionary.' Notwithstanding Walpole's reservations, the admirers out-numbered the detractors, and the reputation of the Dictionary was repeatedly boosted by other philologists, lexicographers, educationalists and word detectives.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 222 Johnson's dictionary was made when etymology was largely based on guesswork. His Classical leanings led him to prefer spellings that pointed to Latin or Greek sources, \\"while his lack of sound scholarship prevented him from detecting their frequent errors\\". For example, he preferred the spelling ache over ake as he wrongly thought it came from the Greek achos. Some of his spelling choices were also inconsistent: \\"while retaining the Latin p in receipt he left it out of deceit; he spelled deign one way and disdain another; he spelled uphill but downhil, muckhill but dunghil, instill but distil, inthrall but disenthral\\".Handbook of Simplified Spelling. Simplified Spelling Board, 1920. p. 7 Boswell relates that \\"A lady once asked him [Johnson] how he came to define pastern as the knee of a horse: instead of making an elaborate reply, as she expected, he at once replied, 'Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance.'\\" On the same page, Boswell notes that Johnson's definition of network (\\"Any thing reticulated or decussated, at equal distances, with interstices between the intersections\\") \\"has often been quoted with sportive malignity, as obscuring a thing in itself very plain.\\" = Influence in Britain = Despite the criticisms, \\"The influence of the Dictionary was sweeping. Johnson established both a methodology for how dictionaries should be put together and a paradigm for how entries should be presented. Anyone who sought to create a dictionary, post-Johnson, did so in his shadow.\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 220 \\"In his history of the Oxford English Dictionary, Simon Winchester asserts of its eighteenth-century predecessor that 'by the end of the century every educated household had, or had access to, the great book. So firmly established did it swiftly become that any request for \\"The Dictionary\\" would bring forth Johnson and none other.' 'One asked for The Dictionary,' writes Winchester, 'much as one might demand The Bible.'\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 212 One of the first editors of the OED, James Murray, acknowledged that many of Johnson's explanations were adopted without change, for 'When his definitions are correct, and his arrangement judicious, it seems to be expedient to follow him.' ... In the end the OED reproduced around 1,700 of Johnson's definitions, marking them simply 'J.'.\\"Hitchings 2005, pp. 227‚Äì8 = Reputation abroad = Johnson's influence was not confined to Britain and English: \\"The president of the Florentine Accademia declared that the Dictionary would be 'a perpetual Monument of Fame to the Author, an Honour to his own Country in particular, and a general Benefit to the Republic of Letters'. This was no empty commendation. Johnson's work served as a model for lexicographers abroad. It is no surprise that his friend Giuseppe Baretti chose to make the Dictionary the model for his Italian‚ÄîEnglish dictionary of 1760, and for his Spanish dictionary nearly two decades later.A DICTIONARY, Spanish and English, and English and Spanish, . .

For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century, Johnson was the seminal authority on language, and the subsequent development of American lexicography was coloured by his fame.\\" For American lexicographers the Dictionary was impossible to ignore: \\"America's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, argued fiercely over Johnson's legacy ... In 1789 [Webster] declared that 'Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be our standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.'\\"Hitchings 2005, p. 225 \\"Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language. He defended Johnson's work, arguing that 'from the time of its publication, [it] has been, far more than any other, regarded as the standard for the language'.\\"Hitchings 2005, pp. 226‚Äì7 Notwithstanding the evolution of lexicography in America, \\"The Dictionary has also played its part in the law, especially in the United States. Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining 'first meanings', with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors' legislation ... Often it is a matter of historicizing language: to understand a law, you need to understand what its terminology meant to its original architects ... as long as the American Constitution remains intact, Johnson's Dictionary will have a role to play in American law.\\"Hitchings 2005, pp. 229‚Äì31  Folio and abridged editions  Samuel Johnson's Folio and Abridged Dictionaries together Close up of pages for M entries in the Folio and Abridged Dictionaries of 1755 and 1756 by Samuel Johnson Johnson's famous dictionary came out in two forms. The first was the 1755 Folio edition, which came in two large volumes on 4 April. The folio edition also features full literary quotes by those authors that Johnson quoted, such as Dryden and Shakespeare. It was followed a few weeks later by a second edition published in 165 weekly parts. The third edition was published in 1765, but it was the fourth, which came out in 1773 which included significant revisions by Johnson of the original work. The Abridged edition came out in 1756 in two octavo volumes with entries, \\"abstracted from the folio edition by the author\\", laid out as two columns per page. The abridged version did not feature the literary quotes, just the author quoted. This made it cheaper to produce and buy. It sold over a thousand copies a year for the next 30 years bringing \\"The Dictionary\\" to the reach of every literate home.  Modern editions  Johnson's Dictionary has been available in replica editions for some years. The entire first Folio edition is available on A Dictionary of the English Language as an electronic scan. The Preface to the Dictionary is available on Project Gutenberg. In addition, a scan of the 6th (1785) edition can be found at the Internet Archive in its two volumes.  In popular culture  The compilation of Johnson's Dictionary was the main plot-line for an episode of Blackadder the Third where Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) tries to conceal the destruction of the dictionary's manuscript by his servant. Johnson had given his only manuscript to the Prince and was presumably destroyed by Blackadder's apprentice dogbody Baldrick. The episode ends with Baldrick obliviously throwing the dictionary into the fire.

The 'existence' referred to need not be 'real', but exist only in a universe of discourse. As an example, legal systems use vocabulary referring to 'legal persons' that are collective entities that have rights. One says the legal doctrine has an ontological commitment to non-singular individuals. In information systems and artificial intelligence, where an ontology refers to a specific vocabulary and a set of explicit assumptions about the meaning and usage of these words, then an ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner within a specific context. In philosophy, a \\"theory is ontologically committed to an object only if that object occurs in all the ontologies of that theory.\\"  Background  The sentence ‚ÄúNapoleon is one of my ancestors‚Äù apparently commits us only to the existence of two individuals (i.e., Napoleon and the speaker) and a line of ancestry between them. The fact that no other people or objects are mentioned seems to limit the ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù of the sentence. However, it is well known that sentences of this kind cannot be interpreted in first-order logic, where individual variables stand for individual things. Instead, they must be represented in some second-order form. In ordinary language, such second-order forms use either grammatical plurals or terms such as ‚Äúset of‚Äù or ‚Äúgroup of‚Äù. For example, the sentence involving Napoleon can be rewritten as ‚Äúany group of people that includes me and the parents of each person in the group must also include Napoleon,‚Äù which is easily interpreted as a statement in second-order logic (one would naturally start by assigning a name, such as G, to the group of people under consideration). Formally, collective noun forms such as ‚Äúa group of people‚Äù are represented by second-order variables, or by first-order variables standing for sets (which are well-defined objects in mathematics and logic). Since these variables do not stand for individual objects, it seems we are ‚Äúontologically committed‚Äù to entities other than individuals ‚Äî sets, classes, and so on. As Quine puts it, > the general adoption of class variables of quantification ushers in a theory > whose laws were not in general expressible in the antecedent levels of > logic. The price paid for this increased power is ontological: objects of a > special and abstract kind, viz. classes, are now presupposed. Formally it is > precisely in allowing quantification over class variables Œ±, Œ≤, etc., that > we assume a range of values for these variables to refer to. To be assumed > as an entity is to be assumed as a value of a variable. (Methods of Logic, > 1950, p. 228) Another statement about individuals that appears ‚Äúontologically innocent‚Äù is the well-known Geach‚ÄìKaplan sentence: Some critics admire only one another. Quine's criterion Willard Van Orman Quine provided an early and influential formulation of ontological commitment: The purpose of Quine's strategy is to determine just how the ontological commitment of a theory is to be found. Quine argued that the only ontologically committing expressions are variables bound by a first-order existential quantifier, and natural language expressions which were formalized using variables bound by first-order existential quantifiers. Attempts have been made to argue that predicates are also ontologically committing, and thus that subject-predicate sentences bear additional ontological commitment to abstract objects such as universals, sets, or classes. It has been suggested that the use of meaningful names in nonexistence statements such as \\"Pegasus does not exist\\" brings with it an ontological commitment to empty names like Pegasus, a quandary referred to as Plato's beard and escaped by using quantifiers. This discussion has a connection to the Carnap‚ÄìQuine argument over analytic and synthetic objects. Although Quine refers to 'ontological commitment' in this connection, in his rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction he does not rely upon the formal translation of any particular theory along the lines he has suggested. Instead, Quine argues by using examples that although there are tautological statements in a formal theory, like \\"all squares are rectangles\\", a formal theory necessarily contains references to objects that are not tautological, but have external connections. That is, there is an ontological commitment to such external objects. In addition, the terms used to interpret the application of the theory are not simply descriptions of sensory input, but are statements in a context. That is, inversely, there is an ontological commitment of these observational objects to the formal theory. As Ryan puts it: \\"Rather than being divided between contingent synthetic claims and indubitable analytic propositions, our beliefs constitute a continuous range from a periphery of sense-reports to interior concepts that are comparatively theory-laden and general.\\" Thus we end up with Quine's 'flat' ontology that does not see a distinction between analytic and synthetic objects. Quine further made a distinction between the ontological commitments of a theory (what the theory says exists) and the ideological commitments of a theory (those concepts, logical or non-logical, that are expressible within the theory).\\"Ontological Commitment\\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. =Ontological parsimony= Whatever process one uses to determine the ontological commitments of a theory, that does not prescribe what ontological commitments one should have. Quine regarded this as a matter of epistemology, which theory one should accept. \\"Appeal is made to [concerns of] explanatory power, parsimony, conservatism, precision, and so on\\". Ontological parsimony can be defined in various ways, and often is equated to versions of Occam's razor, a \\"rule of thumb, which obliges us to favor theories or hypotheses that make the fewest unwarranted, or ad hoc, assumptions about the data from which they are derived.\\" Glock regards 'ontological parsimony' as one of the 'five main points' of Quine's conception of ontology. Following Quine, Baker states that a theory, T, is ontologically committed to items F if and only if T entails that F‚Ä≤s exist. If two theories, T1 and T2, have the same ontological commitments except that T2 is ontologically committed to F‚Ä≤s while T1 is not, then T1 is more parsimonious than T2. More generally, a sufficient condition for T1 being more parsimonious than T2 is for the ontological commitments of T1 to be a proper subset of those of T2. These ideas lead to the following particular formulation of Occam's razor: 'Other things being equal, if T1 is more ontologically parsimonious than T2 then it is rational to prefer T1 to T2.' While a common formulation stipulates only that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity, this version by contrast, states that entities should not be multiplied other things being equal, and this is compatible with parsimony being a comparatively weak theoretical virtue.  Recent controversies  The standard approach to ontological commitment has been that, once a theory has been regimented and/or \\"paraphrased\\" into an agreed \\"canonical\\" version, which may indeed be in formal logical notation rather than the original language of the theory, ontological commitments can be read off straightforwardly from the presence of certain ontologically committing expressions (e.g. bound variables of existential quantification). Although there is substantial debate about which expressions are ontologically committing, parties to that debate generally agree that the expressions they prefer are reliable bearers of ontological commitment, imparting ontological commitment to all regimented sentences in which they occur. This assumption has been challenged. Inwagen has taken issue with Quine's methodology, claiming that this process did not lead to a unique set of fundamental objects, but to several possible sets, and one never could be certain that all the possible sets had been found. He also took issue with Quine's notion of a theory, which he felt was tantamount to suggesting a 'theory' was just a collection of sentences. Inwagen suggested that Quine's approach provided useful tools for discovering what entities were ontological commitments, but that he had not been successful. His attempts are comparable to an \\"attempt to reach the moon by climbing ever higher trees...\\" It has been suggested that the ontological commitments of a theory cannot be discerned by analysis of the syntax of sentences, looking for ontologically committing expressions, because the true ontological commitments of a sentence (or theory) are restricted to the entities needed to serve as truthmakers for that sentence, and the syntax of even a regimented or formalized sentence is not a reliable guide to what entities are needed to make it true. However, this view has been attacked by Jonathan Schaffer, who has argued that truthmaking is not an adequate test for ontological commitment: at best, the search for the truthmakers of our theory will tell us what is \\"fundamental\\", but not what our theory is ontologically committed to, and hence will not serve as a good way of deciding what exists. It also has been argued that the syntax of sentences is not a reliable guide to their ontological commitments because English has no form of words which reliably functions to make an existence-claim in every context in which it is used. For example, Jody Azzouni suggests that \\"There is\\" does not make any kind of genuine existence-claim when it is used in a sentence such as \\"There are mice that talk\\". Since the meaning of the existential quantifier in formal notation is usually explained in terms of its equivalence to English expressions such as \\"there is\\" and \\"there exist\\", and since these English expressions are not reliably ontologically committing, it comes to seem that we cannot be sure of our theory's ontological commitments even after it has been regimented into a canonical formulation. This argument has been attacked by Howard Peacock, who suggests that Azzouni's strategy conflates two different kinds of ontological commitment ‚Äì one which is intended as a measure of what a theory explicitly claims to exist, and one which is intended as a measure of what is required for the theory to be true; what the ontological costs of the theory are. If ontological commitment is thought of as a matter of the ontological costs of a theory, then it is possible that a sentence may be ontologically committed to an entity even though competent speakers of the language do not recognize the sentence as asserting the existence of that entity. Ontological commitment is not a matter of what commitments one explicitly recognizes, but rather a matter of what commitments are actually incurred.

It opened in 1855 with the name Government Hospital for the Insane, the first federally operated psychiatric hospital in the United States. Housing over 8,000 patients at its peak in the 1950s, the hospital had a fully functioning medical-surgical unit, a school of nursing, accredited internships and psychiatric residencies. Its campus was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. The west portion of the campus is home to over 1,000 U.S. Department of Homeland Security personnel and serves as its headquarters. St. Elizabeth‚Äôs Hospital campus also has the joint tenant of the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building with hundreds of Coast Guard personnel. The hospital was under the control of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services until 1987, when ownership of its east wing was transferred to the District of Columbia. Since 2010, the hospital's functions have been limited to the portion of the east campus operated by the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health. The remainder of the east campus is slated for redevelopment by the District of Columbia, and the west campus is for use of the United States Department of Homeland Security headquarters and its subsidiary agencies. Early history =Founding= St. Elizabeths Hospital was founded in August 1852 when the United States Congress appropriated $100,000 for the construction of a hospital in Washington, D.C., to provide care for indigent residents of the District of Columbia and members of the U.S. Army and Navy with brain illnesses. In the 1830s, local residents, including Dr. Thomas Miller, a medical doctor and president of the D.C. Board of Health, began petitioning Congress for a facility to care for people with brain diseases in the City of Washington. Their efforts were given a significant boost by Dorothea Dix (1802‚Äì1887), a pioneering advocate for people living with mental illnesses who helped convince legislators of the need for the hospital. In 1852 she wrote the legislation that established the hospital. Dix, who was on friendly terms with U.S. President Millard Fillmore, was asked to assist the Interior Secretary in getting the hospital started. Her recommendation resulted in the appointment of Dr. Charles H. Nichols as the hospital's first superintendent. After his appointment in the fall of 1852, Nichols and Dix began formulating a plan for the hospital's design and operation and set out to find an appropriate location, based upon guidelines created by Thomas Story Kirkbride. His 1854 manual recommended specifics such as site, ventilation, number of patients, and the need for a rural location proximate to a city. He also recommended that the location have good soil for farming and gardens for the patients. Dr. Nichols oversaw the design and building of St. Elizabeths, which began in 1853. The hospital was constructed in three phases. The west wing was built first, followed by the east wing and finally the center portion of the building, which housed the administrative operations as well as the superintendent's residential quarters. All three sections of the hospital existed under one roof, keeping with Kirkbride's design. Two other buildings, the West Lodge (1856‚Äì98) for men and the East Lodge for women, were built to house and care for African-American patients. = Peak operation = Soon after the hospital opened to patients in January 1855, it became known officially as the Government Hospital for the Insane. During the Civil War the West Lodge, originally built for male African- American patients, was used as a general hospital by the U.S. Navy. The unfinished east wing of the main building was used by the U.S. Army as a general hospital for sick and wounded soldiers. The Army hospital officially took the name of St. Elizabeth's Army Medical Hospital to differentiate it from the psychiatric hospital in the west wing of the same building. The name St. Elizabeth's was derived from the colonial-era name for the tract of land on which the hospital was built. After the Civil War and the closing of the Army's hospital, the St. Elizabeths name was used unofficially and intermittently until 1916, when Congress passed legislation changing the name from the Government Hospital for the Insane to St. Elizabeths Hospital, inexplicably omitting the possessive apostrophe. It also transferred hospital to the United States Department of Interior. In the late 19th century the hospital temporarily housed animals that were brought back from expeditions for the Smithsonian Institution, because of lack of housing for the animals at the yet-to-be-built National Zoo. = Decline = By 1940 St. Elizabeths Hospital was transferred to the Federal Security Agency (later the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) as a U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. At its peak, the St. Elizabeths campus housed 8,000 patients and employed 4,000 people. Beginning in the 1950s, however, large institutions such as St. Elizabeths were being criticized for hindering the treatment of patients. Community-based health care, as specified in the passage of the 1963 Community Mental Health Act, led to deinstitutionalization. The act provided for local outpatient facilities and drug therapy as a more effective means of allowing patients to live near-normal lives. The first community-based center for mental health was established at St. Elizabeths in 1969. The patient population of St. Elizabeth's steadily declined. In 1967, the hospital was transferred to the National Institute of Mental Health. Recent history The Center Building at St. Elizabeths in 2006 After several decades in decline, it was decided that the large campus could no longer be adequately maintained. In 1987, hospital functions on the eastern campus were transferred from the United States Department of Health and Human Services to the District of Columbia government by St. Elizabeths Hospital and District of Columbia Mental Health Services Act of 1984, with the federal government retaining ownership of the western campus. = East Campus = By 1996, only 850 patients remained at the hospital and years of neglect had become apparent; equipment and medicine shortages occurred frequently, and the heating system was broken for weeks at a time. By 2002, all remaining patients on the Federal western campus were transferred to other facilities. Although it continues to operate, it does so on a far smaller scale than it once did. As of January 31, 2009, the current patient census was 404 in-patients. In recent years, approximately half of St. Elizabeths' patients are civilly committed to the hospital for treatment; the other half are forensic (criminal) patients. Forensic patients are those who are adjudicated to be criminally insane (not guilty by reason of insanity) or considered incompetent to stand trial. Civil patients are those who are admitted owing to an acute need for psychiatric care. Civil patients can be voluntarily or involuntarily committed for treatment. A new civil and forensic hospital was built on the East Campus by the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health and opened in the spring of 2010, housing approximately 297 patients. Until the new hospital opened, civil patients were cared for in various buildings on the East Campus; forensic patients were housed in the John Howard Pavilion. In the new facility, civil and forensic patients live in separate units of the same building. The new hospital also houses a library, an auditorium, multiple computer laboratories, and a small museum in the lobby. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice and the District of Columbia reached a settlement over allegations that the civil rights of patients housed at St. Elizabeths were violated by the District. On August 28, 2014, the Department of Justice found that St. Elizabeths had \\"significantly improved the care and treatment of persons confined to Saint Elizabeths Hospital\\" and asked a federal court to dismiss the injunction. In January 2015, DC Auditors dismissed the settlement agreement and officially ended oversight of St. Elizabeths Hospital. The St. Elizabeths East Campus is a planned redevelopment for mixed use rental property development. On September 22, 2018, St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena, home to the Washington Mystics and Capital City Go-Go, as well as the practice facility for the Washington Wizards opened on the campus. =West Campus= Opening ceremony for the new DHS headquarters in April 2019 alt= Atkins Hall, home to U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office in 2014 After the 1987 separation of the campuses, several commercial redevelopment opportunities were proposed by the D.C. government and consultants, including relocating the University of the District of Columbia to the campus or developing office and retail space. However, the tremendous cost of bringing the facilities up to code (estimated at $50‚Äì$100 million) kept developers away. With little interest in developing the site privately, the federal government stepped in. Control of the western campus‚Äîhome of the oldest building on the campus, the Center Building‚Äîwas transferred to the General Services Administration in 2004. GSA improved security around the campus, shored up roofs, and covered the windows with plywood in an attempt to preserve the campus until a tenant could be found. After three years of searching for an occupant, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on March 20, 2007, that it would spend approximately $4.1 billion to move its headquarters and most of its Washington-based offices to a new facility on the site, beginning with the United States Coast Guard in 2010. DHS, whose operations are scattered around dozens of buildings in the Washington, D.C., area, hopes to consolidate at least 60 of its facilities at St. Elizabeths and to save $64 million per year in rental costs. DHS also hopes to improve employee morale and unity by having a central location from which to operate. The view of the Washington, D.C., skyline from St. Elizabeths The plans to locate DHS to St. Elizabeths have been met with criticism, however. Historic preservationists argue that the move will destroy dozens of historic buildings located on the campus and that other alternatives should be considered. Community activists have also expressed concern that the planned high-security facility will not interact with the surrounding community and do little to revitalize the economically depressed area. In 2007 the District of Columbia reached a deal with the Department of Justice and agreed to fix widespread health and safety hazards in the hospital. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the DHS consolidated headquarters took place at St. Elizabeths on September 11, 2009. The event was attended by Senator Joseph Lieberman, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC Mayor Adrian Fenty, and acting GSA administrator Paul Prouty. The relocated U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building was forecast to open on May 2013, and a ceremony was held on July 2013 at the site before it is to be officially opened. Along U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building, several former hospital buildings (Atkins Hall, cafeteria) had been rehabilitated. By 2015, construction began in Center Building. Initially, this building has been slated for renovation, but internal structures (floors and ceilings) appeared to be beyond repair. Whole Center Building was rehabilitated by removing old internal structures and building new structures in the latter place, while retaining the historic facades. Between March and April, 2019 Department's Headquarters components moved to Center Building.https://s3.amazonaws.com/public- inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-07011.pdf By April 2020, DHS National Operations Center relocated to the Mount Weather. Patients Well-known patients of St. Elizabeths have included would-be presidential assassins Richard Lawrence (who attempted to kill Andrew Jackson) and John Hinckley Jr., who shot Ronald Reagan, as well as the assassin of James Garfield, Charles J. Guiteau (until his execution). Other notable residents were Mary Fuller, James Swann, Ezra Pound, and William Chester Minor. According to Kelly Patricia O'Meara, St. Elizabeths is believed to have treated over 125,000 patients, though an exact number is not known because of poor recordkeeping. Additionally, she believes that thousands of patients are buried in unmarked graves across the campus, although records for the individuals buried in the graves have been lost. She believes that the incinerator on-site also brings up a few questions as to what may have happened to the bodies. The General Services Administration, current owner of the property, considered using ground penetrating radar to attempt to locate unmarked graves but has yet to do so. More than 15,000 known autopsies were performed at St. Elizabeths from 1884 through 1982, and a collection of over 1,400 brains preserved in formaldehyde, 5,000 photographs of brains, and 100,000 slides of brain tissue was maintained by the hospital until the collection was transferred to a museum in 1986, according to O'Meara. In addition to the mental health patients buried on the campus, several hundred American Civil War soldiers are interred at St. Elizabeths. Contributions to medicine An elderly patient at St. Elizabeths, ca. 1917 Several important therapeutic techniques were pioneered at St. Elizabeths, and it served as a model for later institutions. Walter Freeman, onetime laboratory director, was inspired by St. Elizabeths to pioneer the transorbital lobotomy. During American involvement in World War II, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor to the CIA) used facilities and staff at St. Elizabeths hospital to test \\"truth serums\\". OSS unsuccessfully tested a mescaline and scopolamine cocktail as a truth drug on two volunteers at St. Elizabeths Hospital. Separate tests of THC as a truth serum were equally unsuccessful. In 1963 Dr. Luther D. Robinson, the first African American superintendent of St. Elizabeths, founded the mental health program for the deaf and was throughout his career a leading authority on treating deaf patients with brain disorders. Facilities and grounds 1860 Topographic Map of the Saint Elizabeths Hospital Campus 1937 Hospital West Campus plan (note: north is on the left) The campus of St. Elizabeths sits on bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. It is divided by Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue between the east campus (owned by the D.C. government) and the west campus (owned by the federal government). It has many important buildings, foremost among them the Center Building, designed according to the principles of the Kirkbride Plan by Thomas U. Walter (1804‚Äì87), who is better known as the primary architect of the expansion of the U.S. Capitol that was begun in 1851. Much of St. Elizabeths' campus has fallen into disuse and is in serious disrepair. It was named in 2002 one of the nation's 11 Most Endangered Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Access to many areas of the campus, including the abandoned western campus (which houses the Center Building), is restricted. In popular culture *The hospital was referred to in an episode of the television series Bonanza. The episode was \\"The Unseen Wound\\", featuring Leslie Nielsen as a sheriff, playing a former Civil War‚Äìera Army officer who falls victim to PTSD, although the modern term was not used in the script. *In the TV series The Rebel episode \\"Berserk\\", a PTSD victim was told by Nick Adams's character at the end of the show as he climbed aboard a stagecoach that he's \\"headed to a new hospital in Washington called St. Elizabeths.\\" *Portions of the west campus can be seen in the film A Few Good Men. *National Public Radio interns toured the east and west campuses, then shared their experiences, in 2010. *St. Elizabeths is referenced several times in W.E.B.

The word was used in light of its biblical usage; in the Latin translation of the Bible, Christ uses the word when sending the disciples to preach the gospel in his name. The term is most commonly used for Christian missions, but can be used for any creed or ideology.For example, Buddhism launched \\"the first large-scale missionary effort in the history of the world's religions\\" in the 3rd century BCE.

The Lausanne Congress of 1974, defined the term, related to Christian mission as, \\"to form a viable indigenous church-planting movement\\". Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world. In the Bible, Jesus is recorded as instructing the apostles to make disciples of all nations (, ). This verse is referred to by Christian missionaries as the Great Commission and inspires missionary work. Historic Village of Christianized Tapuyos Indians, Brazil c. 1820 The Christian Church expanded throughout the Roman Empire already in New Testament times and is said by tradition to have reached even further, to Persia (Church of the East) and to India (Saint Thomas Christians). During the Middle Ages, the Christian monasteries and missionaries such as Saint Patrick (5th century), and Adalbert of Prague (ca 956-997) propagated learning and religion beyond the European boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In 596, Pope Gregory the Great (in office 590-604) sent the Gregorian Mission (including Augustine of Canterbury) into England. In their turn, Christians from Ireland (the Hiberno-Scottish mission) and from Britain (Saint Boniface (ca 675-754), and the Anglo-Saxon mission, for example) became prominent in converting the inhabitants of central Europe. During the Age of Discovery, the Catholic Church established a number of missions in the Americas and in other Western colonies through the Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the Native Americans and other indigenous people. About the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier (1506‚Äì1552) as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans reached Asia and the Far East, and the Portuguese sent missions into Africa. Emblematic in many respects is Matteo Ricci's Jesuit mission to China from 1582, which was totally peaceful and non-violent. These missionary movements should be distinguished from others, such as the Baltic Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries, which were arguably compromised in their motivation by designs of military conquest. John Williams, active in the South Pacific Much contemporary Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the Second Vatican Council of 1962‚Äì1965, with an increased push for indigenization and inculturation, along with social justice issues as a constitutive part of preaching the Gospel. As the Catholic Church normally organizes itself along territorial lines and had the human and material resources, religious orders, some even specializing in it, undertook most missionary work, especially in the era after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. Over time, the Holy See gradually established a normalized Church structure in the mission areas, often starting with special jurisdictions known as apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates. At a later stage of development these foundations are raised to regular diocesan status with a local bishops appointed. On a global front, these processes were often accelerated in the later 1960s, in part accompanying political decolonization. In some regions, however, they are still in course. Just as the Bishop of Rome had jurisdiction also in territories later considered to be in the Eastern sphere, so the missionary efforts of the two 9th-century saints Cyril and Methodius were largely conducted in relation to the West rather than the East, though the field of activity was central Europe. The Eastern Orthodox Church, under the Orthodox Church of Constantinople undertook vigorous missionary work under the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. This had lasting effects and in some sense is at the origin of the present relations of Constantinople with some sixteen Orthodox national churches including the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (both traditionally said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Andrew), the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Paul). The Byzantines expanded their missionary work in Ukraine after the mass baptism in Kiev in 988. The Serbian Orthodox Church had its origins in the conversion by Byzantine missionaries of the Serb tribes when they arrived in the Balkans in the 7th century. Orthodox missionaries also worked successfully among the Estonians from the 10th to the 12th centuries, founding the Estonian Orthodox Church. Araucanian Indians in Elicura in 1612 Under the Russian Empire of the 19th century, missionaries such as Nicholas Ilminsky (1822‚Äì1891) moved into the subject lands and propagated Orthodoxy, including through Belarus, Latvia, Moldova, Finland, Estonia, Ukraine, and China. The Russian St. Nicholas of Japan (1836‚Äì1912) took Eastern Orthodoxy to Japan in the 19th century. The Russian Orthodox Church also sent missionaries to Alaska beginning in the 18th century, including Saint Herman of Alaska (died 1836), to minister to the Native Americans. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia continued missionary work outside Russia after the 1917 Russian Revolution, resulting in the establishment of many new dioceses in the diaspora, from which numerous converts have been made in Eastern Europe, North America, and Oceania. Early Protestant missionaries included John Eliot and contemporary ministers including John Cotton and Richard Bourne, who ministered to the Algonquin natives who lived in lands claimed by representatives of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 17th century. Quaker \\"publishers of truth\\" visited Boston and other mid-17th century colonies, but were not always well received.Selleck, D., discussed throughout Chapter 1, Quakers in Boston: 1656‚Äì1964, Fleming & Son, Somerville, 1980. The Danish government began the first organized Protestant mission work through its College of Missions, established in 1714. This funded and directed Lutheran missionaries such as Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg in Tranquebar, India, and Hans Egede in Greenland. In 1732, while on a visit in 1732 to Copenhagen for the coronation of his cousin King Christian VI, the Moravian Church's patron Nicolas Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf, was very struck by its effects, and particularly by two visiting Inuit children converted by Hans Egede. He also got to know a slave from the Danish colony in the West Indies. When he returned to Herrnhut in Saxony, he inspired the inhabitants of the villageit had fewer than thirty houses thento send out \\"messengers\\" to the slaves in the West Indies and to the Moravian missions in Greenland. Within thirty years, Moravian missionaries had become active on every continent, and this at a time when there were fewer than three hundred people in Herrnhut. They are famous for their selfless work, living as slaves among the slaves and together with the Native Americans, the Delaware (i.e., Lenni Lenape) and Cherokee Indian tribes. Today, the work in the former mission provinces of the worldwide Moravian Church is carried on by native workers. The fastest-growing area of the work is in Tanzania in Eastern Africa. The Moravian work in South Africa inspired William Carey and the founders of the British Baptist missions. , seven of every ten Moravians live in a former mission field and belong to a race other than Caucasian. Much Anglican mission work came about under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG, founded in 1701), the Church Missionary Society (CMS, founded 1799) and of the Intercontinental Church Society (formerly the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, originating in 1823). Modern The first recorded baptism in Alta California Wisconsin Synod going to the Apache With a dramatic increase in efforts since the 20th century, and a strong push since the Lausanne I: The International Congress on World Evangelization in Switzerland in 1974,http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722 modern evangelical groups have focused efforts on sending missionaries to every ethnic group in the world. While this effort has not been completed, increased attention has brought larger numbers of people distributing Bibles, Jesus videos, and establishing evangelical churches in more remote areas. Internationally, the focus for many years in the later 20th century was on reaching every \\"people group\\" with Christianity by the year 2000. Bill Bright's leadership with Campus Crusade, the Southern Baptist International Mission Board, The Joshua Project, and others brought about the need to know who these \\"unreached people groups\\" are and how those wanting to tell about the Christian God and share a Christian Bible could reach them. The focus for these organizations transitioned from a \\"country focus\\" to a \\"people group focus\\". (From \\"What is a People Group?\\" by Dr. Orville Boyd Jenkins: A \\"people group\\" is an ethnolinguistic group with a common self-identity that is shared by the various members. There are two parts to that word: ethno and linguistic. Language is a primary and dominant identifying factor of a people group. But there are other factors that determine or are associated with ethnicity.) The missionary ship Duff arriving at Tahiti, c. 1797 What can be viewed as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of cooperation and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their gospel message, but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort. Over the years, as indigenous churches have matured, the church of the Global South (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) has become the driving force in missions. Korean and African missionaries can now be found all over the world. These missionaries represent a major shift in church history. Another major shift in the form of modern missionary work takes shape in the conflation of spiritualism with contemporary military metaphors and practices. Missionary work as spiritual warfare is the latest iteration in a long-standing relationship between Christian missions and militarization. Despite the seeming opposition between the submissive and morally upstanding associations with prayer and dominating violence associated with militarism, these two spheres interact in a dialectical way‚Äîthey are entangled to produce one another. Nigeria, and other countries have had large numbers of their Christian adherents go to other countries and start churches. These non-western missionaries often have unparalleled success; because, they need few western resources and comforts to sustain their livelihood while doing the work they have chosen among a new culture and people. David Livingstone preaching from a wagon One of the first large-scale missionary endeavors of the British colonial age was the Baptist Missionary Society, founded in 1792 as the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen. The London Missionary Society was an evangelical organisation, bringing together from its inception both Anglicans and Nonconformists; it was founded in England in 1795 with missions in Africa and the islands of the South Pacific. The Colonial Missionary Society was created in 1836, and directed its efforts towards promoting Congregationalist forms of Christianity among \\"British or other European settlers\\" rather than indigenous peoples.Bebbington, David. \\"A view from Britain\\", in Rawlyk, George A., Aspects of the Canadian evangelical experience. p.46.

Yale University Library, Missionary Periodicals Database Both of these merged in 1966, and the resultant organisation is now known as the Council for World Mission. The Church Mission Society, first known as the Society for Missions to Africa and the East, was founded in 1799 by evangelical Anglicans centred around the anti-slavery activist William Wilberforce. It bent its efforts to the Coptic Church, the Ethiopian Church, and India, especially Kerala; it continues to this day. Many of the network of churches they established became the Anglican Communion. In 1809, the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews was founded, which pioneered mission amongst the Jewish people; it continues today as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People. In 1865, the China Inland Mission was founded, going well beyond British controlled areas; it continues as the OMF, working throughout East Asia. missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has an active missionary program. Young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five are encouraged to prepare themselves to serve a two-year, self-funded, full-time proselytizing mission. Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a Missionary Training Center (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people they live among. As of December 2019, the LDS Church had over 67,000 full-time missionaries worldwide and over 31,000 Service Missionaries. =Maryknoll= The sending of missioners from the U.S. Church was seen as a sign of the U.S. Catholic Church finally coming of age. When two American Catholic priests from distinctly different backgrounds met in Montreal in 1910, they discovered they had one thing in common. Father James Anthony Walsh, a priest from the heart of Boston, and Father Thomas Frederick Price, the first native North Carolinian ordained into the priesthood, recognized that through their differences, they were touched by the triumph of the human spirit and enriched by encountering the faith experience of others. This was the foundation of their mutual desire to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions. Countering arguments that the Church needed workers here, Fathers Walsh and Price insisted the Church would not flourish until it sent missioners overseas. Independently, the men had written extensively about the concept, Father Price in his magazine Truth, and Father Walsh in the pages of A Field Afar, an early incarnation of Maryknoll Magazine.Maryknoll Magazine Together, they formulated plans to establish a seminary for foreign missionaries. With the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 to receive final approval from Pope Pius X for their project. On June 29, 1911, Pope Pius X gave his blessings for the formation of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, now better known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers =Islamic missions= Mission Dawah is one of the largest contemporary Islamic missionary organizations. The tombs of historic Islamic missionaries in China, Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun at Mount Lingshan, Quanzhou Dawah means to \\"invite\\" (in Arabic, literally \\"calling\\") to Islam, which is the second largest religion with 1.6 billion members. From the 7th century, it spread rapidly from the Arabian Peninsula to the rest of the world through the initial Muslim conquests and subsequently with traders and explorers after the death of Muhammad. Initially, the spread of Islam came through the Dawah efforts of Muhammad and his followers. After his death in 632 CE, much of the expansion of the empire came through conquest such as that of North Africa and later Spain (Al-Andalus). The Islamic conquest of Persia put an end to the Sassanid Empire and spread the reach of Islam to as far east as Khorasan, which would later become the cradle of Islamic civilization during the Islamic Golden Age (622-1258 CE) and a stepping-stone towards the introduction of Islam to the Turkic tribes living in and bordering the area. The missionary movement peaked during the Islamic Golden Age, with the expansion of foreign trade routes, primarily into the Indo-Pacific and as far south as the isle of Zanzibar as well as the Southeastern shores of Africa. With the coming of the Sufism tradition, Islamic missionary activities increased. Later, the Seljuk Turks' conquest of Anatolia made it easier for missionaries to go lands that formerly belonged to the Byzantine Empire. In the earlier stages of the Ottoman Empire, a Turkic form of Shamanism was still widely practiced in Anatolia, but soon lost ground to Sufism. During the Ottoman presence in the Balkans, missionary movements were taken up by people from aristocratic families hailing from the region, who had been educated in Constantinople or other major city within the Empire such as the famed madrassahs and kulliyes. Primarily, individuals were sent back to the place of their origin and were appointed important positions in the local governing body. This approach often resulted in the building of mosques and local kulliyes for future generations to benefit from, as well as spreading the teachings of Islam. The World Islamic Mission's mosque in Oslo, Norway The spread of Islam towards Central and West Africa had until the early 19th century has been consistent but slow. Previously, the only connection was through Trans-Saharan trade routes. The Mali Empire, consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong example of the early Islamic conversion of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the European colonization of Africa, missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies. There is evidence of Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia as early as the 8th century. Indonesia's early people were animists, Hindus, and Buddhists. However it was not until the end of the 13th century that the process of Islamization began to spread throughout the areas local communities and port towns. The spread, although at first introduced through Arab Muslim traders, continued to saturate through the Indonesian people as local rulers and royalty began to adopt the religion subsequently leading their subjects to mirror their conversion. Recently, Muslim groups have engaged in missionary work in Malawi. Much of this is performed by the African Muslim Agency based in Angola. The Kuwait-sponsored AMA has translated the Qur'an into Chichewa (Cinyanja),Proseletysation in Malawi one of the official languages of Malawi, and has engaged in other missionary work in the country. All of the major cities in the country have mosques and there are several Islamic schools. Several South African, Kuwaiti, and other Muslim agencies are active in Mozambique, with one important one being the African Muslim Agency. The spread of Islam into West Africa, beginning with ancient Ghana in the 9th century, was mainly the result of the commercial activities of North African Muslims. The empires of both Mali and Songhai that followed ancient Ghana in the Western Sudan adopted the religion. Islam made its entry into the northern territories of modern Ghana around the 15th century. Mande speakers (who in Ghana are known as Wangara) traders and clerics carried the religion into the area. The northeastern sector of the country was also influenced by an influx of Hausa Muslim traders from the 16th century onwards Islamic influence first occurred in India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the Indian subcontinent from ancient times. Even in the pre-Islamic era, Arab traders used to visit the Malabar region, which linked them with the ports of Southeast Asia. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book The History of India as told by its own Historians, the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 CE. H. G. Rawlinson, in his book: Ancient and Medieval History of India claims the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century. Ancient and Medieval History of India Shaykh Zainuddin Makhdum's \\"Tuhfat al-Mujahidin\\" also is a reliable work. This fact is corroborated, by J. Sturrock in his South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals,Sturrock, J., South Canara and Madras District Manual (2 vols., Madras, 1894-1895) and also by Haridas Bhattacharya in Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV. Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV It was with the advent of Islam that the Arabs became a prominent cultural force in the world. The Arab merchants and traders became the carriers of the new religion, and they propagated it wherever they went.-Genesis and Growth of the Mappila Community Islam in Bulgaria can be traced back to the mid-ninth century when there were Islamic missionaries in Bulgaria, evidenced by a letter from Pope Nicholas to Boris of Bulgaria calling for the extirpation of Saracens.H. T. Norris: \\"Islam in the Balkans: religion and society between Europe and the Arab world\\" 1993 pp.21-27 Pioneer Muslim missionaries to the Kenyan interior were largely Tanganyikan, who coupled their missionary work with trade, along the centres began along the railway line such as Kibwezi, Makindu, and Nairobi. Outstanding among them was Maalim Mtondo Islam in Kenya, a Tanganyikan credited with being the first Muslim missionary to Nairobi. Reaching Nairobi at the close of the 19th century, he led a group of other Muslims, and enthusiastic missionaries from the coast to establish a \\"Swahili village\\" in present-day Pumwani. A small mosque was built to serve as a starting point and he began preaching Islam in earnest. He soon attracted several Kikuyus and Wakambas, who became his disciples.Quraishy, MA (1987). Text Book of Islam Book 1. Nairobi: The Islamic Foundation, p. 182. In 1380, Karim ul' Makhdum the first Arabian Islamic missionary reached the Sulu Archipelago and Jolo in the Philippines and established Islam in the country. In 1390, the Minangkabau's Prince Rajah Baguinda and his followers preached Islam on the islands. The Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque was the first mosque established in the Philippines on Simunul in Mindanao in the 14th century. Subsequent settlements by Arab missionaries traveling to Malaysia and Indonesia helped strengthen Islam in the Philippines and each settlement was governed by a Datu, Rajah, and a Sultan. Islamic provinces founded in the Philippines included the Sultanate of Maguindanao, Sultanate of Sulu, and other parts of the southern Philippines. Modern missionary work in the United States has increased greatly in the last one hundred years, with much of the recent demographic growth driven by conversion.A NATION CHALLENGED: AMERICAN MUSLIMS; Islam Attracts Converts By the Thousand, Drawn Before and After Attacks Up to one-third of American Muslims are African Americans who have converted to Islam during the last seventy years. Conversion to Islam in prisons,http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=960&wit;_id=2719 and in large urban areasRanks of Latinos Turning to Islam Are Increasing; Many in City Were Catholics Seeking Old Muslim Roots has also contributed to Islam's growth over the years. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries. Ain al-Yaqeen, a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers. Ahmadiyya Islam missions Jamia Ahmadiyya, Ghana Missionaries belonging to the Ahmadiyya thought of Islam often study at International Islamic seminaries and educational institutions, known as Jamia Ahmadiyya. Upon completion of their degrees, they are sent to various parts of the world including South America, Africa, North America, Europe, and the Far East as appointed by Mirza Masroor Ahmad, present head and Caliph of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim community. Jamia students may be appointed by the Caliph either as Missionaries of the community (often called Murrabi, Imam, or Mawlana) or as Qadis or Muftis of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community with a specialisation in matters of fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence). Some Jamia alumni have also become Islamic historians such as the late Dost Muhammad Shahid, former Official Historian of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, with a specialisation in tarikh (Islamic historiography). Missionaries stay with their careers as appointed by the Caliph for the rest of their lives, as per their commitment to the community. Early Islamic missionaries during Muhammad's era During the Expedition of Al Raji in 625,Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 187. (online) the Islamic Prophet Muhammad sent some men as missionaries to various different tribes. Some men came to Muhammad and requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan (Chief of the Banu Lahyan tribe) by Muhammad's followers (online) 8 Muslim Missionaires were killed in this expedition., another version says 10 Muslims were killedNote: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available here Then during the Expedition of Bir Maona in July 625 Muhammad sent some Missionaries at request of some men from the Banu Amir tribe,Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 188. (online) but the Muslims were again killed as revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers 70 Muslims were killed during this expedition During the Expedition of Khalid ibn al-Walid (Banu Jadhimah) in January 630, Muhammad sent Khalid ibn Walid to invite the Banu Jadhimah tribe to Islam.William Muir, The life of Mahomet and history of Islam to the era of the Hegira, Volume 4, p. 135. This is mentioned in the Sunni Hadith .Muhsin Khan, The translation of the meanings of ·π¢ahih AL- Bukhari, Arabic-English, Volume 5, p. 440. = Missionaries and Judaism = Jewish \\"Missionary Activity\\" (a phrase not used within Judaism) is often misunderstood by many. Judaism has never been a faith that seeks converts, because Judaism doesn't believe 'one must be Jewish to inherit everlasting life'. Jewish theology of the afterlife, reincarnation, Kingdom Age, Messiah, hell, heaven and even sin- are all understood very differently than other faiths. Judaism understands the one true God to currently have covenantal relationships with both Jew and non-Jews. Jews, they believe, are under The Covenant of Moses- and is binding on all Jews until the Moshiach (Messiah) appears in Jerusalem, and will bring shalom/peace to all humankind. Non-Jews (Gentiles, goyim, Children of The Nations) are under The Covenant of Noah- and is binding on all Nations until Moshiach (Messiah) gathers all humankind together. The Laws of Noah are the Seven Laws given to Noah once he and the other humans and animals \\"were saved from the wrath of the flood\\". In The Bible, any \\"Missionary Activity\\" done by Jews to non-Jews was Jewish endeavors to bring pagan Nations into Covenant with God through Noah. Even non-Jewish prophets (such as Jonah) were sent out as Non-Jews to Non-Jews with the Noahide Covenant. This was in Biblical times, and contemporary Judaism remains clearly that missionary activities (to convert The Nations to Judaism) are taboo. Historically, various Judaic sects and movements have been consistent on avoiding proselytization to convert Gentiles. Today, Chabad Lubabvitch, a major player within Orthodox Judaism, has regained Jewish support for spreading The Covenant of Noah to All Nations with webpages geared to teaching Gentiles how to follow Noah, workshops led by Rabbis, and even opening actual congregations under The Noahide Covenant banner (Noahidic Congregation of Toronto, for example). Aish HaTorah, another Orthodox 'denomination', also has an entire division set up to preach The Laws of Torah to ALL Non-Jews. Some Jewish people even carry little 'Evangelical-style' tracts with them to give away to Non-Jews who ask them about Judaism. Jewish religious groups encourage \\"Outreach\\" to Jews. The outreach, or kiruv, movements encourage Jews to become more knowledgeable and observant of Jewish law. People who become more observant are known as baalei teshuva. \\"Outreach\\" is done worldwide, by organizations such as Chabad Lubavitch, Aish Hatorah, Ohr Somayach, and Partners In Torah. There are also many such organizations in the United States. There has been a singular, isolated movement to convert Catholics to Judaism in Peru. Members of the very liberal American Reform movement began a program to convert to their liberal brand of Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who have an interest in Reform Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during the Holocaust that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by Orthodox and Conservative JewsMissionary#cite note-39 as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices. =Baha'i pioneering= =Buddhist missions= Buddhist proselytism at the time of king Ashoka (260‚Äì218 BCE), according to his Edicts Central Asian Buddhist monk teaching a Chinese monk.

The first Buddhist missionaries were called \\"Dharma Bhanaks\\", and some see a missionary charge in the symbolism behind the Buddhist wheel, which is said to travel all over the earth bringing Buddhism with it. The Emperor Ashoka was a significant early Buddhist missioner. In the 3rd century BCE, Dharmaraksita‚Äîamong others‚Äîwas sent out by emperor Ashoka to proselytize the Buddhist tradition through the Indian Maurya Empire, but also into the Mediterranean as far as Greece. Gradually, all India and the neighboring island of Ceylon were converted. Then Buddhism spread eastward and southeastward to the present lands of Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.Welty, Paul Thomas. The Asians: Their Heritage and Their Destiny (Revised Edition). Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. (1966); pg. 77. Buddhism was spread among the Turkic people during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE into modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. It was also taken into China brought by Kasyapa Matanga in the 2nd century CE, Lokaksema and An Shigao translated Buddhist sutras into Chinese. Dharmarak·π£a was one of the greatest translators of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Dharmaraksa came to the Chinese capital of Luoyang in 266 CE, where he made the first known translations of the Lotus Sutra and the Dasabhumika Sutra, which were to become some of the classic texts of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Altogether, Dharmaraksa translated around 154 Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras, representing most of the important texts of Buddhism available in the Western Regions. His proselytizing is said to have converted many to Buddhism in China, and made Chang'an, present-day Xi'an, a major center of Buddhism. Buddhism expanded rapidly, especially among the common people, and by 381 most of the people of northwest China were Buddhist. Winning converts also among the rulers and scholars, by the end of the T'ang Dynasty Buddhism was found everywhere in China.Welty, Paul Thomas. The Asians: Their Heritage and Their Destiny (Revised Edition). Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. (1966); pg. 146‚Äì147. Marananta brought Buddhism to the Korean Peninsula in the 4th century. Seong of Baekje, known as a great patron of Buddhism in Korea, built many temples and welcomed priests bringing Buddhist texts directly from India. In 528, Baekje officially adopted Buddhism as its state religion. He sent tribute missions to Liang in 534 and 541, on the second occasion requesting artisans as well as various Buddhist works and a teacher. According to Chinese records, all these requests were granted. A subsequent mission was sent in 549, only to find the Liang capital in the hands of the rebel Hou Jing, who threw them in prison for lamenting the fall of the capital. He is credited with having sent a mission in 538 to Japan that brought an image of Shakyamuni and several sutras to the Japanese court. This has traditionally been considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. An account of this is given in Gang≈çji Garan Engi. First supported by the Soga clan, Buddhism rose over the objections of the pro-Shinto MononobeCrim, Keith (ed.). The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions. San Francisco: Harper Collins (1989).

When in 710 Emperor Shomu established a new capital at Nara modeled after the capital of China, Buddhism received official support and began to flourish. Padmasambhava, The Lotus Born, was a sage guru from O·∏ç·∏çiyƒÅna who is said to have transmitted Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan and Tibet and neighbouring countries in the 8th century. The use of missions, councils, and monastic institutions influenced the emergence of Christian missions and organizations, which developed similar structures in places that were formerly Buddhist missions.http://www.sats.edu.za/userfiles/Final%20Thesis%20Joseph%20Paul%20Charles.pdf During the 19th and 20th centuries, Western intellectuals such as Schopenhauer, Henry David Thoreau, Max M√ºller, and esoteric societies such as the Theosophical Society of H.P. Blavatsky and the Buddhist Society, London spread interest in Buddhism. Writers such as Hermann Hesse and Jack Kerouac, in the West, and the hippie generation of the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a re-discovery of Buddhism. During the 20th and 21st centuries Buddhism has again been propagated by missionaries into the West such as the Dalai Lama and monks including Lama Surya Das (Tibetan Buddhism). Tibetan Buddhism has been significantly active and successful in the West since the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Today Buddhists make a decent proportion of several countries in the West such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, France, and the United States. In Canada, the immense popularity and goodwill ushered in by Tibet's Dalai Lama (who has been made honorary Canadian citizen) put Buddhism in a favourable light in the country. Many non-Asian Canadians embraced Buddhism in various traditions and some have become leaders in their respective sanghas. In the early 1990s, the French Buddhist Union (UBF, founded in 1986) estimated that there are 600,000 to 650,000 Buddhists in France, with 150,000 French converts among them. In 1999, sociologist Fr√©d√©ric Lenoir estimated there are 10,000 converts and up to 5 million \\"sympathizers\\", although other researchers have questioned these numbers.Lenoir, Fr√©d√©ric. Le bouddhisme en France. Paris: Fayard, 1999. Taisen Deshimaru was a Japanese Zen Buddhist who founded numerous zendos in France. Thich Nhat Hanh, a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated, Vietnamese-born Zen Buddhist, founded the Unified Buddhist Church (Eglise Bouddhique Unifi√©e) in France in 1969. The Plum Village Monastery in the Dordogne in southern France was his residence and the headquarters of his international sangha.

Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist leader in the world is Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of Tibet, he has become a popular cause c√©l√®bre. His early life was depicted in Hollywood films such as Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. He has attracted celebrity religious followers such as Richard Gere and Adam Yauch. The first Western- born Tibetan Buddhist monk was Robert A. F. Thurman, now an academic supporter of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama maintains a North American headquarters at Namgyal Monastery in Ithaca, New York. Lewis M. Hopfe in his \\"Religions of the World\\" suggested that \\"Buddhism is perhaps on the verge of another great missionary outreach\\" (1987:170). =Hindu missions= Hinduism was introduced into Java by travelers from India in ancient times. When the early Javanese princes accepted Hinduism, they did not give up all of their early animistic beliefs‚Äîthey simply combined the new ideas with them. Several centuries ago, many Hindus left Java for Bali rather than convert to Islam. Hinduism has survived in Bali ever since.Hintz, Martin. Indonesia (series: Enchantment of the World). Chicago: Childrens Press (1993), pg. 30‚Äì31. Dang Hyang Nirartha was responsible for facilitating a refashioning of Balinese Hinduism. He was an important promoter of the idea of moksha in Indonesia. He founded the Shaivite priesthood that is now ubiquitous in Bali, and is now regarded as the ancestor of all Shaivite pandits.Pringle, p 65 Shantidas Adhikari was a Hindu preacher from Sylhet who converted King Pamheiba of Manipur to Hinduism in 1717.Foundation of Manipuri Muslim History Manipur Online ‚Äì August 15, 2002 Historically, Hinduism has only recently had a large influence in western countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Canada.

Many native-born Canadians of various ethnicities have converted during the last 50 years through the actions of the Ramakrishna Mission, ISKCON, Arya Samaj and other missionary organizations as well as due to the visits and guidance of Indian gurus such as Guru Maharaj, Sai Baba, and Rajneesh. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has a presence in New Zealand, running temples in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch.

In doing so they have retained, to a high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity. Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. However, they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.Sikhs. Adherents.com (2005-09-30).

The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions. San Francisco: Harper Collins (1989). Reprint; originally pub. as Abingdon Dictionary of Living Religions, 1981; pg. 370. For some two centuries the Jains remained a small community of monks and followers. However, in the 4th century BCE, they gained strength and spread from Bihar to Orissa, then so South India and westwards to Gujarat and the Punjab, where Jain communities became firmly established, particularly among the mercantile classes.Cavendish, Richard (ed.). Man, Myth & Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (vol. 11). New York: Marshall Cavendish Corp. (1970); pg. 1481. The period of the Mauryan Dynasty to the 12th century was the period of Jainism's greatest growth and influence. Thereafter, the Jainas in the South and Central regions lost ground in face of rising Hindu devotional movements. Jainism retreated to the West and Northwest, which have remained its stronghold to the present.Crim, Keith (ed.). The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions. San Francisco: Harper Collins (1989). Reprint; originally pub. as Abingdon Dictionary of Living Religions, 1981; pg. 371. Emperor Samprati is regarded as the \\"Jain Ashoka\\" for his patronage and efforts to spreading Jainism in east India. Samprati, according to Jain historians, is considered more powerful and famous than Ashoka himself. Samprati built thousands of Jain Temples in India, many of which remain in use, such as the Jain temples at Viramgam and Palitana (Gujarat), Agar Malwa (Ujjain). Within three and a half years, he got one hundred and twenty-five thousand new temples built, thirty-six thousand repaired, twelve and a half million murtis, holy statues, consecrated and ninety-five thousand metal murtis prepared. Samprati is said to have erected Jain temples throughout his empire. He founded Jain monasteries even in non- Aryan territory, and almost all ancient Jain temples or monuments of unknown origin are popularly attributed to him. It may be noted that all the Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, with unknown builders are also attributed to Emperor Samprati. Virachand Gandhi (1864‚Äì1901) from Mahuva represented Jains at the first Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 and won a silver medal. Gandhi was most likely the first Jain and the first Gujarati to travel to the United States, and his statue still stands at the Jain temple in Chicago. In his time he was a world-famous personality. Gandhi represented Jains in Chicago because the Great Jain Saint Param Pujya Acharya Vijayanandsuri, also known as Acharya Atmaram, was invited to represent the Jain religion at the first World Parliament of Religions. As Jain monks do not travel overseas, he recommended the bright young scholar Virchand Gandhi to be the emissary for the religion. Today there are 100,000 Jains in the United States.McCourt, Frank. \\"God in America \\" in Life (December 1998); pg. 67. There are also tens of thousands of Jains located in the UK and Canada. =Ananda Marga missions= ƒÄnanda MƒÅrga, organizationally known as ƒÄnanda MƒÅrga Pracaraka Samgha (AMPS), meaning the samgha (organization) for the propagation of the marga (path) of ananda (bliss), is a social and spiritual movement founded in Jamalpur, Bihar, India, in 1955 by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (1921‚Äì1990), also known by his spiritual name,According with many Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, master and disciples often have a spiritual name in addition to that given to them by their parents.

Documented cases of European contact with isolated tribes has shown rapid health deterioration, but this is not specifically linked to missionaries.Is It Ethical to Leave Uncontacted Tribes Alone?, Time (magazine), 4 June 2015. The Indian government has been criticised for opening up previously secluded islands to tourism and missionaries. Missionary thinkers have recognised complicity between colonialism and missions during the colonial period, with roots in 'colonial paternalism'.http://www.bu.edu/cgcm/files/2009/09/101015dldanarobertpaper.pdf Some kinds of missionary activity have come under criticism, including concerns about a perceived lack of respect for other cultures. Potential destruction of social structure among the converts has also been a concern. The Huaorani people of Amazonian Ecuador have had a well-documented mixed relation with Evangelical Christian missionaries and the contacts they brought to their communities, criticized by outsiders. Impact of missions A 2012 study by political scientist Robert Woodberry, focusing on Protestant missionaries, found that they have often left a very positive societal impact in the areas where they worked. \\"In cross-national statistical analysis Protestant missions are significantly and robustly associated with higher levels of printing, education, economic development, organizational civil society, protection of private property, and rule of law and with lower levels of corruption\\".Robert D. Woodberry, ‚ÄúThe Missionary Roots of Liberal Democracy.‚Äù American Political Science Review (2012) 106#2: 244-274. online A 2017 study found that areas of colonial Mexico that had Mendicant missions have higher rates of literacy and educational attainment today than regions that did not have missions. Areas that had Jesuit missions are today indistinct from the areas that had no missions. The study also found that \\"the share of Catholics is higher in regions where Catholic missions of any kind were a historical present.\\" A 2016 study found that regions in Sub-Saharan Africa that Protestant missionaries brought printing presses to are today \\"associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation.\\" Missionaries have also made significant contributions to linguistics and the description and documentation of many languages. \\"Many languages today exist only in missionary records. More than anywhere else, our knowledge of the native languages in South America has been the product of missionary activity‚Ä¶ Without missionary documentation the reclamation [of several languages] would have been completely impossible\\"p. 223, 224.

The program focused on the creation of machine- readable representations for the Web. One of the Investigators working on the program was Tim Berners-Lee. Through his influence, working with the program managers, the effort worked to create technologies and demonstrations for what is now called the Semantic Web, leading in turn to the growth of knowledge graph technology. A primary outcome of the DAML program was the DAML language, an agent markup language based on RDF. This language was followed by an extension entitled DAML+OIL which included researchers outside of the DARPA program in the design. The 2002 submission of the DAML+OIL language to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) captures the work done by DAML contractors and the EU/U.S. ad hoc Joint Committee on Markup Languages. This submission was the starting point for the language (later called OWL) to be developed by W3C's web ontology working group, WebOnt. DAML+OIL was a syntax, layered on RDF and XML, that could be used to describe sets of facts making up an ontology. DAML+OIL had its roots in three main languages - DAML, as described above, OIL (Ontology Inference Layer) and SHOE, an earlier US research project. A major innovation of the languages was to use RDF and XML for a basis, and to use RDF namespaces to organize and assist with the integration of arbitrarily many different and incompatible ontologies. Articulation ontologies can link these competing ontologies through codification of analogous subsets in a neutral point of view, as is done in the Wikipedia. Current ontology research derived in part from DAML is leading toward the expression of ontologies and rules for reasoning and action.

The community of , with a population of 47,743 in 2010, is the county seat of surrounding Galveston County and second-largest municipality in the county. It is also within the Houston‚ÄìThe Woodlands‚ÄìSugar Land metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Galveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: Bernardo de G√°lvez y Madrid, Count of G√°lvez (1746‚Äì1786), who was born in Macharaviaya, M√°laga, in the Kingdom of Spain. Galveston's first European settlements on the Galveston Island were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight for independence from Spain, along with other colonies in the Western Hemisphere of the Americas in Central and South America in the 1810s and 1820s. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the Republic of Texas. During the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest ports in the United States. It was for a time Texas' largest city, known as the \\"Queen City of the Gulf\\". It was devastated by the unexpected Galveston Hurricane of 1900, whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the Prohibition era of 1919‚Äì1933 as a leading tourist hub and a center of illegal gambling, nicknamed the Free State of Galveston until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development. Much of Galveston's economy is centered in the tourism, health care, shipping, and financial industries. The University of Texas Medical Branch campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six historic districts containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of 19th-century buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the National Park Service in the United States Department of the Interior. History =Exploration and 19th-century development= Plan of the City of Galveston (c. 1845)Map of City of Galveston (c. 1904) Indigenous inhabitants of Galveston Island called the island Auia. Though there is no certainty regarding their route and their landings, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked at a place he called \\"Isla de Malhado\\" in November 1528. This could have referred to Galveston Island or San Luis Island. During his charting of the Gulf Coast in 1785, the Spanish explorer Jos√© de Evia labeled the water features surrounding the island \\"Bd. de Galvestown\\" and \\"Bahia de Galvestowm\\" [sic]. He was working under the orders of Bernardo de G√°lvez. In his early chart, he calls the western end of the island \\"Isla de San Luis\\" and the eastern end, \\"Pt. de Culebras.\\" Evia did not label the island itself on his map of 1799. Just five years later Alexander von Humboldt borrows the place names Isla de San Luis, Pte. De Culebras, and Bahia de Galveston. Stephen F. Austin followed his predecessors in the use of \\"San Luis Island,\\" but introduced \\"Galveston\\" to refer to the little village at the east end of the island. Evidence of the name Galveston Island appears on the 1833 David H. Burr. The island's first permanent European settlements were constructed around 1816 by the pirate Louis-Michel Aury to support Mexico's rebellion against Spain. In 1817, Aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against Spain to find Galveston occupied by the pirate Jean Lafitte. Lafitte organized Galveston into a pirate \\"kingdom\\" he called \\"Campeche\\", anointing himself the island's \\"head of government.\\" Lafitte remained in Galveston until 1821, when the United States Navy forced him and his raiders off the island. In 1825 the Congress of Mexico established the Port of Galveston and in 1830 erected a customs house. Galveston served as the capital of the Republic of Texas when in 1836 the interim president David G. Burnet relocated his government there. In 1836, the French-Canadian Michel Branamour Menard and several associates purchased of land for $50,000 to found the town that would become the modern city of Galveston. As Anglo-Americans migrated to the city, they brought along or purchased enslaved African-Americans, some of whom worked domestically or on the waterfront, including on riverboats. In 1839, the City of Galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas. The city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of German immigrants to Texas, including Jewish merchants.\\"Galveston, Texas\\" , Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities Together with ethnic Mexican residents, these groups tended to oppose slavery, support the Union during the Civil War, and join the Republican Party after the war. During this expansion, the city had many \\"firsts\\" in the state, with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions: post office (1836), naval base (1836), Texas chapter of a Masonic order (1840); cotton compress (1842), Catholic parochial school (Ursuline Academy) (1847), insurance company (1854), and gas lights (1856). During the American Civil War, Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city in January 1863 in the Battle of Galveston. In 1867 Galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic; 1800 people died in the city. These occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century, as did cholera epidemics. The Beach Hotel catered to vacationers until a fire in 1898. The city's progress continued through the Reconstruction era with numerous \\"firsts\\": construction of the opera house (1870), and orphanage (1876), and installation of telephone lines (1878) and electric lights (1883). Having attracted freedmen from rural areas, in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 3,000,Hales (2003), Southern Family in White and Black, p. 15 made up mostly of former slaves but also by persons who were free men of color and educated before the war. Blacks comprised nearly 25% of the city's population of 13,818 that year.US 1870 Census During the post‚ÄìCivil War period, leaders such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas Republican Party and promoted civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry. By the end of the 19th century, the city of Galveston had a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas. It was one of the nation's largest cotton ports, in competition with New Orleans. Throughout the 19th century, the port city of Galveston grew rapidly and the Strand was considered the region's primary business center. For a time, the Strand was known as the \\"Wall Street of the South\\". In the late 1890s, the government constructed Fort Crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads. In February 1897, the (nicknamed Old Hoodoo), the first commissioned battleship of the United States Navy, visited Galveston. During the festivities, the ship's officers were presented with a $5,000 silver service, adorned with various Texas motifs, as a gift from the state's citizens. =Hurricane of 1900 and recovery= Memorial marker along the Strand Historic District indicating a building that survived the 1900 hurricane On September 8, 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. This event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster. The city was devastated, and an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 people on the island were killed. Following the storm, a long, high seawall was built to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surges. A team of engineers including Henry Martyn Robert (Robert's Rules of Order) designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained. Sunset Route, Seawall, Galveston, Texas (postcard, c. 1907) The city developed the city commission form of city government, known as the \\"Galveston Plan\\", to help expedite recovery. Despite attempts to draw investment to the city after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by the construction of the Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. Finally, the Seawall itself created an insurmountable problem: passive erosion resulting in the gradual disappearance of the once-wide beach and the resort business with it. \\"Within twenty years, the city had lost one hundred yards of sand. People who once watched auto racing on a wide beach were left with a narrow strip of sand at low tide and a gloomy vista of waves on rocks when the tide was high.\\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dean-tide.html To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period.Hardwick (2002), p. 13 This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S. Though the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston developed as the region's principal metropolis, Galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries. In 1905 William Lewis Moody, Jr. and Isaac H. Kempner, members of two of Galveston's leading families founded the American National Insurance Company. Two years later, Moody established the City National Bank, which would become the Moody National Bank. During the 1920s and 1930s, the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination. Under the influence of Sam Maceo and Rosario Maceo, the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the Balinese Room, which offered entertainment to wealthy Houstonians and other out-of-towners. Combined with prostitution, which had existed in the city since the Civil War, Galveston became known as the \\"sin city\\" of the Gulf. Galvestonians accepted and supported the illegal activities, often referring to their island as the \\"Free State of Galveston\\". The island had entered what would later become known as the \\"open era\\". The 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the Island City. During World War II, the Galveston Municipal Airport, predecessor to Scholes International Airport, was re-designated a U.S. Army Air Corps base and named \\"Galveston Army Air Field\\". In January 1943, Galveston Army Air Field was officially activated with the 46th Bombardment Group serving an anti-submarine role in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1942, William Lewis Moody, Jr., along with his wife Libbie Shearn Rice Moody, established the Moody Foundation, to benefit \\"present and future generations of Texans.\\" The foundation, one of the largest in the United States, would play a prominent role in Galveston during later decades, helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs. =After World War II= The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada, as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids that disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward. Expensive Stilt Houses on Galveston's East Beach Downtown Galveston as viewed from the air Playing chess on the Strand In 1947, buildings in the city were damaged when a ship carrying 2,200 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded at the nearby Port of Texas City, in what became known as the Texas City disaster. The island's economy began a long stagnation. Many businesses relocated off the island during this period, but health care, insurance, and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy. By 1959, the city of Houston had long outpaced Galveston in population and economic growth. Beginning in 1957, the Galveston Historical Foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings. The 1966 book The Galveston That Was helped encourage the preservation movement. Restoration efforts financed by motivated investors, notably Houston businessman George P. Mitchell, gradually developed the Strand Historic District and reinvented other areas. A new, family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years. In September 1961, Hurricane Carla struck the city, generating an F4 tornado that killed eight and injured 200. With the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in Galveston. Already home to the University of Texas Medical Branch, the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the Texas Maritime Academy, predecessor of Texas A&M; University at Galveston; and by 1967, a community college, Galveston College, had been established. In the 2000s, property values rose after expensive projects were completed,Novak, Shonda Growth Wave Hits Galveston.\\" Austin American- Statesman. Saturday July 22, 2006. and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased. It has made it difficult for middle-class workers to find affordable housing on the island. Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island in the early morning of September 13, 2008, as a category-2 hurricane with winds of 110 miles per hour. Damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall. After the storm, the island was rebuilt with investments in tourism and shipping, and continued emphasis on higher education and health care, notably the addition of the Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier and the replacement of the bascule-type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical-lift-type drawbridge to allow heavier freight. Geography Galveston, from the International Space Station Salt marsh near Galveston The city of Galveston is situated on Galveston Island, a barrier island off the Texas Gulf coast near the mainland coast. Made up of mostly sand-sized particles and smaller amounts of finer mud sediments and larger gravel-sized sediments, the island is unstable, affected by water and weather, and can shift its boundaries through erosion. The city is about southeast of downtown Houston. The island is oriented generally northeast-southwest, with the Gulf of Mexico on the east and south, West Bay on the west, and Galveston Bay on the north. The island's main access point from the mainland is the Interstate Highway 45 causeway that crosses West Bay on the island's northeast side. A deepwater channel connects Galveston's harbor with the Gulf and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which are land and , or 80.31%, are water. The island is southeast of Houston.Woodhams, Susie. \\"After Ike, a deluge of reinvention .\\" Boston Globe. June 5, 2011. Retrieved on June 6, 2011. The western portion of Galveston is referred to as the \\"West End\\". Communities in eastern Galveston include Lake Madeline, Offats Bayou, Central City, Fort Crockett, Bayou Shore, Lasker Park, Carver Park, Kempner Park, Old City/Central Business District, San Jacinto, East End, and Lindale. As of 2009 many residents of the west end use golf carts as transportation to take them to and from residential houses, the Galveston Island Country Club, and stores. In 2009, Chief of Police Charles Wiley said he believed golf carts should be prohibited outside golf courses, and West End residents campaigned against any ban on their use.Jones, Leigh. \\"Council to consider golf cart committee.\\" Galveston County Daily News. November 9, 2009. Retrieved on June 11, 2012. In 2011 Rice University released a study, \\"Atlas of Sustainable Strategies for Galveston Island,\\" which argued the West End of Galveston was quickly eroding and the city should reduce construction and/or population in that area. It recommended against any rebuilding of the West End in the event of damage from another hurricane.Rice, Harvey. \\"Galveston Island gets tough advice from Rice study\\" , Houston Chronicle, October 26, 2011, Retrieved on October 24, 2012 =Historic districts= Galveston has many restored Victorian homes Galveston is home to six historic districts with over 60 structures listed representing architectural significance in the National Register of Historic Places. The Silk Stocking National Historic District, between Broadway and Seawall Boulevard and bounded by Ave. K, 23rd St., Ave. P, and 26th St., contains a collection of historic homes constructed from the Civil War through World War II. The East End Historic District on both sides of Broadway and Market Streets, contains 463 buildings. Other historic districts include Cedar Lawn, Denver Court and Fort Travis. The Strand National Historic Landmark District is a National Historic Landmark District of mainly Victorian era buildings that have been adapted for use as restaurants, antique stores, historical exhibits, museums and art galleries. The area is a major tourist attraction for the island city. It is the center for two very popular seasonal festivals. It is widely considered the island's shopping and entertainment center. Today, \\"the Strand\\" is generally used to refer to the five-block business district between 20th and 25th streets in downtown Galveston, near the city's wharf. =Oleander City= The first Oleander in Galveston, planted in 1841 Since the early 20th century, Galveston has been popularly known as the 'Oleander City' because of a long history of cultivating Nerium oleander, a subtropical evergreen shrub which thrives on the island. Oleanders are a defining feature of the city; when flowering (between April and October) they add masses of color to local gardens, parks, and streets. Thousands were planted in the recovery following the Hurricane of 1900 and Galvestonians continue to treasure the plant for its low water needs, tolerance of heat, salt spray and sandy soils. This makes them especially resistant to the after-effects of hurricanes and tropical storms. Galveston is reputed to have the most diverse range of Oleander cultivars in the world, numbering over 100, with many varieties developed in the city and named after prominent Galvestonians. In 2005 the month of May was declared \\"Oleander Month\\" by the City of Galveston and there are also Oleander-themed tours of the city exploring the history of the plant on the island. Since 1967 the International Oleander Society has operated in Galveston, which promotes the cultivation of the plant, organizes an Oleander festival every spring and maintains a commemorative Oleander garden in the city. =Architecture= The Galvez Hotel Ashton Villa Galveston contains a large and historically significant collection of 19th-century buildings in the United States. Galveston's architectural preservation and revitalization efforts over several decades have earned national recognition. Located in the Strand District, the Grand 1894 Opera House is a restored historic Romanesque Revival style Opera House that is currently operated as a not-for-profit performing arts theater. The Bishop's Palace, also known as Gresham's Castle, is an ornate Victorian house located on Broadway and 14th Street in the East End Historic District of Galveston, Texas. The American Institute of Architects listed Bishop's Palace as one of the 100 most significant buildings in the United States, and the Library of Congress has classified it as one of the fourteen most representative Victorian structures in the nation. The Galvez Hotel is a historic hotel that opened in 1911.Carmack, Liz. Historic Hotels of Texas , Texas A&M; University Press: College Station, Texas, 2007. pp. 47‚Äì49. The building was named the Galvez, honoring Bernardo de G√°lvez y Madrid, Count of G√°lvez, for whom the city was named. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 4, 1979. The Michel B. Menard House, built in 1838 and the oldest surviving structure in Galveston, is designed in the Greek revival style. In 1880, the house was bought by Edwin N. Ketchum who was police chief of the city during the 1900 Storm. The Ketchum family owned the home until the 1970s. Ashton Villa, a red-brick Victorian Italianate home, was constructed in 1859 by James Moreau Brown. One of the first brick structures in Texas, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The structure is also the site of what was to become the holiday known as Juneteenth, where on June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger, standing on its balcony, read the contents of \\"General Order No. 3\\", thereby emancipating all slaves in the state of Texas. St. Joseph's Church was built by German immigrants in 1859‚Äì1860 and is the oldest wooden church building in Galveston and the oldest German Catholic Church in Texas. The church was dedicated in April 1860, to St. Joseph, the patron saint of laborers. The building is a wooden gothic revival structure, rectangular with a square bell tower with trefoil window. The U.S. Custom House began construction in 1860 and was completed in 1861. The Confederate Army occupied the building during the American Civil War, In 1865, the Custom House was the site of the ceremony officially ending the Civil War. Galveston's modern architecture include the American National Insurance Company Tower (One Moody Plaza), San Luis Resort South and North Towers, The Breakers Condominiums, The Galvestonian Resort and Condos, One Shearn Moody Plaza, US National Bank Building, the Rainforest Pyramid at Moody Gardens, John Sealy Hospital Towers at UTMB and Medical Arts Building (also known as Two Moody Plaza). =Climate= Galveston's climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in K√∂ppen climate classification system), and is part of USDA Plant hardiness zone 9b. Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.

Hurricanes are an ever-present threat during the summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are generally at the greatest risk among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge. ;Notes: Demographics The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city of Galveston had a population of 50,446 in 2019, a 5.7% increase from the 2010 census.

Infrastructure =Healthcare= Galveston is the home of several of the largest teaching hospitals in the state, located on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Prior to Hurricane Ike, the University employed more than 12,000 people. Its significant growth in the 1970s and 1980s was attributable to a uniquely qualified management and medical faculty including: Mr. John Thompson; Dr. William James McGanity, Dr. William Levin, Dr. David Daeschner and many more. Ike severely damaged the 550-bed John Sealy Hospital causing the University of Texas System Board of Regents to cut nearly one-third of the hospital staff. Since the storm, the regents have committed to spending $713 million to restore the campus, construct new medical towers, and return John Sealy Hospital to its 550-bed pre-storm capacity. In 2011, the UT Board of Regents approved the construction of a new 13 story hospital that will be located next to John Sealy Hospital. Construction will begin in the fall of 2011, with the demolition of the old Jennie Sealy and Shriners hospitals, and continue until completion in 2016. The facility will have 250 room, 20 operating suites and 54 intensive care beds. When the new hospital is complete, along with the renovations at John Sealy, both complexes will have around 600 beds. The university reopened their Level I Trauma Center on August 1, 2009, which had been closed for eleven months after the hurricane and, , had reopened 370 hospital beds. The city is also home to a 30-bed acute burns hospital for children, the Shriners Burns Hospital at Galveston. The Galveston hospital is one of only four in the chain of 22 non-profit Shriners hospitals, that provides acute burns care. Although the Galveston Hospital was damaged by Hurricane Ike, the Shriners national convention held in July 2009 voted to repair and reopen the hospital. =Fire department= The Galveston Fire Department provides fire protection services through six fire stations and 17 pieces of apparatus.\\"Fire Department .\\" City of Galveston.

Groesbeck surveyed and mapped the town in 1837 and 1838 on behalf of the Galveston City Company. A new Galveston resident most recently from New York City, he laid out the streets based on a gridiron, and named the east‚Äìwest avenues according to letters of the alphabet, with Avenue A running along the back bay on the north side of the island. He assigned numbers to names of north‚Äìsouth streets, with First Street on the far eastern side of the grid, and the numbered street names increased as they progressed westward. The names of some of the avenues changed over the years. Most notably, Avenue B became known as The Strand, and Avenue J became known as Broadway, a major thoroughfare which runs from the Interstate-45 viaduct to Seawall Boulevard. Interstate 45 has a southern terminus in Galveston and serves as a main artery to Galveston from mainland Galveston County and Houston. Farm to Market Road 3005 (locally called Seawall Boulevard) connects Galveston to Brazoria County via the San Luis Pass-Vacek Toll Bridge. State Highway 87, known locally as Broadway Street, connects the island to the Bolivar Peninsula via the Bolivar Ferry.

It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats. It is also used in knowledge management applications. RDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation in 1999. The RDF 1.0 specification was published in 2004, the RDF 1.1 specification in 2014.  Overview  The RDF data model is similar to classical conceptual modeling approaches (such as entity‚Äìrelationship or class diagrams). It is based on the idea of making statements about resources (in particular web resources) in expressions of the form subject‚Äìpredicate‚Äìobject, known as triples. The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object. For example, one way to represent the notion \\"The sky has the color blue\\" in RDF is as the triple: a subject denoting \\"the sky\\", a predicate denoting \\"has the color\\", and an object denoting \\"blue\\". Therefore, RDF uses subject instead of object (or entity) in contrast to the typical approach of an entity‚Äìattribute‚Äìvalue model in object-oriented design: entity (sky), attribute (color), and value (blue). RDF is an abstract model with several serialization formats (i.e. file formats), so the particular encoding for resources or triples varies from format to format. This mechanism for describing resources is a major component in the W3C's Semantic Web activity: an evolutionary stage of the World Wide Web in which automated software can store, exchange, and use machine-readable information distributed throughout the Web, in turn enabling users to deal with the information with greater efficiency and certainty. RDF's simple data model and ability to model disparate, abstract concepts has also led to its increasing use in knowledge management applications unrelated to Semantic Web activity. A collection of RDF statements intrinsically represents a labeled, directed multi-graph. This in theory makes an RDF data model better suited to certain kinds of knowledge representation than are other relational or ontological models. However, in practice, RDF data is often stored in relational database or native representations (also called Triplestores‚Äîor Quad stores, if context such as the named graph is also stored for each RDF triple).Optimized Index Structures for Querying RDF from the Web Andreas Harth, Stefan Decker, 3rd Latin American Web Congress, Buenos Aires, Argentina, October 31 to November 2, 2005, pp. 71‚Äì80 As RDFS and OWL demonstrate, one can build additional ontology languages upon RDF.  History  The initial RDF design, intended to \\"build a vendor- neutral and operating system-independent system of metadata,\\" derived from the W3C's Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), an early web content labelling system, but the project was also shaped by ideas from Dublin Core, and from the Meta Content Framework (MCF), which had been developed during 1995‚Äì1997 by Ramanathan V. Guha at Apple and Tim Bray at Netscape. A first public draft of RDF appeared in October 1997, issued by a W3C working group that included representatives from IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, Nokia, Reuters, SoftQuad, and the University of Michigan. In 1999, the W3C published the first recommended RDF specification, the Model and Syntax Specification (\\"RDF M&S;\\"). This described RDF's data model and an XML serialization. Two persistent misunderstandings about RDF developed at this time: firstly, due to the MCF influence and the RDF \\"Resource Description\\" initialism, the idea that RDF was specifically for use in representing metadata; secondly that RDF was an XML format rather than a data model, and only the RDF/XML serialisation being XML-based. RDF saw little take-up in this period, but there was significant work done in Bristol, around ILRT at Bristol University and HP Labs, and in Boston at MIT. RSS 1.0 and FOAF became exemplar applications for RDF in this period. The recommendation of 1999 was replaced in 2004 by a set of six specifications: \\"The RDF Primer\\", \\"RDF Concepts and Abstract\\", \\"RDF/XML Syntax Specification (revised)\\", \\"RDF Semantics\\", \\"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0\\", and \\"The RDF Test Cases\\". This series was superseded in 2014 by the following six \\"RDF 1.1\\" documents: \\"RDF 1.1 Primer,\\" \\"RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax,\\" \\"RDF 1.1 XML Syntax,\\" \\"RDF 1.1 Semantics,\\" \\"RDF Schema 1.1,\\" and \\"RDF 1.1 Test Cases\\". RDF topics =Vocabulary= The vocabulary defined by the RDF specification is as follows: Classes = rdf = * \`rdf:XMLLiteral\` ‚Äì the class of XML literal values * \`rdf:Property\` ‚Äì the class of properties * \`rdf:Statement\` ‚Äì the class of RDF statements * \`rdf:Alt\`, \`rdf:Bag\`, \`rdf:Seq\` ‚Äì containers of alternatives, unordered containers, and ordered containers (\`rdfs:Container\` is a super-class of the three) * \`rdf:List\` ‚Äì the class of RDF Lists * \`rdf:nil\` ‚Äì an instance of \`rdf:List\` representing the empty list = rdfs = * \`rdfs:Resource\` ‚Äì the class resource, everything * \`rdfs:Literal\` ‚Äì the class of literal values, e.g. strings and integers * \`rdfs:Class\` ‚Äì the class of classes * \`rdfs:Datatype\` ‚Äì the class of RDF datatypes * \`rdfs:Container\` ‚Äì the class of RDF containers * \`rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\` ‚Äì the class of container membership properties, \`rdf:_1\`, \`rdf:_2\`, ..., all of which are sub- properties of \`rdfs:member\` Properties =rdf= * \`rdf:type\` ‚Äì an instance of \`rdf:Property\` used to state that a resource is an instance of a class * \`rdf:first\` ‚Äì the first item in the subject RDF list * \`rdf:rest\` ‚Äì the rest of the subject RDF list after \`rdf:first\` * \`rdf:value\` ‚Äì idiomatic property used for structured values * \`rdf:subject\` ‚Äì the subject of the RDF statement * \`rdf:predicate\` ‚Äì the predicate of the RDF statement * \`rdf:object\` ‚Äì the object of the RDF statement \`rdf:Statement\`, \`rdf:subject\`, \`rdf:predicate\`, \`rdf:object\` are used for reification (see below). =rdfs= * \`rdfs:subClassOf\` ‚Äì the subject is a subclass of a class * \`rdfs:subPropertyOf\` ‚Äì the subject is a subproperty of a property * \`rdfs:domain\` ‚Äì a domain of the subject property * \`rdfs:range\` ‚Äì a range of the subject property * \`rdfs:label\` ‚Äì a human-readable name for the subject * \`rdfs:comment\` ‚Äì a description of the subject resource * \`rdfs:member\` ‚Äì a member of the subject resource * \`rdfs:seeAlso\` ‚Äì further information about the subject resource * \`rdfs:isDefinedBy\` ‚Äì the definition of the subject resource This vocabulary is used as a foundation for RDF Schema, where it is extended. = Serialization formats = Several common serialization formats are in use, including: * Turtle, a compact, human-friendly format. * N-Triples, a very simple, easy-to-parse, line-based format that is not as compact as Turtle. * N-Quads, a superset of N-Triples, for serializing multiple RDF graphs. * JSON-LD, a JSON-based serialization. * N3 or Notation3, a non-standard serialization that is very similar to Turtle, but has some additional features, such as the ability to define inference rules. * RDF/XML, an XML-based syntax that was the first standard format for serializing RDF. * RDF/JSON, an alternative syntax for expressing RDF triples using a simple JSON notation. RDF/XML is sometimes misleadingly called simply RDF because it was introduced among the other W3C specifications defining RDF and it was historically the first W3C standard RDF serialization format. However, it is important to distinguish the RDF/XML format from the abstract RDF model itself. Although the RDF/XML format is still in use, other RDF serializations are now preferred by many RDF users, both because they are more human- friendly, and because some RDF graphs are not representable in RDF/XML due to restrictions on the syntax of XML QNames. With a little effort, virtually any arbitrary XML may also be interpreted as RDF using GRDDL (pronounced 'griddle'), Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages. RDF triples may be stored in a type of database called a triplestore. = Resource identification = The subject of an RDF statement is either a uniform resource identifier (URI) or a blank node, both of which denote resources. Resources indicated by blank nodes are called anonymous resources. They are not directly identifiable from the RDF statement. The predicate is a URI which also indicates a resource, representing a relationship. The object is a URI, blank node or a Unicode string literal. As of RDF 1.1 resources are identified by IRI's. IRI is a generalization of URI.RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/ In Semantic Web applications, and in relatively popular applications of RDF like RSS and FOAF (Friend of a Friend), resources tend to be represented by URIs that intentionally denote, and can be used to access, actual data on the World Wide Web. But RDF, in general, is not limited to the description of Internet-based resources. In fact, the URI that names a resource does not have to be dereferenceable at all. For example, a URI that begins with \\"http:\\" and is used as the subject of an RDF statement does not necessarily have to represent a resource that is accessible via HTTP, nor does it need to represent a tangible, network-accessible resource ‚Äî such a URI could represent absolutely anything. However, there is broad agreement that a bare URI (without a # symbol) which returns a 300-level coded response when used in an HTTP GET request should be treated as denoting the internet resource that it succeeds in accessing. Therefore, producers and consumers of RDF statements must agree on the semantics of resource identifiers. Such agreement is not inherent to RDF itself, although there are some controlled vocabularies in common use, such as Dublin Core Metadata, which is partially mapped to a URI space for use in RDF. The intent of publishing RDF-based ontologies on the Web is often to establish, or circumscribe, the intended meanings of the resource identifiers used to express data in RDF. For example, the URI: > \` http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-guide-20040210/wine#Merlot \` is intended by its owners to refer to the class of all Merlot red wines by vintner (i.e., instances of the above URI each represent the class of all wine produced by a single vintner), a definition which is expressed by the OWL ontology ‚Äî itself an RDF document ‚Äî in which it occurs. Without careful analysis of the definition, one might erroneously conclude that an instance of the above URI was something physical, instead of a type of wine. Note that this is not a 'bare' resource identifier, but is rather a URI reference, containing the '#' character and ending with a fragment identifier. = Statement reification and context = Basic RDF triple comprising (subject, predicate, object). The body of knowledge modeled by a collection of statements may be subjected to reification, in which each statement (that is each triple subject-predicate-object altogether) is assigned a URI and treated as a resource about which additional statements can be made, as in \\"Jane says that John is the author of document X\\". Reification is sometimes important in order to deduce a level of confidence or degree of usefulness for each statement. In a reified RDF database, each original statement, being a resource, itself, most likely has at least three additional statements made about it: one to assert that its subject is some resource, one to assert that its predicate is some resource, and one to assert that its object is some resource or literal. More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the application's needs. Borrowing from concepts available in logic (and as illustrated in graphical notations such as conceptual graphs and topic maps), some RDF model implementations acknowledge that it is sometimes useful to group statements according to different criteria, called situations, contexts, or scopes, as discussed in articles by RDF specification co-editor Graham Klyne. For example, a statement can be associated with a context, named by a URI, in order to assert an \\"is true in\\" relationship. As another example, it is sometimes convenient to group statements by their source, which can be identified by a URI, such as the URI of a particular RDF/XML document. Then, when updates are made to the source, corresponding statements can be changed in the model, as well. Implementation of scopes does not necessarily require fully reified statements. Some implementations allow a single scope identifier to be associated with a statement that has not been assigned a URI, itself. Likewise named graphs in which a set of triples is named by a URI can represent context without the need to reify the triples. = Query and inference languages = The predominant query language for RDF graphs is SPARQL. SPARQL is an SQL-like language, and a recommendation of the W3C as of January 15, 2008. The following is an example of a SPARQL query to show country capitals in Africa, using a fictional ontology: PREFIX ex: SELECT ?capital ?country WHERE { ?x ex:cityname ?capital ; ex:isCapitalOf ?y . ?y ex:countryname ?country ; ex:isInContinent ex:Africa . } Other non- standard ways to query RDF graphs include: * RDQL, precursor to SPARQL, SQL- like * Versa, compact syntax (non‚ÄìSQL-like), solely implemented in 4Suite (Python). * RQL, one of the first declarative languages for uniformly querying RDF schemas and resource descriptions, implemented in RDFSuite. * SeRQL, part of Sesame * XUL has a template element in which to declare rules for matching data in RDF. XUL uses RDF extensively for databinding. = Validation and description = There are several proposals to validate and describe RDF: * SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) SPIN website was based on SPARQL queries. It has been effectively deprecated in favor of SHACL. Comparison of SHACL with SPIN * SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) SHACL Specification expresses constraints on RDF Graphs. SHACL is divided in two parts: SHACL Core and SHACL-SPARQL. SHACL Core consists of a list of built-in constraints such as cardinality, range of values and many others. SHACL-SPARQL consists of all features of SHACL Core plus the advanced features of SPARQL-based constraints and an extension mechanism to declare new constraint components. * ShEx (Shape Expressions) ShEx Specification is a concise language for RDF validation and description.  Examples  = Example 1: Description of a person named Eric Miller = The following example is taken from the W3C website describing a resource with statements \\"there is a Person identified by http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, whose name is Eric Miller, whose email address is e.miller123(at)example (changed for security purposes), and whose title is Dr.\\" An RDF Graph Describing Eric Miller The resource \\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\\" is the subject. The objects are: * \\"Eric Miller\\" (with a predicate \\"whose name is\\"), * mailto:e.miller123(at)example (with a predicate \\"whose email address is\\"), and * \\"Dr.\\" (with a predicate \\"whose title is\\"). The subject is a URI. The predicates also have URIs. For example, the URI for each predicate: * \\"whose name is\\" is http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName, * \\"whose email address is\\" is http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox, * \\"whose title is\\" is http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle. In addition, the subject has a type (with URI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), which is person (with URI http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person). Therefore, the following \\"subject, predicate, object\\" RDF triples can be expressed: * http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName, \\"Eric Miller\\" * http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox, mailto:e.miller123(at)example * http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle, \\"Dr.\\" * http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf- syntax-ns#type, http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person In standard N-Triples format, this RDF can be written as: \\"Eric Miller\\" . . \\"Dr.\\" . . Equivalently, it can be written in standard Turtle (syntax) format as: @prefix eric: . @prefix contact: . @prefix rdf: . eric:me contact:fullName \\"Eric Miller\\" . eric:me contact:mailbox . eric:me contact:personalTitle \\"Dr.\\" . eric:me rdf:type contact:Person . Or, it can be written in RDF/XML format as: Eric Miller Dr. = Example 2: The postal abbreviation for New York = Certain concepts in RDF are taken from logic and linguistics, where subject- predicate and subject-predicate-object structures have meanings similar to, yet distinct from, the uses of those terms in RDF. This example demonstrates: In the English language statement 'New York has the postal abbreviation NY' , 'New York' would be the subject, 'has the postal abbreviation' the predicate and 'NY' the object. Encoded as an RDF triple, the subject and predicate would have to be resources named by URIs. The object could be a resource or literal element. For example, in the N-Triples form of RDF, the statement might look like: \\"NY\\" . In this example, \\"urn:x-states:New%20York\\" is the URI for a resource that denotes the US state New York, \\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative\\" is the URI for a predicate (whose human-readable definition can be found at here DCMI Metadata Terms. Dublincore.org. Retrieved on 2014-05-30.), and \\"NY\\" is a literal string. Note that the URIs chosen here are not standard, and don't need to be, as long as their meaning is known to whatever is reading them. = Example 3: A Wikipedia article about Tony Benn = In a like manner, given that \\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn\\" identifies a particular resource (regardless of whether that URI could be traversed as a hyperlink, or whether the resource is actually the Wikipedia article about Tony Benn), to say that the title of this resource is \\"Tony Benn\\" and its publisher is \\"Wikipedia\\" would be two assertions that could be expressed as valid RDF statements. In the N-Triples form of RDF, these statements might look like the following: \\"Tony Benn\\" . \\"Wikipedia\\" . To an English-speaking person, the same information could be represented simply as: > The title of this resource, which is published by Wikipedia, is 'Tony Benn' However, RDF puts the information in a formal way that a machine can understand. The purpose of RDF is to provide an encoding and interpretation mechanism so that resources can be described in a way that particular software can understand it; in other words, so that software can access and use information that it otherwise couldn't use. Both versions of the statements above are wordy because one requirement for an RDF resource (as a subject or a predicate) is that it be unique. The subject resource must be unique in an attempt to pinpoint the exact resource being described. The predicate needs to be unique in order to reduce the chance that the idea of Title or Publisher will be ambiguous to software working with the description. If the software recognizes http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title (a specific definition for the concept of a title established by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative), it will also know that this title is different from a land title or an honorary title or just the letters t-i-t-l-e put together. The following example, written in Turtle, shows how such simple claims can be elaborated on, by combining multiple RDF vocabularies. Here, we note that the primary topic of the Wikipedia page is a \\"Person\\" whose name is \\"Tony Benn\\": @prefix rdf: . @prefix foaf: . @prefix dc: . dc:publisher \\"Wikipedia\\" ; dc:title \\"Tony Benn\\" ; foaf:primaryTopic [ a foaf:Person ; foaf:name \\"Tony Benn\\" ] .

Santhi Thilagam It will also help scientists understand how people are connected to one another. RDF is being used to have a better understanding of road traffic patterns. This is because the information regarding traffic patterns is on different websites, and RDF is used to integrate information from different sources on the web. Before, the common methodology was using keyword searching, but this method is problematic because it does not consider synonyms. This is why ontologies are useful in this situation. But one of the issues that comes up when trying to efficiently study traffic is that to fully understand traffic, concepts related to people, streets, and roads must be well understood. Since these are human concepts, they require the addition of fuzzy logic. This is because values that are useful when describing roads, like slipperiness, are not precise concepts and cannot be measured. This would imply that the best solution would incorporate both fuzzy logic and ontology.Traffic Information Retrieval Based on Fuzzy Ontology and RDF on the Semantic Web By Jun Zhai, Yi Yu, Yiduo Liang, and Jiatao Jiang (2008)  See also  ;Notations for RDF * TRiG * TRiX * RDF/XML * RDFa * JSON-LD * Notation3 ;Similar concepts * Entity‚Äìattribute‚Äìvalue model * Graph theory ‚Äì an RDF model is a labeled, directed multi-graph. * Website Parse Template * Tagging * SciCrunch * Semantic network ; Other (unsorted): * Semantic technology * Associative model of data * Business Intelligence 2.0 (BI 2.0) * Data portability * EU Open Data Portal * Folksonomy * Life Science Identifiers * Swoogle * Universal Networking Language (UNL) * VoID  References  = Citations = = Sources = *  Further reading  * W3C's RDF at W3C: specifications, guides, and resources * RDF Semantics: specification of semantics, and complete systems of inference rules for both RDF and RDFS  External links  * Knowledge representation World Wide Web Consortium standards XML XML-based standards Metadata Semantic Web Bibliography file formats Modeling languages ","title":"Resource Description Framework"},{"id":"53848","title":"San Antonio"},{"id":"53849","text":"Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. Its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the U.S. film industry and the people associated with it. Many of its studios such as Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures were founded there and Paramount still has its studios there. Hollywood was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable in the world. History =Early history and development= Original 480 acre map of H. J. Whitley property developed by his company, Los Angeles Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Highland Avenue runs through the center of the property. The square at the lower right hand corner is the Whitley Estate and was not part of the Grand View development. H.J. Whitley, a real estate developer, had previously started more than a hundred towns across the western United States.Margaret Leslie Davis, (1993), p. 92. Whitley arranged to buy the E.C. Hurd ranch. They agreed on a price and shook hands on the deal. Whitley shared his plans for the new town with General Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and Ivar Weid, a prominent businessman in the area. Glen-Holly Hotel, first hotel in Hollywood, at the corner of what is now called Yucca Street. It was built in the 1890s. Daeida Wilcox, who donated land to help in the development of Hollywood, learned of the name Hollywood from Ivar Weid, her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now Lake Hollywood) and a prominent investor and friend of Whitley's.The Father of Hollywood by Gaelyn Whitley Keith The Father of Hollywood (2010) pg. 127The Quarterly, pg 93‚Äì94 She recommended the same name to her husband, Harvey H. Wilcox, who had purchased 120 acres on February 1, 1887. It wasn't until August 1887 Wilcox decided to use that name and filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office on a deed and parcel map of the property. By 1900, the region had a post office, newspaper, hotel, and two markets. Los Angeles, with a population of 102,479 lay east through the vineyards, barley fields, and citrus groves. A single-track streetcar line ran down the middle of Prospect Avenue from it, but service was infrequent and the trip took two hours. The old citrus fruit-packing house was converted into a livery stable, improving transportation for the inhabitants of Hollywood.Hollywood and Highland, 1907 Newspaper advertisement for Hollywood land sales, 1908 H.J. Whitley is the man standing on the left wearing a bowler hat. The building at the left is the Hollywood Hotel on the corner of Highland Ave. and Hollywood Blvd. The Hollywood Hotel was opened in 1902 by Whitley, who was a president of the Los Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Having finally acquired the Hurd ranch and subdivided it, Whitley built the hotel to attract land buyers. Flanking the west side of Highland Avenue, the structure fronted on Prospect Avenue, which, still a dusty, unpaved road, was regularly graded and graveled. The hotel was to become internationally known and was the center of the civic and social life and home of the stars for many years.Father of Hollywood Dies Hollywood Daily Citizen (1931) Whitley's company developed and sold one of the early residential areas, the Ocean View Tract.

On January 30, 1904, the voters in Hollywood decided, by a vote of 113 to 96, to banish the sale of liquor within the city, except for medicinal purposes. Neither hotels nor restaurants were allowed to serve wine or liquor before or after meals. \\"Hollywood Becomes a Prohibition Town,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 29, 1903, page A-3 In 1910, the city voted for a merger with Los Angeles in order to secure an adequate water supply and to gain access to the L.A. sewer system.

To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west to Los Angeles, where attempts to enforce Edison's patents were easier to evade. Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry in the United States.Mintz, S., and S.

His 17-minute short film In Old California (1910) was filmed for the Biograph Company. Although Hollywood banned movie theaters‚Äîof which it had none‚Äîbefore annexation that year, Los Angeles had no such restriction. The first film by a Hollywood studio, Nestor Motion Picture Company, was shot on October 26, 1911. The H. J.

It later became the Hollywood Film Laboratory, now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory. Four major film companies ‚Äì Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, and Columbia ‚Äì had studios in Hollywood, as did several minor companies and rental studios. In the 1920s, Hollywood was the fifth-largest industry in the nation. By the 1930s, Hollywood studios became fully vertically integrated, as production, distribution and exhibition was controlled by these companies, enabling Hollywood to produce 600 films per year. Hollywood became known as Tinseltown and the \\"dream factory\\" because of the glittering image of the movie industry. Hollywood has since become a major center for film study in the United States. =Development= Hollywood Boulevard as seen from the Dolby Theatre, prior to 2006 Capitol Records Tower, 1991 A large sign reading HOLLYWOODLAND was built in the Hollywood Hills in 1923 to advertise a housing development. In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce entered a contract with the City of Los Angeles to repair and rebuild the sign. The agreement stipulated that LAND be removed to spell HOLLYWOOD so the sign would now refer to the district, rather than the housing development. During the early 1950s, the Hollywood Freeway was constructed through the northeast corner of Hollywood. The Capitol Records Building on Vine Street, just north of Hollywood Boulevard, was built in 1956, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame was created in 1958 as a tribute to artists and other significant contributors to the entertainment industry.

The Dolby Theatre, which opened in 2001 as the Kodak Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center mall, is the home of the Oscars. The mall is located where the historic Hollywood Hotel once stood. =Revitalization= After the neighborhood underwent years of serious decline in the 1980s, many landmarks were threatened with demolition. (subscription may be required for this article) Columbia Square, at the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, is part of the ongoing rebirth of Hollywood. The Art Deco-style studio complex completed in 1938, which was once the Hollywood headquarters for CBS, became home to a new generation of broadcasters when cable television networks MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Spike TV consolidated their offices here in 2014 as part of a $420-million office, residential and retail complex. Since 2000, Hollywood has been increasingly gentrified due to revitalization by private enterprise and public planners. Over 1,200 hotel rooms have been added in Hollywood area between 2001 and 2016. Four thousand new apartments and over thirty low to mid-rise development projects were approved in 2019.https://la.curbed.com/maps/hollywood-development-hotels-apartments- construction =Secession movement= In 2002, some Hollywood voters began a campaign for the area to secede from Los Angeles and become a separate municipality. In June of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed secession referendums for both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley on the ballot. To pass, they required the approval of a majority of voters in the proposed new municipality as well as a majority of voters in all of Los Angeles. In the November election, both measures failed by wide margins in the citywide vote. thumb Geography According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Hollywood is flanked by Hollywood Hills to the north, Los Feliz to the northeast, East Hollywood or Virgil Village to the east, Larchmont and Hancock Park to the south, Fairfax to the southwest, West Hollywood to the west and Hollywood Hills West to the northwest. Street limits of the Hollywood neighborhood are: north, Hollywood Boulevard from La Brea Avenue to the east boundary of Wattles Garden Park and Franklin Avenue between Bonita and Western avenues; east, Western Avenue; south, Melrose Avenue, and west, La Brea Avenue or the West Hollywood city line.The Thomas Guide, Los Angeles County 2006, page 593 In 1918, H. J. Whitley commissioned architect A. S. Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean-style village on the hills above Hollywood Boulevard, and it became the first celebrity community. Other areas within Hollywood are Franklin Village, Little Armenia, Spaulding Square, Thai Town, and Yucca Corridor.

A key point was that Alabama's Hollywood was the first incorporated Hollywood in the nation, whereas the one in California did not incorporate until 1903, six years after Alabama's. In addition, it merged with Los Angeles in 1910 and was no longer identified as a separate city.  Climate  Demographics Four Ladies of Hollywood, 2018 The 2000 U.S. census counted 77,818 residents in the Hollywood neighborhood‚Äîan average of 22,193 people per square mile (8,569 per km2), the seventh-densest neighborhood in all of Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 85,489. The median age for residents was 31, about the city's average. Hollywood was said to be \\"highly diverse\\" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was 42.2% Latino or Hispanic, 41% Non-Hispanic White, 7.1% Asian, 5.2% black, and 4.5% other. Mexico (21.3%) and Guatemala (13%) were the most common places of birth for the 53.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high for the city as a whole. The median household income in 2008 dollars was $33,694, considered low for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.1 people was also lower than the city norm. Renters occupied 92.4% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest. The percentages of never-married men (55.1%), never-married women (39.8%) and widows (9.6%) were among the county's highest. There were 2,640 families headed by single parents, about average for Los Angeles. In 2000, there were 2,828 military veterans, or 4.5%, a low rate for the city as a whole. Radio and television KNX was the last radio station to broadcast from Hollywood before it left CBS Columbia Square for a studio in the Miracle Mile in 2005.Bob Pool, \\"Hollywood, Radio Finally Part Waves,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 11, 2005 On January 22, 1947, the first commercial television station west of the Mississippi River, KTLA, began operating in Hollywood.

Television stations KTLA and KCET, both on Sunset Boulevard, are the last broadcasters (television or radio) with Hollywood addresses, but KCET has since sold its studios on Sunset and plans to move to another location. KNBC moved in 1962 from the former NBC Radio City Studios at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street to NBC Studios in Burbank. KTTV moved in 1996 from its former home at Metromedia Square on Sunset Boulevard to West Los Angeles, and KCOP left its home on La Brea Avenue to join KTTV on the Fox lot. KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV moved from their longtime home at CBS Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard to a new facility at CBS Studio Center in Studio City.

In the mid-1930s, Goodman led one of the most popular musical groups in the United States. His concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938 is described by critic Bruce Eder as \\"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\\" Goodman's bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. During an era of racial segregation, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups. He performed nearly to the end of his life while exploring an interest in classical music.  Early years  Goodman was the ninth of twelve children born to poor Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire. His father, David Goodman (1873‚Äì1926), came to the United States in 1892 from Warsaw in partitioned Poland and became a tailor. His mother, Dora Grisinsky, (1873‚Äì1964), came from Kovno. They met in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to Chicago before Goodman's birth. With little income and a large family, they moved to the Maxwell Street neighborhood, an overcrowded slum near railroad yards and factories that was populated by German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Scandinavian, and Jewish immigrants. Money was a constant problem. On Sundays, his father took the children to free band concerts in Douglas Park, which was the first time Goodman experienced live professional performances. To give his children some skills and an appreciation for music, his father enrolled ten- year-old Goodman and two of his brothers in music lessons, from 1919, at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue and Benny received two years of instruction from the classically trained clarinettist and Chicago Symphony member, Franz Schoepp. During the next year Goodman joined the boys club band at Hull House, where he received lessons from director James Sylvester. By joining the band, he was entitled to spend two weeks at a summer camp near Chicago. It was the only time he could get away from his bleak neighborhood. At 13, he got his first union card. He performed on Lake Michigan excursion boats, and in 1923 played at Guyon‚Äôs Paradise, a local dance hall. In summer 1923, he met Bix Beiderbecke. He attended the Lewis Institute (Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1924 as a high-school sophomore and played clarinet in a dance hall band. When he was 17, his father was killed by a passing car after stepping off a streetcar. His father's death was \\"the saddest thing that ever happened in our family\\", Goodman said.  Career  His early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists who worked in Chicago, such as Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Leon Roppolo. He learned quickly, becoming a strong player at an early age, and was soon playing in bands. He made his professional debut in 1921 at the Central Park Theater on the West Side of Chicago. He entered Harrison Technical High School in Chicago in 1922. At fourteen he became a member of the musicians' union and worked in a band featuring Bix Beiderbecke. Two years later he joined the Ben Pollack Orchestra and made his first recordings in 1926. =From sideman to bandleader= Goodman moved to New York City and became a session musician for radio, Broadway musicals, and in studios. In addition to clarinet, he sometimes played alto saxophone and baritone saxophone. In a Victor recording session on March 21, 1928, he played alongside Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nathaniel Shilkret. He played with the bands of Red Nichols, Ben Selvin, Ted Lewis, and Isham Jones and recorded for Brunswick under the name Benny Goodman's Boys, a band that featured Glenn Miller. In 1928, Goodman and Miller wrote \\"Room 1411\\", which was released as a Brunswick 78. He reached the charts for the first time when he recorded \\"He's Not Worth Your Tears\\" with a vocal by Scrappy Lambert for Melotone. After signing with Columbia in 1934, he had top ten hits with \\"Ain't Cha Glad?\\" and \\"I Ain't Lazy, I'm Just Dreamin'\\" sung by Jack Teagarden, \\"Ol' Pappy\\" sung by Mildred Bailey, and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\" sung by Billie Holiday. An invitation to play at the Billy Rose Music Hall led to his creation of an orchestra for the four-month engagement. The orchestra recorded \\"Moonglow\\", which became a number one hit and was followed by the Top Ten hits \\"Take My Word\\" and \\"Bugle Call Rag\\". NBC hired Goodman for the radio program Let's Dance. John Hammond asked Fletcher Henderson if he wanted to write arrangements for Goodman, and Henderson agreed. During the Depression, Henderson disbanded his orchestra because he was in debt. Goodman hired Henderson's band members to teach his musicians how to play the music.Charters, Murray (2009). \\"The Road to Carnegie Hall\\". Brantford Expositor. Goodman's band was one of three to perform on Let's Dance, playing arrangements by Henderson along with hits such as \\"Get Happy\\" and \\"Limehouse Blues\\" by Spud Murphy. Goodman's portion of the program was broadcast too late at night to attract a large audience on the east coast. He and his band remained on Let's Dance until May of that year when a strike by employees of the series' sponsor, Nabisco, forced the cancellation of the radio show. An engagement was booked at Manhattan's Roosevelt Grill filling in for Guy Lombardo, but the audience expected \\"sweet\\" music and Goodman's band was unsuccessful. Goodman spent six months performing on Let's Dance, and during that time he recorded six more Top Ten hits for Columbia. =Catalyst for the swing era= A crowd of Goodman fans in Oakland, California, 1940 On July 31, 1935, \\"King Porter Stomp\\" was released with \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\" on the B-side, both arranged by Henderson and recorded on July 1. In Pittsburgh at the Stanley Theater some members of the audience danced in the aisles. This information is attributed to writer and historian James T. Maher. But these arrangements had little impact on the tour until August 19 at McFadden's Ballroom in Oakland, California. Goodman and his band, which included Bunny Berrigan, drummer Gene Krupa, and singer Helen Ward were met by a large crowd of young dancers who cheered the music they had heard on Let's Dance. Herb Caen wrote, \\"from the first note, the place was in an uproar.\\" One night later, at Pismo Beach, the show was a flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke. The next night, August 21, 1935, at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, Goodman and his band began a three-week engagement. On top of the Let's Dance airplay, Al Jarvis had been playing Goodman's records on KFWB radio. Goodman started the evening with stock arrangements, but after an indifferent response, he began the second set with arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and Spud Murphy. According to Willard Alexander, the band's booking agent, Krupa said, \\"If we're gonna die, Benny, let's die playing our own thing.\\" The crowd broke into cheers and applause. News reports spread word of the exciting music and enthusiastic dancing. The Palomar engagement was such a marked success that it is often described as the beginning of the swing era. According to Donald Clarke, \\"It is clear in retrospect that the Swing Era had been waiting to happen, but it was Goodman and his band that touched it off.\\" The reception of American swing was less enthusiastic in Europe. British author J. C. Squire filed a complaint with BBC radio to demand it stop playing Goodman's music, which he called \\"an awful series of jungle noises which can hearten no man.\\" Germany's Nazi party barred jazz from the radio, claiming it was part of a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the culture. Italy's fascist government banned the broadcast of any music composed or played by Jews which they said threatened \\"the flower of our race, the youth.\\" In November 1935 Goodman accepted an invitation to play in Chicago at the Joseph Urban Room at the Congress Hotel. His stay there extended to six months, and his popularity was cemented by nationwide radio broadcasts over NBC affiliate stations. While in Chicago, the band recorded If I Could Be with You, Stompin' at the Savoy, and Goody, Goody. Goodman also played three concerts produced by Chicago socialite and jazz aficionado Helen Oakley. These \\"Rhythm Club\\" concerts at the Congress Hotel included sets in which Goodman and Krupa sat in with Fletcher Henderson's band, perhaps the first racially integrated big band appearing before a paying audience in the United States. Goodman and Krupa played in a trio with Teddy Wilson on piano. Both combinations were well received, and Wilson remained. In his 1935‚Äì1936 radio broadcasts from Chicago, Goodman was introduced as the \\"Rajah of Rhythm.\\" Slingerland Drum Company had been calling Krupa the \\"King of Swing\\" as part of a sales campaign, but shortly after Goodman and his crew left Chicago in May 1936 to spend the summer filming The Big Broadcast of 1937 in Hollywood, the title \\"King of Swing\\" was applied to Goodman by the media. At the end of June 1936, Goodman went to Hollywood, where, on June 30, 1936, his band began CBS's Camel Caravan, its third and (according to Connor and Hicks) its greatest sponsored radio show, co-starring Goodman and his former boss Nathaniel Shilkret. By spring 1936, Fletcher Henderson was writing arrangements for Goodman's band. = Carnegie Hall concert = In late 1937, Goodman's publicist Wynn Nathanson suggested that Goodman and his band play Carnegie Hall in New York City. The sold-out concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It is regarded as one of the most significant in jazz history. After years of work by musicians from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences. Recordings of the concert were made, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was not of the finest quality. Acetate recordings of the concert were made, and aluminum studio masters were cut. \\"The recording was produced by Albert Marx as a special gift for his wife, Helen Ward, and a second set for Benny. He contracted Artists Recording Studio to make two sets. Artists Recording only had two turntables so they farmed out the second set to Raymond Scott's recording studio....It was Benny's sister-in-law who found the recordings in Benny's apartment [in 1950] and brought them to Benny's attention. Goodman took the discovered recording to Columbia, and a selection was issued on LP as The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert. = Charlie Christian = Pianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams suggested to Hammond that he see guitarist Charlie Christian. Hammond had seen Christian perform in Oklahoma City in 1939 and recommended him to Goodman, but Goodman was uninterested in electric guitar and was put off by Christian's taste in gaudy clothing. During a break at a concert in Beverly Hills, Hammond inserted Christian into the band. Goodman started playing \\"Rose Room\\" on the assumption that Christian didn't know it, but his performance impressed everyone. Christian was a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet from 1939 to 1941, and during these two years he turned the electric guitar into a popular jazz instrument. =Decline of swing= Stage Door Canteen (1943) Goodman continued his success throughout the late 1930s with his big band, his trio and quartet, and the sextet formed in August 1939, the same month Goodman returned to Columbia Records after four years with RCA Victor. At Columbia, John Hammond, his future brother-in-law, produced most of his sessions. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands had lost much of their popularity. In 1941, ASCAP had a licensing war with music publishers. From 1942 to 1944 and again in 1948, the musicians' union went on strike against the major record labels in the United States, and singers acquired the popularity that the big bands had once enjoyed. During the 1942‚Äì44 strike, the War Department approached the union and requested the production of V-Discs, a set of records containing new recordings for soldiers to listen to, thereby boosting the rise of new artists Also, by the late 1940s, swing was no longer the dominant style of jazz musicians. = Exploring bebop = Benny Goodman (third from left) with some of his former musicians, seated around piano left to right: Vernon Brown, George Auld, Gene Krupa, Clint Neagley, Ziggy Elman, Israel Crosby and Teddy Wilson (at piano); 1952 By the 1940s, some jazz musicians were borrowing from classical music, while others, such as Charlie Parker, were broadening the rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic vocabulary of swing to create bebop (or bop). The bebop recordings Goodman made for Capitol were praised by critics. For his bebop band he hired Buddy Greco, Zoot Sims, and Wardell Gray. He consulted his friend Mary Lou Williams for advice on how to approach the music of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Pianist Mel Powell was also an adviser in 1945. Goodman enjoyed bebop. When he heard Thelonious Monk, he said, \\"I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I like the way he played it....I think he's got a sense of humor and he's got some good things there.\\" He also admired Swedish clarinetist Stan Hasselgard. But after playing with a bebop band for over a year, he returned to his swing band because he concluded that was what he knew best. In 1953, he said, \\"Maybe bop has done more to set music back for years than anything....Basically it's all wrong. It's not even knowing the scales....Bop was mostly publicity and people figuring angles.\\" = Classical repertoire = In 1949 he studied with clarinetist Reginald Kell, requiring a change in technique: \\"instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques. He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again‚Äîalmost from scratch.\\" Goodman commissioned compositions for clarinet and chamber ensembles or orchestra that have become standard pieces of classical repertoire. He premiered works by composers, such as Contrasts by B√©la Bart√≥k; Clarinet Concerto No. 2, Op. 115 by Malcolm Arnold; Derivations for Clarinet and Band by Morton Gould; Sonata for Clarinet and Piano by Francis Poulenc, and Clarinet Concerto by Aaron Copland. Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs by Leonard Bernstein was commissioned for Woody Herman's big band, but it was premiered by Goodman. Herman was the dedicatee (1945) and first performer (1946) of Igor Stravinsky's Ebony Concerto, but many years later Stravinsky made another recording with Goodman as the soloist. He made a recording of Mozart's Clarinet Quintet in July 1956 with the Boston Symphony String Quartet at the Berkshire Festival; on the same occasion he recorded Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Munch. He also recorded the clarinet concertos of Weber After forays outside swing, Goodman started a new band in 1953. According to Donald Clarke, this was not a happy time for Goodman. He reunited the band to tour with Louis Armstrong. But he insulted Armstrong and \\"was appalled at the vaudeville aspects of Louis's act...a contradiction of everything Goodman stood for\\". Armstrong left Goodman hanging during a joint performance where Goodman called Armstrong back onstage to wrap up the show. Armstrong refused to perform alongside Goodman, which led essentially to the end of their friendship. Goodman's band appeared as a specialty act in the films The Big Broadcast of 1937; Hollywood Hotel (1938); Syncopation (1942); The Powers Girl (1942); Stage Door Canteen (1943); The Gang's All Here (1943); Sweet and Low-Down (1944), Goodman's only starring feature; Make Mine Music (1946) and A Song Is Born (1948).  Later years  Goodman in concert in Nuremberg, Germany (1971) He continued to play on records and in small groups. In the early 1970s he collaborated with George Benson after the two met taping a PBS tribute to John Hammond, recreating some of Goodman's duets with Charlie Christian. Benson appeared on Goodman's album Seven Come Eleven. Goodman continued to play swing, but he practiced and performed classical pieces and commissioned them for clarinet. In 1960 he performed Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with conductor Alfredo Antonini at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City. Despite health problems, he continued to perform, his last concert six days before his death. Goodman died June 13th, 1986, from a heart attack while taking a nap at his apartment in Manhattan House. Personal life One of Goodman's closest friends was Columbia producer John Hammond, who influenced Goodman's move from Victor to Columbia. Goodman married Hammond's sister, Alice Frances Hammond Duckworth (1913‚Äì1978), on March 20, 1942. They had two daughters and raised Alice's three daughters from her first marriage to British politician Arthur Duckworth. Goodman's daughter Rachel became a classical pianist. She sometimes performed in concert with him, beginning when she was sixteen. Goodman and Hammond had disagreements from the 1930s onwards. For the 1939 Spirituals to Swing concert Hammond had placed Charlie Christian into the Kansas City Six to play before Goodman's band, which had angered Goodman. They disagreed over the band's music until Goodman refused to listen to Hammond. Their arguments escalated, and in 1941 Hammond left Columbia. Goodman appeared on a 1975 PBS tribute to Hammond but remained at a distance. In the 1980s, after the death of Alice Goodman, Hammond and Goodman reconciled. On June 25, 1985, Goodman appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for \\"A Tribute to John Hammond\\". Goodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others as an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of \\"The Ray\\", the glare that Goodman directed at a musician who failed to perform to his standards. After guitarist Allan Reuss incurred Goodman's displeasure, Goodman relegated him to the rear of the bandstand where his contribution would be drowned out by the other musicians. Vocalists Anita O'Day and Helen Forrest spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman: \\"The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,\\" said Forrest. \\"When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.\\" He was generous and funded several college educations, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why, he said, \\"Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.\\" Goodman helped racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by Jim Crow laws. Goodman hired Teddy Wilson for his trio and added vibraphonist Lionel Hampton for his quartet. In 1939 he hired guitarist Charlie Christian. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's six-decade-long color line. \\"Goodman's popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws.\\" According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he \\"played with that nigger\\" (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, \\"I'll knock you out if you use that word around me again\\". In 1962, the Benny Goodman Orchestra toured the Soviet Union as part of a cultural exchange program between the two nations after the Cuban Missile Crisis and the end of that phase of the Cold War; both visits were part of efforts to normalize relations between the United States and the USSR. Members of the band included Jimmy Knepper, Jerry Dodgion, and Turk Van Lake (Vanig Hovsepian).Feather, Leonard (2007). The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz. Oxford University Press. e-book. Bassist Bill Crow published a very jaundiced view of the tour and Goodman's conduct during it under the title \\"To Russia Without Love\\". On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Benny Goodman among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Awards and honors Goodman's star on Hollywood Walk of Fame Goodman was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After winning polls as best jazz clarinetist, Goodman was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1957. He was a member of the radio division of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. His papers were donated to Yale University after his death. He received honorary doctorates from Union College, the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Bard College, Brandeis University, Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University. His music appeared in the documentary Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story (2010) narrated by actor Dustin Hoffman.

The character is a primary antagonist in the original trilogy and a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy. Star Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \\"the tragedy of Darth Vader\\". Originally a slave on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force. He is lured to the dark side of the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith lord. After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, in which he is severely injured, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic Empire as its chief enforcer until he ultimately redeems himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process. He is also the secret husband of Padm√© Amidala, father of Princess Leia, and grandfather of Kylo Ren. The character has been portrayed by numerous actors: David Prowse physically portrayed Vader while James Earl Jones voiced him in the original trilogy, and Sebastian Shaw portrayed the unmasked Anakin in Return of the Jedi, as well as the character's spirit in the original release of that film. Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen played the character in the prequel trilogy in the first and next two films, respectively, with Christensen also replacing Shaw as Anakin's spirit with the 2004 of Return of the Jedi. His cinematic appearances span the first six Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One. He is referenced in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, and makes vocal cameos as both Vader and Anakin in The Rise of Skywalker. He also appears in television series (most substantially The Clone Wars) and numerous iterations of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books. Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever. The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. His role as a tragic hero in the saga was also met with positive reviews.  Creation and development  = Name = George Lucas, Vader's creator Various combinations of names for the character were built upon the phrase \\"Dark Water\\". Then Lucas \\"added lots of last names, Vaders and Wilsons and Smiths, and [he] just came up with the combination of Darth and Vader.\\" After the release of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Lucas said the name Vader was based upon the German/Dutch-language homophone vater or vader, meaning 'father', making the name representative of a \\"Dark Father\\". Other words which may have inspired the name are \\"death\\" and \\"invader\\", as well as the name of a high school upperclassman of Lucas's, Gary Vader. As no other character with the title \\"Darth\\" was introduced until the release of The Phantom Menace (1999), some viewers interpreted it as the character's first name, in part because Obi-Wan Kenobi addresses him as \\"Darth\\" in the original film. The moniker is bestowed upon Anakin in Revenge of the Sith (2005) upon his turn to the dark side of the Force. Director Ken Annakin's films Swiss Family Robinson and Battle of the Bulge influenced the original trilogy, leading some to believe that Anakin was named after him. Lucas's publicist denied this following Annakin's death in 2009. Anakin and Luke's original surname \\"Starkiller\\" remained in the script until a few months into filming Star Wars, when it was dropped due to what Lucas called \\"unpleasant connotations\\" with Charles Manson and replaced with \\"Skywalker\\". = Concept and writing = In the first draft of The Star Wars, tall, grim general \\"Darth Vader\\" was already close in line with his final depiction, and the protagonist Annikin Starkiller had a role similar to that of his son Luke's as the 16-year-old son of a respected warrior. Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler. In developing the backstory for The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader. After the success of the original Star Wars (1977), Lucas hired science-fiction author Leigh Brackett to write the sequel with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke. Lucas was disappointed with the script, but Brackett died of cancer before he could discuss it with her. With no writer available, Lucas wrote the next draft himself. In this draft, dated April 1, 1978, he made use of a new plot twist: Vader claiming to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles writing the first film. Lucas has said that he knew Vader was Luke's father while writing the first film, though the relationship is not evidenced before said draft of The Empire Strikes Back. The new plot element of Luke's parentage had drastic effects on the series. Author Michael Kaminski argues in The Secret History of Star Wars that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the first film was clearly operating under a storyline where Vader was a separate character from Luke's father. After writing the second and third drafts in which the plot point was introduced, Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created: Anakin had been Obi-Wan Kenobi's brilliant student and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by Palpatine. Anakin battled Obi-Wan on the site of a volcano and was badly wounded, but was then reborn as Vader. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan hid Luke on Tatooine while the Galactic Republic became the tyrannical Galactic Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi. This change in character would provide a springboard to the \\"tragedy of Darth Vader\\" storyline that underlies the prequel trilogy. After deciding to create the prequel trilogy, Lucas indicated that the story arc would be a tragic one depicting Anakin's fall to the dark side. He also saw that the prequels could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a \\"saga\\". For the first prequel, Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Lucas made Anakin nine years old to make the character's separation from his mother poignant. Movie trailers focused on Anakin and a one-sheet poster showing him casting Vader's shadow informed otherwise unknowing audiences of the character's eventual fate. The movie ultimately achieved a primary goal of introducing audiences to Anakin, as well as introducing the concept that he is the Chosen One of an ancient Jedi prophecy, destined to bring balance to the Force. Lucas states in an interview recorded around the time of the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith (2005), that \\"Anakin is the Chosen One. Even when Anakin turns into Darth Vader, he is still the Chosen One.\\" Michael Kaminski offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make fundamental story changes, first revising the opening sequence of Revenge of the Sith to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice, Count Dooku, killed by Anakin in cold blood as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side. After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas re-wrote Anakin's turn to the dark side; Anakin's fall from grace would now be motivated by a desire to save his wife, Padm√© Amidala, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004. During production of the animated The Clone Wars television series, Ahsoka Tano was developed to illustrate how Anakin develops from the brash, undisciplined Padawan apprentice in Attack of the Clones (2002) to the more reserved Jedi Knight in Revenge of the Sith.TV Guide Article August 11, 2008 Clone Wars supervising director and Rebels co- creator Dave Filoni said that giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible. It would also give him insight into his relationship with Obi-Wan and depict how their relationship matured. Ahsoka and Anakin's relationship was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the animated film and Clone Wars television series. Filoni began thinking about the final confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader ever since he created the former; different iterations had different endings, including one in which Vader kills Ahsoka just as she slashes open his helmet to reveal Vader's scarred face. Ahsoka's presence in Rebels was necessary to allow Darth Vader to encounter the show's lead characters without the latter being \\"destroyed\\", as Ahsoka can \\"stand toe-to-toe\\" with Vader. = Design = Ralph McQuarrie incorporated samurai armor into his conceptual designs for Vader's costume in 1975. The original design of Darth Vader's costume did not originally include a helmet. The idea that Vader should wear a breathing apparatus was first proposed by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie during preproduction discussions for Star Wars with George Lucas in 1975. McQuarrie stated that Lucas's artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with samurai armor. \\"For Darth Vader, George just said he would like to have a very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind.\\" McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space, and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet, thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema. McQuarrie's 1975 production painting of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller (a character prototype for Luke Skywalker) depicts Vader wearing black armor, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet. Its similarity to the final design of Vader's costume demonstrates that McQuarrie's earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production. Working from McQuarrie's designs, the costume designer John Mollo devised a costume that could be worn by an actor on-screen using a combination of clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet and a military gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armour used in the film. The sound of the respirator function of Vader's mask was created by Ben Burtt using modified recordings of scuba breathing apparatus used by divers. The sound effect is trademarked in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office under Trademark #77419252 and is officially described in the documentation as \\"The sound of rhythmic mechanical human breathing created by breathing through a scuba tank regulator.\\" Commentators have often pointed to the influence of Akira Kurosawa's films such as The Hidden Fortress (1958) on George Lucas, and Vader's samurai-inspired costume design is held up as a significant example of the Japanese influences on Star Wars. = Portrayals = David Prowse physically portrayed Vader in the original film trilogy. Darth Vader was portrayed by bodybuilder David Prowse in the original film trilogy, and by stunt performer Bob Anderson during the character's lightsaber fight scenes. Lucas originally intended for Orson Welles to voice Vader (after dismissing using Prowse's own voice due to his English West Country accent, leading to the rest of the cast nicknaming him \\"Darth Farmer\\"). After deciding that Welles's voice would be too recognizable, he cast the lesser-known James Earl Jones instead.Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005] Jones initially felt his contributions to the films were too small to warrant recognition and his role was uncredited at his request until the release of Return of the Jedi (1983). When Jones was specifically asked if he had supplied Vader's voice for Revenge of the Sith‚Äîeither newly or from a previous recording‚ÄîJones answered, \\"You'd have to ask Lucas about that. I don't know\\". Hayden Christensen and Gene Bryant alternately portray Vader in Revenge of the Sith. During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by Prowse. Brock Peters provided the voice of Darth Vader in the NPR/USC radio series. Both Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous portrayed Vader in Rogue One (2016), with Jones reprising his role as the character's voice. Vader's character has also been portrayed in several video games; in games such as Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire and Dark Forces, visual effects artist C. Andrew Nelson appears in short sequences in the Vader costume, voiced by Scott Lawrence. Matt Sloan, who appeared in the YouTube parody Chad Vader, provided the voice of Darth Vader in The Force Unleashed. As a result of his video game appearances, Nelson was cast to appear as Vader in brief sequences inserted into the Special Edition of The Empire Strikes Back, in which Vader is seen boarding his shuttle. During production of Return of the Jedi, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role of Anakin Skywalker since his death was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, and Sebastian Shaw was selected for the role. When Shaw arrived at the set for filming, he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid, the actor playing the Emperor. When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there, Shaw responded, \\"I don't know, dear boy, I think it's something to do with science-fiction.\\" His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by Richard Marquand, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue. Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film, in which he is a Force Ghost of Anakin. Shaw's image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 DVD release. This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be possibly the most controversial change in the Star Wars re-releases. Shaw received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role in the rest of his career. He later reflected that he enjoyed his experience filming Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film. James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader in the original trilogy, Revenge of the Sith, and Rogue One. When The Phantom Menace was being produced, hundreds of actors were tested for the role of young Anakin before the producers settled on Jake Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of \\"a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic\\". Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was \\"smart, mischievous and loves anything mechanicaljust like Anakin.\\" During production of Attack of the Clones, casting director Robin Gurland reviewed about 1,500 other candidates for the role of the young Anakin before Lucas eventually selected Hayden Christensen for the role. When Revenge of the Sith was being produced, Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous prequel film, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles.Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD documentary It's All for Real: The Stunts of Episode III, [2005]. Anakin has also been voiced by Mat Lucas for the 2003 micro-series Clone Wars, and by Matt Lanter in the CGI animated film The Clone Wars, the television series of the same name and for Anakin's small roles in the animated series Rebels and Forces of Destiny. James Earl Jones reprised the voice role for Vader's appearances in Rebels. Both Lanter and Jones contributed their voices for the second-season finale of Rebels, at times with identical dialogue spoken by both actors blended together in different ways. = Characteristics = In Attack of the Clones, Anakin Skywalker feels \\"smothered\\" by Obi-Wan Kenobi and is incapable of controlling his own life. By Revenge of the Sith, however, his \\"father-son\\" friction with his master has matured into a more equal, brotherly relationship. Once he becomes Darth Vader, each evil act he commits shatters any hope or connection towards his previous life, which makes it harder for him to return to the light, but he ultimately escapes the dark side and redeems himself by sacrificing his life to save his son, Luke Skywalker, and kill the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. Eric Bui, a psychiatrist at University of Toulouse Hospital, argued at the 2007 American Psychiatric Association convention that Anakin Skywalker meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD), one more than necessary for a diagnosis. He and a colleague, Rachel Rodgers, published their findings in a 2010 letter to the editor of the journal Psychiatry Research. Bui says he found Anakin Skywalker a useful example to explain BPD to medical students. In particular, Bui points to Anakin's abandonment issues and uncertainty over his identity. Anakin's mass murders of the Tusken Raiders in Attack of the Clones and the young Jedi in Revenge of the Sith count as two dissociative episodes, fulfilling another criterion. Bui hoped his paper would help raise awareness of the disorder, especially among teens.  Appearances  Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker appears in seven of the live-action Star Wars films, the animated series The Clone Wars (including the film), Rebels, and the micro-series Clone Wars and Forces of Destiny. He also has a main and recurring role in games, comics, books and the non-canon Star Wars Legends material. = Skywalker saga =  Original trilogy  Darth Vader first appears in Star Wars as a ruthless cyborg serving the Galactic Empire. He is tasked, along with Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), with recovering the secret plans for the Death Star superweapon, which were stolen by the Rebel Alliance. Vader captures and tortures Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who has hidden the plans inside the droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and sent it to find Vader's former Jedi Master Obi- Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) on the planet Tatooine. During Leia's rescue by Obi-Wan's allies Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Vader strikes down Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Having placed a tracking device aboard their ship, the Millennium Falcon, Vader is able to track down the Rebel base on the planet Yavin 4. During the Rebel attack on the Death Star, Vader boards his TIE fighter and attempts to shoot down Rebel X-wing fighters, but Solo intervenes and sends Vader's ship spiraling off course, allowing Luke to destroy the Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader becomes obsessed with finding the Force-sensitive Luke and leads his stormtroopers to attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, which the Rebels escape. While conversing with Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) via hologram, Vader convinces him that Luke would be a valuable ally if he could be turned to the dark side. Vader hires a group of bounty hunters to follow Luke's friends, and negotiates with Bespin administrator Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to set a trap for them to bait Luke. After Han, Leia, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) arrive, Vader tortures and freezes Han in carbonite and gives him to the bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch). When Luke arrives, Vader overpowers him in a lightsaber duel, severing his hand. Vader tells Luke that he is his father, and tries to persuade him to join the dark side and help him overthrow the Emperor. Horrified, Luke escapes through an air shaft. Vader telepathically tells Luke that it is his destiny to join the dark side. Sebastian Shaw as the redeemed Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi (1983) In Return of the Jedi, Vader and the Emperor supervise the final stages of the second Death Star's construction. Thinking that there is still good in his father, Luke surrenders to Vader and tries to convince him to turn from the dark side. Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor. While there, Palpatine tempts Luke to give in to his anger, which leads to Vader dueling with Luke once again. Realizing that Leia is Luke's twin sister, Vader threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Furious, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his father's robotic hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place. Luke refuses and the Emperor tortures him with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor chute to his death, but is mortally wounded by his former master's lightning in the process. The redeemed Anakin Skywalker asks Luke to remove his mask, and admits that there was still good in him after all as he dies peacefully in his son's arms. Luke escapes the Death Star with his father's body and cremates it in a pyre on Endor. As the Rebels celebrate the Death Star's destruction and the Empire's defeat, Luke sees the spirits of Anakin, Yoda (Frank Oz), and Obi-Wan watching over him.  Prequel trilogy  In Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, which takes place 32 years before A New Hope, Anakin appears as a nine-year-old slave living on Tatooine with his mother Shmi (Pernilla August). In addition to being a gifted pilot and mechanic, Anakin has built his own protocol droid, C-3PO. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) meets Anakin after making an emergency landing on Tatooine with Queen of Naboo Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman). Qui-Gon learns from Shmi that Anakin was conceived without a father and can foresee the future. Qui-Gon senses Anakin's strong connection to the Force and becomes convinced that he is the \\"Chosen One\\" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force. After winning his freedom in a podrace wager, Anakin leaves with Qui-Gon to be trained as a Jedi on Coruscant, but is forced to leave his mother behind. During the journey, Anakin forms a bond with Padm√©. Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council for permission to train Anakin, but they sense fear in the boy and refuse. Eventually, Anakin helps end the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo by destroying their control ship. After Qui-Gon is killed in a lightsaber duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul (portrayed by Ray Park, voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), Qui-Gon's apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) promises to train Anakin, with the Council's reluctant approval. Palpatine, newly elected as the Galactic Republic's Chancellor, befriends Anakin and tells him that he will watch his career \\"with great interest\\". In Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which takes place 10 years after The Phantom Menace, 19-year-old Anakin is still Obi-Wan's Padawan apprentice. Over the years, he has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is holding him back. After rescuing Padm√© from an assassination attempt, Anakin travels with her to Naboo as her bodyguard, and they fall in love. Sensing that Shmi is in pain, Anakin travels with Padm√© to Tatooine to rescue his mother. While there, Anakin learns that Shmi had been freed by and married farmer Cliegg Lars (Jack Thompson) a few years after he left. He then visits Cliegg and learns from him that she was kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. Anakin locates Shmi at a Tusken campsite, where she dies in his arms. Anakin, enraged, massacres the Tusken tribe and returns to the Lars homestead to bury Shmi. Anakin then travels with Padm√© to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan from Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Dooku captures the trio and sentences them to death. However, a battalion of Jedi arrives with an army of clone troopers to halt the executions. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku, but the Sith Lord beats them both in a lightsaber duel and severs Anakin's arm. After being rescued by Yoda, Anakin is fitted with a robotic arm and marries Padm√© in a secret ceremony. Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith (2005) In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, set three years after Attack of the Clones, Anakin is now a Jedi Knight and a hero of the Clone Wars. He and Obi-Wan lead a mission to rescue Palpatine from Separatist commander General Grievous (voiced by Matthew Wood). The two Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin overpowers and decapitates at Palpatine's urging. They rescue Palpatine and return to Coruscant. Anakin reunites with Padm√©, who tells him that she is pregnant. Although initially excited, Anakin soon begins to have nightmares about Padm√© dying in childbirth. Palpatine also appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. Suspicious of Palpatine, the Council allows Anakin as a member, but declines to grant him the rank of Jedi Master and instead instructs him to spy on Palpatine, diminishing Anakin's trust in the Jedi. Later, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and says that only he has the power to save Padm√© from dying. Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), who confronts and subdues Palpatine. Desperate to save Padm√©, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and disarms Windu, allowing Palpatine to kill him. Anakin then pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine dubs him Darth Vader. On Palpatine's orders, Vader leads the 501st Legion to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple, including the children, and then goes to the volcanic planet Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist Council. A distraught Padm√© goes to Mustafar and implores Vader to abandon the dark side, but he refuses. Sensing Obi-Wan's presence, and thinking that they are conspiring to kill him, Vader angrily uses the Force to strangle Padm√© to unconsciousness. Obi-Wan engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that ends with Obi-Wan severing Vader's limbs and leaving him for dead on the banks of a lava flow, severely burned. Palpatine finds a barely alive Vader and takes him to Coruscant, where his mutilated body is treated and covered in the black suit first depicted in the original trilogy. When Vader asks if Padm√© is safe, Palpatine says that he killed her out of anger, devastating Vader. At the end of the film, Vader supervises the construction of the first Death Star alongside Palpatine and Tarkin (Wayne Pygram).  Sequel trilogy  Vader's melted helmet appears in The Force Awakens (2015), in which Vader's grandson Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is seen addressing him, though Vader does not appear in the film. At one point, his helmet was considered as the film's MacGuffin. The helmet appears again in The Rise of Skywalker (2019), when Kylo briefly meditates with it, and during the film's first duel between Kylo and Rey (Daisy Ridley), during which it is last seen on Kijimi, which is later destroyed. The film also reveals that the voice which Ren perceived coming from Vader's helmet in The Force Awakens was generated by Palpatine. In The Rise of Skywalker, Anakin makes a vocal cameo, along with other \\"voices of Jedi Past\\", where he encourages Rey to \\"bring back the balance... as [he] did\\" before she faces a resurrected Palpatine. = Other Star Wars films =  The Clone Wars (film)  In the 2008 3D animated film The Clone Wars, Yoda (voiced by Tom Kane) assigns Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) as Anakin's Padawan apprentice, a responsibility Anakin is at first reluctant to accept. Anakin calls her \\"Snips\\" for her \\"snippy\\" attitude, while Ahsoka calls him \\"Skyguy\\" as a pun on his surname. After earning Anakin's respect during a dangerous mission, Ahsoka joins him on a quest to rescue Jabba the Hutt's infant son, Rotta. Her impetuousness both annoys and endears her to her master, and Anakin develops a friendly affection for his apprentice.  Anthology films  In the first anthology film Rogue One, Vader makes a cameo appearance in which he meets with Imperial weapons engineer Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), who asks him for an audience with the Emperor regarding the Death Star, which Krennic lost command of to Tarkin. Vader refuses, however, using the Force to choke him, and ordering him to ensure that the Death Star project has not been compromised. At the end of the film, Vader boards the disabled Rebel flagship Profundity with a cadre of 501st Legion troopers and kills several Rebel soldiers as he attempts to recover the plans. However, the docked blockade runner Tantive IV escapes with the plans, setting up the events of A New Hope. = Television series =  Clone Wars (2003‚Äì2005)  Anakin is a lead character in all three seasons of the Clone Wars micro-series, which takes place shortly after the conclusion of Attack of the Clones. Anakin becomes a Jedi Knight and is quickly promoted to a General of the Republic's Clone Army, due in part to Palpatine's (voiced by Nick Jameson) influence. Among other missions, he fights a duel with Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress (voiced by Grey DeLisle), helps Obi-Wan (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) capture a Separatist-controlled fortress and rescues Jedi Master Saesee Tiin (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) during a space battle. During the third season, Anakin frees a planet's indigenous species from Separatist control and sees a cryptic vision of his future as Darth Vader. In the seasons finale, Anakin and Obi-Wan go on a mission to rescue Palpatine from General Grievous, leading to the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  The Clone Wars (2008‚Äì2014, 2020)  Anakin is a lead character in all seasons of The Clone Wars. As a Jedi Knight, he leads the 501st Legion on missions with both his master Obi-Wan and apprentice Ahsoka Tano throughout the war. Some of Anakin's actions taken out of concern for Ahsoka violate the Jedi code, such as torturing prisoners who may know her location when she goes missing. Throughout the series there are several references to Anakin's eventual fall to the dark side, such as the time he experiences a vision of his future as Darth Vader in the third season, or when he begins to become disillusioned with the Jedi Council after Ahsoka leaves the Jedi Order upon being wrongly accused of bombing the Jedi Temple. The final story arc from the seventh and final season overlaps with Revenge of the Sith and shows Anakin briefly reuniting with Ahsoka before taking part in the Battle of Coruscant and rescuing Palpatine, whilst Ahsoka leads part of the 501st Legion in the Siege of Mandalore to capture the former Sith Lord Maul, who has learned that Darth Sidious intends to make Anakin his new apprentice and seeks to kill him before this would happen. After capturing Maul, Ahsoka senses Anakin's fall to the dark side through the Force before Sidious executes Order 66, causing her squadron of clone troopers to turn on her, though she escapes. The final scene of the series, which takes place some time after the rise of the Empire, shows Darth Vader arriving at a moon on which Ahsoka's ship crash-landed and finding her lightsaber, which leads him to believe that she has died.  Rebels (2014‚Äì2018)  Darth Vader appears in multiple episodes of the first season of Star Wars Rebels, which takes place 14 years after The Clone Wars concludes, and serves as the main antagonist of its second season. Vader leads a squadron of Force-sensitive Imperial Inquisitors who actively search for and kill any remaining Jedi and Force-sensitive children. In the second-season premiere, Vader discovers that Ahsoka has joined the Rebel Alliance, and the Emperor orders him to kill her. When they meet, Ahsoka is overwhelmed when she recognizes Anakin under \\"a layer of hate\\" in Darth Vader. Later in the season, Ahsoka has a vision in which Anakin blames her for allowing him to fall to the dark side. In the season finale, Ahsoka duels with her former master inside a Sith Temple, allowing her friends to escape Vader and the temple's destruction. As the episode concludes, Vader escapes from the temple's ruins. Vader makes a final voiceless cameo in the late fourth-season episode \\"A World Between Worlds\\", in which it is revealed that Ahsoka escaped from her previous duel with Vader by entering a Force-realm. Shortly afterward, Vader's voice is heard echoing in the void.  Forces of Destiny (2017‚Äì2018)  Anakin Skywalker appears in multiple episodes of the 2D animated online micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny. = Canon literature = In the first chapter of the novelization of The Phantom Menace, Anakin participates in a podrace through Beggar's Canyon on Tatooine. This parallels his future son Luke's flights through the same canyon as mentioned in A New Hope. Star Wars: Lords of the Sith was one of the first four canon novels to be released in 2014 and 2015. In it, Vader and Palpatine find themselves hunted by revolutionaries on the Twi'lek planet Ryloth.  Comics  In 2015, Marvel released a 25-issue series called Darth Vader (2015‚Äì16), written by Kieron Gillen. It focuses on the Sith lord in the aftermath of the Death Star's destruction, as well as his life after learning about his son's existence, and introduces franchise fan favorite character Doctor Aphra. This series takes place parallel to the comic book series Star Wars, in which Vader and Luke meet; the two series have a crossover titled Vader Down. The five-issue mini-series Obi- Wan & Anakin (2016), written by Charles Soule, depicts the lives of the titular Jedi between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. At New York Comic Con 2015, Soule described the story as \\"pretty unexplored territory\\". A prequel-era series, also called Darth Vader (sometimes subtitled Dark Lord of the Sith) and featuring the same logo, was also written by Soule and published 2017‚Äì18. It begins immediately after Vader wakes up in his armor at the end of Revenge of the Sith and focuses on his emotional transformation upon learning of Padm√©'s death, his adjustment to his mechanical suit, how he creates his red-bladed lightsaber, and his hunting of Jedi in the Inquisitor program introduced in Rebels. Its final issue indicates that Palpatine used the Force to conceive Anakin in utero, as some fans had theorized that Revenge of the Sith implies. A third series titled Darth Vader debuted in 2020; it is written by Greg Pak and set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The series features Vader returning to Naboo to visit Padm√©'s tomb. = Virtual reality game = In the 2015 Star Wars Celebration, it was announced David S. Goyer was helping to develop a virtual reality game series based on Darth Vader. As a observer with limited influence, the player is able to walk, pick up, push and open things, and possibly affect the story. The game, titled Vader Immortal, had three episodes overall, set between Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One; the first became available with the launch of Oculus Quest, while the last episode was released on November 21, 2019. The game was later ported to the Oculus Rift. On August 25, 2020, all three episodes were also released on PlayStation VR. = Legends = In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise.  Books  Vader is featured prominently in novels set in the Star Wars universe. In the 1978 novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye by Alan Dean Foster, Vader meets Luke Skywalker for the first time and engages him in a lightsaber duel that ends with Luke cutting off Vader's arm and Vader falling into a deep pit. Shadows of the Empire (1996) reveals that Vader is conflicted about trying to turn his son to the dark side of the Force, and knows deep down that there is still some good in himself. Vader's supposedly indestructible glove is the MacGuffin of the young-reader's book The Glove of Darth Vader (1992). Anakin Skywalker's redeemed spirit appears in The Truce at Bakura (1993), set a few days after the end of Return of the Jedi. He appears to Leia, imploring her forgiveness. In Tatooine Ghost (2003), Leia learns to forgive her father after learning about his childhood as a slave and his mother's traumatic death. In The Unifying Force (2003), Anakin tells his grandson Jacen Solo to \\"stand firm\\" in his battle with the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong. Upon the release of the prequel films, the Expanded Universe grew to include novels about Vader's former life as Anakin Skywalker. Greg Bear's 2000 novel Rogue Planet and Jude Watson's Jedi Quest series chronicle Anakin's early missions with Obi-Wan, while James Luceno's 2005 novel Labyrinth of Evil, set during the Clone Wars, depicts Anakin battling Separatist commander General Grievous. In Luceno's Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (2005), set a few months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, Vader disavows his identity as Skywalker as he systematically pursues and kills the surviving Jedi and cements his position in the Empire. The novel reveals that Vader plans to eventually overthrow Palpatine and that he betrayed the Jedi because he resented their supposed failure to recognize his power. In the Dark Nest trilogy (2005), Luke and Leia uncover old recordings of their parents in R2-D2's memory drive; for the first time, they see their own birth and their mother's death, as well as their father's corruption to the dark side. In Bloodlines (2006), Han and Leia's son Jacen ‚Äì who has himself turned to the dark side ‚Äì uses the Force to \\"watch\\" Darth Vader slaughter the children at the Jedi Temple. Vader also appears in a series of tongue-in-cheek children's books by Jeffrey Brown. In Brown's series, a hapless Vader sets out to be a father to a young Luke and Leia, with some scenes portraying light-hearted versions of their darker film counterparts (for example, one scene shows Vader, Luke and Leia at the carbonite freezing chamber on Bespin, with Vader pronouncing the freezer adequate for making ice cream).  Comics  Vader appears in several comic books such as Marvel Comics' Star Wars (1977‚Äì1986). Anakin Skywalker is a major character in Dark Horse Comics' Star Wars: Republic series (1998‚Äì2006). In Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire (1999), Vader hires Fett a few years before the events of A New Hope. In Vader's Quest (1999), set soon after A New Hope, the dark lord encounters Luke for the first time. Star Wars: Empire (2002‚Äì2005) spans from about a year before A New Hope to several months afterwards. Anakin and Vader appear in the non-canonical Star Wars Tales (1999‚Äì2005); in the story Resurrection, Darth Maul is resurrected and faces Vader in battle. Vader- centric comics released and set just after Revenge of the Sith include Dark Times (2006‚Äì2013), Darth Vader and the Lost Command (2011), Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison (2012), and Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows (2013‚Äì14). = Video games = Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker have appeared in a number of Star Wars since the earliest days of the franchise, though rarely as a playable character. Vader plays a central role in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008), where he is the playable character for the first level of the game. He also appears in the sequel Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II as the final boss. Darth Vader has also appeared in non-Star Wars video games as a guest character, for example Soulcalibur IV (2008). Most recently, Vader makes a cameo appearance in the final mission of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, after the main antagonist, the Second Sister, is defeated. After Vader kills her for her failure to retrieve a Jedi Holocron, the protagonist, Padawan Cal Kestis, must escape from Vader, who attempts to get the Holocron in his possession. Cal is ultimately able to escape from Vader's grasp with the help of his allies. = Other = In the Star Wars Holiday Special, a television special broadcast by CBS in 1978, features a brief appearance by Darth Vader, who appears on-screen speaking with Imperial officer \\"Chief Bast\\" in footage cut from the original 1977 film. The sequence is dubbed with new dialogue, performed by James Earl Jones. In the story, Vader colludes with Boba Fett to entrap the Rebels. Darth Vader features in the 1981 radio drama adaptation of Star Wars, voiced by the actor Brock Peters. Vader makes his first appearance on the planet Ralltiir, where he treats Princess Leia with suspicion. In later extended scenes, he is heard interrogating and torturing Leia on board his Star Destroyer and aboard the Death Star. Vader appears in Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue, where he is once again voiced by Jones. An action figure of Vader comes to life alongside RoboCop and Jurassic Park toys in The Indian in the Cupboard (1995). Vader also had a brief cameo in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009), in which he and Oscar the Grouch try unsuccessfully to join the army formed by Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone.  Cultural impact  The Darth Vader Grotesque sculpted into the Washington National Cathedral Darth Vader's iconic status has made the character a symbol for evil in popular culture. Psychiatrists have considered Vader to be a useful example for explaining borderline personality disorder to medical students. Anakin's origin story in The Phantom Menace has been compared to signifiers of African American racial identity, and his dissatisfaction with his life has been compared to Siddartha's before he became Gautama Buddha. A Mexican church advised Christians against seeing The Phantom Menace because it portrays Anakin as a Christ figure. The slime-mold beetle Agathidium vaderi is named after Vader, and several buildings across the globe are regularly compared to him. A grotesque of Darth Vader looms over the east face of the Washington National Cathedral's northwest tower. During the 2007‚Äì08 NHL season, Ottawa Senators goaltender Martin Gerber performed so well in an all-black mask that fans endearingly termed him \\"Darth Gerber\\". In 2015, a statue of Vladimir Lenin in Odessa, Ukraine, was converted into one of Darth Vader due to a law on decommunization. Many films and television series have paid homage to Darth Vader. The 1982 compilation movie Cosmic Princess, compiled from parts of Space: 1999 episodes, contains several Star Wars references including a character named \\"Vader\\". Marty McFly in Back to the Future (1985), dressed in a radiation suit, calls himself \\"Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan\\" to convince the past version of his father to ask his mother to a dance. Rick Moranis plays \\"Dark Helmet\\" in the Star Wars parody Spaceballs (1987). In Chasing Amy (1997), Hooper X speaks at a comic book convention about Darth Vader being a metaphor for how poorly the science fiction genre treats Black people; he is especially offended that Vader, the \\"Blackest brother in the galaxy\\", reveals himself to be a \\"feeble, crusty old white man\\" at the end of Return of the Jedi. The character was also parodied in the Nickelodeon cartoon Rocko's Modern Life in the episode \\"Teed Off\\". On another Nickelodeon cartoon, Jimmy Neutron, Darth Vader's infamous line, \\"I am your father\\", was interpolated in the mini-episode \\"New Dog, Old Tricks\\". The line was also alluded to in Toy Story 2, which also introduces Emperor Zurg (a parody of Vader) to the Disney media franchise. The character of Dark Mayhem in The Thundermans is also a parody of Vader, especially in his original depiction, while his later appearances changed the character to a comical supervillain usually working with incompetent henchmen. The Warner Bros. animated show based on the Looney Tunes, Loonatics Unleashed has a Sylvester the Cat type character named Sylth Vester, a parody and play on the character and name of Darth Vader, respectively. The Final Fantasy IV the character Golbez, who spends most of the game as the main antagonist, was stated by Takashi Tokita to be based on Vader, with his following a similar character arc. In 2010, IGN ranked Darth Vader 25th in the \\"Top 100 Videogame Villains\\". Many commentators and comedians have also evoked his visage to satirize politicians and other public figures, and several American political figures have been unflatteringly compared to the character. In response to Ronald Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (dubbed \\"Star Wars\\" by his political opponents), German news magazine Der Spiegel portrayed the president wearing Vader's helmet on its cover in 1984. In 2005, Al Gore referred to Tele-Communications Inc.'s John C. Malone as the \\"Darth Vader of cable\\", and political strategist Lee Atwater was known by his political enemies as \\"the Darth Vader of the Republican Party\\". Native American artist Bunky Echohawk portrayed General George Armstrong Custer as Vader in his painting Darth Custer. In 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney referenced Darth Vader in an interview with CNN's John King. While discussing the George W. Bush administration's dogma on gathering intelligence, Cheney said, \\"It means we need to be able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans. That's not a pleasant business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'\\" Following this interview, many pop culture celebrities referred to Cheney in this manner during and after his vice presidency. On January 25, 2007, Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a \\"kindred spirit\\" on The Daily Show. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally referred to Cheney as \\"Darth Cheney\\". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison \\"humanizes\\" him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared Bush and Cheney to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters. In Ukraine, the Internet Party of Ukraine regularly lets people named Darth Vader take part in elections. In 2019, an original Vader helmet from The Empire Strikes Back was sold for $900,000 in an online auction.

These stars are estimated, via Kepler's 3rd law, to have periods ranging from a few years to thousands of years. A visual binary consists of two stars, usually of a different brightness. Because of this, the brighter star is called the primary and the fainter one is called the companion. If the primary is too bright, relative to the companion, this can cause a glare making it difficult to resolve the two components.The Binary Stars, Robert Grant Aitken, New York: Dover, 1964, p. 41. However, it is possible to resolve the system if observations of the brighter star show it to wobble about a centre of mass. In general, a visual binary can be resolved into two stars with a telescope if their centres are separated by a value greater than or equal to one arcsecond, but with modern professional telescopes, interferometry, or space-based equipment, stars can be resolved at closer distances. For a visual binary system, measurements taken need to specify, in arc-seconds, the apparent angular separation on the sky and the position angle which is the angle measured eastward from North in degrees of the companion star relative to the primary star. Taken over a period of time, the apparent relative orbit of the visual binary system will appear on the celestial sphere. The study of visual binaries reveal useful stellar characteristics: Masses, densities, surface temperatures, luminosity, and rotation rates. Distance In order to work out the masses of the components of a visual binary system, the distance to the system must first be determined, since from this astronomers can estimate the period of revolution and the separation between the two stars. The trigonometric parallax provides a direct method of calculating a star's mass. This will not apply to the visual binary systems, but it does form the basis of an indirect method called the dynamical parallax. =Trigonometric parallax= In order to use this method of calculating distance, two measurements are made of a star, one each at opposite sides of the Earth's orbit about the Sun. The star's position relative to the more distant background stars will appear displaced. The distance, d is found from the following equation, : d = \\\\frac{1AU}{\\\\tan(p)} Where p is the parallax, measured in units of arc-seconds. =Dynamical parallax= This method is used solely for binary systems. The mass of the binary system is assumed to be twice that of the Sun. Kepler's Laws are then applied and the separation between the stars is determined. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, providing a temporary distance measurement. From this measurement and the apparent magnitudes of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass‚Äìluminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated a number of times, with accuracies as high as 5% being achieved. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time. =Spectroscopic parallax= Spectroscopic parallax is another commonly used method for determining the distance to a binary system. No parallax is measured, the word is simply used to place emphasis on the fact that the distance is being estimated. In this method, the luminosity of a star is estimated from its spectrum. It is important to note that the spectra from distant stars of a given type are assumed to be the same as the spectra of nearby stars of the same type. The star is then assigned a position on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram based on where it is in its life-cycle. The star's luminosity can be estimated by comparison of the spectrum of a nearby star. The distance is then determined via the following inverse square law: : b = \\\\frac{L}{4\\\\pi d^2} where b is the apparent brightness and L is the luminosity. Using the Sun as a reference we can write : \\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} = (\\\\frac{d^{2}_{\\\\odot}}{b})(\\\\frac{d^{2}}{b_{\\\\odot}}) where the subscript \\\\odot represents a parameter associated with the Sun. Rearranging for d^2 gives an estimate for the distance.European Space Agency, Stellar distances : d^2 = (\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}})(\\\\frac{b_{\\\\odot}}{b}) Kepler's laws The two stars orbiting each other, as well as their centre of mass, must obey Kepler's laws. This means that the orbit is an ellipse with the centre of mass at one of the two foci (Kepler's 1st law) and the orbital motion satisfies the fact that a line joining the star to the centre of mass sweeps out equal areas over equal time intervals (Kepler's 2nd law). The orbital motion must also satisfy Kepler's 3rd law. Kepler's 3rd Law can be stated as follows: \\"The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\\" Mathematically, this translates as : T^2 \\\\propto a^3 where T is the orbital period of the planet and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. =Newton's generalisation= Consider a binary star system. This consists of two objects, of mass m_1 and m_2, orbiting around their centre of mass. m_1 has position vector r_1 and orbital velocity v_1, and m_2 has position vector r_2 and orbital velocity v_2 relative to the centre of mass. The separation between the two stars is denoted r, and is assumed to be constant. Since the gravitational force acts along a line joining the centers of both stars, we can assume the stars have an equivalent time period around their center of mass, and therefore a constant separation between each other. To arrive at Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd law we can start by considering Newton's 2nd law which states: \\"The net force acting on an object is proportional to the objects mass and resultant acceleration.\\" : F_{net} = \\\\sum \\\\, F_{i} = ma where F_{net} is the net force acting on the object of mass m, and a is the acceleration of the object. Applying the definition of centripetal acceleration to Newton's second law gives a force of : F = \\\\frac{mv^2}{r} Then using the fact that the orbital velocity is given as : v = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi r}{T} we can state the force on each star as : F_{1} = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 m_{1}r_{1}}{T^2} and F_{2} = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 m_{2}r_{2}}{T^2} If we apply Newton's 3rd law- \\"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\\" : F_{12} = -F_{21} We can set the force on each star equal to each other. : \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 m_{1}r_{1}}{T^2} = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 m_{2}r_{2}}{T^2} This reduces to : r_{1}m_{1} = r_{2}m_{2} If we assume that the masses are not equal, then this equation tells us that the smaller mass remains farther from the centre of mass than does the larger mass. The separation r of the two objects is : r = r_{1}+r_{2} Since r_1 and r_2 would form a line starting from opposite directions and joining at the centre of mass. Now we can substitute this expression into one of the equations describing the force on the stars and rearrange for r_1 to find an expression relating the position of one star to the masses of both and the separation between them. Equally, this could have been solved for r_2. We find that : r_{1} = \\\\frac{m_{2}a}{(m_{1}+m_{2})} Substituting this equation into the equation for the force on one of the stars, setting it equal to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation (namely, F=Gm_{1}m_{2}/a^2, and solving for the period squared yields the required result. : T^2 = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 a^3}{G(m_{1}+m_{2})} This is Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd Law. Unless G is in non-standard units, this will not work if mass is measured in solar masses, the orbital period is measured in years, and the orbital semi-major axis is measured in astronomical units (e.g., use the Earth's orbital parameters). It will work if SI units, for instance, are used throughout. Determining stellar masses  Binary systems are particularly important here because they are orbiting each other, their gravitational interaction can be studied by observing parameters of their orbit around each other and the centre of mass. Before applying Kepler's 3rd Law, the inclination of the orbit of the visual binary must be taken into account. Relative to an observer on Earth, the orbital plane will usually be tilted. If it is at 0¬∞ the planes will be seen to coincide and if at 90¬∞ they will be seen edge on. Due to this inclination, the elliptical true orbit will project an elliptical apparent orbit onto the plane of the sky. Kepler's 3rd law still holds but with a constant of proportionality that changes with respect to the elliptical apparent orbit. The inclination of the orbit can be determined by measuring the separation between the primary star and the apparent focus. Once this information is known the true eccentricity and the true semi-major axis can be calculated since the apparent orbit will be shorter than the true orbit, assuming an inclination greater than 0¬∞, and this effect can be corrected for using simple geometry : a=\\\\frac{a}{p} Where a is the true semi-major axis and p is the parallax. Once the true orbit is known, Kepler's 3rd law can be applied. We re-write it in terms of the observable quantities such that : (m_{1}+m_{2})T^2 = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2 (a/p)^3}{G} From this equation we obtain the sum of the masses involved in the binary system. Remembering a previous equation we derived, : r_{1}m_{1} = r_{2}m_{2} where : r_{1} + r_{2} = r we can solve the ratio of the semi-major axis and therefore a ratio for the two masses since : \\\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} = \\\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} and : \\\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} = \\\\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} The individual masses of the stars follow from these ratios and knowing the separation between each star and the centre of mass of the system. Mass‚Äìluminosity relationship In order to find the luminosity of the stars, the rate of flow of radiant energy, otherwise known as radiant flux, must be observed. When the observed luminosities and masses are graphed, the mass-luminosity relation is obtained. This relationship was found by Arthur Eddington in 1924. :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha Where L is the luminosity of the star and M is its mass. L‚äô and M‚äô are the luminosity and mass of the Sun. The value \\\\alpha = 3.5 is commonly used for main-sequence stars. This equation and the usual value of a = 3.5 only applies to main-sequence stars with masses 2M‚äô < M < 20M‚äô and does not apply to red giants or white dwarfs. For these stars, the equation applies with different constants, since these stars have different masses. For the different ranges of masses, an adequate form of the Mass-Luminosity Relation is :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx .23\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^{2.3} \\\\qquad (M < .43M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^4 \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (.43M_{\\\\odot} < M < 2M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx 1.5\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^{3.5} \\\\qquad (2M_{\\\\odot} < M < 20M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\varpropto \\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}} \\\\qquad (M > 20M_{\\\\odot}) The greater a star's luminosity, the greater its mass will be. The absolute magnitude or luminosity of a star can be found by knowing the distance to it and its apparent magnitude. The stars bolometric magnitude is plotted against its mass, in units of the Sun's mass. This is determined through observation and then the mass of the star is read of the plot. Giants and main sequence stars tend to agree with this, but super giants do not and neither do white dwarfs. The Mass-Luminosity Relation is very useful because, due to the observation of binaries, particularly the visual binaries since the masses of many stars have been found this way, astronomers have gained insight into the evolution of stars, including how they are born. Spectral classification Generally speaking, there are three classes of binary systems. These can be determined by considering the colours of the two components. \\"1. Systems consisting of a red or reddish primary star and a blueish secondary star, usually a magnitude or more fainter... 2\\\\. Systems in which the differences in magnitude and colour are both small... 3\\\\. Systems in which the fainter star is the redder of the two...\\" The luminosity of class 1. binaries is greater than that of class 3. binaries. There is a relationship between the colour difference of binaries and their reduced proper motions. In 1921, Frederick C. Leonard, at the Lick Observatory, wrote \\"1. The spectrum of the secondary component of a dwarf star is generally redder than that of the primary, whereas the spectrum of the fainter component of a giant star is usually bluer than that of the brighter one. In both cases, the absolute difference in spectral class seems ordinarily to be related to the disparity between the components...2. With some exceptions, the spectra of the components of double stars are so related to each other that they conform to the Hertzsprung-Russell configuration of the stars...\\" An interesting case for visual binaries occurs when one or both components are located above or below the Main-Sequence. If a star is more luminous than a Main-Sequence star, it is either very young, and therefore contracting due to gravity, or is at the post Main-Sequence stage of its evolution. The study of binaries is useful here because, unlike with single stars, it is possible to determine which reason is the case. If the primary is gravitationally contracting, then the companion will be further away from the Main-Sequence than the primary since the more massive star becomes a Main-Sequence star much faster than the less massive star.William P.

A member of the Sac and Fox Nation, Thorpe became the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals in the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, and played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball. He lost his Olympic titles after it was found he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi- professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the amateurism rules that were then in place. In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) restored his Olympic medals. 218x218px Thorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma, and attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he was a two-time All-American for the school's football team. After his Olympic success in 1912, which included a record score in the decathlon, he added a victory in the All-Around Championship of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1913, Thorpe signed with the New York Giants, and he played six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1913 and 1919. Thorpe joined the Canton Bulldogs American football team in 1915, helping them win three professional championships; he later played for six teams in the National Football League (NFL). He played as part of several all-American Indian teams throughout his career, and barnstormed as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians. From 1920 to 1921, Thorpe was nominally the first president of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which became the NFL in 1922. He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. He struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. He suffered from alcoholism, and lived his last years in failing health and poverty. He was married three times and had eight children, before suffering from heart failure and dying in 1953. Thorpe has received various accolades for his athletic accomplishments. The Associated Press named him the \\"greatest athlete\\" from the first 50 years of the 20th century, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted him as part of its inaugural class in 1963. A Pennsylvania town was named in his honor and has a monument site that contains his remains, which were the subject of legal action. Thorpe appeared in several films and was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1951 film Jim Thorpe ‚Äì All-American.  Early life  Information about Thorpe's birth, name and ethnic background varies widely.O'Hanlon-Lincoln. p. 129. He was baptized \\"Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe\\" in the Catholic Church. Thorpe was born in Indian Territory of the United States (later Oklahoma), but no birth certificate has been found. He was generally considered to have been born on May 22, 1887, near the town of Prague, Oklahoma. Thorpe himself said in a note to The Shawnee News-Star in 1943 that he was born May 28, 1888, \\"near and south of Bellemont ‚Äì Pottawatomie County ‚Äì along the banks of the North Fork River ... hope this will clear up the inquiries as to my birthplace.\\"Wheeler. p. 291. However, most biographers believe that he was born on May 22, 1887, as that is what is listed on his baptismal certificate. Bellemont was a small community, now disappeared, on the line between Pottawatomie and Lincoln Counties. Thorpe referred to Shawnee as his birthplace in the 1943 note. Thorpe's parents were both of mixed-race ancestry. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an Irish father and a Sac and Fox Indian mother. His mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a French father and a Potawatomi mother, a descendant of Chief Louis Vieux. He was raised as a Sac and Fox, and his native name, Wa-Tho-Huk, translated as \\"path lit by great flash of lightning\\" or, more simply, \\"Bright Path\\". As was the custom for Sac and Fox, he was named for something occurring around the time of his birth, in this case the light brightening the path to the cabin where he was born. Thorpe's parents were both Roman Catholic, a faith which Thorpe observed throughout his adult life.O'Hanlon-Lincoln. p. 131.

After several arguments with his father, he left home to work on a horse ranch.Jim Thorpe ‚Äì Olympic Hero and Native American, olympics30.com. Retrieved July 30, 2018. In 1904 the sixteen-year-old Thorpe returned to his father and decided to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There his athletic ability was recognized and he was coached by Glenn Scobey \\"Pop\\" Warner, one of the most influential coaches of early American football history. Later that year he became orphaned after Hiram Thorpe died from gangrene poisoning after being wounded in a hunting accident,Hoxie. p. 628. and Jim again dropped out of school.

Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him try some rushing plays in practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea. Thorpe \\"ran around past and through them not once, but twice\\". He then walked over to Warner and said \\"Nobody is going to tackle Jim\\", while flipping him the ball.

As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all of his team's four field goals in an 18‚Äì15 upset of Harvard, a top-ranked team in the early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His team finished the season 11‚Äì1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship largely as a result of his efforts ‚Äì he scored 25 touchdowns and 198 points during the season, according to CNN's Greg Botelho. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points.

He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin,Buford. pp. 127‚Äì128. an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he finished in a tie for fourth, and on July 12 he placed seventh in the long jump. Thorpe's final event was the decathlon, his first (and as it turned out, his only) decathlon. Strong competition from local favorite Hugo Wieslander was expected. Thorpe, however, defeated Wieslander by 688 points.Buford. p. 130. He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found a mismatched pair of replacements, including one from a trash can, and won the gold medal wearing them.Tucker, Neely. \\"Battle over athlete Jim Thorpe's burial site continues\\".

In NAGPRA language, \\"'museum' means any institution or State or local government agency (including any institution of higher learning) that receives Federal funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items.\\"25 USC Ch. 32: Native American Graves Protection And Repatriation. Office of the Law Revision Counsel. Retrieved May 23, 2017. The Court of Appeals directed the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of the borough. The appeals court said Pennsylvania law allows the plaintiffs to ask a state court to order reburial of Thorpe's remains, but noted, \\"once a body is interred there is great reluctance in permitting same to be moved, absent clear and compelling reasons for such a move.\\" Retrieved September 9, 2016 On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the matter, effectively bringing the legal process to an end.

An orogen or orogenic belt develops when a continental plate crumples and is uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges; this involves a series of geological processes collectively called orogenesis. Orogeny is the primary mechanism by which mountains are built on continents. The word \\"orogeny\\" () comes from Ancient Greek (, , + , , ). Although it was used before him, the term was employed by the American geologist G.K. Gilbert in 1890 to describe the process of mountain-building as distinguished from epeirogeny. Physiography delamination of orogenic roots into the asthenosphere; Bottom: Subduction of lithospheric plate to mantle depths. The two processes lead to differently located metamorphic rocks (bubbles in diagram), providing evidence as to which process actually occurred at convergent plate margins. Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate to form an accretionary orogen. (example: the Andes) Continental collision of two continental plates to form a collisional orogen. Typically, continental crust is subducted to lithospheric depths for blueschist to eclogite facies metamorphism, and then exhumed along the same subduction channel. (example: the Himalayas) The formation of an orogen can be accomplished by the tectonic processes such as oceanic subduction (where a continent rides forcefully over an oceanic plate for accretionary orogeny) or continental subduction convergence of two or more continents for collisional orogeny). Orogeny usually produces long arcuate (from the Latin ', \\"to bend like a bow\\") structures, known as orogenic belts. Generally, orogenic belts consist of long parallel strips of rock exhibiting similar characteristics along the length of the belt. Although orogenic belts are associated with subduction zones, subduction tectonism may be ongoing or past processes. The subducting tectonism would consume crust, thicken lithosphere, produce earthquake and volcanoes, and build island arcs in many cases. Geologists attribute the arcuate structure to the rigidity of the descending plate, and island arc cusps relate to tears in the descending lithosphere. These island arcs may be added to a continental margin during an accretionary orogeny. On the other hand, subduction zones may be reworked at a later time due to lithospheric rifting, leading to amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphism of the thinned orogenic crust. The processes of orogeny can take tens of millions of years and build mountains from plains or from the seabed. The topographic height of orogenic mountains is related to the principle of isostasy, that is, a balance of the downward gravitational force upon an upthrust mountain range (composed of light, continental crust material) and the buoyant upward forces exerted by the dense underlying mantle. Frequently, rock formations that undergo orogeny are severely deformed and undergo metamorphism. Orogenic processes may push deeply buried rocks to the surface. Sea-bottom and near-shore material may cover some or all of the orogenic area. If the orogeny is due to two continents colliding, very high mountains can result (see Himalayas). An orogenic event may be studied: (a) as a tectonic structural event, (b) as a geographical event, and (c) as a chronological event. Orogenic events: * cause distinctive structural phenomena related to tectonic activity * affect rocks and crust in particular regions, and * happen within a specific period =Orogen (or \\"orogenic system\\")= The Foreland Basin System In general, there are two main types of orogens at convergent plate margins: (1) accretionary orogens, which were produced by subduction of one oceanic plate beneath one continental plate to result in either continental arc magmatism or the accretion of island arc terranes to continental margins; (2) collisional orogens, which were produced by collision between two continental blocks, with subduction of one continental block beneath the other continental block. An orogeny produces an orogen, but a (mountain) range-foreland basin system is only produced on passive plate margins. The foreland basin forms ahead of the orogen due mainly to loading and resulting flexure of the lithosphere by the developing mountain belt. A typical foreland basin is subdivided into a wedge-top basin above the active orogenic wedge, the foredeep immediately beyond the active front, a forebulge high of flexural origin and a back-bulge area beyond, although not all of these are present in all foreland-basin systems. The basin migrates with the orogenic front and early deposited foreland basin sediments become progressively involved in folding and thrusting. Sediments deposited in the foreland basin are mainly derived from the erosion of the actively uplifting rocks of the mountain range, although some sediments derive from the foreland. The fill of many such basins shows a change in time from deepwater marine (flysch-style) through shallow water to continental (molasse-style) sediments. =Orogenic cycle= Although orogeny involves plate tectonics, the tectonic forces result in a variety of associated phenomena, including crustal deformation, crustal thickening, crustal thinning and crustal melting as well as magmatism, metamorphism and mineralization. What exactly happens in a specific orogen depends upon the strength and rheology of the continental lithosphere, and how these properties change during orogenesis. In addition to orogeny, the orogen (once formed) is subject to other processes, such as sedimentation and erosion. The sequence of repeated cycles of sedimentation, deposition and erosion, followed by burial and metamorphism, and then by crustal anatexis to form granitic batholiths and tectonic uplift to form mountain chains, is called the orogenic cycle. In other words, orogeny is only a phase in the existence of an orogen. Five characteristics of the orogenic cycle are listed by For example, the Caledonian Orogeny refers to a series of tectonic events due to the continental collision of Laurentia with Eastern Avalonia and other former fragments of Gondwana in the Early Paleozoic. The Caledonian Orogen resulted from these events and various others that are part of its peculiar orogenic cycle.However, this orogen was superimposed by rifting orogeny at a later time to result in various extents of reworking. In summary, an orogeny is an episode of deformation, metamorphism and magmatism at convergent plate margins, during which many geological processes play a role at convergent plate margins. Every orogeny has its own orogenic cycle, but composite orogenesis is common at convergent plate margins. =Erosion= Erosion represents a subsequent phase of the orogenic cycle. Erosion inevitably removes much of the mountains, exposing the core or mountain roots (metamorphic rocks brought to the surface from a depth of several kilometres). Isostatic movements may help such exhumation by balancing out the buoyancy of the evolving orogen. Scholars debate about the extent to which erosion modifies the patterns of tectonic deformation (see erosion and tectonics). Thus, the final form of the majority of old orogenic belts is a long arcuate strip of crystalline metamorphic rocks sequentially below younger sediments which are thrust atop them and which dip away from the orogenic core. An orogen may be almost completely eroded away, and only recognizable by studying (old) rocks that bear traces of orogenesis. Orogens are usually long, thin, arcuate tracts of rock that have a pronounced linear structure resulting in terranes or blocks of deformed rocks, separated generally by suture zones or dipping thrust faults. These thrust faults carry relatively thin slices of rock (which are called nappes or thrust sheets, and differ from tectonic plates) from the core of the shortening orogen out toward the margins, and are intimately associated with folds and the development of metamorphism. =Biology= In the 1950s and 1960s the study of orogeny, coupled with biogeography (the study of the distribution and evolution of flora and fauna),For example, see and geography and mid ocean ridges, contributed greatly to the theory of plate tectonics. Even at a very early stage, life played a significant role in the continued existence of oceans, by affecting the composition of the atmosphere. The existence of oceans is critical to sea- floor spreading and subduction. =Relationship to mountain building= An example of thin-skinned deformation (thrust faulting) of the Sevier Orogeny in Montana. Note the white Madison Limestone repeated, with one example in the foreground (that pinches out with distance) and another to the upper right corner and top of the picture. Sierra Nevada Mountains (a result of delamination) as seen from the International Space Station. Mountain formation occurs through a number of mechanisms. Large modern orogenies often lie on the margins of present-day continents; the Alleghenian (Appalachian), Laramide, and Andean orogenies exemplify this in the Americas. Older inactive orogenies, such as the Algoman, Penokean and Antler, are represented by deformed and metamorphosed rocks with sedimentary basins further inland. Areas that are rifting apart, such as mid-ocean ridges and the East African Rift, have mountains due to thermal buoyancy related to the hot mantle underneath them; this thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography. In strike-slip orogens, such as the San Andreas Fault, restraining bends result in regions of localized crustal shortening and mountain building without a plate-margin-wide orogeny. Hotspot volcanism results in the formation of isolated mountains and mountain chains that look as if they are not necessarily on present tectonic- plate boundaries, but they are essentially the product of plate tectonism. Regions can also experience uplift as a result of delamination of the orogenic lithosphere, in which an unstable portion of cold lithospheric root drips down into the asthenospheric mantle, decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift. An example is the Sierra Nevada in California. This range of fault-block mountains experienced renewed uplift due to abundant magmatism after a delamination of the orogenic root beneath them. Finally, uplift and erosion related to epeirogenesis (large-scale vertical motions of portions of continents without much associated folding, metamorphism, or deformation) can create local topographic highs. Mount Rundle, Banff, Alberta. Mount Rundle on the Trans-Canada Highway between Banff and Canmore provides a classic example of a mountain cut in dipping-layered rocks. Millions of years ago a collision caused an orogeny, forcing horizontal layers of an ancient ocean crust to be thrust up at an angle of 50‚Äì60¬∞. That left Rundle with one sweeping, tree-lined smooth face, and one sharp, steep face where the edge of the uplifted layers are exposed. History of the concept Before the development of geologic concepts during the 19th century, the presence of marine fossils in mountains was explained in Christian contexts as a result of the Biblical Deluge. This was an extension of Neoplatonic thought, which influenced early Christian writers. The 13th-century Dominican scholar Albert the Great posited that, as erosion was known to occur, there must be some process whereby new mountains and other land-forms were thrust up, or else there would eventually be no land; he suggested that marine fossils in mountainsides must once have been at the sea-floor. Orogeny was used by Amanz Gressly (1840) and Jules Thurmann (1854) as orogenic in terms of the creation of mountain elevations, as the term mountain building was still used to describe the processes. Elie de Beaumont (1852) used the evocative \\"Jaws of a Vise\\" theory to explain orogeny, but was more concerned with the height rather than the implicit structures created by and contained in orogenic belts. His theory essentially held that mountains were created by the squeezing of certain rocks. Eduard Suess (1875) recognised the importance of horizontal movement of rocks. The concept of a precursor geosyncline or initial downward warping of the solid earth (Hall, 1859) prompted James Dwight Dana (1873) to include the concept of compression in the theories surrounding mountain- building. With hindsight, we can discount Dana's conjecture that this contraction was due to the cooling of the Earth (aka the cooling Earth theory). The cooling Earth theory was the chief paradigm for most geologists until the 1960s. It was, in the context of orogeny, fiercely contested by proponents of vertical movements in the crust (similar to tephrotectonics), or convection within the asthenosphere or mantle. Gustav Steinmann (1906) recognised different classes of orogenic belts, including the Alpine type orogenic belt, typified by a flysch and molasse geometry to the sediments; ophiolite sequences, tholeiitic basalts, and a nappe style fold structure. In terms of recognising orogeny as an event, Leopold von Buch (1855) recognised that orogenies could be placed in time by bracketing between the youngest deformed rock and the oldest undeformed rock, a principle which is still in use today, though commonly investigated by geochronology using radiometric dating. Based on available observations from the metamorphic differences in orogenic belts of Europe and North America, H. J. Zwart (1967) proposed three types of orogens in relationship to tectonic setting and style: Cordillerotype, Alpinotype, and Hercynotype. His proposal was revised by W. S. Pitcher in 1979 in terms of the relationship to granite occurrences. Cawood et al. (2009) categorized orogenic belts into three types: accretionary, collisional, and intracratonic. Notice that both accretionary and collisional orogens developed in converging plate margins. In contrast, Hercynotype orogens generally show similar features to intracratonic, intracontinental, extensional, and ultrahot orogens, all of which developed in continental detachment systems at converged plate margins. # Accretionary orogens, which were produced by subduction of one oceanic plate beneath one continental plate for arc volcanism. They are dominated by calc-alkaline igneous rocks and high-T/low-P metamorphic facies series at high thermal gradients of >30 ¬∞C/km. There is a general lack of ophiolites, migmatites and abyssal sediments. Typical examples are all circum-Pacific orogens containing continental arcs. # Collisional orogens, which were produced by subduction of one continental block beneath the other continental block with the absence of arc volcanism. They are typified by the occurrence of blueschist to eclogite facies metamorphic zones, indicating high-P/low-T metamorphism at low thermal gradients of <10 ¬∞C/km. Orogenic peridotites are present but volumetrically minor, and syn-collisional granites and migmatites are also rare or of only minor extent. Typical examples are the Alps-Himalaya orogens in the southern margin of Eurasian continent and the Dabie-Sulu orogens in east-central China.

The members of this family were also the only inhabitants of this island (whose land is owned partly by the Marzano family in Rome, and partly by a NATO military base) that had been abandoned in the 1730s because of North-African piracy in the area. They sustained themselves by goat farming and fishing.

Within the penalty area is the penalty spot, which is or 12 yards from the goal line, directly in-line with the centre of the goal. A penalty arc adjoins the penalty area, and encloses the area within 9.15m (10 yd) from the penalty spot; it does not form part of the penalty area and is only of relevance during the taking of a penalty kick.

A penalty kick is taken from the penalty spot. The penalty spot is located 12 yards (10.97m) away from the goal line. The penalty area has other functions, including: * Goalkeepers: The area delimiting the area in which a goalkeeper may legally handle the ball; * Goal kicks and defensive Free kicks: opponents must remain outside of the area and at least 10 yards away from the ball until the ball is kicked and clearly moves; * Taking of penalty kicks: players other than the kicker and the goalkeeper must remain outside the area (and also the penalty arc) until the kick has been taken. In play In a typical game, for the majority of time the penalty area is occupied only by the goalkeeper. The attacking team generally aims to get the ball and their own players into the defending team's penalty area, and a high percentage of goals in professional football are scored from within the penalty area. Usually during attacking set pieces, including corners, a large number of both attacking and defending players are in the penalty area and, although illegal, grappling between players is frequently observed.

In corpus linguistics, they are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory. Overview A corpus may contain texts in a single language (monolingual corpus) or text data in multiple languages (multilingual corpus). In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as annotation. An example of annotating a corpus is part-of- speech tagging, or POS-tagging, in which information about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of tags. Another example is indicating the lemma (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it, interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual. Some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied. In particular, a number of smaller corpora may be fully parsed. Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for morphology, semantics and pragmatics.  Applications  Corpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics. Other notable areas of application include: * Language technology, natural language processing, computational linguistics  The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics, speech recognition and machine translation, where they are often used to create hidden Markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes. Corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching. Corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing.Yoon, H., & Hirvela, A. (2004). ESL Student Attitudes toward Corpus Use in L2 Writing. Journal of Second Language Writing, 13(4), 257‚Äì283. Retrieved 21 March 2012. * Machine translation  Multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side-by-side comparison are called aligned parallel corpora. There are two main types of parallel corpora which contain texts in two languages. In a translation corpus, the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language. In a comparable corpus, the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content, but they are not translations of each other. To exploit a parallel text, some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments (phrases or sentences) is a prerequisite for analysis. Machine translation algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus which is an element-for-element translation of the first language corpus. * Philologies  Text corpora are also used in the study of historical documents, for example in attempts to decipher ancient scripts, or in Biblical scholarship. Some archaeological corpora can be of such short duration that they provide a snapshot in time. One of the shortest corpora in time may be the 15‚Äì30 year Amarna letters texts (1350 BC). The corpus of an ancient city, (for example the \\"K√ºltepe Texts\\" of Turkey), may go through a series of corpora, determined by their find site dates.

The first version, which appears in the original 1977 film Star Wars, is stated to be more than in diameter, and is crewed by an estimated 1.7 million military personnel and 400,000 droids.Star Wars: Complete Locations The second Death Star, which appears in Return of the Jedi, is significantly larger at between to in diameter, and while it appears unfinished, is technologically more powerful than its predecessor. Origin and design Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a \\"Death Star\\" to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that \\"I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle.\\" As it \\"would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression,\\" Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears.\\"John Stears, 64, Dies; Film-Effects Wizard\\". New York Times. Retrieved January 28, 2013John Stears; Special Effects Genius Behind 007 and R2-D2\\"\\". Los Angeles Times. Retrieved January 28, 2013 The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings. =Special effects= The explosion special effect depicted in the 2004 Special Edition of A New Hope The Death Star explosions featured in the Special Edition of A New Hope and in Return of the Jedi are rendered with a Praxis effect, wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion. The grid plan animations shown during the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in A New Hope were an actual computer-graphics simulation from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory made by Larry Cuba and Gary Imhoff as part of a CalArts project, and had been included during filming. After filming was complete, the original model, as well as one of the surface setpieces, were to be thrown out; however, they were salvaged. Depiction The original Death Star was introduced in the original Star Wars film, which later had elements of its backstory explored in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Clone Wars, Rebels, and Rogue One. The second Death Star appears in Return of the Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, and a similar superweapon, the Starkiller Base, appears in The Force Awakens. Both the original and second Death Star were moon-sized and designed for massive power-projection capabilities, capable of destroying an entire planet with a 6.2x1032 J/s power output blast from their superlasers. =Original Death Star= Emperor Palpatine (left) and Darth Vader (right) oversee the First Death Star construction in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. The original Death Star's completed form appears in the original Star Wars film, known as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, or Project Stardust in Rogue One; before learning the true name of the weapon, the Rebel Alliance referred to it as the \\"Planet Killer\\". Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the Galactic Empire's \\"ultimate weapon\\", a huge spherical battle station 120 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. To mark the Death Star being fully operational, Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan in an attempt to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel headquarters; she gives them the location of Dantooine which housed a now-deserted Rebel base, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway as a demonstration of the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are pulled aboard the station by a tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself whilst duelling Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray- shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke is able to successfully launch his X-wing fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which destroys the station before it can use its superlaser weapon to annihilate the Rebel base on Yavin 4. The first Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on Geonosis in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones showcasing the early development of the Death Star prototype. The Death Star plans were designed by Geonosians led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser, a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and is shown early in construction at the end of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. The Death Star plans are a central plot-point in the 2016 film Rogue One and the original 1977 film Star Wars. The Death Star began as a Geonosian design, but became operational after nearly two decades of work by a team of brilliant scientists sequestered on the rainswept world of Eadu. Led by a reluctant Galen Erso, the Death Star scientists seek to fuse kyber crystal shards into larger structures and use those crystals to amplify energy into a stable beam powerful enough to destroy an entire planet. The Clone Wars Legacy story reel from the unfinished Crystal Crisis on Utapau episodes revealed that General Grievous went to Utapau prior to Revenge of the Sith in order to acquire an enormous kyber crystal, which was required to power the Death Star's super laser. A hologram from the original Death Star is briefly visible in a scene at the Resistance base in The Force Awakens and used as a means of comparison with one from the First Order's own superweapon, Starkiller Base. (The Planet Ilum) In the animated series Star Wars Rebels, the two-part episode \\"Ghost of Geonosis\\" hinted that the Geonosians were nearly wiped out to extinction out of the Empire's need for secrecy. Saw Gerrera, having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \\"In the Name of the Rebellion.\\" Though it was a dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system. The anthology film Rogue One focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of A New Hope. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of Jedha, and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of A New Hope. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor. Rogue One also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Near the end of Rogue One, a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. This is consistent with the canon continuity in Star Wars, since the destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star fired the superlaser with all reactors employed so Tarkin could declare the battlestation \\"fully operational\\". The canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors and catering staff. The first Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers. The 2014 book Star Wars: Tarkin detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him. It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the Project but then turned on him. =Second Death Star= The second Death Star Return of the Jedi features the DS-2 Orbital Battle Station still under construction as it orbits the forest moon of the planet Endor. Besides it being larger, it also fixed the flaws found in its predecessor, so the Rebel Alliance's only hope is to destroy it prior to its completion. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet operational in order to lure the Alliance fleet into a trap, resulting in the decisive Battle of Endor. Compared to its predecessor, the second Death Star's superlaser is more advanced as it can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24 hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller targets such as capital ships. The unfinished battle station had been protected by a planetary shield projector deployed on the forest moon of Endor, but this was taken out by a ground assault team led by Han Solo with the help of the native Ewoks. Rebel pilots Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian flew into the reactor core, with Antilles in his X-wing first taking out the power regulator with proton torpedoes, and Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon (co-piloted by Nien Nunb) striking the main reactor with concussion missiles, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the battle station. An early draft of the film featured two Death Stars at various stages of completion. The second Death Star is featured in the cover of the book Star Wars: Aftermath (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the second Death Star, as well as the events directly after its destruction. One of the main characters in the story personally escaped the explosion of the Death Star. The destruction of the second Death Star was also shown in holograms in the book. The 2015 comic book Star Wars: Shattered Empire also explores the days following the destruction of the second Death Star from the perspective of Poe Dameron's parents, who were pilots during the event. The video game Star Wars: Uprising also takes place during the aftermath of the second Death Star's destruction, and features a hologram of its description on multiple occasions in and out of cutscenes. Part of the wreckage of the second Death Star appears in The Rise of Skywalker (2019), on the ocean moon Kef Bir. Rey visits the wreckage to obtain Emperor Palpatine's wayfinder, a device that points the way to his hidden lair on Exegol. =Similar superweapons= The 2019 comic Star Wars #68 reveals that the Rebels considered creating their own version of a Death Star by luring Star Destroyers to a tectonically unstable planet and setting it off with proton detonators. Starkiller Base The Force Awakens features Starkiller Base, the kyber crystal-rich planet called Ilum converted into a superweapon built by the First Order. Significantly larger than either the first or second Death Star, and unlike either of those cost-prohibitive space stations, this superweapon cut costs by terraforming an existing planet. The base draws its raw firepower directly from a star but it requires time to draw enough energy‚Äîthis stored energy is enough to obliterate multiple planets at once, making it a far deadlier superweapon than the Death Star. In the film, the weapon is used to simultaneously destroy five New Republic planets within the same star system. General Hux gives an incendiary speech while Starkiller Base demonstrates its lethality by obliterating the five planets of the Hosnian Prime system (at that time the location of the New Republic's government, which rotated every few years). After Rey was captured by Kylo Ren, he interrogated her within the base. Han, Chewbacca and Finn approached the base at light-speed because Starkiller's shield kept out anything going under the speed of light. They found Rey and successfully lowered the protective shields, enabling an X-wing assault led by Poe Dameron and Nien Nunb to destroy the superweapon, with Poe firing the crucial, destructive shots. As the Resistance forces flee, the base implodes, forming a star. The name Starkiller Base pays homage to the early drafts of the original Star Wars film, referring to Luke Skywalker's original surname. Coincidentally, the name \\"Starkiller\\" is an alias given to Galen Marek by Darth Vader in the 2008 game, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. During early concept development, artist Doug Chiang envisioned the superweapon's gun as set inside a volcano, which X-wings would have to enter in a maneuver similar to the trench run on the Death Star in the original film. Final Order In The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth installment in the series, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine is revealed to have created a shadow empire on the hidden planet of Exegol, where his servants constructed thousands of Xyston-class Star Destroyers. Each of these vessels was armed with an axial superlaser that could destroy planets; one of these ships was deployed ahead of the main fleet and used to destroy a planet known to harbor Resistance members. Later, a small force of Resistance ships was forced to confront the entire fleet of Sith Star Destroyers; at the moment before they would be overwhelmed, however, surprise reinforcements from all over the galaxy led by Lando Calrissian arrived and wiped out the fleet of planet-killers. =Legends= Both Death Stars and similar superweapons appear throughout the non-canonical Star Wars Legends continuity. National Public Radio's A New Hope adaptation (1981) portrays Leia (Ann Sachs) and Bail Organa's (Stephen Elliott) discovery of the Death Star's existence and how Leia obtained its schematics. The 1983 Star Wars arcade game and numerous LucasArts titles recreate the movies' attacks on the Death Stars. Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Academy trilogy (1994) introduces the Maw Cluster of black holes that protect a laboratory where the Death Star prototype was built (consisting of the superstructure, power core, and superlaser). The first level of LucasArts' Dark Forces (1995) gives mercenary Kyle Katarn the role of stealing the plans which are subsequently given to Leia. Steve Perry's novel Shadows of the Empire (1996) describes a mission that leads to the Rebels learning of the second Death Star's existence, and that mission is playable in LucasArts' X-Wing Alliance combat flight simulator (1999). The Death Star itself is a controllable weapon for the Empire in the Rebellion (1998) and Empire at War (2006) strategy game. In Battlefront II (2005), the player participates in a mission to secure crystals used in the Death Star's superlaser. Another mission in the game tasks the player with acting as a stormtrooper or Darth Vader in an attempt to recover the plans and capture Leia. The first Death Star under construction acts as the final stage in the video game The Force Unleashed (2008). The first Death Star's construction is the subject of Michael Reaves and Steve Perry's novel Death Star (2007), which depicts the many politics and hidden agendas behind the massive project, from its construction up until its final destruction. The hardcover edition charted on the US bestsellers list in its first week after release.(October 29, 2007). \\"Hardcover Bestsellers: Fiction\\", Publishers Weekly 254 (43): 12. The first Death Star is depicted in various sources of having a crew of 265,675, as well as 52,276 gunners, 607,360 troops, 30,984 stormtroopers, 42,782 ship support staff, and 180,216 pilots and support crew. Its hangars contain assault shuttles, blastboats, Strike cruisers, land vehicles, support ships, and 7,293 TIE fighters. It is also protected by 10,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,600 ion cannons, and at least 768 tractor beam projectors. Various sources state that the first Death Star has a diameter of between 140 and 160 kilometers. There is a broader range of figures for the second Death Star's diameter, ranging from 160 to 900 kilometers. DS-X Prototype Battle Station In the Legends works Death Star (2007), Dark Empire II, Jedi Search and Champions of the Force, an experimental Death Star prototype, DS-X (a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a control room) was conceived by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as a test bed for the first Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable \\"dead planet\\". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel. Although Star Wars creator George Lucas confirmed that the plans featured in Attack of the Clones and the under-construction facility in Revenge of the Sith was the original Death Star, Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology retconned the DS-X prototype into being separate from the main Death Star. Death Star III In the Disney attraction Star Tours - The Adventures Continue, guests can travel inside an incomplete Death Star during one of the randomized ride sequences. In the original Star Tours, a Death Star III is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. Leland Chee originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the Star Tours ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed. The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before. It is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The Habitation spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire. In the Legends game Star Wars: Tiny Death Star, a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third Death Star. Other superweapons A prototype version of the Death Star can be found in Kevin J. Anderson's novel Jedi Search (1994). It was kept at the Maw Installation, an Imperial research institute in a cluster of black holes, and later deployed by Tol Sivron after the Maw Installation was invaded by the New Republic. The prototype was ineffective, missing its target and instead destroying an Imperial garrison moon the sole time it was fired in combat. After this, the prototype was later destroyed when it was led into the black holes of the cluster. In the original Marvel Star Wars comic series, a superweapon called \\"The Tarkin\\" is built. It is described as being similar to the Death Star but with more energy. Darth Vader commands it and Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, , and R2-D2 sabotage it with Lando's help. It is finally destroyed by an Imperial officer attempting to use an ionic weapon to both attack the escaping Rebels and assassinate Vader. In the Dark Empire comic series (1991‚Äì95), the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships Eclipse and Eclipse II Super Star Destroyers (Star Dreadnoughts) have a miniaturized version of the Death Star superlaser. The first Eclipse was under construction at the time of the Emperor's death at Endor; shortly thereafter, it was briefly captured by pirates, who quickly abandoned it as an obvious target for the Rebels. The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The Eclipse II was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of Byss. In Kevin J. Anderson's novel Darksaber (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon. Due to their refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the project, the resultant 'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a combination of the tumultuous Hoth asteroid field in which it was built and the efforts of the New Republic. Lemelisk is captured and incarcerated by the Republic, and is later executed for his hand in the design and construction of Imperial superweapons. The novel Children of the Jedi (1995) involves the return of Eye of Palpatine, a \\"colossal, asteroid- shaped\\" super dreadnaught constructed at the behest of Emperor Palpatine during the second year of the Galactic Civil War. The Imperials lose control of the Eye when a Jedi uses the Force to hijack the main computer with their spirits. Cultural influence The Death Star placed ninth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll of the most popular movie weapons. It has been referred to outside of the Star Wars context in such examples as: * AT&T; Corporation's logo introduced in 1982 is informally referred to as the \\"Death Star\\". Ars Technica referred to \\"the AT&T; Death Star\\" in an article criticizing a company data policy. Competitor T-Mobile mocked AT&T;'s \\"Death Star\\" logo and \\"Empire-like reputation\\" in a press release. * In Kevin Smith's first feature film, Clerks (1994), one of the main characters points out that many independent contractors would have been killed in the second Death Star's destruction. In the DVD audio commentary for Attack of the Clones, George Lucas says that the inclusion of the holographic Death Star in the film implies that the Geonosians were the contractors discussed by \\"Jay and Silent Bob\\". * KTCK (SportsRadio 1310 The Ticket) in Dallas were the first to use the term \\"Death Star\\" to describe the new mammoth Cowboys Stadium, now AT&T; Stadium, in Arlington, Texas. The term has since spread to local media and is generally accepted as a nickname for the stadium. * The Death Star strategy was the name Enron gave to one of their fraudulent business practices for manipulating California's energy market. * In the novels of the Bridge Trilogy, the San Francisco Police Department admonishes its officers to stop referring to their surveillance satellite as the \\"Death Star\\". * The video game Sonic The Hedgehog 2 features a parody of the Death Star known as the Death Egg, a battle station created by Dr. Eggman that serves as the final level. * Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign has referred to itself as the \\"Death Star\\". * Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis dubed the nickname of the team's new Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada as the \\"Death Star\\". Herschel) of the Saturnian moon Mimas gives it a resemblance to the Death Star. =Science= In 1981, following the Voyager spacecraft's flight past Saturn, scientists noticed a resemblance between one of the planet's moons, Mimas, and the Death Star. Additionally, a few astronomers sometimes use the term \\"Death Star\\" to describe Nemesis, a hypothetical star postulated in 1984 to be responsible for gravitationally forcing comets and asteroids from the Oort cloud toward Earth. =Merchandise= Kenner and AMT created a playset and a model, respectively, of the first Death Star. In 2005 and 2008, Lego released models of Death Star II and Death Star I, respectively. In 1979, Palitoy created a heavy card version of the Death Star as a playset for the vintage range of action figures in the UK, Australia and Canada. Both Death Stars are part of different Micro Machines three-packs. The Death Stars and locations in them are cards in Decipher, Inc.'s and Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. Hasbro released a Death Star model that transforms into a Darth Vader mech. Estes Industries released a flying model rocket version. A Death Star trinket box was also released by Royal Selangor in 2015, in conjunction with the December screening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens that year, and in 2016, Plox released the official levitating Death Star Speaker in anticipation of that year's screening of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. =Petitions= In 2012‚Äì13, a proposal on the White House's website urging the United States government to build a real Death Star as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 30,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response was released in January 2013: the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $850 quadrillion by the Lehigh University, or about 13,000 times the amount of mineable resources on Earth, while the International Business Times cited a Centives economics blog calculation that, at current rates of steel production, the Death Star would not be ready for more than 833,000 years. The White House response also stated \\"the Administration does not support blowing up planets,\\" and questioned funding a weapon \\"with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship\\" as reasons for denying the petition. The Luxembourgish magician Christian Lavey (born as Christian Kies) submitted a petition for the construction of a Death Star to the Luxemburgish parliament. However, on an interview with a local radio station Lavey admitted that this petition was just a joke and some kind of protest against the space plans of the government.

The series was directed by K≈çichi Mashimo, with Yoko Kikuchi, Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi in charge of character designs, Kenji Teraoka in charge of mechanical design, and Yuki Kajiura composing the music. The DVD version was released by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. The series follows the story of two young female assassins who embark together on a personal journey to seek answers about mysteries from their past. While they seem to be only vaguely related to each other at first, there are clues and hints given throughout the series that there is more than what meets their eyes. During the course of the series, they are lured into more and more traps by a secret organization named Les Soldats (\\"The Soldiers\\" in French). Noir was followed by two spiritual successors, Madlax and El Cazador de la Bruja. Together, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the \\"girls-with-guns\\" genre.  Plot  Opening introduction, Kirika's-(later with Mireille) voice over towards the audience: The series follows the story of two young female assassins, the Corsican Mireille Bouquet and the Japanese amnesiac Kirika Yuumura, who embark together on a personal journey to seek answers about mysteries concerning their past. At first, they seem to be only vaguely related to each other, but there are clues and hints given throughout the series that there is more going on behind the scenes than at first glance. In their journey to learn more about Kirika's lost memories and her connection to Mireille, the two form an alliance and begin performing assassinations under the code name \\"Noir.\\" During the course of the series, they are lured into more and more traps by a secret organization named Les Soldats (\\"The Soldiers\\" in French). Les Soldats are a secret organization that has been a part, yet separate group of humanity. It is this hidden group that created and once completely controlled the deadly duo \\"Noir\\". Each time that Les Soldats soldiers are sent to kill Mireille and Kirika, it is considered a test as to whether or not the young women are suitable to carry the title \\"Noir\\".  Characters  The main characters; clockwise from top: Altena, Chloe, Kirika, and Mireille ; : Kirika is a teenage high school girl with amnesia who lives in Japan, however during her journey she goes to stay with Mireille in her apartment which resides in Paris; the only things she remembers are the word Noir and her instinctual killing abilities. When creating the characters for Noir, producer Shigeru Kitayama wanted the image of Kirika to be \\"sweet and fragile\\". She is voiced by H≈çko Kuwashima in the Japanese version, and by Monica Rial in the English dub. ; : Mireille is a Corsican woman born into a powerful crime family. Mireille and her uncle are the sole survivors of a brutal attack on her family, whereafter he trained her to become an assassin. When creating the character for Noir, Shigeru Kitayama imagined Mireille as \\"a lithe female panther\\". The voice actor for Mireille is Kotono Mitsuishi, who had previously worked with Kitayama on Excel Saga, where Mitsuishi voiced the protagonist Excel; the first thing she was told was that Excel and Mireille are completely opposite characters. In the English dub, Mireille is voiced by Shelley Calene- Black; ADV Films decided against giving Mireille a Corsican accent so as to avoid confusion among viewers unfamiliar with the language. ; : Chloe is a skilled assassin who uses throwing and handheld knives instead of guns. Like Kirika and Mireille, Chloe is a candidate to become Noir. Chloe idolizes Kirika for her exceptional killing skills, and she believes that she and Kirika are destined to become Noir together. She is the personal favorite character of Noir's composer Yuki Kajiura. She is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in the Japanese version, and Hilary Haag in the English dub. ; : Altena is the high priestess of the Soldats. She believes that the Soldats have been corrupted by power and greed, and she attempts to return the Soldats to its \\"original state\\" by reviving Noir. She lives a medieval lifestyle in a place the Soldats consider as their holy site called \\"The Manor\\", located somewhere on the border between France and Spain, where she raised and trained Chloe. She is voiced by Tarako in the Japanese version, and Tiffany Grant in the English dub.  Setting  Unlike its spiritual successors Madlax and El Cazador de la Bruja, Noir is mainly about reality's criminal underworld while the later two are about supernatural events. Mireille and Kirika, in episode four, check the profile of a fifteen-year-old student named Rosaly Hammond, discovering that she was born in August 2, 1994. As Rosaly would be turning sixteen, Noir thus takes place approximately between 2010 and 2011.Noir, episode 4 (11:11): When Kirika checks Rosaly Hammond's profile. = Les Soldats = Les Soldats (\\"The Soldiers\\" in French) is a mysterious organization in Noir. According to Altena, a thousand years ago, a group of people who had survived a bloody war that cost numerous lives, formed a group called Les Soldats to protect the weak and take revenge on the world.Noir, episode 20: Altena tells Chloe about Soldats' history. When Kirika travels to a Soldats' village, she finds out that during the late tenth century, Les Soldats has taken place in every social part of humankind. For example, Soldats were witnessed at the birth of the Greone's mafia family, which was created 200 years ago from the time the series began.Noir, episode 09: \\"Intocabile Act II\\". Near the end of the series, Altena states that \\"Les Soldats\\" have been consumed by the very greed they once swore to undo, and thus had become like the world itself. Although the Soldats were founded by a united group, in Noir its members were separated into two groups: Altena's followers and her opposers, the Soldats' Council members. For easy identification, Altena's most loyal followers are include people who dress up as nunsNoir, episode 24: Dark Return. and common villagers who are skilled at fightingNoir, episode 22: \\"Journey's End\\". These nuns and priestesses often appear to be ordinary, petite women, they are capable of using guns and other lethal weapons. Altena lives in a manor not located on any map but is near the border of France and Spain.Noir, episode 22: Kirika's conversation with a Soldats' villager. It is known by name \\"the place which has been forgotten by time\\". The manor's structure is similar to those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Separated from the manor by mountains, there is a village which belongs to Altena, and their ancient task is to guard her manor. The Soldats' Council are the people who disagreed with Altena's decision to bring back the True Noir by means of a ritual called the Grand Retour. The Council contains five members,Noir, episode 26: \\"Rebirth\\". and one of them, Remy Brefford, invites Mireille to join their ranks, and he has an office in a building in Paris.Noir, episode 23: Mireille attacks Brefford's building. Men in black suits are often sent by the Soldats to try to kill the Noir candidates, but the faction affiliate of these men is unclear. Altena successfully manipulates everyone in the group, and she particularly targets the three Noir candidates Chloe, Kirika, and Mireille. She hides her true agenda from the Soldats, even her most trusted advisers, until the end. Altena led the Soldats to believe that she wanted Chloe and Kirika to be the True Noir, to enforce the will of the Soldats. However, she believed that Mireille and Kirika would enact her true plan, to destroy the Soldats. Altena's plan was not fully successful because Mireille did not target the Council at the end of the series. = Noir = Noir is the French word for \\"black\\". In Noir, it is known as the name of the two maidens who govern death. Pictures and sculptures of the two maidens can be seen on Mireille's father's watch and on Soldats' churches. To the underworld, it is known as the \\"One Thousand Year\\" darkness of Europe. According to Altena's story, when the Soldats went under, two hands were left on the surface, so their ancient task is to retrieve the two maidens known as \\"Noir\\". The ritual to become Noir takes place under Altena's manor, an underground temple in the style of ancient Greek ruins. Throughout the series, the only three candidates for \\"Noir\\" are Mireille Bouquet, Kirika Yuumura and Chloe. Of all the three, Mireille was the only who was predicted to be neglected, and Kirika probably is the only who can turn into True Noir.Noir, episode 24: Altena's conversation with Borne.Noir, episode 22: Kirika became True Noir after witnessed the assault on the village. When one has fallen, the remaining two shall become Noir.  Production  According to the director K≈çichi Mashimo, he envisioned Noir and Madlax as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become El Cazador de la Bruja. For Mireille's personal sidearm, Mashimo wanted a gun with \\"a more modern image\\", therefore the production staff decided on the Walther P99. After considering several compact pistols, including the Walther PPK and the Glock 26, for Kirika's personal sidearm, the Beretta M1934 became the weapon of choice, because of its \\"classic, European feel\\" that suited the premise of the series' story. Because of the organization's premise, European guns were chosen for the members of Les Soldats. The assassins in black suits that are sent after the protagonists throughout the series all carry the SIG Pro 2340, which at the time of production was the newest model of its line, while other members were given increasingly older weapons, depending on the member's rank. According to producer Shigeru Kitayama, Kotono Mitsuishi's voicing of Mireille was a continuation of the working relationship they had from creating Excel Saga, where Mitsuishi voiced the protagonist Excel.

Live-action remake A possible live action feature based on the anime series has been planned for development by the cable television network Starz. Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena: Warrior Princess, Legend of the Seeker) are the executive producers for the project. Stephen Lightfoot was serving as executive producer and writer but was replaced by Sean Jablonski. In June 2011, Starz gave a greenlight to the show with a straight to series order. The number of episodes of the first season has yet to be determined, though some speculated it will likely be in the 8‚Äì13 episode range. In March 2012, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht commented that production has been put on hiatus as he states in an interview, \\"We're in a bit of holding pattern with Noir.\\" Then in December of that year, two new writers, Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff, were announced to have joined the project and were undertaking re-writes of Jablonski's scripts. By January 2013, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht announced that the project remained at a standstill citing difficulty to get the project creatively to a good place. Reception Newtype ranked Noir second in its top 10 list of anime of the year 2001. Noir also made a top three place in the top 20 anime in Japan chart by Anihabara! in October 2001.Anihabara! In the June 2002 issue of Animage, Noir was voted by the magazine's readers onto a shared 10th place in the best 20 new anime of 2001 in Japan. Josh Mohs of Active Anime commented that \\"Noir doesn't fail to deliver mystery, action, and drama.\\" Though he lamented \\"some pacing problems, especially towards the beginning of the series,\\" he lauded the character interactions as well as the series' \\"job of tying together all its inherent sub-plots\\" and the director's \\"bold move\\" in leaving \\"the ending open to viewer interpretation.\\" In a review of the first DVD compilation by ADV Films, Jeremy Conrad of IGN lauded the series for being \\"stylistic\\", stating that \\"It oozes style\\", and for its \\"extremely cool\\" fight choreography and \\"great\\" shootouts, saying that \\"What Noir does right is its action.\\" He also noted the series' character design as being \\"solid\\" and the series' soundtrack as being \\"excellent\\", reminiscent of \\"√âric Serra's stuff in movies such as La Femme Nikita, but lamented about the slowed pace at the end of the volume, stating that \\"some of the story stuff they were trying to do [in the fourth and fifth episodes] was snooze inducing.\\" Josh Mohs of Active Anime commentEd that Noirs \\"strong character interactions are usually enough to pull you through\\" the pacing problems he saw with the series and further states that, along with the series' \\"unique twists\\", the \\"intriguing character dynamic definitely elevate[s] it above the rest of the competition.\\" Kirika had been voted with Mireille as two of the top ten female anime characters by Newtype in 2001.Newtype top 10 Anime - Anime News Network Anime News Network's Theron Martin, ten years after the show's original run, commented that Noir \\"was at least to some degree an influential title\\" and \\"is still recognized as one of the preeminent titles of its type because it redefined what a 'girls with guns' title could be.\\" He went on to praise the show for its \\"sleek, elegant story\\" and called it \\"anime's most pronounced homage to classic film noir\\". He named Mireille and Kirika \\"one of anime's most iconic female teams\\" along with the Dirty Pair and credited Kirika as \\"a precursor of the moe craze that came along later in the decade.\\" He named \\"The Lost Kitten\\" as the series' episode with the best story content, and the double episode \\"The Intoccabile\\" as having the worst, noting its \\"hackneyed look into the Cosa Nostra\\". He lamented repetitiveness in action sequences and excessive reuse of scenes especially in early episodes as well as the absence of blood in light of the show's high body count. He showed himself unimpressed with the animation quality, but lauded the show's good looks, in particular those of the environments. He named the \\"tendency for repetitiveness\\" of its first half as the soundtrack's \\"only real flaw\\" and praised the pieces \\"Salva Nos\\" and \\"Canta Per Me\\" as \\"stand[ing] among the all-time great anime themes\\". About the English version, he commented that the \\"casting choices fit and match up well against the original performances\\" and that the \\"script stays tight enough to avoid garnering any accuracy complaints\\". In conclusion, he said \\"the series works in the ways that it is supposed to work and should keep viewers thoroughly involved through to the end.\\"  Notes   References  * External links * Official website of JVC * Official website of Funimation Entertainment  * 2001 anime television series Adventure anime and manga ADV Films Anime composed by Yuki Kajiura Anime with original screenplays Bee Train Production Funimation Girls with guns anime and manga Madman Entertainment anime Noir (TV series) Revenge in anime and manga TV Tokyo original programming ","title":"Noir (TV series)"},{"id":"53892","text":"The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (; OKW, , \\"High Command of the Armed Forces\\") was the High Command of the Wehrmacht (armed forces) of Nazi Germany. Created in 1938, the OKW replaced the Reich War Ministry and had nominal oversight over the German Army, the Kriegsmarine (navy), and the Luftwaffe (air force). Rivalry with the armed services branch commands, mainly with the Army High Command (the OKH), prevented the OKW from becoming a unified German General Staff in an effective chain of command. It did help coordinate operations between the three services. During the war, the OKW, subordinate to Adolf Hitler as Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, acquired more and more operational powers. By 1942, OKW had responsibility for all theatres except for the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. However, Hitler manipulated the system in order to prevent any one command from taking a dominant role in decision making. This \\"divide and conquer\\" method helped put most military decisions in Hitler's own hands, which at times included even those affecting engagements at the battalion level.  Genesis  The OKW was established by decree of 4 February 1938 in the aftermath of the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair, which had led to the dismissal of the head of the Reich War Ministry and Commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht, Generalfeldmarschall Werner von Blomberg. Hitler took the chance to get rid of his critics within the armed forces. The Ministry was dissolved and replaced with the OKW led by General Wilhelm Keitel in the rank of a Reich Minister, with Alfred Jodl as Chief of the Operations Staff. Nevertheless, all Supreme Commanders of the armed service branches, like OKH Chief General Walther von Brauchitsch, had direct access to Hitler and were able to circumvent Keitel's command. The appointments made to the OKW and the motive behind the reorganization are commonly thought to be Hitler's desire to consolidate power and authority around his position as F√ºhrer and Reich Chancellor (F√ºhrer und Reichskanzler), to the detriment of the military leadership of the Wehrmacht. Furthermore, Hitler did not want to create a tri- service joint command, or appointment of a single joint Chief of Staff, as he feared it would break his image of having the \\"Midas touch\\" concerning military strategy.  Organization  By June 1938, the OKW comprised four departments: * Wehrmacht-F√ºhrungsamt (WFA, renamed Wehrmachtf√ºhrungsstab (Wfst) in August 1940) ‚Äì operational orders. Chief: Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, 1 September 1939 ‚Äì 8 May 1945  Abteilung Landesverteidigungsf√ºhrungsamt (WFA/L) a subdepartment through which all details of operational planning were worked out, and from which all operational orders were communicated to the OKW. Chief: Major General Walter Warlimont, 1 September 1939 ‚Äì 6 September 1944; Major General Horst Freiherr Treusch von Buttlar-Brandenfels, 6 September 1944 ‚Äì 30 November 1944; General August Winter, 1 December 1944 ‚Äì 23 April 1945  Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops: its function was to produce and disseminate propaganda materials aimed at the German troops and the population. Commanded by General Hasso von Wedel (1 September 1939 ‚Äì 8 May 1945), the department oversaw the numerous propaganda companies (Propagandakompanie) of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, attached to the fighting troops. At its peak in 1942, the propaganda troops included 15,000 men. Among the propaganda materials produced was the Wehrmachtbericht, the official news communiqu√© about the military situation of Germany, and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption.  Heeresstab ‚Äì army staff. Chief: General Walther Buhle, 15 February 1942 ‚Äì 8 May 1945  Inspekteur der Wehrmachtnachrichtenverb√§nde ‚Äì Chief of Staff, Wehrmacht signal corps * Amt Ausland/Abwehr ‚Äì foreign intelligence.  Zentralabteilung ‚Äì central department. Chief: Major General Hans Oster, 1 September 1939 ‚Äì January 1944  Abteilung Ausland ‚Äì foreign. Chief: Admiral Leopold B√ºrkner, 15 June 1938 -  Abteilung I, Nachrichtenbeschaffung ‚Äì intelligence. Chief: Colonel Hans Piepenbrock, 1 September 1939 ‚Äì March 1943; Colonel Georg Hansen, March 1943 ‚Äì February 1944  Abteilung II, Sonderdienst ‚Äì special service. Chief: Colonel Erwin von Lahousen, 1 September 1939 ‚Äì July 1943; Colonel Wessel Freytag von Loringhoven, July 1943 ‚Äì June 1944  Abteilung III, Abwehr ‚Äì counter-intelligence. Chief: Colonel Franz Eccard von Bentivegni, 1 March 1941 -  Auslands(telegramm)pr√ºfstelle ‚Äì foreign communications * Wirtschafts und R√ºstungsamt ‚Äì supply matters * Amtsgruppe Allgemeine Wehrmachtsangelegenheiten ‚Äì miscellaneous matters.  Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) ‚Äì information centre for war casualties and prisoners of war The WFA replaced the Wehrmachtsamt (Armed Forces Office) which had existed between 1935 and 1938 within the Reich War Ministry, headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. Hitler promoted Keitel to Chief of the OKW (Chef des OKW), i.e. Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. As head of the WFA, Keitel appointed Max von Viebahn although after two months he was removed from command, and this post was not refilled until the promotion of Alfred Jodl. To replace Jodl at Abteilung Landesverteidigungsf√ºhrungsamt (WFA/L), Walther Warlimont was appointed. In December 1941 further changes took place with Abteilung Landesverteidigungsf√ºhrungsamt (WFA/L) being merged into the Wehrmacht- F√ºhrungsamt and losing its role as a subordinate organization. These changes were largely cosmetic however as key staff remained in post and continued to fulfill the same duties. The OKW directed the operations of the German Armed Forces during World War II. The OKW was almost always represented at daily situation conferences (Lagevortr√§ge) by Jodl, Keitel, and the officer serving as Hitler's adjutant. During these conferences situation reports prepared by the head of WFA/L would be delivered to Hitler and then discussed. Following these discussions, Hitler would issue further operational orders. These orders were then relayed back to WFA/L by Jodl along with the minutes of the meeting. These would then be converted into orders for issuance to the appropriate commanders.  Leadership  ;Chief of the OKW ;Chief of Operations Staff  Operation  Officially, the OKW served as the military general staff for the Third Reich, coordinating the efforts of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (Heer, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe). In practice, the OKW acted as Hitler's personal military staff, translating his ideas into military orders, and issuing them to the three services while having little control over them. However, as the war progressed the OKW found itself exercising increasing amounts of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the West. This created a situation such that by 1942 the OKW held the de facto command of Western forces while the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, OKH) exercised de facto command of the Eastern Front. It was not until 28 April 1945 (two days before his suicide) that Hitler placed OKH under OKW, giving OKW command of forces on the Eastern Front. Setting different parts of the Nazi bureaucracy to compete for his favor in areas where their administration overlapped was a standard tactic employed by Hitler to reinforce his authority; and just as in other areas of government, there was a rivalry between the OKW and the OKH. Since most German operations during World War II were Army controlled (with Luftwaffe support), the OKH demanded control over German military forces. Nevertheless, Hitler decided against the OKH and in favor of the OKW overseeing operations in many land theaters. As the war progressed, more and more influence moved from the OKH to the OKW, with Norway being the first \\"OKW war theater\\". More and more areas came under complete control of the OKW. Finally only the Eastern Front remained the domain of the OKH. However, as the Eastern Front was by far the primary battlefield of the German military, the OKH was still influential, particularly when on 19 December 1941 Hitler himself succeeded Walther von Brauchitsch as commander-in-chief of the OKH (Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres) during the Battle of Moscow. The OKW ran military operations on the Western front, in North Africa, and in Italy. In the west, operations were further split between the OKW and Oberbefehlshaber West (OBW, Commander in Chief West), who was Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt (succeeded by Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge). There was even more fragmentation since the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe operations had their own commands (Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) and Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL)) which, while theoretically subordinate, were largely independent from the OKW or the OBW. During the entire period of the war, the OKW was led by Keitel, who reported directly to Hitler, from whom most operational orders actually originated as Oberster Befehlshaber der Wehrmacht (Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces). Albrecht von Hagen, a member of the failed assassination attempt on Hitler on 20 July 1944, was stationed here to be responsible for the courier service between military posts in Berlin and Hitler's secret military headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair.  International Military Tribunal  During the Nuremberg Trials, the OKW was indicted but acquitted of being a criminal organization because of Article 9 of the charter of the international military tribunal. Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl were both convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. During the subsequent High Command Trial in 1947/48, fourteen Wehrmacht officers were charged with war crimes, especially for the Commissar Order to shoot Red Army political commissars in German-occupied countries, the killing of POWs and participation in the Holocaust. Eleven defendants received prison sentences ranging from three years including time served to lifetime imprisonment, two were acquitted on all counts, and one committed suicide during the trial.

It fell into decline in the summer of 1725, but was revived in 1781, thanks to the efforts of Slovene Enlightenment figures.

Two early Archaic Doric order Greek temples at Paestum (Italy) with much wider capitals than later Entry to the Biblioth√®que Mazarine (Paris), with four Doric columns in this photo The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian. The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns. Originating in the western Doric region of Greece, it is the earliest and, in its essence, the simplest of the orders, though still with complex details in the entablature above. The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced,Art a Brief History 6th Edition and had no base, dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood. The capital was a simple circular form, with some mouldings, under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions, but later more restrained. Above a plain architrave, the complexity comes in the frieze, where the two features originally unique to the Doric, the triglyph and guttae, are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples.Summerson, 13-14 In stone they are purely ornamental. The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these, and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament, as well as often using plain columns. More often they used versions of the Tuscan order, elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers, which is in effect a simplified Doric, with un- fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards; often earlier Greek versions were used, with wider columns and no bases to them. The ancient architect and architectural historian Vitruvius associates the Doric with masculine proportions (the Ionic representing the feminine).Summerson, 14-15 It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use. When the three orders are superposed, it is usual for the Doric to be at the bottom, with the Ionic and then the Corinthian above, and the Doric, as \\"strongest\\", is often used on the ground floor below another order in the storey above.Palladio, First Book, Chapter 12 History =Greek= Temple of the Delians, Delos; 19th-century pen-and-wash drawing In their original Greek version, Doric columns stood directly on the flat pavement (the stylobate) of a temple without a base. With a height only four to eight times their diameter, the columns were the most squat of all the classical orders; their vertical shafts were fluted with 20 parallel concave grooves; and they were topped by a smooth capital that flared from the column to meet a square abacus at the intersection with the horizontal beam (architrave) that they carried. The Parthenon has the Doric design columns. It was most popular in the Archaic Period (750‚Äì480 BC) in mainland Greece, and also found in Magna Graecia (southern Italy), as in the three temples at Paestum. These are in the Archaic Doric, where the capitals spread wide from the column compared to later Classical forms, as exemplified in the Parthenon. Pronounced features of both Greek and Roman versions of the Doric order are the alternating triglyphs and metopes. The triglyphs are decoratively grooved with two vertical grooves (\\"tri-glyph\\") and represent the original wooden end-beams, which rest on the plain architrave that occupies the lower half of the entablature. Under each triglyph are peglike \\"stagons\\" or \\"guttae\\" (literally: drops) that appear as if they were hammered in from below to stabilize the post-and-beam (trabeated) construction. They also served to \\"organize\\" rainwater runoff from above. The spaces between the triglyphs are the \\"metopes\\". They may be left plain, or they may be carved in low relief.Summerson, 13‚Äì15, 126 The Doric corner conflict Spacing the triglyphs The spacing of the triglyphs caused problems which took some time to resolve. A triglyph is centered above every column, with another (or sometimes two) between columns, though the Greeks felt that the corner triglyph should form the corner of the entablature, creating an inharmonious mismatch with the supporting column. The architecture followed rules of harmony. Since the original design probably came from wooden temples and the triglyphs were real heads of wooden beams, every column had to bear a beam which lay across the centre of the column. Triglyphs were arranged regularly; the last triglyph was centred upon the last column (illustration, right: I.). This was regarded as the ideal solution which had to be reached. Changing to stone cubes instead of wooden beams required full support of the architrave load at the last column. At the first temples the final triglyph was moved (illustration, right: II.), still terminating the sequence, but leaving a gap disturbing the regular order. Even worse, the last triglyph was not centered with the corresponding column. That \\"archaic\\" manner was not regarded as a harmonious design. The resulting problem is called the doric corner conflict. Another approach was to apply a broader corner triglyph (III.) but was not really satisfying. Because the metopes are somewhat flexible in their proportions, the modular space between columns (\\"intercolumniation\\") can be adjusted by the architect. Often the last two columns were set slightly closer together (corner contraction), to give a subtle visual strengthening to the corners. That is called the \\"classic\\" solution of the corner conflict (IV.). Triglyphs could be arranged in a harmonic manner again, and the corner was terminated with a triglyph, though the final triglyph and column were often not centered. Roman aesthetics did not demand that a triglyph form the corner, and filled it with a half (demi-) metope, allowing triglyphs centered over columns (illustration, right, V.). Temples There are many theories as to the origins of the Doric order in temples. The term Doric is believed to have originated from the Greek- speaking Dorian tribes.Ian Jenkins, Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2006), 15. One belief is that the Doric order is the result of early wood prototypes of previous temples.Idid. 16. With no hard proof and the sudden appearance of stone temples from one period after the other, this becomes mostly speculation. Another belief is that the Doric was inspired by the architecture of Egypt.Ibid. 16-17. With the Greeks being present in Ancient Egypt as soon the 7th-century BC, it is possible that Greek traders were inspired by the structures they saw in what they would consider foreign land. Finally, another theory states that the inspiration for the Doric came from Mycenae. At the ruins of this civilization lies architecture very similar to the Doric order. It is also in Greece, which would make it very accessible. Some of the earliest examples of the Doric order come from the 7th-century BC. These examples include the Temple of Apollo at Corinth and the Temple of Zeus at Nemea.Robin F. Rhodes, \\"Early Corinthian Architecture and the Origins of the Doric Order\\" in the American Journal of Archaeology 91, no. 3 (1987), 478. Other examples of the Doric order include the 6th-century BC temples at Paestum in southern Italy, a region called Magna Graecia, which was settled by Greek colonists. Compared to later versions, the columns are much more massive, with a strong entasis or swelling, and wider capitals. The Temple of the Delians is a \\"peripteral\\" Doric order temple, the largest of three dedicated to Apollo on the island of Delos. It was begun in 478 BC and never completely finished. During their period of independence from Athens, the Delians reassigned the temple to the island of Poros. It is \\"hexastyle\\", with six columns across the pedimented end and thirteen along each long face. All the columns are centered under a triglyph in the frieze, except for the corner columns. The plain, unfluted shafts on the columns stand directly on the platform (the stylobate), without bases. The recessed \\"necking\\" in the nature of fluting at the top of the shafts and the wide cushionlike echinus may be interpreted as slightly self-conscious archaising features, for Delos is Apollo's ancient birthplace. However, the similar fluting at the base of the shafts might indicate an intention for the plain shafts to be capable of wrapping in drapery. A classic statement of the Greek Doric order is the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, built about 447 BC. The contemporary Parthenon, the largest temple in classical Athens, is also in the Doric order, although the sculptural enrichment is more familiar in the Ionic order: the Greeks were never as doctrinaire in the use of the Classical vocabulary as Renaissance theorists or Neoclassical architects. The detail, part of the basic vocabulary of trained architects from the later 18th century onwards, shows how the width of the metopes was flexible: here they bear the famous sculptures including the battle of Lapiths and Centaurs. The Roman Doric order from the Theater of Marcellus: triglyphs centered over the end column =Roman= In the Roman Doric version, the height of the entablature has been reduced. The endmost triglyph is centered over the column rather than occupying the corner of the architrave. The columns are slightly less robust in their proportions. Below their caps, an astragal molding encircles the column like a ring. Crown moldings soften transitions between frieze and cornice and emphasize the upper edge of the abacus, which is the upper part of the capital. Roman Doric columns also have moldings at their bases and stand on low square pads or are even raised on plinths. In the Roman Doric mode, columns are not invariably fluted. Since the Romans did not insist on a triglyph covered corner, now both columns and triglyphs could be arranged equidistantly again and centered together. The architrave corner needed to be left \\"blank,\\" which is sometimes referred to as a half, or demi-, metope (illustration, V., in Spacing the Columns above). The Roman architect Vitruvius, following contemporary practice, outlined in his treatise the procedure for laying out constructions based on a module, which he took to be one half a column's diameter, taken at the base. An illustration of Andrea Palladio's Doric order, as it was laid out, with modules identified, by Isaac Ware, in The Four Books of Palladio's Architecture (London, 1738) is illustrated at Vitruvian module. According to Vitruvius, the height of Doric columns is six or seven times the diameter at the base.\\"... they measured a man's foot, and finding its length the sixth part of his height, they gave the column a similar proportion, that is, they made its height, including the capital, six times the thickness of the shaft, measured at the base. Thus the Doric order obtained its proportion, its strength, and its beauty, from the human figure.\\" (Vitruvius, iv.6) \\"The successors of these people, improving in taste, and preferring a more slender proportion, assigned seven diameters to the height of the Doric column.\\" (Vitruvius, iv.8) This gives the Doric columns a shorter, thicker look than Ionic columns, which have 8:1 proportions. It is suggested that these proportions give the Doric columns a masculine appearance, whereas the more slender Ionic columns appear to represent a more feminine look. This sense of masculinity and femininity was often used to determine which type of column would be used for a particular structure. The most influential, and perhaps the earliest, use of the Doric in Renaissance architecture was in the circular Tempietto by Donato Bramante (1502 or later), in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome.Summerson, 41‚Äì43 Graphics of ancient forms File:Doric polychromy Die Baunkunst der Griechen.jpgOriginal Doric polychromy File:Doric-order-labeled.jpgUpper parts, labelled File:Schema Saeulenordnungen (cropped).jpgThree Greek Doric columns File:Fotothek df tg 0003893 Architektur ^ S√§ule ^ Ordnung.jpgThe Five Orders illustrated by Vignola, 1640 =Modern= The Grange (nearby Northington, England), 1804, Europe's first house designed with all external detail of a Greek temple Before Greek Revival architecture grew, initially in England, in the 18th century, the Greek or elaborated Roman Doric order had not been very widely used, though \\"Tuscan\\" types of round capitals were always popular, especially in less formal buildings. It was sometimes used in military contexts, for example the Royal Hospital Chelsea (1682 onwards, by Christopher Wren). The first engraved illustrations of the Greek Doric order dated to the mid-18th century. Its appearance in the new phase of Classicism brought with it new connotations of high-minded primitive simplicity, seriousness of purpose, noble sobriety. In Germany it suggested a contrast with the French, and in the United States republican virtues. In a customs house, Greek Doric suggested incorruptibility; in a Protestant church a Greek Doric porch promised a return to an untainted early church; it was equally appropriate for a library, a bank or a trustworthy public utility. The revived Doric did not return to Sicily until 1789, when a French architect researching the ancient Greek temples designed an entrance to the Botanical Gardens in Palermo.

The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the Olympic Games, first held in modern times in 1896 in Athens, Greece and inspired by the Ancient Olympic Games, one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi- sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the course of several days in and around a \\"host city\\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports. Athletes or teams are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for first, second and third place respectively. Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.  History  The Ancient Olympic Games, first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the Modern Olympic Games, although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions. There were several other \\"games\\" held in Europe in the classical era: * Panhellenic Games:  The Pythian Games (founded 527 BC) held in Delphi every four years  The Nemean Games (founded 516 BC) held in Argolid every two years  The Isthmian Games (founded 523 BC) held on the Isthmus of Corinth every two years * The Roman Games ‚Äì Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and wrestling, as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage. Other multi- sport festivals emerged in the Middle Ages in Europe, including the Cotswold Olimpick Games in England in the 1600s, the Highland Games in Scotland, and the Olympiade de la R√©publique in France in the 1800s. In the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international women's sport began to develop, events such as the Women's World Games and Olympics of Grace were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.  Audience  Since the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities. These affiliations include: * Regional, such as the Asian Games and the Pan-American Games * Sub-Regional, such as the South Asian Games, Southeast Asian Games and the South American Games * Political, such as the Spartakiad and the Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO) * Historic or historicultural roots, such as the Commonwealth Games (for members of the Commonwealth of Nations) and the Jeux de la Francophonie (for members of La Francophonie) * Ethnocultural or ethnoreligious, such as the Pan-Armenian Games (for ethnic communities of Armenians both in Armenia and in other countries) and the Maccabiah Games (for communities of Jews of both ethnic and religious origins) * Religious, such as the Islamic Solidarity Games and the previously mentioned Maccabiah Games * Occupational, such as the Military World Games, the World Police and Fire Games, and the Universiade * Physical disabilities, such as the Paralympics and the Deaflympics * Intellectual disabilities, such as the Special Olympics World Games * Age, such as the World Masters Games, Commonwealth Youth Games, and the Senior Olympics * Gender and sexual orientation, such as the Women's Islamic Games and the Gay Games Historic events =Olympic Games= The first modern multi-sport event organised were the Olympic Games, organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (est. 1894) for the first time in 1896 in Athens, Greece. After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing. =Paralympic Games= The Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities and is organized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Arranged for the first time in 1960 in Rome, Italy. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing. =Special Olympics= The first Special Olympics International Summer Games were held in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games in Schladming, Austria involved 25 sports and approximately 2,277 athletes from 133 countries.{{cite web url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Olympics_World_Winter_Games title=Archived copy accessdate=2019-01-31 =Others= At the beginning of the 20th century, another multi-sport event, the Nordic Games were first held. These Games were held in Scandinavia, and the sports conducted were winter sports such as cross-country skiing and speed skating. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in Chamonix was declared the first Olympic Winter Games. In the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was basically the case with the Olympic Games. The Soviets organized the first Spartakiad in 1920, a communist alternative to the 'bourgeois' Olympic Games, and in 1922 the University Olympia was organizedor in Italy, the forerunner of the World University Games, meant for students only. Regional games were another kind of multi-sport event that was established, such as the Far Eastern Championship Games (1913), the Central American and Caribbean Games (1926) or the Pan American Games (1951).

Chancellor Adolf Hitler, urged on by Hermann G√∂ring and Heinrich Himmler, ordered a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of Ernst R√∂hm and the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazis' paramilitary organization. Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under R√∂hm ‚Äì the so-called R√∂hm Putsch. The primary instruments of Hitler's action, which carried out most of the killings, were the Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service (SD) and Gestapo (secret police) under Reinhard Heydrich. G√∂ring's personal police battalion also took part in the killings. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being R√∂hm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the leftist-leaning Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, including its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics. Hitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to appease leaders of the Reichswehr, the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of R√∂hm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with R√∂hm's outspoken support for a \\"second revolution\\" to redistribute wealth. In R√∂hm's view, President Hindenburg's appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30, 1933, had brought the Nazi Party to power, but had left unfulfilled the party's larger goals. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate German critics of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, as well as to settle scores with old enemies. At least 85 people died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds, with high estimates running from 700 to 1,000. More than a thousand perceived opponents were arrested. The purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the Wehrmacht for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazis, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as the supreme administrator of justice of the German people, as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Before its execution, its planners sometimes referred to the purge as Hummingbird (German: ), the codeword used to send the execution squads into action on the day of the purge. The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in the German language predates the killings and refers generally to acts of vengeance. Hitler and the Sturmabteilung (SA) Hitler posing in Nuremberg with SA members in 1928. Julius Streicher is to the left of Hitler, and Hermann G√∂ring stands beneath Hitler President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. Over the next few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed with the need for the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime. To a lesser extent, the Sturmabteilung (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the Freikorps movement of the post-World War I years. The Freikorps were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans founded by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the Freikorps believed that the November Revolution had betrayed them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the Freikorps were in opposition to the new Weimar Republic, which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called \\"November criminals\\". Captain Ernst R√∂hm of the Reichswehr served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. R√∂hm was given the nickname \\"The Machine Gun King of Bavaria\\" in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. R√∂hm left the Reichswehr in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the Social Democrats and the Communists. Also known as the \\"brownshirts\\" or \\"stormtroopers,\\" the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists. The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilization of Germany's inter-war experiment with democracy, the Weimar Republic. In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths. Hitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking; they would attack passers-by and then attack the police who were called to stop them. Complaints of \\"overbearing and loutish\\" behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The Foreign Office even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats. Hitler's move would be to strengthen his position with the army by moving against its nemesis, the SA. On July 6, 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the National Socialist, or Nazi, seizure of power. Now that the NSDAP had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, \\"The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution.\\" Hitler's speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively ‚Äì or even primarily ‚Äì a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned. Conflict between the army and the SA SA leader Ernst R√∂hm in Bavaria in 1934 No one in the SA spoke more loudly for \\"a continuation of the German revolution\\" (as one prominent stormtrooper, Edmund Heines, put it) than R√∂hm himself. R√∂hm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of World War I, R√∂hm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper. R√∂hm saw violence as a means to political ends. He took seriously the socialist promise of National Socialism, and demanded that Hitler and the other party leaders initiate wide- ranging socialist reform in Germany. Not content solely with the leadership of the SA, R√∂hm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by the conservative General Werner von Blomberg. Although nicknamed the \\"Rubber Lion\\" by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the Prussian nobility, and regarded the SA as a plebeian rabble that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society. If the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in Rummelsburg, denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, \\"Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army.\\" Despite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalized army. R√∂hm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934. In January 1934, R√∂hm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA. In response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on February 28, 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, R√∂hm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, R√∂hm declared that he would not take instructions from \\"the ridiculous corporal\\" ‚Äì a demeaning reference to Hitler. While Hitler did not take immediate action against R√∂hm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them. Growing pressure against the SA Despite his earlier agreement with Hitler, R√∂hm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, R√∂hm's success could come only at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared R√∂hm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann G√∂ring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess, positioning themselves against R√∂hm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only R√∂hm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. R√∂hm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned G√∂ring, Minister-President of Prussia. Finally in the spring of 1934, the growing rift between R√∂hm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, to start playing politics again. Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, R√∂hm Minister of Defence, Heinrich Br√ºning Foreign Minister and Gregor Strasser Minister of National Economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a \\"lack of discretion\\" that was \\"terrifying\\" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested. Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with R√∂hm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis. As a means of isolating R√∂hm, on April 20, 1934, G√∂ring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, G√∂ring believed, could be counted on to move against R√∂hm. Himmler named his deputy Reinhard Heydrich to head the Gestapo on April 22, 1934. Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and Heydrich had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against R√∂hm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be \\"liquidated\\" started to circulate amongst G√∂ring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other. At the end of May two former Chancellors, Heinrich Br√ºning and Kurt von Schleicher, received warnings from friends in the Reichswehr that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once. Br√ºning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke. By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler. Franz von Papen, the conservative vice-chancellor who ran afoul of Hitler after denouncing the regime's failure to rein in the SA in his Marburg speech. (Picture taken 1946 at the Nuremberg trial) Demands for Hitler to constrain the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against R√∂hm. While R√∂hm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Mei√üner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell ‚Äì without Hitler's knowledge ‚Äì to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction. On June 17, 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave a speech at Marburg University warning of the threat of a \\"second revolution.\\" According to his memoirs, von Papen, a Catholic aristocrat with ties to army and industry, privately threatened to resign if Hitler did not act. While von Papen's resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler's position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative. Heydrich and Himmler alt= In response to conservative pressure to constrain R√∂hm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the president, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against R√∂hm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against R√∂hm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against R√∂hm, in part due to R√∂hm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying R√∂hm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and G√∂ring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by R√∂hm's downfall ‚Äì the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for G√∂ring. In preparation for the purge, both Himmler and Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that R√∂hm had been paid 12 million Reichsmark (EUR in ) by France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on June 24 that R√∂hm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government (). At Hitler's direction, G√∂ring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men G√∂ring recruited to assist him was Willi Lehmann, a Gestapo official and spy. On June 25, General Werner von Fritsch placed the Reichswehr on the highest level of alert. On June 27, Hitler moved to secure the army's cooperation. Blomberg and General Walther von Reichenau, the army's liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling R√∂hm from the German Officers' League. On June 28 Hitler went to Essen to attend a wedding celebration and reception; from there he called R√∂hm's adjutant at Bad Wiessee and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on June 30 at 11:00. On June 29, a signed article in V√∂lkischer Beobachter by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the Reichswehr stood behind Hitler. Purge SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer , chief of the Munich police, 1930 At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and his entourage flew to Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they assembled the leaders of an SA rampage that had taken place in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenf√ºhrer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst R√∂hm and his followers were staying. Hotel Lederer am See (former Kurheim Hanselbauer) in Bad Wiessee before its planned demolition in 2017. With Hitler's arrival in Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel, and Hitler personally placed R√∂hm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. The SS found Breslau SA leader Edmund Heines in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside the hotel and shot. Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on moral turpitude. Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with R√∂hm and Hitler. Although Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by R√∂hm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced \\"the worst treachery in world history\\". Hitler told the crowd that \\"undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements\\" would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the \\"traitors\\". Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned G√∂ring at 10:00 with the codeword to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims. Sepp Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the Leibstandarte to form an \\"execution squad\\" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held. There in the prison courtyard, the Leibstandarte firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel. Those not immediately executed were taken back to the Leibstandarte barracks at Lichterfelde, given one-minute \\"trials\\", and shot by a firing squad. =Against conservatives and old enemies= General Kurt von Schleicher, Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, in uniform, 1932 Gregor Strasser in 1928 Gustav Ritter von Kahr in 1920 Willi Schmid, a mistaken victim of the purge, in 1930 The regime did not limit itself to a purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on G√∂ring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech, and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticize the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador. Hitler and Himmler unleashed the Gestapo against old enemies, as well. Both Kurt von Schleicher, Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home. Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, the former Bavarian state commissioner who crushed the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Kahr's fate was especially gruesome. His body was found in a wood outside Munich; he had been hacked to death, apparently with pickaxes. The murdered included at least one accidental victim: Willi Schmid, the music critic of the newspaper. As Himmler's adjutant Karl Wolff later explained, friendship and personal loyalty were not allowed to stand in the way: Some SA members died saying \\"Heil Hitler\\" because they believed that an anti-Hitler SS plot had led to their execution. Several leaders of the disbanded Catholic Centre Party were also murdered in the purge. The Party had generally been aligned with the Social Democrats and Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism, being critical of Nazi ideology, but voting nonetheless for the Enabling Act of 1933 which granted Hitler dictatorial authority. =R√∂hm's fate= R√∂hm was held briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler considered his future. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michael Lippert visited R√∂hm. Once inside R√∂hm's cell, they handed him a Browning pistol loaded with a single cartridge and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. R√∂hm demurred, telling them, \\"If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.\\" Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to R√∂hm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot R√∂hm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for R√∂hm's murder. Until then, Lippert had been one of the few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Aftermath Hitler triumphant: The reviewing the SA in 1935. In the car with Hitler: the Blutfahne, behind the car SS-man Jakob Grimminger As the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. G√∂ring instructed police stations to burn \\"all documents concerning the action of the past two days.\\" Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented R√∂hm and Schleicher from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil. Then, on July 13, 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag: Concerned with presenting the massacre as legally sanctioned, Hitler had the cabinet approve a measure on July 3 that declared, \\"The measures taken on June 30, July 1 and 2 to suppress treasonous assaults are legal as acts of self- defence by the State.\\" Reich Justice Minister Franz G√ºrtner, a conservative who had been Bavarian Justice Minister in the years of the Weimar Republic, demonstrated his loyalty to the new regime by drafting the statute, which added a legal veneer to the purge. Signed into law by Hitler, G√ºrtner, and Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, the \\"Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defence\\" retroactively legalized the murders committed during the purge. Germany's legal establishment further capitulated to the regime when the country's leading legal scholar, Carl Schmitt, wrote an article defending Hitler's July 13 speech. It was named \\"The F√ºhrer Upholds the Law.\\" A special fund administered by SS General Franz Breithaupt was set up for the relatives of the murdered, from which they were cared for at state cost. The widows of the murdered SA leaders received between 1,000 and 1,600 marks a month, depending on the rank of the murdered person. Kurt von Schleicher's stepdaughter received 250 marks per month up to the age of 21 and the son of General von Bredow received a monthly allowance of 150 marks. =Reaction= Law Relating to National Emergency Defense Measures July 3, 1934.Roderick Stackelberg, Sally A. Winkle. The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts. p. 173 The army almost unanimously applauded the Night of the Long Knives, even though the generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. A telegram allegedly sent by the ailing President Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered military hero, expressed his \\"profoundly felt gratitude\\", and congratulated Hitler for \\"nipping treason in the bud\\", although Hermann G√∂ring later admitted during the Nuremberg trials that the telegram was never seen by Hindenburg, and was actually written by the Nazis. General von Reichenau went so far as to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Ernst R√∂hm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. Fran√ßois-Poncet was not declared persona non grata as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government. The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realize this: \\"If you look on without lifting a finger,\\" he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, \\"you will meet the same fate sooner or later.\\" Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935. Election poster for Hindenburg in 1932 (translation: \\"With him\\") Rumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's \\"personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness\\" in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century King of Prussia. Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. \\"A very calm and easy going mailman,\\" the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, \\"who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply sentenced them.'\\" It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. \\"A chancellor,\\" he wrote, \\"sentences and shoots members of his own private army!\\" The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it. Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticized Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganize the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann G√∂ring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels, and Richard Walther Darr√© from the Cabinet. The memo asked that Hindenburg instead create a directorate to rule Germany, comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed), and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to the USSR, who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the \\"distant friendliness\\" towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933. Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with: Hindenburg never responded to the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Mei√üner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is noteworthy that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they wanted to see continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers. Werner von Blomberg in 1934 In late 1934‚Äìearly 1935, Werner von Fritsch and Werner von Blomberg, who had been shamed into joining Hammerstein and Mackensen's rehabilitation campaign, successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating Generals von Schleicher and von Bredow. Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July, which portrayed them as the vilest traitors, working against the Fatherland in the pay of France. In a speech given on January 3, 1935 at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot \\"in error\\" on the basis of false information, and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once. Hitler's speech was not reported in the German press, but the army was appeased by the speech. However, despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers, the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, G√∂ring told Jan Szembek that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice. During a meeting with Polish Ambassador J√≥zef Lipski on May 22, 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was \\"rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the Rapallo Treaty.\\" The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German‚ÄìPolish relations up to the outbreak of the war. Former Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was in exile in Doorn, Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He asked, \\"What would people have said if I had done such a thing?\\"Macdonogh 2001, pp. 452‚Äì53 Hearing of the murder of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, \\"We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!\\" SA leadership Hitler named Viktor Lutze to replace R√∂hm as head of the SA. Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to \\"homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living\\" in the SA. Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance. Lutze did little to assert the SA's independence in the coming years, and the SA lost its power in Germany. Membership in the organization plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938. According to Speer, \\"the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler ... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated.\\" R√∂hm was purged from all Nazi propaganda, such as The Victory of Faith, the Leni Riefenstahl film about the 1933 Nuremberg rally, which showed R√∂hm frequently alongside Hitler; a copy of the original survived and in the 1980s, it was found within the German Democratic Republic's film archives.Trimborn, J√ºrgen (2008) Leni Riefenstahl: A Life. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. . Retrieved 12 April 2020. Legacy The Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as \\"the supreme leader of the German people\\", as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself de jure as well as de facto above the reach of the law. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power. Years later, in November 1945, while being interviewed by psychologist Gustave Gilbert in his cell during the Nuremberg trials, G√∂ring angrily justified the killings to Gilbert, \\"It's a damn good thing I wiped them out, or they would have wiped us out!\\" See also * The Damned (1969 film) * Glossary of Nazi Germany * List of Nazi Party leaders and officials * Der Sieg des Glaubens * Victims of the Night of the Long Knives * White Book of the Purge * Kurt Ludecke References Informational notes Citations Bibliography               Further reading   * Wiskemann, Elizabeth. \\"The Night of the Long Knives.\\" History Today (June 1964) 14#6 pp 371-380.

Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological, physical, social, political and managerial sciences. Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, in what is known as multiple-use management, including: * The provision of timber * Fuel wood * Wildlife habitat * Natural water quality management * Recreation * Landscape and community protection * Employment * Aesthetically appealing landscapes * Biodiversity management * Watershed management * Erosion control * Preserving forests as \\"sinks\\" for atmospheric carbon dioxide A practitioner of forestry is known as a forester. Other common terms are: a verderer, or a silviculturalist. Silviculture is narrower than forestry, being concerned only with forest plants, but is often used synonymously with forestry. Forest ecosystems have come to be seen as the most important component of the biosphere, and forestry has emerged as a vital applied science, craft, and technology. Forestry is an important economic segment in various industrial countries. For example, in Germany, forests cover nearly a third of the land area,Bundeswaldinventur 2002 , Bundesministerium f√ºr Ern√§hrung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz (BMELV), retrieved, 17 January 2010 wood is the most important renewable resource, and forestry supports more than a million jobs and about ‚Ç¨181 billion of value to the German economy each year.Unternehmen Wald, forests as an enterprise, German private forestry association website A deciduous beech forest in Slovenia History = Background = The preindustrial age has been dubbed by Werner Sombart and others as the 'wooden age', as timber and firewood were the basic resources for energy, construction and housing. The development of modern forestry is closely connected with the rise of capitalism, economy as a science and varying notions of land use and property.compare Joachim Radkau Wood: A History, 2011 Roman Latifundiae, large agricultural estates, were quite successful in maintaining the large supply of wood that was necessary for the Roman Empire.The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History, by Alfred Thomas Grove, Oliver Rackham, Yale University Press, 2003, review at Yale university press Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History (review) Brian M. Fagan, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Volume 32, Number 3, Winter 2002, pp. 454-455 Large deforestations came with respectively after the decline of the Romans. However already in the 5th century, monks in the then Byzantine Romagna on the Adriatic coast, were able to establish stone pine plantations to provide fuelwood and food. This was the beginning of the massive forest mentioned by Dante Alighieri in his 1308 poem Divine Comedy. Similar sustainable formal forestry practices were developed by the Visigoths in the 7th century when, faced with the ever-increasing shortage of wood, they instituted a code concerned with the preservation of oak and pine forests. The use and management of many forest resources has a long history in China as well, dating back to the Han dynasty and taking place under the landowning gentry. A similar approach was used in Japan. It was also later written about by the Ming dynasty Chinese scholar Xu Guangqi (1562‚Äì1633). In Europe, land usage rights in medieval and early modern times allowed different users to access forests and pastures. Plant litter and resin extraction were important, as pitch (resin) was essential for the caulking of ships, falking and hunting rights, firewood and building, timber gathering in wood pastures, and for grazing animals in forests. The notion of \\"commons\\" (German \\"Allmende\\") refers to the underlying traditional legal term of common land. The idea of enclosed private property came about during modern times. However, most hunting rights were retained by members of the nobility which preserved the right of the nobility to access and use common land for recreation, like fox hunting. = Early modern forestry development = Timber harvesting in Finland Golden Steinrueck, Vogelsberg Hans Carl von Carlowitz, German miner Systematic management of forests for a sustainable yield of timber began in Portugal in the 13th century when King Afonso III planted the Pinhal do Rei (King's Pine Forest) near Leiria to prevent coastal erosion and soil degradation, and as a sustainable source for timber used in naval construction. His successor King Denis of Portugal continued the practice and the forest exists still today. Forest management also flourished in the German states in the 14th century, e.g. in Nuremberg, and in 16th-century Japan. Typically, a forest was divided into specific sections and mapped; the harvest of timber was planned with an eye to regeneration. As timber rafting allowed for connecting large continental forests, as in south western Germany, via Main, Neckar, Danube and Rhine with the coastal cities and states, early modern forestry and remote trading were closely connected. Large firs in the black forest were called ‚ÄûHoll√§nder‚Äú, as they were traded to the Dutch ship yards. Large timber rafts on the Rhine were 200 to 400m in length, 40m in width and consisted of several thousand logs. The crew consisted of 400 to 500 men, including shelter, bakeries, ovens and livestock stables.Beschreibung eines gro√üen Rheinflo√ües Timber rafting infrastructure allowed for large interconnected networks all over continental Europe and is still of importance in Finland. Starting with the 16th century, enhanced world maritime trade, a boom in housing construction in Europe, and the success and further Berggeschrey (rushes) of the mining industry increased timber consumption sharply. The notion of 'Nachhaltigkeit', sustainability in forestry, is closely connected to the work of Hans Carl von Carlowitz (1645‚Äì1714), a mining administrator in Saxony. His book Sylvicultura oeconomica, oder hau√üwirthliche Nachricht und Naturm√§√üige Anweisung zur wilden Baum-Zucht (1713) was the first comprehensive treatise about sustainable yield forestry. In the UK, and, to an extent, in continental Europe, the enclosure movement and the Clearances favored strictly enclosed private property.Radkau, Joachim. Nature and Power. A Global History of the Environment. Cambridge University Press. 2008. The Agrarian reformers, early economic writers and scientists tried to get rid of the traditional commons.Nature and Power, A Global History of the Environment, by Joachim Radkau, 2008, p. 72 At the time, an alleged tragedy of the commons together with fears of a Holznot, an imminent wood shortage played a watershed role in the controversies about cooperative land use patterns.The end of the commons as a watershed' The Age of Ecology, Joachim Radkau, John Wiley & Sons, 03.04.2014, p. 15 ff The practice of establishing tree plantations in the British Isles was promoted by John Evelyn, though it had already acquired some popularity. Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert's oak Forest of Tron√ßais, planted for the future use of the French Navy, matured as expected in the mid-19th century: \\"Colbert had thought of everything except the steamship,\\" Fernand Braudel observed. In parallel, schools of forestry were established beginning in the late 18th century in Hesse, Russia, Austria- Hungary, Sweden, France and elsewhere in Europe. = Forest conservation and early globalization = Starting from the 1750s modern scientific forestry was developed in France and the German speaking countries in the context of natural history scholarship and state administration inspired by physiocracy and cameralism. Its main traits were centralized management by professional foresters, the adherence to sustainble yield concepts with a bias towards fuelwood and timber production, artificial afforestation, and a critical view of pastoral and agricultural uses of forests. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, forest preservation programs were established in British India, the United States, and Europe. Many foresters were either from continental Europe (like Sir Dietrich Brandis), or educated there (like Gifford Pinchot). Sir Dietrich Brandis is considered the father of tropical forestry, European concepts and practices had to be adapted in tropical and semi-arid climate zones. The development of plantation forestry was one of the (controversial) answers to the specific challenges in the tropical colonies. The enactment and evolution of forest laws and binding regulations occurred in most Western nations in the 20th century in response to growing conservation concerns and the increasing technological capacity of logging companies. Tropical forestry is a separate branch of forestry which deals mainly with equatorial forests that yield woods such as teak and mahogany. = Mechanization = Forestry mechanization was always in close connection to metal working and the development of mechanical tools to cut and transport timber to its destination. Rafting belongs to the earliest means of transport. Steel saws came up in the 15th century. The 19th century widely increased the availability of steel for whipsaws and introduced Forest railways and railways in general for transport and as forestry customer. Further human induced changes, however, came since World War II, respectively in line with the \\"1950s syndrome\\".Christian Pfister (Hrsg.), Das 1950er Syndrom: Der Weg in die Konsumgesellschaft, Bern 1995 The first portable chainsaw was invented in 1918 in Canada, but large impact of mechanization in forestry started after World War II. Forestry harvesters are among the most recent developments. Although drones, planes, laser scanning, satellites and robots also play a part in forestry. =Early journals which are still present= * Sylwan first published in 1820 * Schweizerische Zeitschrift f√ºr Forstwesen first published in 1850. * Erd√©szeti Lapok first published in 1862.

Forestry studies also include the development of better methods for the planting, protecting, thinning, controlled burning, felling, extracting, and processing of timber. One of the applications of modern forestry is reforestation, in which trees are planted and tended in a given area. Trees provide numerous environmental, social and economic benefits for people. In many regions, the forest industry is of major ecological, economic, and social importance, with the United States producing more timber than any other country in the world. Third-party certification systems that provide independent verification of sound forest stewardship and sustainable forestry have become commonplace in many areas since the 1990s. These certification systems developed as a response to criticism of some forestry practices, particularly deforestation in less-developed regions along with concerns over resource management in the developed world. In topographically severe forested terrain, proper forestry is important for the prevention or minimization of serious soil erosion or even landslides. In areas with a high potential for landslides, forests can stabilize soils and prevent property damage or loss, human injury, or loss of life.  Foresters  Foresters of the Austral University of Chile in the Valdivian forests of San Pablo de Tregua, Chile Foresters work for the timber industry, government agencies, conservation groups, local authorities, urban parks boards, citizens' associations, and private landowners. The forestry profession includes a wide diversity of jobs, with educational requirements ranging from college bachelor's degrees to PhDs for highly specialized work. Industrial foresters plan forest regeneration starting with careful harvesting. Urban foresters manage trees in urban green spaces. Foresters work in tree nurseries growing seedlings for woodland creation or regeneration projects. Foresters improve tree genetics. Forest engineers develop new building systems. Professional foresters measure and model the growth of forests with tools like geographic information systems. Foresters may combat insect infestation, disease, forest and grassland wildfire, but increasingly allow these natural aspects of forest ecosystems to run their course when the likelihood of epidemics or risk of life or property are low. Increasingly, foresters participate in wildlife conservation planning and watershed protection. Foresters have been mainly concerned with timber management, especially reforestation, maintaining forests at prime conditions, and fire control.  Forestry plans  Foresters develop and implement forest management plans relying on mapped resource inventories showing an area's topographical features as well as its distribution of trees (by species) and other plant cover. Plans also include landowner objectives, roads, culverts, proximity to human habitation, water features and hydrological conditions, and soils information. Forest management plans typically include recommended silvicultural treatments and a timetable for their implementation. Application of digital maps in Geographic Informations systems (GIS) that extracts and integrates different information about forest terrains, soil type and tree covers, etc. using, e.g. laser scanning, enhances forest management plans in modern systems. Forest management plans include recommendations to achieve the landowner's objectives and desired future condition for the property subject to ecological, financial, logistical (e.g. access to resources), and other constraints. On some properties, plans focus on producing quality wood products for processing or sale. Hence, tree species, quantity, and form, all central to the value of harvested products quality and quantity, tend to be important components of silvicultural plans. Good management plans include consideration of future conditions of the stand after any recommended harvests treatments, including future treatments (particularly in intermediate stand treatments), and plans for natural or artificial regeneration after final harvests. The objectives of landowners and leaseholders influence plans for harvest and subsequent site treatment. In Britain, plans featuring \\"good forestry practice\\" must always consider the needs of other stakeholders such as nearby communities or rural residents living within or adjacent to woodland areas. Foresters consider tree felling and environmental legislation when developing plans. Plans instruct the sustainable harvesting and replacement of trees. They indicate whether road building or other forest engineering operations are required. Agriculture and forest leaders are also trying to understand how the climate change legislation will affect what they do. The information gathered will provide the data that will determine the role of agriculture and forestry in a new climate change regulatory system. Forestry as a science Over the past centuries, forestry was regarded as a separate science. With the rise of ecology and environmental science, there has been a reordering in the applied sciences. In line with this view, forestry is a primary land-use science comparable with agriculture.Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p. Under these headings, the fundamentals behind the management of natural forests comes by way of natural ecology. Forests or tree plantations, those whose primary purpose is the extraction of forest products, are planned and managed utilizing a mix of ecological and agroecological principles.Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Undoing the Damage: Silviculture for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 313p. In many regions of the world there is considerable conflict between forest practices and other societal priorities such as water quality, watershed preservation, sustainable fishing, conservation, and species preservation. Genetic diversity in forestry The provenance of forest reproductive material used to plant forests has great influence on how the trees develop, hence why it is important to use forest reproductive material of good quality and of high genetic diversity. More generally, all forest management practices, including in natural regeneration systems, may impact the genetic diversity of trees. The term describes the differences in DNA sequence between individuals as distinct from variation caused by environmental influences. The unique genetic composition of an individual (its genotype) will determine its performance (its phenotype) at a particular site. Genetic diversity is needed to maintain the vitality of forests and to provide resilience to pests and diseases. Genetic diversity also ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, genetic diversity is the foundation of biological diversity at species and ecosystem levels. Forest genetic resources are therefore important to consider in forest management. Genetic diversity in forests is threatened by forest fires, pests and diseases, habitat fragmentation, poor silvicultural practices and inappropriate use of forest reproductive material. About 98 million ha of forest were affected by fire in 2015; this was mainly in the tropical domain, where fire burned about 4 percent of the total forest area in that year. More than two-thirds of the total forest area affected was in Africa and South America. Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million ha of forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains. Furthermore, the marginal populations of many tree species are facing new threats due to climate change. Most countries in Europe have recommendations or guidelines for selecting species and provenances that can be used in a given site or zone.  Education  =History of forestry education= The first dedicated forestry school was established by Georg Ludwig Hartig at Hungen in the Wetterau, Hesse, in 1787, though forestry had been taught earlier in central Europe, including at the University of Giessen, in Hesse-Darmstadt. In Spain, the first forestry school was the Forest Engineering School of Madrid (Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes), founded in 1844. The first in North America, the Biltmore Forest School was established near Asheville, North Carolina, by Carl A. Schenck on September 1, 1898, on the grounds of George W. Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate. Another early school was the New York State College of Forestry, established at Cornell University just a few weeks later, in September 1898. Early 19th century North American foresters went to Germany to study forestry. Some early German foresters also emigrated to North America. In South America the first forestry school was established in Brazil, in Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais, in 1962, and moved the next year to become a faculty at the Federal University of Paran√°, in Curitiba. =Forestry education today= Prescribed burning is used by foresters to reduce fuel loads Today, forestry education typically includes training in general biology, ecology, botany, genetics, soil science, climatology, hydrology, economics and forest management. Education in the basics of sociology and political science is often considered an advantage. Professional skills in conflict resolution and communication are also important in training programs. In India, forestry education is imparted in the agricultural universities and in Forest Research Institutes (deemed universities). Four year degree programmes are conducted in these universities at the undergraduate level. Masters and Doctorate degrees are also available in these universities. In the United States, postsecondary forestry education leading to a Bachelor's degree or Master's degree is accredited by the Society of American Foresters. In Canada the Canadian Institute of Forestry awards silver rings to graduates from accredited university BSc programs, as well as college and technical programs. In many European countries, training in forestry is made in accordance with requirements of the Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Area. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations is the only international organization that coordinates forest science efforts worldwide. =Continuing education= In order to keep up with changing demands and environmental factors, forestry education does not stop at graduation. Increasingly, forestry professionals engage in regular training to maintain and improve on their management practices. An increasingly popular tool are marteloscopes; one hectare large, rectangular forest sites where all trees are numbered, mapped and recorded. These sites can be used to do virtual thinnings and test one's wood quality and volume estimations as well as tree microhabitats. This system is mainly suitable to regions with small-scale multi-functional forest management systems. =Miscellaneous about Forestry research and education= * List of forest research institutes * List of forestry technical schools * List of forestry universities and colleges * List of historic journals of forestry * Imperial Forestry Institute (disambiguation) See also * Afforestation * Agroforestry * Close to nature forestry * Community forestry * Deforestation * Deforestation and climate change * Dendrology * Forest dynamics * Forest farming * Forest informatics * Forestry literature * History of the forest in Central Europe * International Year of Forests * List of forest research institutes * List of forestry journals * Lumberjack * Nonindustrial private forests * Sustainable forest management * Silviculture * Silvology  Sources  References =Further reading= * Eyle, Alexandra. 1992.

An archetype can be: # a statement, pattern of behavior, prototype, \\"first\\" form, or a main model that other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy, emulate, or \\"merge\\" into. Informal synonyms frequently used for this definition include \\"standard example,\\" \\"basic example,\\" and the longer-form \\"archetypal example;\\" mathematical archetypes often appear as \\"canonical examples.\\" # the Platonic concept of pure form, believed to embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing. # a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in individual psyches, as in Jungian psychology # a constantly-recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology. This definition refers to the recurrence of characters or ideas sharing similar traits throughout various, seemingly unrelated cases in classic storytelling, media, etc. This usage of the term draws from both comparative anthropology and from Jungian archetypal theory. Archetypes are also very close analogies to instincts, in that, long before any consciousness develops, it is the impersonal and inherited traits of human beings that present and motivate human behavior. They also continue to influence feelings and behavior even after some degree of consciousness developed later on. Etymology The word archetype, \\"original pattern from which copies are made,\\" first entered into English usage in the 1540s. It derives from the Latin noun archetyipum, latinisation of the Greek noun (arch√©typon), whose adjective form is (arch√©typos), which means \\"first-molded\\",, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus which is a compound of arch·∏ó, \\"beginning, origin\\",·ºÄœÅœáŒÆ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and t√Ωpos, which can mean, amongst other things, \\"pattern\\", \\"model\\", or \\"type\\".œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus It, thus, referred to the beginning or origin of the pattern, model or type.  Archetypes in literature  =Function= Usage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism to their work. According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work. = Story archetypes = Christopher Booker, author of The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories, argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories: # Overcoming the Monster # Rags to Riches # The Quest # Voyage and Return #Comedy #Tragedy #Rebirth These themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes. =Literary criticism= Archetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring images, symbols, or patterns (which may include motifs such as the \\"quest\\" or the \\"heavenly ascent\\"; recognizable character types such as the \\"trickster\\", \\"saint\\", \\"martyr\\" or the \\"hero\\"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work. The archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.

Estudio de Paremiolog√≠a comparada.\\" Espa√±a: Sociedad Espa√±ola de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide 5. Platonic archetypes The origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as Plato. Plato's eidos, or ideas, were pure mental forms that were imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. Some philosophers also translate the archetype as \\"essence\\" in order to avoid confusion with respect to Plato's conceptualization of Forms. While it is tempting to think of Forms as mental entities (ideas) that exist only in our mind, the philosopher insisted that they are independent of any minds (real). Eidos were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir Thomas Browne and Francis Bacon both employ the word archetype in their writings; Browne in The Garden of Cyrus (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names. Jungian archetypes The concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, c. 1919. Jung has acknowledged that his conceptualization of archetype is influenced by Plato's eidos, which he described as \\"the formulated meaning of a primordial image by which it was represented symbolically.\\" According to Jung, the term archetype is an explanatory paraphrase of the Platonic eidos, also believed to represent the word form. He maintained that Platonic archetypes are metaphysical ideas, paradigms, or models, and that real things are held to be only copies of these model ideas. However, archetypes are not easily recognizable in Plato's works in the way in which Jung meant them. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex (e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through evolution. At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.Brown, R. S. 2013. \\"Beyond the Evolutionary Paradigm in Consciousness Studies.\\" Journal of Transpersonal Psychology 45(2):159‚Äì71. Jung states in part one of Man And His Symbols that: > My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or > 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack > sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term > 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological > images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. > Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype is a > tendency to form such representations of a motif‚Äîrepresentations that can > vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern. While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms primordial images, include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden. He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious. = Neo-Jungian concepts = Other authors, such as Carol Pearson and Margaret Mark, have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include: Other authors, such Margaret Hartwell and Joshua Chen, go further to give these 12 archetypes families 5 archetypes each. They are as follows:  Other uses of archetypes  There is also the position that the use of archetypes in different ways is possible because every archetype has multiple manifestations, with each one featuring different attributes. For instance, there is the position that the function of the archetype must be approached according to the context of biological sciences and is accomplished through the concept of the ultimate function. This pertains to the organism's response to those pressures in terms of biological trait. = Dichter's application of archetypes = Later in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. Ernest Dichter took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Dichter moved to New York around 1939 and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a letter boasting of his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.

It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of Impressionist and post- Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, C√©zanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe.

History The Mus√©e d'Orsay as seen from the Passerelle L√©opold- S√©dar-Senghor Mus√©e d'Orsay Clock, Victor Laloux, Main Hall The interior of the museum. The museum building was originally a railway station, Gare d'Orsay, constructed for the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, √âmile B√©nard and Victor Laloux. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939. By 1939 the station's short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II. It was then used as a set for several films, such as Kafka's The Trial adapted by Orson Welles, and as a haven for the Renaud‚ÄìBarrault Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the H√¥tel Drouot was being rebuilt. In 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but Jacques Duhamel, Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museum of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum. ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues. In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. In July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. From 2020 on, the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay is scheduled to undergo a radical transformation over the next decade, funded in part by an anonymous US patron who donated ‚Ç¨20 million to a building project known as Orsay Grand Ouvert (Orsay Wide Open).

History  Buccleuch Cottages, typical of the architectural style in Beaulieu village The name Beaulieu comes etymologically from French beau lieu, which means \\"beautiful place\\". It is derived from Beaulieu Abbey which was populated by 30 monks sent from the abbey of C√Æteaux in France, the mother house of the Cistercian order. The medieval Latin name of the monastery was Bellus Locus Regis (\\"The beautiful place of the king\\"') or monasterium Belli loci Regis. During the Second World War, the Beaulieu Estate of Lord Montagu in the New Forest area was the site of group B finishing schools for agents operated by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) between 1941 and 1945. (One of the trainers was Kim Philby who was later found to be part of a spy ring passing information to the Soviets.) In 2005, a special exhibition was installed at the Beaulieu Estate, with a video showing photographs from that era as well as voice recordings of former SOE trainers and agents.https://books.google.ca/books?id=3JO0DAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT155&dq;=hampshire+school+special+operations+1941+-1945+Beaulieu++Hampshire&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjEq8n71L3kAhXKm- AKHa4PA34Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q;=hampshire%20school%20special%20operations%201941%20-1945%20Beaulieu%20%20Hampshire&f;=false, SOE's Mastermind The village has remained largely unspoilt by progress, and is a favourite tourist stop for visitors to the New Forest, and also for birders seeking local specialities like Dartford warbler, European honey buzzard and hobby. Palace House was featured in the 2005 comedy-drama film Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont starring Joan Plowright and Rupert Friend.  Transport  The nearest railway station is Beaulieu Road, about away on the London-Weymouth main line. While previously this station had an infrequent service, there are now some 20 trains a day stopping here. Wilts & Dorset bus service 112 serves the village on its way between Hythe and Lymington. In summer, Beaulieu is served by the New Forest Tour, an hourly open-top bus service.  Palace House  Palace House under an overcast sky Palace House (not to be confused with the Palace of Beaulieu in Essex), which overlooks the village from across Beaulieu River, began in 1204 as the gatehouse to Beaulieu Abbey, and has been the ancestral home of a branch of the Montagu family since 1538, when was seized from the monks by the Crown in Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries and then sold on. The house was extended in the 16th century, and again in the 19th century, and is today a fine example of a Gothic country house. Although still home to the current Lord and Lady Montagu, parts of the house and gardens are open daily to the public. It is a member of the Treasure Houses of England consortium.  Museum  Sunbeam 1000HP The village is also home to the British National Motor Museum. The museum was opened in 1952 as the Montagu Motor Museum and became a charitable trust in 1972. It contains an important collection of historic motor vehicles, including four world land speed record holders: * Sir Malcolm Campbell's 1920 Sunbeam 350hp * His son Donald Campbell's 1961 Bluebird-Proteus CN7 * The 1927 Sunbeam 1000hp (the first motor car to reach ) * The 1929 Irving-Napier Special 'Golden Arrow'. The last two were both driven by Major Henry Segrave.  Beaulieu Jazz Festival  In the late 1950s Beaulieu was the surprising location for one of Britain's first experiments in pop festival culture, with the annual Beaulieu Jazz Festival, which quickly expanded to become a significant event in the burgeoning jazz and youth pop music scene of the period. Camping overnight, a rural invasion, eccentric dress, wild music and sometimes wilder behaviour ‚Äî these now familiar features of pop festivals happened at Beaulieu each summer, culminating in the so-called 'Battle of Beaulieu' at the 1960 festival, when rival gangs of modern and traditional jazz fans indulged in a spot of what sociologists went on to call 'subcultural contestation'.McKay 2004, 2005 See also *List of jazz festivals *List of historic rock festivals  References   Bibliography  * Lord Montagu of Beaulieu (2000) Wheels Within Wheels: An Unconventional Life.

The play was first produced on 21 April 1894 at the Avenue Theatre and published in 1898 as part of Shaw's Plays Pleasant volume, which also included Candida, You Never Can Tell, and The Man of Destiny. Arms and the Man was one of Shaw's first commercial successes. He was called onto stage after the curtain, where he received enthusiastic applause. Amidst the cheers, one audience member booed. Shaw replied, in characteristic fashion, \\"My dear fellow, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?\\"Frezza, Daniel. \\"About the Playwright: George Bernard Shaw\\" , \\"Utah Shakespearean Festival,\\" 2007. Accessed 12 February 2008. Shaw's contemporary, William Butler Yeats, was present for the performance, and rendered this quotation differently in his autobiography: \\"I assure the gentleman in the gallery that he and I are of exactly the same opinion, but what can we do against a whole house who are of the contrary opinion?\\" (Yeats, The Trembling of the Veil, book 4: The Tragic Generation, from Autobiographies, in The Collected Works of W.

No men were allowed in the rehearsals or at the performance.

Its heroine, Raina Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, one of the heroes of that war, whom she idolizes. On the night after the Battle of Slivnitza, a Swiss mercenary soldier in the Serbian army, Captain Bluntschli, climbs in through her bedroom balcony window and threatens to shoot Raina if she gives the alarm. When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search the house for him, Raina hides him so that he won't be killed. He asks her to remember that \\"nine soldiers out of ten are born fools.\\" In a conversation after the soldiers have left, Bluntschli's pragmatic and cynical attitude towards war and soldiering shocks the idealistic Raina, especially after he admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than cartridges for his pistol. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother Catherine sneak Bluntschli out of the house, disguised in one of Raina's father's old coats. The war ends, and the Bulgarians and Serbians sign a peace treaty. Raina's father (Major Paul Petkoff) and Sergius both return home. Raina begins to find Sergius both foolhardy and tiresome, but she hides it. Sergius also finds Raina's romantic ideals tiresome, and flirts with Raina's insolent servant girl Louka (a soubrette role), who is engaged to Nicola, the Petkoffs' manservant. Bluntschli unexpectedly returns so that he can give back the old coat, but also so that he can see Raina. Raina and Catherine are shocked, especially when Major Petkoff and Sergius reveal that they have met Bluntschli before and invite him to stay for lunch (and to help them figure out how to send the troops home). Left alone with Bluntschli, Raina realizes that he sees through her romantic posturing, but that he respects her as a woman, as Sergius does not. She reveals that she left a photograph of herself in the pocket of the coat, inscribed \\"To my chocolate- cream soldier\\", but Bluntschli says that he didn't find it and that it must still be in the coat pocket. Bluntschli gets a telegram informing him of his father's death: he must now take over the family business, several luxury hotels in Switzerland. Louka tells Sergius that Raina protected Bluntschli when he burst into her room and that Raina is really in love with him. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel, but Bluntschli avoids fighting and Sergius and Raina break off their engagement, with some relief on both sides. Major Petkoff discovers the photograph in the pocket of his old coat; Raina and Bluntschli try to remove it before he finds it again, but Petkoff is determined to learn the truth and claims that the \\"chocolate-cream soldier\\" is Sergius. After Bluntschli reveals the whole story to Major Petkoff, Sergius proposes marriage to Louka (to Major Petkoff and Catherine's horror); Nicola quietly and gallantly lets Sergius have her, and Bluntschli, recognising Nicola's dedication and ability, offers him a job as hotel manager. While Raina is now unattached, Bluntschli protests that‚Äîbeing 34 and believing she is 17‚Äîhe is too old for her. On learning that she is actually 23, he immediately proposes marriage and proves his wealth and position by listing his inheritance from the telegram. Raina, realizing the hollowness of her romantic ideals, protests that she would prefer her poor \\"chocolate-cream soldier\\" to this wealthy businessman. Bluntschli says that he is still the same person, and the play ends with Raina proclaiming her love for him and Bluntschli, with Swiss precision, both clearing up the major's troop movement problems and informing everyone that he will return to be married to Raina exactly two weeks from that day. Critical reception George Orwell said that Arms and the Man was written when Shaw was at the height of his powers as a dramatist. \\"It is probably the wittiest play he ever wrote, the most flawless technically, and in spite of being a very light comedy, the most telling.\\" Orwell says that Arms and the Man wears well‚Äîhe was writing 50 years later‚Äîbecause its moral‚Äîthat war is not a wonderful, romantic adventure‚Äîstill needs to be told. His other plays of the period, equally well written, are about issues no longer controversial. For example, the theme of Mrs. Warren's Profession, which so shocked audiences at the time, was that the causes of prostitution are mainly economic, hardly big news today, and the play Widowers' Houses was an attack on slum landlords, who are now held in such low esteem that the matter is hardly controversial.George Orwell,George Bernard Shaw, Chapter 8 in George Orwell, The Lost Writings, Edited by W.

Subsequent productions * The first Broadway production opened on 17 September 1894 at New York City's Herald Square Theatre. Since then there have been six Broadway revivals, two of which are listed below. * The most prestigious London revival was directed by John Burrell for The Old Vic Company at the New Theatre, which opened on 5 September 1944, starring Ralph Richardson (Bluntschli), Margaret Leighton (Raina Petkoff), Joyce Redman (Louka), and Laurence Olivier (Major Sergius Saranoff). \\"Olivier thought Sergius a humbug, a buffoon, a blackguard, a coward, 'a bloody awful part' until Tyrone Guthrie said he would never succeed in the role until he learned to love Sergius. Olivier, spurred and moustachioed, was high camp\\": Robert Tanitch.London Stage in the 20th Century, by Robert Tanitch, Haus (2007) * A revival production ran at New York City's Arena Theatre from 19 October 1950 to 21 January 1951, for a total of 108 performances. The cast included Lee Grant as Raina, Francis Lederer as Bluntschli and Sam Wanamaker as Sergius. * Marlon Brando's final stage appearance was in Arms and the Man in 1953. He gathered friends who were fellow actors into a company for a summer stock production. He chose to play Sergius while William Redfield starred as Bluntschli. The show was produced on the college circuit as well in the 1950s. * The play was produced in 1982 at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, with Brian Bedford as Bluntschli and Len Cariou as Sergius. * The Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, New York, put on a production of Arms and the Man in 1983 with Kelsey Grammer as Sergius. * A BBC television production in 1983 starring Richard Briers as Captain Bluntschli, Peter Egan as Major Sergius Saranoff, Alice Krige as Raina and Anna Nygh as Louka. * In 1985 John Malkovich directed a revival production at New York City's Circle in the Square Theatre starring Kevin Kline as Bluntschli (later replaced by Malkovich after Kline's departure), Glenne Headly as Raina and Raul Julia as Sergius. The production ran from 30 May to 1 September 1985, for a total of 109 performances. * The BBC produced a second made-for-TV version in 1989, directed by James Cellan Jones, starring Helena Bonham Carter as Raina, Pip Torrens as Bluntschli, Patrick Ryecart as Sergius and Patsy Kensit as Louka. * In 2011 the play was presented by the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota; The Seattle Public Theater; and the Constellation Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. * In the summer of 2013, Odyssey Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada performed a masked performance of this play. * The Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, has performed the play a number of times: in 1967, 1976, 1986, 1994, 2006 and 2014, the last directed by Morris Panych.\\"History\\", Shaw Festival, accessed 5 January 2016 * The play opened at the American Shakespeare Center's Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, on 29 April 2016 and ran until 11 June. * The play is about to be staged at Thiagarajar College, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India from 9 to 14 December 2019 by the theatre club \\"Stage Sculptors\\". Adaptations The scene in The Chocolate Soldier in which Bumerli (the equivalent of Bluntschli) enters the bedroom of Nadina (the equivalent of Raina), in a 1910 London production *When Shaw gave the rights to adapt the play into what became the operetta The Chocolate Soldier (1908) with music by Oscar Straus, he provided three conditions: none of Shaw's dialogue nor any of his character's names could be used, the libretto must be advertised as a parody of Shaw's work, and Shaw would accept no monetary compensation. Nonetheless, Shaw's original plot, and with it the central message of the play, remained more or less untouched.Ellwood Annaheim (February 2002). \\"Shaw's Folly ‚Äì Straus' Fortune\\".

Shaw despised the result, calling it \\"a putrid op√©ra bouffe in the worst taste of 1860\\", but grew to regret not accepting payment when, despite his opinion of the work, it became a lucrative international success. *When Shaw heard, in 1921, that Franz Leh√°r wanted to set his play Pygmalion to music, he sent word to Vienna that Leh√°r be instructed that he could not touch Pygmalion without infringing Shaw's copyright and that Shaw had \\"no intention of allowing the history of The Chocolate Soldier to be repeated.\\" Only after Shaw's death was Pygmalion eventually adapted by Lerner and Loewe as My Fair Lady (1956). *A 1932 British film adaptation was directed by Cecil Lewis. It starred Barry Jones as Bluntschli and Anne Grey as Raina. *A filmed version of Arms and the Man in German entitled Helden (Heroes) starring O. W. Fischer and Liselotte Pulver was runner up for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1958. *An audio version was produced by the BBC in 1975 starring Ralph Richardson as Captain Bluntschli, John Gielgud as Major Sergius Saranoff, Vanessa Redgrave as Raina and Judi Dench as Louka. *A second BBC radio production was produced in 1984 and broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in February 2009 starring Andrew Sachs as Captain Bluntschli, Jackie Smith-Wood as Raina and Gary Bond as Major Saranoff. *A third BBC Radio production was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 21 March 2010 starring Rory Kinnear as Captain Bluntschli, Lydia Leonard as Raina and Tom Mison as Major Saranoff. This production was produced by Nicolas Soames and directed by David Timson. *An audio version was produced in 1999 by the CBC starring Simon Bradbury as Captain Bluntschli, Elizabeth Brown as Raina and Andrew Gillies as Major Saranoff. *Another audio version was produced in 2006 by the L.A. Theatre Works starring Jeremy Sisto as Captain Bluntschli, Anne Heche as Raina and Teri Garr as Catherine. *A musical by Udo J√ºrgens, Helden, Helden, also based on Shaw's play, premiered at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, Austria in 1973.

He is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the Imperial Latin period, known in particular for his epic Pharsalia. His youth and speed of composition set him apart from other poets. Life Three brief ancient accounts allow for the reconstruction of a modest biography ‚Äì the earliest attributed to Suetonius, another to an otherwise unknown Vacca, and the third anonymous and undated ‚Äì along with references in Martial, Cassius Dio, Tacitus's Annals, and one of Statius's Silvae. Lucan was the son of Marcus Annaeus Mela and grandson of Seneca the Elder; he grew up under the tutelage of his uncle Seneca the Younger. Born into a wealthy family, he studied rhetoric at Athens and was probably provided with a philosophical and Stoic education by his uncle.Suetonius, \\"Life of Lucan\\" Engraved title page of a French edition of Lucan's Pharsalia, 1657 His wife was Polla Argentaria, who is said to have assisted him with his Pharsalia. He found success under Nero, became one of the emperor's close friends and was rewarded with a quaestorship in advance of the legal age. In 60 AD, he won a prize for extemporizing Orpheus and Laudes Neronis at the quinquennial Neronia, and was again rewarded when the emperor appointed him to the augurate. During this time he circulated the first three books of his epic poem, Pharsalia (labelled De Bello civili in the manuscripts), which told the story of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey. At some point, a feud began between Nero and Lucan. Two very different accounts of the events have survived that both trivialize the feud. According to Tacitus, Nero became jealous of Lucan and forbade him to publish his poems.Tacitus, Annals XV.49 According to Suetonius, Nero lost interest in Lucan and Lucan responded by writing insulting poems about Nero that Nero continued to ignore.Suetonius, \\"Life of Lucan\\" Other works, though, point to a more serious basis to the feud. Works by the grammarian Vacca and the poet Statius may support the claim that Lucan wrote insulting poems about Nero. Vacca mentions that one of Lucan's works was entitled De Incendio Urbis (On the Burning of the City).Vacca, Life of Lucan Statius's ode to Lucan mentions that Lucan described how the \\"unspeakable flames of the criminal tyrant roamed the heights of Remus.\\"Statius, Silvae II.vii Additionally, the later books of Pharsalia are anti-Imperial and pro-Republic. This criticism of Nero and office of the Emperor may have been the true cause of the ban. Lucan later joined the 65 AD conspiracy of Gaius Calpurnius Piso against Nero. His treason discovered, he was obliged, at the age of 25, to commit suicide by opening a vein, but not before incriminating his mother, among others, in the hopes of a pardon. According to Tacitus, as Lucan bled to death, \\"(he) recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death and he recited the very lines. These were his last words.\\"Tacitus, Annals XV.70.1. Scholars have vainly tried to locate Lucan's last words in his work but no passage in Lucan's extant poem exactly matches Tacitus's description at \\"Annals\\" 15.70.1. See, e.g., P. Asso, \\"A Commentary on Lucan 'De Bello Civili IV.'\\" Berlin: De Gruyter, 2010, p. 9n38. His father was involved in the proscription but his mother escaped. Statius's poem about Lucan was addressed to his widow, Polla Argentaria, upon the occasion of his birthday during the reign of Domitian (Silvae, ii.7, the Genethliacon Lucani). Works Pharsalia, 1740 According to Vacca and Statius, Lucan's works included: Surviving work: * Pharsalia or De Bello Civili (On the Civil War), on the wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey Often attributed to him (but to others as well): * Laus Pisonis (Praise of Piso), a panegyric of a member of the Piso family Lost works: * Catachthonion * Iliacon from the Trojan cycle * Epigrammata * Adlocutio ad Pollam * Silvae * Saturnalia * Medea * Salticae Fabulae * Laudes Neronis, a praise of Nero * Orpheus * Prosa oratio in Octavium Sagittam * Epistulae ex Campania * De Incendio Urbis, on the Roman fire of 64, perhaps accusing Nero of arson Notes References * Further reading * Ahl, Frederick M.

It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem. It is occasionally called the Pythagorean distance, especially as a way to contrast three-dimensional Euclidean distance with geodesic distance, the length of a shortest curve along some surface such as that of the earth. The distance between two objects that are not points is usually defined to be the smallest distance between any two points from the two objects. Various formulas are known for computing distances between different types of objects, such as the distance from a point to a line. In more advanced areas of mathematics, Euclidean space and its distance provides a standard example of a metric space, called the Euclidean metric. When viewing Euclidean space as a vector space, its distance is associated with a norm called the Euclidean norm. It can be extended to more general vector spaces as the L2 norm or L2 distance. Distance formulas =One dimension= The distance between any two points on the real line is the absolute value of the numerical difference of their coordinates. Thus if p and q are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by: :d(p,q) = p-q. A more complicated formula, giving the same value, but generalizing more readily to higher dimensions, is: :d(p,q) = \\\\sqrt{(p-q)^2}. In this formula, squaring and then taking the square root leaves any positive number unchanged, but replaces any negative number by its absolute value. =Two dimensions= In the Euclidean plane, let point p have Cartesian coordinates (p_1,p_2) and let point q have coordinates (q_1,q_2). Then the distance between p and q is given by: :d(p,q) = \\\\sqrt{(p_1-q_1)^2+(p_2-q_2)^2}. This can be seen by applying the Pythagorean theorem to a right triangle with horizontal and vertical sides, having the line segment from p to q as its hypotenuse. The two squared formulas inside the square root give the areas of squares on the horizontal and vertical sides, and the outer square root converts the area of the square on the hypotenuse into the length of the hypotenuse. It is also possible to compute the distance for points given by polar coordinates. If the polar coordinates of p are (r,\\\\theta) and the polar coordinates of q are (s,\\\\psi), then their distance is :d(p,q)=\\\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 - 2rs\\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\psi)}. =Higher dimensions= Deriving the n-dimensional Euclidean distance formula by repeatedly applying the Pythagorean theorem In general, for points given by Cartesian coordinates in n-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance is :d(p,q) = \\\\sqrt{(p_1- q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2+\\\\cdots+(p_i - q_i)^2+\\\\cdots+(p_n - q_n)^2}. =Other objects than points= For pairs of objects that are not both points, the distance can be defined as the smallest distance between any two points from the two objects. Formulas for computing distances between different types of objects include: *The distance from a point to a line, in the Euclidean plane *The distance from a point to a plane in three-dimensional Euclidean space *The distance between two lines in three-dimensional Euclidean space Squared Euclidean distance In many applications, and in particular when comparing distances, it may be more convenient to omit the final square root in the calculation of Euclidean distances. The value resulting from this omission is the squared Euclidean distance. As an equation: :d^2(p,q) = (p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2+\\\\cdots+(p_i - q_i)^2+\\\\cdots+(p_n - q_n)^2. Beyond its application to distance comparison, squared Euclidean distance is of central importance in statistics, where it is used in the method of least squares, a standard method of fitting linear functions to data by finding the function that minimizes the average of the (one-dimensional) squared distances between the observed function values and the values predicted by the fit. In cluster analysis, squared distances can be used to strengthen the effect of longer distances. Squared Euclidean distance is not a metric, as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. However it is a smooth, strictly convex function of the two points, unlike the distance, which is non-smooth for equal points and convex but not strictly convex. The squared distance is thus preferred in optimization theory, since it allows convex analysis to be used. Since squaring is a monotonic function of non-negative values, minimizing squared distance is equivalent to minimizing the Euclidean distance, so the optimization problem is equivalent in terms of either, but easier to solve using squared distance. In the terminology of rational trigonometry, squared Euclidean distance is also called quadrance.

Such a medium can have a lower ratio of electric flux to charge (more permittivity) than empty space In electromagnetism, the absolute permittivity, often simply called permittivity and denoted by the Greek letter Œµ (epsilon), is a measure of the electric polarizability of a dielectric. A material with high permittivity polarizes more in response to an applied electric field than a material with low permittivity, thereby storing more energy in the material. In electrostatics, the permittivity plays an important role in determining the capacitance of a capacitor. In the simplest case, the electric displacement field \\\\mathbf{D} resulting from an applied electric field \\\\mathbf{E} is :\\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\mathbf{E}. More generally, the permittivity is a thermodynamic function of state . It can depend on the frequency, magnitude, and direction of the applied field. The SI unit for permittivity is farad per meter (F/m). The permittivity is often represented by the relative permittivity \\\\varepsilon_\\\\textrm{r} which is the ratio of the absolute permittivity \\\\varepsilon and the vacuum permittivity \\\\varepsilon_0 :\\\\kappa = \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\varepsilon_0}. This dimensionless quantity is also often and ambiguously referred to as the permittivity. Another common term encountered for both absolute and relative permittivity is the dielectric constant which has been deprecated in physics and engineering as well as in chemistry. By definition, a perfect vacuum has a relative permittivity of exactly 1 whereas at STP, air has a relative permittivity of Œ∫air = 1.0006. Relative permittivity is directly related to electric susceptibility (œá) by :\\\\chi = \\\\kappa - 1 otherwise written as :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\varepsilon_0 = (1+\\\\chi)\\\\varepsilon_0 Units The standard SI unit for permittivity is farad per meter (F/m or F¬∑m‚àí1)., p. 119 :\\\\frac{\\\\text{F}}{\\\\text{m}} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{C}}{\\\\text{V} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{m}} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{C}^2}{\\\\text{N} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{m}^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{C}^2 {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{s}^2}{\\\\text{kg} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{m}^3} Explanation In electromagnetism, the electric displacement field represents the distribution of electric charges in a given medium resulting from the presence of an electric field . This distribution includes charge migration and electric dipole reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of linear, homogeneous, isotropic materials with \\"instantaneous\\" response to changes in electric field is: :\\\\mathbf{D}=\\\\varepsilon \\\\mathbf{E} where the permittivity is a scalar. If the medium is anisotropic, the permittivity is a second rank tensor. In general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a nonlinear medium, the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values. In SI units, permittivity is measured in farads per meter (F/m or A2¬∑s4¬∑kg‚àí1¬∑m‚àí3). The displacement field is measured in units of coulombs per square meter (C/m2), while the electric field is measured in volts per meter (V/m). and describe the interaction between charged objects. is related to the charge densities associated with this interaction, while is related to the forces and potential differences. Vacuum permittivity The vacuum permittivity (also called permittivity of free space or the electric constant) is the ratio in free space. It also appears in the Coulomb force constant, :k_\\\\text{e}=\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} Its value is : \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{c_0^2\\\\mu_0} = \\\\frac{1}{35\\\\,950\\\\,207\\\\,149.472\\\\,7056\\\\pi}\\\\text{ F/m} \\\\approx 8.854\\\\,187\\\\,8176\\\\ldots\\\\times 10^{-12}\\\\text{ F/m } where * is the speed of light in free space, * is the vacuum permeability. The constants and were defined in SI units to have exact numerical values until redefinition of SI units in 2019. (The approximation in the second value of above stems from being an irrational number.) Relative permittivity The linear permittivity of a homogeneous material is usually given relative to that of free space, as a relative permittivity (also called dielectric constant, although this term is deprecated and sometimes only refers to the static, zero-frequency relative permittivity). In an anisotropic material, the relative permittivity may be a tensor, causing birefringence. The actual permittivity is then calculated by multiplying the relative permittivity by : :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\varepsilon_0 = (1+\\\\chi)\\\\varepsilon_0, where (frequently written ) is the electric susceptibility of the material. The susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a tensor) relating an electric field to the induced dielectric polarization density such that :\\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\varepsilon_0\\\\chi\\\\mathbf{E}, where is the electric permittivity of free space. The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity by :\\\\chi = \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} - 1. So in the case of a vacuum, :\\\\chi = 0. The susceptibility is also related to the polarizability of individual particles in the medium by the Clausius-Mossotti relation. The electric displacement is related to the polarization density by :\\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\varepsilon_0\\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\varepsilon_0 (1+\\\\chi) \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{E}. The permittivity and permeability of a medium together determine the phase velocity of electromagnetic radiation through that medium: :\\\\varepsilon \\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{v^2}.  Practical applications  = Determining capacitance = The capacitance of a capacitor is based on its design and architecture, meaning it will not change with charging and discharging. The formula for capacitance in a parallel plate capacitor is written as :C = \\\\varepsilon \\\\ \\\\frac{A}{d} where A is the area of one plate, d is the distance between the plates, and \\\\varepsilon is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity \\\\kappa, it can be said that :C = \\\\kappa \\\\ \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{A}{d} = Gauss's law = Permittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through Gauss's law. Gauss's law states that for a closed Gaussian surface, s :\\\\Phi_E = \\\\frac{Q_\\\\text{enc}}{\\\\varepsilon_0} = \\\\oint_s \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{A} where \\\\Phi_E is the net electric flux passing through the surface, Q_\\\\text{enc} is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface, \\\\mathbf{E} is the electric field vector at a given point on the surface, and \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{A} is a differential area vector on the Gaussian surface. If the Gaussian surface uniformly encloses an insulated, symmetrical charge arrangement, the formula can be simplified to :EA \\\\cos(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q_\\\\text{enc}}{\\\\varepsilon_0} where \\\\theta represents the angle between the electric field vector and the area vector. If all of the electric field lines cross the surface at 90¬∞, the formula can be further simplified to :E = \\\\frac{Q_\\\\text{enc}}{\\\\varepsilon_0 A} Because the surface area of a sphere is 4 \\\\pi r^2, the electric field a distance r away from a uniform, spherical charge arrangement is :E = \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon_0 A} = \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\left(4 \\\\pi r^2\\\\right)} :E = \\\\frac{Q}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 r^2} = \\\\frac{kQ}{r^2} where k is Coulomb's constant (\\\\sim 9.0 \\\\times 10^9 \\\\ \\\\text{m}/\\\\text{F}). This formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.  Dispersion and causality  In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is :\\\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^t \\\\chi\\\\left(t - t'\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(t'\\\\right) \\\\, dt'. That is, the polarization is a convolution of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by . The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines for . An instantaneous response would correspond to a Dirac delta function susceptibility . It is convenient to take the Fourier transform with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the convolution theorem, the integral becomes a simple product, :\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\chi(\\\\omega) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\omega). This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the dispersion properties of the material. Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively for ), a consequence of causality, imposes Kramers‚ÄìKronig constraints on the susceptibility . =Complex permittivity= A dielectric permittivity spectrum over a wide range of frequencies. and denote the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity, respectively. Various processes are labeled on the image: ionic and dipolar relaxation, and atomic and electronic resonances at higher energies. As opposed to the response of a vacuum, the response of normal materials to external fields generally depends on the frequency of the field. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be causal (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the (angular) frequency of the applied field: :\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\omega) (since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes :D_0 e^{-i \\\\omega t} = \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\omega) E_0 e^{-i \\\\omega t}, where * and are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively, * is the imaginary unit, . The response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity (also ): :\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{s} = \\\\lim_{\\\\omega \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\omega). At the high-frequency limit (meaning optical frequencies), the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as (or sometimes ). At the plasma frequency and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference emerges between and . The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength (), and remain proportional, and :\\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{D_0}{E_0} = \\\\varepsilone^{-i\\\\delta}. Since the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way: :\\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon'(\\\\omega) - i\\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega) = \\\\left\\\\frac{D_0}{E_0} \\\\right\\\\left( \\\\cos \\\\delta - i\\\\sin \\\\delta \\\\right). where * is the real part of the permittivity; * is the imaginary part of the permittivity; * is the loss angle. The choice of sign for time-dependence, , dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities. The complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency , since it is a superimposed description of dispersion phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions. At a given frequency, the imaginary part, , leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered. In the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of photon absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function . The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression: : \\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega) = 1 + \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2 e^2}{m^2}\\\\sum_{c,v}\\\\int W_{c,v}(E) \\\\bigl( \\\\varphi (\\\\hbar \\\\omega - E) - \\\\varphi( \\\\hbar\\\\omega + E) \\\\bigr) \\\\, dx. In this expression, represents the product of the Brillouin zone-averaged transition probability at the energy with the joint density of states, ; is a broadening function, representing the role of scattering in smearing out the energy levels. In general, the broadening is intermediate between Lorentzian and Gaussian; for an alloy it is somewhat closer to Gaussian because of strong scattering from statistical fluctuations in the local composition on a nanometer scale. =Tensorial permittivity= According to the Drude model of magnetized plasma, a more general expression which takes into account the interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor. Prati E. (2003) \\"Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems\\", J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl. 17, 8, 1177 (see also Electro-gyration). :\\\\mathbf{D}(\\\\omega) = \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\varepsilon_1 & -i \\\\varepsilon_2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ i \\\\varepsilon_2 & \\\\varepsilon_1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\varepsilon_z \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{E}}(\\\\omega) If vanishes, then the tensor is diagonal but not proportional to the identity and the medium is said to be a uniaxial medium, which has similar properties to a uniaxial crystal. =Classification of materials= Materials can be classified according to their complex-valued permittivity , upon comparison of its real and imaginary components (or, equivalently, conductivity, , when accounted for in the latter). A perfect conductor has infinite conductivity, , while a perfect dielectric is a material that has no conductivity at all, ; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name lossless media.http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf Generally, when we consider the material to be a low-loss dielectric (although not exactly lossless), whereas is associated with a good conductor; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of loss that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be lossy media. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media. =Lossy medium= In the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is: :J_\\\\text{tot} = J_\\\\mathrm{c} + J_\\\\mathrm{d} = \\\\sigma E + i \\\\omega \\\\varepsilon' E = i \\\\omega \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon} E where * is the conductivity of the medium; *\\\\varepsilon'=\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_r is the real part of the permittivity. *\\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}=\\\\varepsilon'-i\\\\varepsilonis the complex permittivity The size of the displacement current is dependent on the frequency œâ of the applied field E; there is no displacement current in a constant field. In this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:John S. Seybold (2005), Introduction to RF Propagation, John Wiley & Sons, p. 22, eq. (2.6).Kenneth L. Kaiser, Electromagnetic Shielding, CRC Press, 2005, p. 1¬∑28, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81). :\\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\varepsilon' \\\\left(1 - i \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\omega \\\\varepsilon'}\\\\right) = \\\\varepsilon' - i \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\omega} In general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency: * First are the relaxation effects associated with permanent and induced molecular dipoles. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach equilibrium before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the viscosity of the medium, absorption of the field's energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called dielectric relaxation and for ideal dipoles is described by classic Debye relaxation. * Second are the resonance effects, which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, ions, or electrons. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic absorption frequencies. The above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1‚Äì2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15‚Äì25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors. =Quantum-mechanical interpretation= In terms of quantum mechanics, permittivity is explained by atomic and molecular interactions. At low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens. At moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime). At high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting electron energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as ionizing radiation. While carrying out a complete ab initio (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The Debye model and the Lorentz model use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit). Measurement The relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of dielectric spectroscopy, covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10‚àí6 to 1015 hertz. Also, by using cryostats and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range. Various microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen et al.. Typical errors for the Hakki-Coleman method employing a puck of material between conducting planes are about 0.3%. * Low-frequency time domain measurements (10‚àí6 to 103 Hz) * Low-frequency frequency domain measurements (10‚àí5 to 106 Hz) * Reflective coaxial methods (106 to 1010 Hz) * Transmission coaxial method (108 to 1011 Hz) * Quasi-optical methods (109 to 1010 Hz) * Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (1011 to 1013 Hz) * Fourier-transform methods (1011 to 1015 Hz) At infrared and optical frequencies, a common technique is ellipsometry. Dual polarisation interferometry is also used to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.

These lands have changed hands many times, and have been known by a variety of different names. Up until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy after the First World War, the lands were known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown and formed a constituent state of that empire: the Kingdom of Bohemia (in Czech: \\"Kr√°lovstv√≠ ƒçesk√©\\", the word \\"Bohemia\\" is a Latin term for ƒåechy). Prior to the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the Kingdom was an independent state within the Holy Roman Empire. After that battle the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were incorporated into the Austrian Empire, and later into the aforementioned Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. They came to be known as the Czech lands after the fall of the Empire, and the rise of the First Czechoslovak Republic, when the term Bohemia (), which also refers to the core region of the former kingdom, was no longer deemed acceptable by those in Moravia and Czech Silesia (historically, other two core lands of the Bohemian Crown). These three integral Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia) now form the boundaries of the Czech Republic.

Territories ruled by Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1273 Territory under the control of the P≈ôemyslids, c. 1301 Lands of the Bohemian crown until 1740. The First Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938)  Pre-history  Humans had settled in the region by the (Lower Paleolithic) (2.5mil ‚Äì 300,000 BP). Several Paleolithic cultures settled here, including Acheulean, Micoquien, Mousterian, and Aurignacian. The P≈ôedmost√≠ archaeological site near Brno is dated to between 24,000 and 27,000 years old. The figurines (Venus of Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice) found here are the oldest known ceramic articles in the world. Early tribes The area was settled by the Celts (called Boii, who gave the name to the region: Bohemia, which means more or less \\"the home of the Boii\\") from 5th century BCE until 2nd century CE and from 1st century by various Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards). Germanic towns are described on the Map of Ptolemaios in the 2nd century, e.g. Coridorgis for Jihlava. Those tribes migrated to the West in 5th century and then came Slavs. Arrival of the Slavs The first Slavic people (Czech tribes in Bohemia and Moravians in Moravia) arrived in the 6th century. According to historian Du≈°an T≈ôe≈°t√≠k, they advanced through the Moravian Gate (Moravsk√° br√°na) valley and in the year 530 moved into Eastern Bohemia, along the rivers Labe (Elbe) and Vltava (Moldau) further into Central Bohemia. Many historians support the theory of a further wave of Slavs coming from the south during the first half of the 7th century. They fought with neighboring Avars until the rise of the empire of Samo (see below).; Literature : Du≈°an T≈ôe≈°t√≠k: \\"Poƒç√°tky P≈ôemyslovc≈Ø.

Samo's realm According to the Chronicle of Fredegar, some of the Slavs living on what is now Czech territory, mainly in southern Moravia, were exposed for a number of years to violence and marauding raids from the Avars, whose empire stretched across the territory of present-day Hungary. In 623, the Slavic tribes revolted against the oppression of the Avars. During this time, the Frankish merchant Samo allegedly came to the Czech lands with his entourage and joined with the Slavs to defeat the Avars. Thus the Slavs adopted Samo as their ruler. \\"So it happened that he self-founded the first Slavic empire. He married the then twelve Slavic women had with them twenty-two sons and fifteen daughters and happily ruled for 35 years. All other fights, which under his leadership Slavs fought with the Avars, were victorious,\\" the Frankish chronicler Reich (called Fredegar) wrote about Samo in the oldest extant written report by the Slavs in the Czech lands. Later Samo and the Slavs came into conflict with the Frankish empire whose ruler Dagobert I wanted to extend his rule to the east, but Dagobert was defeated in the memorable battle of Wogastisburg in 631. To this day, historians are searching in vain for this stronghold's actual location. Over the next five years Samo and the Slavs undertook raids on Frankish territory, but no one knows exactly how far to the northeast Samo's power eventually reached, probably beyond the boundaries of today's Czech Republic. After Samo's death, his empire seems to have disappeared; in fact, however, there never was a real state structure with solid organization. The empire was created to unite Slavs to defend against Avars and Franks and to facilitate Slavic plundering expeditions against their neighbors. Once the Avar and Frankish danger had passed, the united empire disintegrated and the fragmented territories were ruled by Samo's various followers. These remnants continued their further development and became the core foundation for the future Great Moravian Empire. Great Moravia A Slavic state Great Moravia was created by the ancestors of the Czechs, Serbs (engl. Sorbs), Slovaks and Poles and its core area lay on both sides of the Morava river.  Duchy of Bohemia and Kingdom of Bohemia to 1526 The Duchy of Bohemia established in the 9th century raised to a Kingdom in 1198. The country reached its greatest territorial extent and is considered as the Golden Age. Bohemian Estates against Habsburg absolutism Ferdinand II, who ruled 1619‚Äì1637, sharply curtailed the power of the largely Protestant representative assembly known as the \\"Bohemian Estates\\". He confiscated lands of Protestant nobles and gave them to his Catholic friends and to the generals who led the foreign mercenaries he employed.

It was initially scheduled for fielding by 2008. United Defense was the prime contractor; General Dynamics the major subcontractor. In early May 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld cancelled the US$11 billion program because he considered it neither mobile nor precise enough. The prototype SPH vehicle is on display at the cannon park at Fort Sill. Inception The Crusader was conceived as the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS), part of a family of vehicles built around a common chassis in the Armored Systems Modernization program. In 1994 AFAS was renamed \\"Crusader.\\" In 1996, the Crusader's experimental liquid propellant system was replaced by more traditional solid propellant bags. In 1997 the Government Accountability Office advised the Army to consider either upgrading the Paladin or to purchase the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 instead. The Crusader was intended to replace the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer and the M992 Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV). It was intended to be an automated gun artillery system to support the Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) Counterattack Corps and a basis for other vehicle developments. Key features of the Crusader design included: * A cooled XM297E2 cannon for sustained high rates of fire * Automated ammunition handling and loading * Cockpit with embedded command and control * Composite armor * Survivability features to protect the vehicle and crew * GE/Honeywell LV100-5 gas turbine engine to keep up with other fighting vehicles Using the same chassis, the resupply vehicles (RSVs) would deliver automatic, reciprocal transfer of ammunition, data and fuel to the SPH or another RSV. =Program Timeline= * 1QFY95 Approved to commence program definition and risk reduction (PDRR) phase. * 2QFY98 In-process review completed and manufacture of the PDRR prototype systems begun. * 3QFY99 Delivery of first RSV prototype. * 2QFY00 Delivery of first prototype howitzer SPH 1. * 1QFY02 Successful preliminary design review. * 1QFY02 More than 4000 rounds fired from SPH 1. * 2QFY02 Program discontinued.

The following month Shinseki said the vehicles were too heavy: the howitzer and its resupply vehicle would weigh a combined 110 tons, more than could be carried by any of the Air Force's aircraft, including the C-5 Galaxy if flight rules aren't waived. Shinseki spoke with contractor United Defense about bringing down the combined weight of the two vehicles by 20 tons, which United agreed was possible. In April 2001, a panel convened by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recommended canceling the Crusader and other defense modernization programs. An official involved called the Crusader \\"a wonderful system  for a legacy world.\\" As of 2002, the Army planned to acquire 480 Crusaders at a program cost of $11 billion. In February 2002, President George W. Bush allocated $475 million for the Crusader program in the White House's 2003 budget proposal, which also proposed increased Pentagon spending by $48 billion. In April, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, whose concerns about defense modernization overspending had intensified, met with Pentagon officials including Army Secretary Thomas E. White to discuss defense spending cuts to free funding for more essential modernization programs. The officials discussed cuts to the Crusader, RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, and F-22 Raptor. Some officials questioned whether the howitzer was redundant given the parallel development of a lighter howitzer for the Future Combat Systems modernization effort. On May 9, Rumsfeld announced that he would ask Congress to cancel the $11 billion program. Days before, Congress members favorable to the Crusader received talking points from Army official who sought to save the program. The last-minute lobbying prompted anger from Rumsfeld and an internal Army investigation into its congressional liaison office. The investigation culminated with the resignation of the Army official who had distributed the talking points. After being absolved himself of wrongdoing in the matter, Army Secretary White assured that he supported Rumsfeld's decision and said the Army was analyzing alternatives to the Crusader including the M982 Excalibur 155-mm guided artillery shell. The House Appropriations Committee responded, after rejected a measure that would have sustained the program until the fall, asking the Pentagon to delay plans to cancel the Crusader. Later that month President Bush asked Congress to reallocate the Crusader's budget towards other Army developmental weapons including $310 million for Future Combat Systems in the proposed 2003 Pentagon budget.

Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex in the allocortex, and in primates it is in the medial temporal lobe. It contains two main interlocking parts: the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn)Pearce, 2001 and the dentate gyrus. In Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories. Since different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was initially discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain. In rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment. Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.  Name  fornix (left) compared with a seahorse (right)preparation by L√°szl√≥ Seress in 1980. The earliest description of the ridge running along the floor of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle comes from the Venetian anatomist Julius Caesar Aranzi (1587), who likened it first to a silkworm and then to a seahorse (Latin hippocampus, from Greek ·º±œÄœÄœåŒ∫Œ±ŒºœÄŒøœÇ, from Greek ·ºµœÄœÄŒøœÇ, \\"horse\\" + Œ∫Œ¨ŒºœÄŒøœÇ, \\"sea- monster\\"). The German anatomist Duvernoy (1729), the first to illustrate the structure, also wavered between \\"seahorse\\" and \\"silkworm\\". \\"Ram's horn\\" was proposed by the Danish anatomist Jacob Winsl√∏w in 1732; and a decade later his fellow Parisian, the surgeon de Garengeot, used \\"cornu Ammonis\\" ‚Äì horn of (the ancient Egyptian god) Amun,Duvernoy, 2005 who was often represented as having a ram's head. This has survived in abbreviated form as CA in naming the subfields of the hippocampus. Another reference appeared with the term pes hippocampi, which may date back to Diemerbroeck in 1672, introducing a comparison with the shape of the folded back forelimbs and webbed feet of the mythological hippocampus, a sea-monster with a horse's forequarters and a fish's tail. The hippocampus was then described as pes hippocampi major, with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn, described as the pes hippocampi minor and later renamed as the calcar avis. The renaming of the hippocampus as hippocampus major, and the calcar avis as hippocampus minor, has been attributed to F√©lix Vicq-d'Azyr systematising nomenclature of parts of the brain in 1786. Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the centre of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirised as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks, and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895.Gross, 1993 Today, the structure is just called the hippocampus, with the term Cornu Ammonis surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1-CA4.Wechsler, 2004 Relation to limbic system The term limbic system was introduced in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line the edge of the cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior‚Äîthe septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted to be part of the limbic system. Anatomy Image 2: Cross-section of cerebral hemisphere showing structure and location of hippocampus Coronal section of the brain of a macaque monkey, showing hippocampus (circled) The hippocampus can be seen as a ridge of gray matter tissue, elevating from the floor of each lateral ventricle in the region of the inferior or temporal horn. This ridge can also be seen as an inward fold of the archicortex into the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampus can only be seen in dissections as it is concealed by the parahippocampal gyrus.Amaral and Lavenex, 2006 The cortex thins from six layers to the three or four layers that make up the hippocampus. The term hippocampal formation is used to refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals. The hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, has the shape of a curved tube, which has been compared to a seahorse, and a ram's horn (Cornu Ammonis). Its abbreviation CA is used in naming the hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. It can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the \\"U,\\" ‚Äì CA4, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part (in primates) or a ventral and dorsal part in other animals. Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits.Moser and Moser, 1998 In the rat, the two hippocampi resemble a pair of bananas, joined at the stems by the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure). In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut. In a cross- section of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, several layers will be shown. The dentate gyrus has three layers of cells (or four if the hilus is included). The layers are from the outer in - the molecular layer, the inner molecular layer, the granular layer, and the hilus. The CA3 in the hippocampus proper has the following cell layers known as strata: lacunosum-moleculare, radiatum, lucidum, pyramidal, and oriens. CA2 and CA1 also have these layers except the lucidum stratum. The input to the hippocampus (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) comes from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures as well as with the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus. The EC is located in the parahippocampal gyrus, a cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex, which plays an important role in the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.Eichenbaum et al, 2007 =Circuitry= Cajal DG: dentate gyrus. Sub: subiculum. EC: entorhinal cortex The major input to the hippocampus is through the entorhinal cortex (EC), whereas its major output is via CA1 to the subiculum.Kandel, 2012 Information reaches CA1 via two main pathways, direct and indirect. Axons from the EC that originate in layer III are the origin of the direct perforant pathway and form synapses on the very distal apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. Conversely, axons originating from layer II are the origin of the indirect pathway, and information reaches CA1 via the trisynaptic circuit. In the initial part of this pathway, the axons project through the perforant pathway to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (first synapse). From then, the information follows via the mossy fibres to CA3 (second synapse). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1 (third synapse). Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex, completing the circuit. Basket cells in CA3 receive excitatory input from the pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits. Several other connections play important roles in hippocampal function. Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers (GABAergic fibers) to all parts of the hippocampus. The inputs from the medial septal nucleus play a key role in controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.Winson, 1978 =Regions= Image 5: Hippocampal location and regions Areas of the hippocampus are shown to be functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells.Fanselow, 2010 The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus.Pothuizen et al., 2004 The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.Jung et al., 1994 The intermediate hippocampus has overlapping characteristics with both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes.Cenquizca et al., 2007 Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced the amount of information sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.Anagnostaras et al., 2002 Historically, the earliest widely held hypothesis was that the hippocampus is involved in olfaction. This idea was cast into doubt by a series of anatomical studies that did not find any direct projections to the hippocampus from the olfactory bulb.Finger, p. 183 However, later work did confirm that the olfactory bulb does project into the ventral part of the lateral entorhinal cortex, and field CA1 in the ventral hippocampus sends axons to the main olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and to the primary olfactory cortex. There continues to be some interest in hippocampal olfactory responses, in particular, the role of the hippocampus in memory for odors, but few specialists today believe that olfaction is its primary function.Eichenbaum et al, 1991Vanderwolf, 2001 Function =Theories of hippocampal functions= Over the years, three main ideas of hippocampal function have dominated the literature: response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. The behavioral inhibition theory (caricatured by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel as \\"slam on the brakes!\\")Nadel et al., 1975 was very popular up to the 1960s. It derived much of its justification from two observations: first, that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive; second, that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit responses that they have previously been taught, especially if the response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test. British psychologist Jeffrey Gray developed this line of thought into a full-fledged theory of the role of the hippocampus in anxiety.Gray and McNaughton, 2000 The inhibition theory is currently the least popular of the three.Best & White, 1999 The second major line of thought relates the hippocampus to memory. Although it had historical precursors, this idea derived its main impetus from a famous report by American neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville and British-Canadian neuropsychologist Brenda MilnerScoville and Milner, 1957 describing the results of surgical destruction of the hippocampi when trying to relieve epileptic seizures in an American man Henry Molaison,New York Times, 12-06-2008 known until his death in 2008 as \\"Patient H.M.\\" The unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde and partial retrograde amnesia; Molaison was unable to form new episodic memories after his surgery and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery, but he did retain memories of events that occurred many years earlier extending back into his childhood. This case attracted such widespread professional interest that Molaison became the most intensively studied subject in medical history.Squire, 2009 In the ensuing years, other patients with similar levels of hippocampal damage and amnesia (caused by accident or disease) have also been studied, and thousands of experiments have studied the physiology of activity-driven changes in synaptic connections in the hippocampus. There is now universal agreement that the hippocampi play some sort of important role in memory; however, the precise nature of this role remains widely debated.Squire, 1992Eichenbaum and Cohen, 1993 A recent theory proposed - without questioning its role in spatial cognition - that the hippocampus encodes new episodic memories by associating representations in the newborn granule cells of the dentate gyrus and arranging those representations sequentially in the CA3 by relying on the phase precession generated in the entorhinal cortex Rats and cognitive maps The third important theory of hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space. The spatial theory was originally championed by O'Keefe and Nadel, who were influenced by American psychologist E.C. Tolman's theories about \\"cognitive maps\\" in humans and animals. O'Keefe and his student Dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in the rat hippocampus that appeared to them to show activity related to the rat's location within its environment.O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971 Despite skepticism from other investigators, O'Keefe and his co-workers, especially Lynn Nadel, continued to investigate this question, in a line of work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map.O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 There is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function plays an important role in spatial coding, but the details are widely debated.Moser et al., 2008 Later research has focused on trying to bridge the disconnect between the two main views of hippocampal function as being split between memory and spatial cognition. In some studies, these areas have been expanded to the point of near convergence. In an attempt to reconcile the two disparate views, it is suggested that a broader view of the hippocampal function is taken and seen to have a role that encompasses both the organisation of experience (mental mapping, as per Tolman's original concept in 1948) and the directional behaviour seen as being involved in all areas of cognition, so that the function of the hippocampus can be viewed as a broader system that incorporates both the memory and the spatial perspectives in its role that involves the use of a wide scope of cognitive maps. This relates to the purposive behaviorism born of Tolman's original goal of identifying the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behaviour. It has also been proposed that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and it was suggested that the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically the same. Many studies have made use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a functional role in approach-avoidance conflict has been noted. The anterior hippocampus is seen to be involved in decision-making under approach- avoidance conflict processing. It is suggested that the memory, spatial cognition, and conflict processing functions may be seen as working together and not mutually exclusive. = Role in memory = Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree that the hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of new memories about experienced events (episodic or autobiographical memory).Squire and Schacter, 2002 Part of this function is hippocampal involvement in the detection of new events, places and stimuli.VanElzakker et al., 2008 Some researchers regard the hippocampus as part of a larger medial temporal lobe memory system responsible for general declarative memory (memories that can be explicitly verbalized‚Äîthese would include, for example, memory for facts in addition to episodic memory). The hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This is partly why returning to a location where an emotional event occurred may evoke that emotion. There is a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places. Due to bilateral symmetry the brain has a hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere. If damage to the hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere, leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere, the brain can retain near-normal memory functioning. Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends many years back before the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain. This retention of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain.Squire and Schacter, 2002, Ch. 1 Experiments using intrahippocampal transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation and recall, but not the storage, of memories. It has been shown that a decrease in the volume of various parts of the hippocampus in people leads to specific memory impairments. In particular, efficiency of verbal memory retention is related to the anterior parts of the right and left hippocampus. The right head of the hippocampus is more involved in executive functions and regulation during verbal memory recall. The tail of the left hippocampus tends to be closely related to verbal memory capacity. Damage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory, such as the ability to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory (procedural memory) and different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show \\"implicit\\" memory for experiences even in the absence of conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection, which depends on the hippocampus, and familiarity, which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe.Diana et al., 2007 When rats are exposed to an intense learning event, they may retain a life-long memory of the event even after a single training session. The memory of such an event appears to be first stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an intense learning event was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one hour and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) in DNA. Demethylation of 5mC can be carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). = Role in spatial memory and navigation = CA1 layer of a rat. The rat ran back and forth along an elevated track, stopping at each end to eat a small food reward. Dots indicate positions where action potentials were recorded, with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential. Studies on freely moving rats and mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a particular location. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair.Matsumura et al., 1999 However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather than to its actual location in the room.Rolls and Xiang, 2006 Over many years, many studies have been carried out on place-responses in rodents, which have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons, and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate that are much weaker. There is little, if any, spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next to each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30‚Äì40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables.Smith and Mizumori, 2006 The firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves, a process termed phase precession. In humans, cells with location-specific firing patterns have been reported during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize the source of their seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town.Ekstrom et al., 2003 Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London‚Äôs black cab drivers need to learn the locations of a large number of places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.Maguire et al., 2000 Another study showed opposite findings in blind individuals. The anterior part of the right hippocampus was larger and the posterior part was smaller, compared with sighted individuals. There are several navigational cells in the brain that are either in the hippocampus itself or are strongly connected to it, such as the speed cells present in the medial entorhinal cortex. Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory. The first of such cells discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, which led to the idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a cognitive map.O'Keefe and Nadel When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia.Chiu et al., 2004 Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal.Morris et al., 1982Sutherland et al., 1982Sutherland et al., 2001Clark et al., 2005 Other cells have been discovered since the finding of the place cells in the rodent brain that are either in the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex. These have been assigned as head direction cells, grid cells and boundary cells.Solstad et al., 2008 Speed cells are thought to provide input to the hippocampal grid cells. =Role in approach-avoidance conflict processing= Approach-avoidance conflict happens when a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making has been associated with anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions. A review makes reference to a number of studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.  Electroencephalography Image 7: Examples of rat hippocampal EEG and CA1 neural activity in the theta (awake/behaving) and LIA (slow-wave sleep) modes. Each plot shows 20 seconds of data, with a hippocampal EEG trace at the top, spike rasters from 40 simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells in the middle (each raster line represents a different cell), and a plot of running speed at the bottom. The top plot represents a time period during which the rat was actively searching for scattered food pellets. For the bottom plot the rat was asleep. The hippocampus shows two major \\"modes\\" of activity, each associated with a distinct pattern of neural population activity and waves of electrical activity as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). These modes are named after the EEG patterns associated with them: theta and large irregular activity (LIA). The main characteristics described below are for the rat, which is the animal most extensively studied. The theta mode appears during states of active, alert behavior (especially locomotion), and also during REM (dreaming) sleep.Buzs√°ki et al., 1990 In the theta mode, the EEG is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hz, and the main groups of hippocampal neurons (pyramidal cells and granule cells) show sparse population activity, which means that in any short time interval, the great majority of cells are silent, while the small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates, up to 50 spikes in one second for the most active of them. An active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds. As the rat behaves, the active cells fall silent and new cells become active, but the overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant. In many situations, cell activity is determined largely by the spatial location of the animal, but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it. The LIA mode appears during slow-wave (non-dreaming) sleep, and also during states of waking immobility such as resting or eating. In the LIA mode, the EEG is dominated by sharp waves that are randomly timed large deflections of the EEG signal lasting for 25‚Äì50 milliseconds. Sharp waves are frequently generated in sets, with sets containing up to 5 or more individual sharp waves and lasting up to 500 ms. The spiking activity of neurons within the hippocampus is highly correlated with sharp wave activity. Most neurons decrease their firing rate between sharp waves; however, during a sharp wave, there is a dramatic increase in firing rate in up to 10% of the hippocampal population These two hippocampal activity modes can be seen in primates as well as rats, with the exception that it has been difficult to see robust theta rhythmicity in the primate hippocampus. There are, however, qualitatively similar sharp waves and similar state-dependent changes in neural population activity.Skaggs et al., 2007 = Theta rhythm = right The underlying currents producing the theta wave are generated mainly by densely packed neural layers of the entorhinal cortex, CA3, and the dendrites of pyramidal cells. The theta wave is one of the largest signals seen on EEG, and is known as the hippocampal theta rhythm.Buzs√°ki, 2002 In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10 Hz, often continuing for many seconds. These reflect subthreshold membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronise across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern.Lubenov & Siapas, 2009 The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm. Theta rhythmicity is very obvious in rabbits and rodents and also clearly present in cats and dogs. Whether theta can be seen in primates is not yet clear.Cantero et al., 2003 In rats (the animals that have been the most extensively studied), theta is seen mainly in two conditions: first, when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings; second, during REM sleep.Vanderwolf, 1969 The function of theta has not yet been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed.Buzs√°ki, 2006 The most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory. An example would be the phase with which theta rhythms, at the time of stimulation of a neuron, shape the effect of that stimulation upon its synapses. What is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity.Huerta & Lisman, 1993 It is well established that lesions of the medial septum‚Äîthe central node of the theta system‚Äîcause severe disruptions of memory.Numan, 1995 However, the medial septum is more than just the controller of theta; it is also the main source of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. It has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating the theta rhythm.Kahana et al., 2001 = Sharp waves = During sleep or during resting, when an animal is not engaged with its surroundings, the hippocampal EEG shows a pattern of irregular slow waves, somewhat larger in amplitude than theta waves. This pattern is occasionally interrupted by large surges called sharp waves.Buzs√°ki, 1986 These events are associated with bursts of spike activity lasting 50 to 100 milliseconds in pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1. They are also associated with short-lived high-frequency EEG oscillations called \\"ripples\\", with frequencies in the range 150 to 200 Hz in rats, and together they are known as sharp waves and ripples. Sharp waves are most frequent during sleep when they occur at an average rate of around 1 per second (in rats) but in a very irregular temporal pattern. Sharp waves are less frequent during inactive waking states and are usually smaller. Sharp waves have also been observed in humans and monkeys. In macaques, sharp waves are robust but do not occur as frequently as in rats. One of the most interesting aspects of sharp waves is that they appear to be associated with memory. Wilson and McNaughton 1994,Wilson & McNaughton, 1994 and numerous later studies, reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields (and therefore often fire in near-simultaneity), they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session. This enhancement of correlation, commonly known as reactivation, has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves.Jackson et al., 2006 It has been proposed that sharp waves are, in fact, reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior, driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within the hippocampus.Sutherland & McNaughton, 2000 This idea forms a key component of the \\"two-stage memory\\" theory, advocated by Buzs√°ki and others, which proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep. Sharp waves in Hebbian theory are seen as persistently repeated stimulations by presynaptic cells, of postsynaptic cells that are suggested to drive synaptic changes in the cortical targets of hippocampal output pathways.Buzs√°ki, 1989 Suppression of sharp waves and ripples in sleep or during immobility can interfere with memories expressed at the level of the behavior, nonetheless, the newly formed CA1 place cell code can re-emerge even after a sleep with abolished sharp waves and ripples, in spatially non-demanding tasks. = Long-term potentiation= Since at least the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by altering the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active.Ramon y Cajal, 1894 This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949,Hebb, 1949 but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje L√∏mo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb's specifications: a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer.Bliss & L√∏mo, 1973 This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, and a great deal has been learned about it. However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signalling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.Malenka & Bear, 2004 The hippocampus is a particularly favorable site for studying LTP because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons, but similar types of activity-dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas.Cooke & Bliss, 2006 The best-studied form of LTP has been seen in CA1 of the hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use the neurotransmitter glutamate. The synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor, the N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a cell surface receptor which has the special property of allowing calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time.Nakazawa et al., 2004 Drugs that interfere with NMDA receptors block LTP and have major effects on some types of memory, especially spatial memory. Genetically modified mice that are modified to disable the LTP mechanism, also generally show severe memory deficits. Disorders =Aging= Age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia (for which hippocampal disruption is one of the earliest signsHampel et al., 2008) have a severe impact on many types of cognition including memory. Even normal aging is associated with a gradual decline in some types of memory, including episodic memory and working memory (or short-term memory). Because the hippocampus is thought to play a central role in memory, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that age-related declines could be caused by hippocampal deterioration.Prull et al., 2000, p. 105 Some early studies reported substantial loss of neurons in the hippocampus of elderly people, but later studies using more precise techniques found only minimal differences. Similarly, some MRI studies have reported shrinkage of the hippocampus in elderly people, but other studies have failed to reproduce this finding. There is, however, a reliable relationship between the size of the hippocampus and memory performance; so that where there is age-related shrinkage, memory performance will be impaired.Prull et al., 2000, p. 107 There are also reports that memory tasks tend to produce less hippocampal activation in the elderly than in the young. Furthermore, a randomized control trial published in 2011 found that aerobic exercise could increase the size of the hippocampus in adults aged 55 to 80 and also improve spatial memory.Erickson et al., 2011 =Stress= The hippocampus contains high levels of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas.Joels, 2008 There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of other parts of the brain.Fu et al, 2010 These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. see also MRI database at www.depressiondatabase.org Anterior hippocampal volume in children is positively correlated with parental family income and this correlation is thought to be mediated by income related stress. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.Campbell & MacQueen, 2004 Chronic stress resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids, notably of cortisol, is seen to be a cause of neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus. This atrophy results in a smaller hippocampal volume which is also seen in Cushing‚Äôs syndrome. The higher levels of cortisol in Cushing‚Äôs syndrome is usually the result of medications taken for other conditions. Neuronal loss also occurs as a result of impaired neurogenesis. Another factor that contributes to a smaller hippocampal volume is that of dendritic retraction where dendrites are shortened in length and reduced in number, in response to increased glucocorticoids. This dendritic retraction is reversible. After treatment with medication to reduce cortisol in Cushing‚Äôs syndrome, the hippocampal volume is seen to be restored by as much as 10%. This change is seen to be due to the reforming of the dendrites. This dendritic restoration can also happen when stress is removed. There is, however, evidence derived mainly from studies using rats that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect hippocampal function in ways that persist throughout life.Garcia-Segura, pp. 170‚Äì71 Sex-specific responses to stress have also been demonstrated in the rat to have an effect on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones. In rats, DNA damage increases in the hippocampus under conditions of stress. =Epilepsy= Image 9: An EEG showing epilepsy right-hippocampal seizure onset Image 10: An EEG showing epilepsy left-hippocampal seizure onset The hippocampus is one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus.Kuruba et al., 2009 The production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures. Seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy can affect the normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common type of such tissue damage.Chang and Lowenstein, 2003 It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures.Sloviter, 2005 However, in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also have something to do with the hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life, and to abnormalities in this process. =Schizophrenia= The causes of schizophrenia are not well understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions in the size of the hippocampus in people with schizophrenia.Harrison, 2004 The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex.Goto & Grace, 2008 It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.Boyer et al., 2007 MRI studies have found a smaller brain volume and larger ventricles in people with schizophrenia- however researchers do not know if the shrinkage is from the schizophrenia or from the medication. The hippocampus and thalamus have been shown to be reduced in volume; and the volume of the globus pallidus is increased. Cortical patterns are altered, and a reduction in the volume and thickness of the cortex particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes has been noted. It has further been proposed that many of the changes seen are present at the start of the disorder which gives weight to the theory that there is abnormal neurodevelopment. The hippocampus has been seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder. Oxidative DNA damage is substantially increased in the hippocampus of elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia. =Transient global amnesia= Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of short-term memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of structures such as the hippocampus that are involved in memory. There has been no scientific proof of any cause. However, diffusion weighted MRI studies taken from 12 to 24 hours following an episode has shown there to be small dot-like lesions in the hippocampus. These findings have suggested a possible implication of CA1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress. =PTSD= Some studies shows correlation of reduced hippocampus volume and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). It is also the case that non- combat twin brothers of Vietnam veterans with PTSD also had smaller hippocampi than other controls, raising questions about the nature of the correlation. A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus increases the likelihood of efficacious treatment. Other animals Image 11: Drawing by Italian pathologist Camillo Golgi of a hippocampus stained using the silver nitrate method =Other mammals= The hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across the range of mammals, from monotremes such as the echidna to primates such as humans.West, 1990 The hippocampal-size-to-body-size ratio broadly increases, being about twice as large for primates as for the echidna. It does not, however, increase at anywhere close to the rate of the neocortex- to-body-size ratio. Therefore, the hippocampus takes up a much larger fraction of the cortical mantle in rodents than in primates. In adult humans the volume of the hippocampus on each side of the brain is about 3.0 to 3.5 cm3 as compared to 320 to 420 cm3 for the volume of the neocortex.Suzuki et al, 2005 There is also a general relationship between the size of the hippocampus and spatial memory. When comparisons are made between similar species, those that have a greater capacity for spatial memory tend to have larger hippocampal volumes.Jacobs, 2003 This relationship also extends to sex differences; in species where males and females show strong differences in spatial memory ability they also tend to show corresponding differences in hippocampal volume.Jacobs et al., 1990 =Other vertebrates= Non-mammalian species do not have a brain structure that looks like the mammalian hippocampus, but they have one that is considered homologous to it. The hippocampus, as pointed out above, is in essence part of the allocortex. Only mammals have a fully developed cortex, but the structure it evolved from, called the pallium, is present in all vertebrates, even the most primitive ones such as the lamprey or hagfish.Aboitiz et al., 2003 The pallium is usually divided into three zones: medial, lateral and dorsal. The medial pallium forms the precursor of the hippocampus. It does not resemble the hippocampus visually because the layers are not warped into an S shape or enfolded by the dentate gyrus, but the homology is indicated by strong chemical and functional affinities. There is now evidence that these hippocampal-like structures are involved in spatial cognition in birds, reptiles, and fish.Rodr√≠guez et al., 2002 Birds In birds, the correspondence is sufficiently well established that most anatomists refer to the medial pallial zone as the \\"avian hippocampus\\".Colombo and Broadbent, 2000 Numerous species of birds have strong spatial skills, in particular those that cache food. There is evidence that food-caching birds have a larger hippocampus than other types of birds and that damage to the hippocampus causes impairments in spatial memory.Shettleworth, 2003 Fish The story for fish is more complex. In teleost fish (which make up the great majority of existing species), the forebrain is distorted in comparison to other types of vertebrates: most neuroanatomists believe that the teleost forebrain is in essence everted, like a sock turned inside-out, so that structures that lie in the interior, next to the ventricles, for most vertebrates, are found on the outside in teleost fish, and vice versa.Nieuwenhuys, 1982 One of the consequences of this is that the medial pallium (\\"hippocampal\\" zone) of a typical vertebrate is thought to correspond to the lateral pallium of a typical fish. Several types of fish (particularly goldfish) have been shown experimentally to have strong spatial memory abilities, even forming \\"cognitive maps\\" of the areas they inhabit. There is evidence that damage to the lateral pallium impairs spatial memory.Portavella et al., 2002Vargas et al., 2006 It is not yet known whether the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more primitive vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish.Docampo-Seara2018 =Insects and molluscs= Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet no good reason to think that they have a common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a \\"hippocampus\\" to be identified in these species. Some have proposed, however, that the insect's mushroom bodies may have a function similar to that of the hippocampus.Mizunami et al., 1998 Notes  References                                                   Further reading  *Hippocampus (Wiley)   External links   Diagram of a Hippocampal Brain Slice * Hippocampus ‚Äì Cell Centered Database * Temporal-lobe.com An interactive diagram of the rat parahippocampal-hippocampal region * Search Hippocampus on BrainNavigator via BrainNavigator Limbic system ","title":"Hippocampus"},{"id":"53949","text":"Black-and-white colobuses (or colobi) are Old World monkeys of the genus Colobus, native to Africa. They are closely related to the red colobus monkeys of genus Piliocolobus. There are five species of this monkey, and at least eight subspecies. They are generally found in high-density forests where they forage on leaves, flowers and fruit. Social groups of colobus are diverse, varying from group to group. Resident-egalitarian and allomothering relationships have been observed among the female population. Complex behaviours have also been observed in this species, including greeting rituals and varying group sleeping patterns. Colobi play a significant role in seed dispersal. Etymology The word \\"colobus\\" comes from Greek (kolob√≥s, \\"docked\\", \\"maimed\\"), so named because the thumb is stump-like. Habitat and food Colobuses habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands; they are found more in higher-density logged forests than in other primary forests. Their ruminant-like digestive systems have enabled them to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates: they are herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, lichen, herbaceous vegetation and bark. Leaf toughness influences colobus foraging efficiency. Tougher leaves correlate negatively with ingestion rate (g/min) as they are costly in terms of mastication, but positively with investment (chews/g). Individuals spend approximately 150 minutes actively feeding each day. In a montane habitat colobus are known to utilise lichen as a fallback food during periods of low food availability. Social patterns and morphology Colobuses live in territorial groups that vary in both size (3-15 individuals) and structure. It was originally believed that the structure of these groups consisted of one male and about 8 female members. However, more recent observations have shown variation in structure and the number of males within groups, with one species forming multi-male, multifemale groups in a multilevel society, and in some populations supergroups form exceeding 500 individuals. There appears to be a dominant male, whilst there is no clear dominance among female members. Relationships among females are considered to be resident-egalitarian, as there is low competition and aggression between them within their own groups. Juveniles are treated as a lower-rank (in regards to authority) than subadults and likewise when comparing subadults to adults. Colobuses do not display any type of seasonal breeding patterns. As suggested by their name, adult colobi have black fur with white features. White fur surrounds their facial region and a \\"U\\" shape of long white fur runs along the sides of their body. Newborn colobi are completely white with a pink face. Cases of allomothering are documented, which means members of the troop other than the infant's biological mother care for it. Possible explanations to this are, increasing inclusive fitness or maternal practice which will benefit future offspring.  Social behaviours  Angolan black-and-white colobus with infant. Many members participate in a greeting ritual when they are reunited with familiar individuals, an act of reaffirming. The greeting behaviour is generally carried out by the approaching monkey and often is followed with grooming. They participate in three greeting behaviours of physical contact. This includes mounting, head mounting (grasps the shoulders) and embracing. It seems as though these behaviours do not have any relationship with mating or courting.Adult Eastern black-and-white colobus with a juvenileBlack-and-white colobus have complex sleeping patterns. They sleep in trees near a food source, which may serve to save energy. Groups seem to regularly switch up sleeping locations (suggested due to reducing risk of parasites and placement prediction) and generally do not sleep near other groups. They also tend to sleep more tightly together on nights with great visibility. They sleep in mid- to upper sections of tall trees which allows for predator watch as well as protection from ground and aerial predators while they are asleep. Although there is no obvious preference for tree type, they have often been observed in Antiaris toxicaria.  Ecology  Colobuses are important for seed dispersal through their sloppy eating habits, as well as through their digestive systems. Predators and threat level They are prey for many forest predators, and are threatened by hunting for the bushmeat trade, logging, and habitat destruction. Individuals are more vigilant (conspecific threat) in low canopy, they also spend less time scanning when they are around familiar group members as opposed to unfamiliar. There are no clear difference in vigilance between male and females. However, there is a positive correlation between mean monthly vigilance and encounter rates. Male vigilance generally increases during mating.

He was Oscar Hammerstein II's mentor and believed that librettists should integrate songs into the plot. He is considered one of the first great lyricists, and helped raise the status of the lyricist in an age concerned more with music, costumes, and stars. Some of his more famous lyrics are for \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", \\"Indian Love Call\\" and \\"Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine\\". Early life and education Harbach was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Danish immigrant parents Adolph Christiansen and his wife Sena Olsen. His parents changed their name when they immigrated to the United States, and took the name of the farm they worked on (common practice at the time), and their new last name was Hauerbach. He attended the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute, transferring to Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois, where he was a friend of Carl Sandburg, joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and graduated in 1895. Knox has since named its 599-seat Harbach Theatre in his honor. He obtained his master's degree in English from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, and attended Columbia University in New York with the goal of becoming an English professor. In the early 1900s, complaining of eye difficulties making prolonged reading uncomfortable, he became a newspaper reporter. He also worked at various advertising agencies, at an insurance firm, as a copywriter in advertising, and later as a journalist. He would have to pull out of Columbia when he could not financially support himself. Early career (1902‚Äì1911) In 1902, he spotted an advertisement with a picture of Fay Templeton for a new Joe Weber and Lew Fields musical. He had not been interested in theatre but more in literary classics, but after seeing the show, realized he liked the lighthearted genre. In the same year, he met Karl Hoschna. They wrote a comic opera together, but no producer would pick it up, so they wrote songs to put in other Broadway shows. Isidore Witmark then contacted Hoschna, his employee, and told him he wanted to turn Mary Pacheco's play Incog into a musical. Hoschna then contacted Harbach, and so began the partnership. The result, with Whitmark and Charles Dickson writing the libretto, was Three Twins, which opened in 1908 and ran for 288 performances (Harbach was paid a hundred dollars for his work). The show starred Clifton Crawford. Their next collaboration was Madame Sherry in 1910, adapting a 1902 German operetta with Jack Gardner in the lead role. The show featured a song that was not theirs: the Albert von Tilzer and Junie McCree song \\"Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey\\" was put into the score because it was popular. They would collaborate for four more shows until Hoschna died in 1911, at the age of thirty-four. Career (1912‚Äì1924) After working with Hoschna, his works had given somewhat of a name for himself. Arthur Hammerstein asked Harbach in 1912 to write the lyrics to an operetta with Rudolf Friml, called The Firefly. Victor Herbert was originally supposed to write the music, but he refused to work with the star of the show, Emma Trentini, because in his last show, she had refused to sing a song for the encore, and Herbert walked out refusing to ever work with her again. Hammerstein could not find anyone as talented as Herbert, but settled on the unknown Friml because of his classical training. The result was a huge success, and it would spell eleven more musicals, including High Jinks (1913) (which featured the song \\"All Aboard Dixieland\\" by Jack Yellen and George L. Cobb) and Katinka (1915). Most of the shows they wrote together ran for over 200 performances. In 1914, he contributed the libretto only to the Percy Wenrich musical The Crinoline Girl. In 1917, he shortened his name from Hauerbach to Harbach to avoid anti-German sentiment caused by World War I. He would also work with composer Louis Hirsch during this time, and would score his biggest success so far in 1917 with Going Up. This was his first attempt at a musical comedy, as opposed to an American operetta. The show was based on the 1910 comedy by James Montgomery, who co- wrote the libretto with Harbach. The show ran for 351 performances, toured nationally, and was an even larger hit in London. Other works He collaborated as lyricist or librettist with Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, George Gershwin, and Sigmund Romberg.

It is aged between 60 days and 2 years. Manchego has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep's milk. The designation is protected under Spain's denominaci√≥n de origen regulatory classification system, and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. PDO requirements A must satisfy these requirements: * It must be produced within designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, and Toledo, all in the La Mancha region. * It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the Manchega breed raised on registered farms within that area. * It must be aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to ) and a maximum of two years. * It must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of and a maximum diameter of . Manchego cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled as (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme and salt. Manufacture and labeling The moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally, manchego cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind. Today, the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of a head of wheat. During the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO. Cheeses that meet the PDO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould, and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha. A cheese that is similar to manchego and made in the same region, but from a blend of cow's, goat's, and ewe's milk, is sold as or cheese. Varieties has variety of different flavours depending on its age: * ': fresh cheese is aged for 2 weeks. It has a rich but mild flavour; not a true due to its lack of ageing. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain. * ': semifirm, semicured cheese aged for 3 weeks to 3‚Äì4 months, somewhat milder than curado. * ': semifirm cured cheese aged for 3-6 months with a caramel and nutty flavour. * ': aged for 1-2 years, firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged; it has a rich, deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or on tapas.Spanish-Cheese.co.uk ‚Äì Types of Spanish Cheese (Queso) Americas =North America= In Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, or (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to an industrialized cow's milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack.

Some of his more famous lyrics include \\"Blue Moon\\", \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", \\"Manhattan\\", \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\", and \\"My Funny Valentine\\". Life and career Hart was born in Harlem, New York City, the elder of two sons, to Jewish immigrant parents, Max M. and Frieda (Isenberg) Hart, of German background. Through his mother, he was a great-grandnephew of the German poet Heinrich Heine.Politico.com. Retrieved November 19, 2017 His father, a business promoter, sent Hart and his brother to private schools. (His brother, Teddy Hart, also went into theatre and became a musical comedy star. Teddy Hart's wife, Dorothy Hart, wrote a biography of Lorenz Hart.) Hart received his early education from Columbia Grammar School and then attended Columbia University School of Journalism for two years.Hughson Mooney, \\"Lorenz Hart\\", PBS. Excerpted from the Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 3: 1941‚Äì1945. American Council of Learned Societies, 1973. Reprinted by permission of the American Council of Learned Societies; retrieved November 12, 2010.Biography\\" songwritershalloffame.org, retrieved November 12, 2010 In 1919 a friend introduced him to Richard Rodgers, and the two joined forces to write songs for a series of amateur and student productions. By 1918, Hart was working for the Shubert brothers, partners in theatre, translating German plays into English. In 1919, his and Rodgers' song \\"Any Old Place With You\\" was included in the Broadway musical comedy A Lonely Romeo. In 1920, six of their songs were used in the musical comedy Poor Little Ritz Girl, which also had music by Sigmund Romberg. They were hired to write the score for the 1925 Theatre Guild production The Garrick Gaieties, the success of which brought them acclaim. Rodgers and Hart subsequently wrote the music and lyrics for 26 Broadway musicals during a more-than-20-year partnership that ended shortly before Hart's early death. Their \\"big four\\" were Babes in Arms, The Boys From Syracuse, Pal Joey, and On Your Toes. The Rodgers and Hart songs have been described as intimate and destined for long lives outside the theater. Many of their songs are standard repertoire for singers and jazz instrumentalists. Notable singers who have performed and recorded their songs have included Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Blossom Dearie, and Carly Simon. Hart has been called \\"the expressive bard of the urban generation which matured during the interwar years\\". But the \\"encomiums suggest(ing) that Larry Hart was a poet\\"Marmorstein, Gary A Ship Without a Sail: the life of Lorenz Hart Simon & Schuster 2012. p. 14. caused his friend and fellow writer Henry Myers to state otherwise. \\"Larry in particular was primarily a showman. If you can manage to examine his songs technically, and for the moment elude their spell, you will see that they are all meant to be acted, that they are part of a play. Larry was a playwright.\\" Rodgers and Hart wrote music and lyrics for several films, including Love Me Tonight (1932), The Phantom President (1932), Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (1933), and Mississippi (1935). With their successes, during the Great Depression Hart was earning $60,000 annually, and he became a magnet for many people. He gave numerous large parties. Beginning in 1938, he traveled more often and suffered from his drinking.Nolan, Frederick, Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway, New York: Oxford University Press (1995), pp. 237‚Äì239; accessed December 2, 2010. Nevertheless, Rodgers and Hart continued working together through mid-1942, with their final new musical being 1942's By Jupiter. The New York Times reported on July 23, 1942: \\"The Theatre Guild announced yesterday that Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II will soon begin work on a musical version of Lynn Riggs's folk-play, 'Green Grow the Lilacs,' which the Guild produced for sixty-four performances at the Guild Theatre in 1931.\\" The musical opened March 31, 1943 as Oklahoma! but Hart had exited, leaving Rodgers and his new partner Hammerstein as the composer and lyricist. Hart, meanwhile, was much affected by his mother's death in late April 1943. Regrouping somewhat, Rodgers and Hart teamed a final time in the fall of 1943 for a revival of A Connecticut Yankee. Six new numbers, including \\"To Keep My Love Alive\\", were written for this reworked version of the play; it would prove to be Hart's last lyric. Hart had taken off the night of the opening and was gone for two days. He was found ill in a hotel room and taken to Doctors Hospital, Upper East Side, but died within a few days. After Hart's death, Rodgers continued his collaboration with Oscar Hammerstein II. Theirs was a long and successful collaboration, one which made them one of the most successful composing teams of the 20th century. Musical style According to Thomas Hischak, Hart \\"had a remarkable talent for polysyllabic and internal rhymes\\",Hischak, Thomas. The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia (2007). Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 109. . and his lyrics have often been praised for their wit and technical sophistication. According The New York Times music critic Stephen Holden, \\"Many of Hart's ballad lyrics conveyed a heart-stopping sadness that reflected his conviction that he was physically too unattractive to be lovable.\\"Holden, Stephen.\\"Television Review: Thou Rodgers, Thou Hart, So Fizzy, So Smart\\", The New York Times, January 6, 1999. Retrieved October 12, 2020/ Holden also noted that \\"In his lyrics, as in his life, Hart stands as a compellingly lonely figure. Although he wrote dozens of songs that are playful, funny and filled with clever wordplay, it is the rueful vulnerability beneath their surface that lends them a singular poignancy.\\"Holden, Stephen, \\"Pop View: Just a Sap For Sugar, Love And Sorrow\\", The New York Times, April 30, 1995. Personal life and death Hart lived with his widowed mother. He suffered from alcoholism, and would sometimes disappear for weeks at a time on alcoholic binges. Holden writes: Hart suffered from depression throughout his life. His erratic behavior was often the cause of friction between him and Rodgers and led to a breakup of their partnership in 1943 before his death. Rodgers then began collaborating with Oscar Hammerstein II. Devastated by the death of his mother seven months earlier, Hart died in New York City of pneumonia from exposure on November 22, 1943, after drinking heavily.Nolan, p. 2.

A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility,\\" but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh, vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. The Brothers Grimm defined legend as \\"folktale historically grounded\\".Norbert Krapf, Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the genre of legend from other narrative forms, such as fairy tale; he \\"reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded\\", according to Hans Sebald's review in German Studies Review 13.2 (May 1990), p 312. A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:Tangherlini, \\"'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization\\" Western Folklore 49.4 (October 1990:371‚Äì390) p. 385. > Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly > ecotypifiedThat is to say, specifically located in place and time. > historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a > psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective > experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the > group to whose tradition it belongs. Etymology and origin Holger Danske, a legendary character Legend is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage circa 1340. The Old French noun legende derives from the Medieval Latin legenda.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"legend\\" In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word legendary was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends. This word changed to legendry, and legendary became the adjectival form. By 1613, English-speaking Protestants began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments) was fictitious. Thus, legend gained its modern connotations of \\"undocumented\\" and \\"spurious\\", which distinguish it from the meaning of chronicle.Patrick Collinson. Elizabethans, \\"Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs\\" 2003:151‚Äì77, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's Acts and Monuments, itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history, 1985, examines the \\"Renaissance verdict\\" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic hagiography in general. In 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as \\"poetic, legend historic.\\"Das M√§rchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer, quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371) Early scholars such as Wehrhan Die Sage (Leipzig) 1908.

Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the Aarne‚ÄìThompson folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis. Lapu-Lapu, a historical figure in early 16th century Philippines, has been associated with numerous legends since around the 17th century. Among these include his relationship with ally Datu Mangal and the forces of nature which backed Lapu-Lapu in the historical Battle of Mactan.\\"Lapu-Lapu in Folk Tradition\\" by Resil B.

Folklore in the Modern World, (The Hague: Mouton)1978, in The Journal of American Folklore 93 No. 369 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1980:367), remarked on Ranke's definition, criticised in the essay, as a \\"dead issue\\". A more recent examination of the balance between oral performance and literal truth at work in legends forms Gillian Bennett's chapter \\"Legend: Performance and Truth\\" in Gillian Bennett and Paul Smith, eds. Contemporary Legend (Garland) 1996:17‚Äì40. Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928.de Boor, \\"M√§rchenforschung\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Deutschkunde 42 1928:563‚Äì81. The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of folktale;Lutz R√∂hrich, M√§rchen und Wirklichkeit: Eine volkskundliche Untersuchung (Wiesbaden: Steiner Verlag) 1956:9‚Äì26. Wilhelm HeiskeHeiske, \\"Das M√§rchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer: Versuch einer Kritik\\", Deutschunterricht14 1962:69‚Äì75.. remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic mode, legend is not more historical than folktale. In Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft (1928), Ernst Bernheim asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour.Bernheim, Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft(Berlin: de Gruyter) 1928. Gordon Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;Allport, The Psychology of Rumor (New York: Holt, Rinehart) 1947:164. thus \\"Urban legends\\" are a feature of rumour.Bengt af Klintberg, \\"Folks√§gner i dag\\" Fataburen 1976:269‚Äì96. When Willian Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were \\"short-term legends\\" and the persistent ones be termed \\"long-term legends\\", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.Jansen, \\"Legend: oral tradition in the modern experience\\", Folklore Today, A Festschrift for William Dorson (Bloomington: Indiana University Press) 1972:265‚Äì72, noted in Tangherlini 1990:375. Christian legenda In the narrow Christian sense, legenda (\\"things to be read [on a certain day, in church]\\") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, legend, in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains supernatural, divine or fantastic elements.Literary or Profane Legends. Catholic Encyclopedia Related concepts Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the streets of Messina, Italy, the second week of August, according to a legend are founders of the Sicilian city. The mediaeval legend of Genevieve of Brabant connected her to Treves. Hippolyte Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: \\"The legend, on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\\"Hippolyte Delehaye, The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography (1907), Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with \\"Gothic\\" overtones, which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend. Stories that exceed the boundaries of \\"realism\\" are called \\"fables\\". For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable. Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to- person, or, in the original sense, through written text. Jacob de Voragine's Legenda Aurea or \\"The Golden Legend\\" comprises a series of vitae or instructive biographical narratives, tied to the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of hagiography. The Legenda was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the saint of the day.Timothy R. Tangherlini, \\"'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization\\" Western Folklore 49.4 (October 1990:371‚Äì390). A condensed survey with extensive bibliography. Urban legend The tale of the White Lady who haunts Union Cemetery is a variant of the Vanishing hitchhiker legend. Bahay na Pula in the Philippines is believed to be haunted by all those who were murdered and raped by the Japanese army within the property during World War II. Urban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local popular culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for seemingly-mysterious events, such as disappearances and strange objects. The term \\"urban legend,\\" as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for \\"urban legend,\\" citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, Our Living Traditions, xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B. Edgerton, The Ghost in Search of Help for a Dying Man, Journal of the Folklore Institute, Vol. 5, No. 1. pp. 31, 38, 41 (1968). Jan Harold Brunvand, professor of English at the University of Utah, introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings (1981) to make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

He collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on a series of Broadway musicals, including My Fair Lady and Camelot, both of which were made into films. Biography Loewe was born in Berlin, Germany, to Viennese parents Edmund and Rosa Loewe. His father was a noted Jewish operetta star who performed throughout Europe and in North and South America; he starred as Count Danilo in the 1906 Berlin production of The Merry Widow. Loewe grew up in Berlin and attended a Prussian cadet school from the age of five until he was thirteen. At an early age Loewe learned to play piano by ear and helped his father rehearse, and he began composing songs at age seven. He eventually attended a music conservatory in Berlin, one year behind virtuoso Claudio Arrau, and studied with Ferruccio Busoni and Eugene d'Albert. He won the coveted Hollander Medal awarded by the school and gave performances as a concert pianist while still in Germany. At 13, he was the youngest piano soloist ever to appear with the Berlin Philharmonic. In 1924, his father received an offer to appear in New York City, and Loewe traveled there with him, determined to write for Broadway. This proved to be difficult, and he took other odd jobs, including cattle punching, gold mining and prize fighting.Green, Benny. \\"Frederick Loewe, a prince of musical comedy\\", The Guardian, February 16, 1988, p. 33 He eventually found work playing piano in German clubs in Yorkville and in movie theaters as the accompanist for silent films.

Early years Hart was born in New York City, the son of Lillian (Solomon) and Barnett Hart, a cigar maker.1910 United States Federal Census1920 United States Federal Census He had a younger brother, Bernard.1930 United States Federal Census He grew up in relative poverty with his English-born Jewish immigrant parents in the Bronx and in Sea Gate, Brooklyn.Moss Hart profile: the early years He was the great-grandson of the Jewish bare-knuckle pugilist Barney Aaron. Early on he had a strong relationship with his Aunt Kate, with whom he later lost contact due to a falling out between her and his parents, and Kate's weakening mental state. She piqued his interest in the theater and took him to see performances often. Hart even went so far as to create an \\"alternate ending\\" to her life in his book Act One. He writes that she died while he was working on out-of-town tryouts for The Beloved Bandit. Later, Kate became eccentric and then disturbed, vandalizing Hart's home, writing threatening letters and setting fires backstage during rehearsals for Jubilee. But his relationship with her was formative. He learned that the theater made possible \\"the art of being somebody else ‚Ä¶ not a scrawny boy with bad teeth, a funny name ‚Ä¶ and a mother who was a distant drudge.\\" Career George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in 1937 After working several years as a director of amateur theatrical groups and an entertainment director at summer resorts, he scored his first Broadway hit with Once in a Lifetime (1930), a farce about the arrival of the sound era in Hollywood. The play was written in collaboration with Broadway veteran George S. Kaufman, who regularly wrote with others, notably Marc Connelly and Edna Ferber. (Kaufman also performed in the play's original Broadway cast in the role of a frustrated playwright hired by Hollywood.) During the next decade, Kaufman and Hart teamed on a string of successes, including You Can't Take It with You (1936) and The Man Who Came to Dinner (1939). Though Kaufman had hits with others, Hart is generally conceded to be his most important collaborator. You Can't Take It With You, the story of an eccentric family and how they live during the Depression, won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for drama. It is Hart's most-revived play. When director Frank Capra and writer Robert Riskin adapted it for the screen in 1938, the film won the Best Picture Oscar and Capra won for Best Director. The Man Who Came To Dinner is about the caustic Sheridan Whiteside who, after injuring himself slipping on ice, must stay in a Midwestern family's house. The character was based on Kaufman and Hart's friend, critic Alexander Woollcott. Other characters in the play are based on No√´l Coward, Harpo Marx and Gertrude Lawrence. Throughout the 1930s, Hart worked both with and without Kaufman on several musicals and revues, including Face the Music (1932); As Thousands Cheer (1933), with songs by Irving Berlin; Jubilee (musical) (1935), with songs by Cole Porter; and I'd Rather Be Right (1937), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. (Lorenz Hart and Moss Hart were not related.) After George Washington Slept Here (1940), Kaufman and Hart called it quits. Hart continued to write plays after parting with Kaufman, such as Christopher Blake (1946) and Light Up the Sky (1948), as well as the book for the musical Lady In The Dark (1941), with songs by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin. However, he became best known during this period as a director. Among the Broadway hits he staged were Junior Miss (1941), Dear Ruth (1944) and Anniversary Waltz (1954). By far his biggest hit was the musical My Fair Lady (1956), adapted from George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The show ran over six years and won a Tony Award for Best Musical. Hart picked up the Tony for Best Director. Hart was the host of an early television game show, Answer Yes or No, in 1950. Arlene Francis was one of the panelists. Hart also wrote some screenplays, including Gentleman's Agreement (1947) ‚Äì for which he received an Oscar nomination ‚Äì Hans Christian Andersen (1952) and A Star Is Born (1954). He wrote a memoir, Act One: An Autobiography by Moss Hart, which was released in 1959. It was adapted to film in 1963, with George Hamilton portraying Hart. The last show Hart directed was the Lerner and Loewe musical Camelot (1960). During a troubled out-of-town tryout, Hart had a heart attack. The show opened before he fully recovered, but he and Lerner reworked it after the opening. That, along with huge pre-sales and a cast performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, helped ensure the expensive production was a hit. Guild presidency Hart was the tenth president of the Dramatists Guild of America, from 1947 until 1956, when Oscar Hammerstein II became his successor. Personal life Hart married Kitty Carlisle on August 10, 1946; they had two children. Death Moss Hart died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on December 20, 1961, at his winter home in Palm Springs, California.

Legacy In 1972, 11 years after his death, Moss Hart was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, one of 23 people to be selected into the Hall of Fame's first induction class that year. Alan Jay Lerner paid tribute to Hart in his memoir, The Street Where I Live. =Moss Hart Awards= The New England Theatre Conference offers the Moss Hart Memorial Award at their annual convention to theater groups in New England which put forth imaginative productions of exemplary scripts.

The GTC New Play Initiative is the brainchild of producers Charles Johanson and Kevin Cochran (founders of Grove Theater Center) and its expansion to a truly bi-coastal program with the focus on the author and their vision for their work. The Hart NPI is under the leadership of Moss Hart's son Christopher Hart (artistic director), Kevin Cochran (producing artistic director) and Charles Johanson (executive director). In the first Hart NPI play cycle (2017-2018) there were 1,243 submissions from 44 states and 6 countries!. The Hart NPI will select 16-21 semifinalists, which will then be narrowed down to eight finalists and the eight will be narrowed down to the winners: Four Bronze Hart NPI winners will have a reading of their play at 59E59 Theaters, two Silver Hart NPI winners will have a production of their play in Los Angeles (Burbank), CA at the GTC Burbank and the Gold Hart NPI winner will have an Off-Broadway premiere at 59E59 Theaters.

Euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. 92% of the human genome is euchromatic. Structure Heterochromatin vs. euchromatin The structure of euchromatin is reminiscent of an unfolded set of beads along a string, wherein those beads represent nucleosomes. Nucleosomes consist of eight proteins known as histones, with approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wound around them; in euchromatin, this wrapping is loose so that the raw DNA may be accessed. Each core histone possesses a 'tail' structure, which can vary in several ways; it is thought that these variations act as \\"master control switches\\", which determine the overall arrangement of the chromatin. In particular, it is believed that the presence of methylated lysine 4 on the histone tails acts as a general marker. Appearance In general, euchromatin appears as light-colored bands when stained in G banding and observed under an optical microscope, in contrast to heterochromatin, which stains darkly. This lighter staining is due to the less compact structure of euchromatin. The basic structure of euchromatin is an elongated, open, 10 nm microfibril, as noted by electron microscopy. In prokaryotes, euchromatin is the only form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size. Function Euchromatin participates in the active transcription of DNA to mRNA products. The unfolded structure allows gene regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase complexes to bind to the DNA sequence, which can then initiate the transcription process. Not all euchromatin is necessarily transcribed, but in general that which is not is transformed into heterochromatin to protect the genes while they are not in use. There is therefore a direct link to how actively productive a cell is and the amount of euchromatin that can be found in its nucleus. It is thought that the cell uses transformation from euchromatin into heterochromatin as a method of controlling gene expression and replication, since such processes behave differently on densely compacted chromatin, known as the 'accessibility hypothesis'. One example of constitutive euchromatin that is 'always turned on' is housekeeping genes, which code for the proteins needed for basic functions of cell survival. References External links *Research news in Euchromatin  Article * Molecular genetics Nuclear organization sv:Eukromatin ","title":"Euchromatin"},{"id":"53983","text":"Heterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA or condensed DNA, which comes in multiple varieties. These varieties lie on a continuum between the two extremes of constitutive heterochromatin and facultative heterochromatin. Both play a role in the expression of genes. Because it is tightly packed, it was thought to be inaccessible to polymerases and therefore not transcribed, however according to Volpe et al. (2002), and many other papers since, much of this DNA is in fact transcribed, but it is continuously turned over via RNA- induced transcriptional silencing (RITS). Recent studies with electron microscopy and OsO4 staining reveal that the dense packing is not due to the chromatin. Constitutive heterochromatin can affect the genes near itself (e.g. position-effect variegation). It is usually repetitive and forms structural functions such as centromeres or telomeres, in addition to acting as an attractor for other gene-expression or repression signals. Facultative heterochromatin is the result of genes that are silenced through a mechanism such as histone deacetylation or Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) through RNAi. It is not repetitive and shares the compact structure of constitutive heterochromatin. However, under specific developmental or environmental signaling cues, it can lose its condensed structure and become transcriptionally active. Heterochromatin has been associated with the di- and tri-methylation of H3K9 in certain portions of the genome. H3K9me3-related methyltransferases appear to have a pivotal role in modifying heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and in maintaining lineage fidelity. The nucleus of a human cell showing the location of heterochromatin Note that the informal diagram shown here may be in error as to the location of heterochromatin. An inactivated X-chromosome (a.k.a. Barr body) migrates to the nuclear membrane alone, leaving the active X and other chromosomes within the nucleoplasm (away from the membrane in general). Other heterochromatin appear as particles separate from the membrane, \\"Heterochromatin appears as small, darkly staining, irregular particles scattered throughout the nucleus ...\\".Shown here: Electron microscope image of nucleus with heterochromatin particles annotated  Structure  Heterochromatin vs. euchromatin Chromatin is found in two varieties: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Originally, the two forms were distinguished cytologically by how intensely they get stained ‚Äì the euchromatin is less intense, while heterochromatin stains intensely, indicating tighter packing. Heterochromatin is usually localized to the periphery of the nucleus. Despite this early dichotomy, recent evidence in both animals and plants has suggested that there are more than two distinct heterochromatin states, and it may in fact exist in four or five 'states', each marked by different combinations of epigenetic marks. Heterochromatin mainly consists of genetically inactive satellite sequences, and many genes are repressed to various extents, although some cannot be expressed in euchromatin at all. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic, as is the Barr body of the second, inactivated X-chromosome in a female.  Function  General model for duplication of heterochromatin during cell division Heterochromatin has been associated with several functions, from gene regulation to the protection of chromosome integrity; some of these roles can be attributed to the dense packing of DNA, which makes it less accessible to protein factors that usually bind DNA or its associated factors. For example, naked double-stranded DNA ends would usually be interpreted by the cell as damaged or viral DNA, triggering cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or destruction of the fragment, such as by endonucleases in bacteria. Some regions of chromatin are very densely packed with fibers that display a condition comparable to that of the chromosome at mitosis. Heterochromatin is generally clonally inherited; when a cell divides, the two daughter cells typically contain heterochromatin within the same regions of DNA, resulting in epigenetic inheritance. Variations cause heterochromatin to encroach on adjacent genes or recede from genes at the extremes of domains. Transcribable material may be repressed by being positioned (in cis) at these boundary domains. This gives rise to expression levels that vary from cell to cell, which may be demonstrated by position-effect variegation. Insulator sequences may act as a barrier in rare cases where constitutive heterochromatin and highly active genes are juxtaposed (e.g. the 5'HS4 insulator upstream of the chicken Œ≤-globin locus, and loci in two Saccharomyces spp. ). Constitutive heterochromatin All cells of a given species, package the same regions of DNA in constitutive heterochromatin, and thus in all cells, any genes contained within the constitutive heterochromatin will be poorly expressed. For example, all human chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and the Y-chromosome contain large regions of constitutive heterochromatin. In most organisms, constitutive heterochromatin occurs around the chromosome centromere and near telomeres. Facultative heterochromatin The regions of DNA packaged in facultative heterochromatin will not be consistent between the cell types within a species, and thus a sequence in one cell that is packaged in facultative heterochromatin (and the genes within are poorly expressed) may be packaged in euchromatin in another cell (and the genes within are no longer silenced). However, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is regulated, and is often associated with morphogenesis or differentiation. An example of facultative heterochromatin is X chromosome inactivation in female mammals: one X chromosome is packaged as facultative heterochromatin and silenced, while the other X chromosome is packaged as euchromatin and expressed. Among the molecular components that appear to regulate the spreading of heterochromatin are the Polycomb-group proteins and non-coding genes such as Xist. The mechanism for such spreading is still a matter of controversy. The polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 regulate chromatin compaction and gene expression and have a fundamental role in developmental processes. PRC- mediated epigenetic aberrations are linked to genome instability and malignancy and play a role in the DNA damage response, DNA repair and in the fidelity of replication. Yeast heterochromatin Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast, is a model eukaryote and its heterochromatin has been defined thoroughly. Although most of its genome can be characterized as euchromatin, S. cerevisiae has regions of DNA that are transcribed very poorly. These loci are the so-called silent mating type loci (HML and HMR), the rDNA (encoding ribosomal RNA), and the sub-telomeric regions. Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) uses another mechanism for heterochromatin formation at its centromeres. Gene silencing at this location depends on components of the RNAi pathway. Double-stranded RNA is believed to result in silencing of the region through a series of steps. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two RNAi complexes, the RITS complex and the RNA- directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), are part of an RNAi machinery involved in the initiation, propagation and maintenance of heterochromatin assembly. These two complexes localize in a siRNA-dependent manner on chromosomes, at the site of heterochromatin assembly. RNA polymerase II synthesizes a transcript that serves as a platform to recruit RITS, RDRC and possibly other complexes required for heterochromatin assembly. Both RNAi and an exosome- dependent RNA degradation process contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing. These mechanisms of Schizosaccharomyces pombe may occur in other eukaryotes. A large RNA structure called RevCen has also been implicated in the production of siRNAs to mediate heterochromatin formation in some fission yeast.

A fallacious argument may be deceptive by appearing to be better than it really is. Some fallacies are committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception, while others are committed unintentionally due to carelessness or ignorance. The soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which the arguments are made. Fallacies are commonly divided into \\"formal\\" and \\"informal\\". A formal fallacy can be expressed neatly in a standard system of logic, such as propositional logic, while an informal fallacy originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form. Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally valid, but still fallacious. A special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof, often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. Overview Fallacies are defects that weaken arguments. Fallacious arguments are very common and can be persuasive in common use. They may be even \\"unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts\\". Informal fallacies in particular are found frequently in mass media such as television and newspapers. It is important to understand what fallacies are so that one can recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies will strengthen one's ability to produce strong arguments. It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of soundness and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones. \\"Fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments.\\" Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in rhetorical patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the emotional, intellectual, or psychological weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true. Argumentation theory provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In this approach, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals that attempts to resolve their disagreements. The protocol is regulated by certain rules of interaction, so violations of these rules are fallacies. Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the mass media today include but are not limited to propaganda, advertisements, politics, newspaper editorials and opinion-based ‚Äúnews‚Äù shows. Systems of classification Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption. On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications; compare equivocation which is a word or phrase based ambiguity, e. g. \\"he is mad\\", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the fallacy of composition which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. \\"this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player\\". Even the definitions of the classes may not be unique. For example, Whately treats material fallacies as a complement to logical fallacies, which makes them synonymous to informal fallacies, while others consider them to be a subclass of informal fallacies, like mentioned above. =Aristotle= Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 ‚Äì 322 BC) was the first to systematize logical errors into a list, as being able to refute an opponent's thesis is one way of winning an argument. Aristotle's \\"Sophistical Refutations\\" (De Sophisticis Elenchis) identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types, linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some which depend on language and others that do not. These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies respectively. A material fallacy is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a verbal fallacy is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words. An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who in humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant. A language-independent fallacy is for example: # \\"Coriscus is different from Socrates.\\" # \\"Socrates is a man.\\" # \\"Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man.\\" =Whately's grouping= English scholar and theologian Richard Whately (1787 ‚Äì 1863) defines a fallacy broadly as, \\"any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not\\". Whately divided fallacies into two groups: logical and material. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion does follow from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's sophisms except:ignoratio elenchi, petitio principii, and non causa pro causa, which are in the material group. =Other systems of classification= Of other classifications of fallacies in general the most famous are those of Francis Bacon and J. S. Mill. Bacon (Novum Organum, Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. With these should be compared the Offendicula of Roger Bacon, contained in the Opus maius, pt. i. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book v. of his Logic, and Jeremy Bentham's Book of Fallacies (1824) contains valuable remarks. See Rd. Whateley's Logic, bk. v.; A. de Morgan, Formal Logic (1847); A. Sidgwick, Fallacies (1883) and other textbooks. Formal fallacy A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or non sequitur (Latin for \\"it does not follow\\") is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument which renders the argument invalid. The flaw can neatly be expressed in standard system of logic. Such an argument is always considered to be wrong. The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion. Both may actually be true, or may even be more probable as a result of the argument; but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described. By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one: for instance, an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality can be said to commit a formal fallacy. \\"Since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments.\\" A logical form such as \\"A and B\\" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a statement to be true. The term logical fallacy is in a sense self-contradictory, because logic refers to valid reasoning, whereas a fallacy is the use of poor reasoning. Therefore, the term formal fallacy is preferred. In informal discourse, however, logical fallacy is used to mean an argument which is problematic for any reason. The term non sequitur denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one which does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies like affirming the consequent. =Common examples=  Ecological fallacy  An ecological fallacy is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, \\"if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide.\\" =Fallacy fork= Maarten Boudry and others have argued that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and/or inductive. Boudry coined the term fallacy fork. For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation scheme, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork) or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork). To argue, for example, that one became nauseated after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy unless one were actually arguing inductively and probabilistically that it is likely that the mushroom caused the illness since some mushrooms are poisonous, it is possible to misidentify a mushroom as edible, one doesn't usually feel nauseated, etc. Informal fallacy In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates in a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument. A deductive argument containing an informal fallacy may be formally valid, but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments. Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are the \\"types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the content of the propositions constituting the argument\\". p.125 = Faulty generalization = A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of faulty generalizations, also known as inductive fallacies. Here the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, statistical inference). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of empirical evidence, however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).  Hasty generalization  Hasty generalization is described as making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a sample that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small). Stereotypes about people (\\"frat boys are drunkards\\", \\"grad students are nerdy\\", \\"women don‚Äôt enjoy sports\\", etc.) are common examples of the principle. Hasty generalization often follows a pattern such as: :X is true for A. :X is true for B. :Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc. While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one. = Relevance fallacy = The fallacies of relevance are a broad class of informal fallacies, generically represented by missing the point: presenting an argument, which may be sound, but fails to address the issue in question.  Argument from silence  An argument from silence is a faulty conclusion that is made based on the absence of evidence rather than on the presence of evidence. = Examples of informal fallacies =  Post hoc (false cause)  This fallacy gets its name from the Latin phrase \\"post hoc, ergo propter hoc\\", which translates as \\"after this, therefore because of this\\". Definition: Assuming that because B comes after A, A caused B. Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later‚Äîfor example, if one registers for a class, and their name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time are not really related as cause and event. That is, temporal correlation does not necessarily entail causation. For example, if I ate a sandwich and then I got food poisoning, that does not necessarily mean the sandwich gave me food poisoning. It is possible that I could have eaten something else earlier that caused the food poisoning.  Slippery slope  Definition: The arguer claims that a sort of chain reaction, usually ending in some dire consequence, will take place, but in fact there is not enough evidence for that assumption. The arguer asserts that if we take even one step onto the \\"slippery slope\\", we will end up sliding all the way to the bottom; they assume we cannot stop halfway down the hill.  False analogy  This error in reasoning occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons, Hence the false analogy's informal nickname: the \\"apples and oranges\\" fallacy. Measurement fallacy Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement. Where mathematical fallacies are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist Protagoras was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his \\"human-measure\\" principle and the practice of dissoi logoi (arguing multiple sides of an issue). This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by informal logic and argumentation theory. =Knowledge value measurement fallacy= The increasing availability and circulation of big data are driving a proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority, and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an \\"information tsunami\\". For example, anchoring fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge is flawed. For example, limitations of the journal impact factor (JIF) are well documented, and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes, \\"while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative-and qualitative- indicators.\\" To the extent that arguers jettison acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments, or leave behind Garfield's \\"supplement rather than replace\\" caveat, they court commission of anchoring fallacies. A naturalistic fallacy can occur for example in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise \\"more is better\\" or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, \\"higher is better\\". A false analogy occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work). Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds. As another example, consider the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index of Academic Analytics. This tool purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet it does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool commit argument from silence fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data. Ecological fallacies can be committed when one measures scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. \\"Puerto Rican\\" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g. \\"Hispanic\\" faculty). Intentional fallacy Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or for comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true. Examples of this include the speaker or writer: # Diverting the argument to unrelated issues with a red herring (Ignoratio elenchi) # Insulting someone's character (argumentum ad hominem) # Assume the conclusion of an argument, a kind of circular reasoning, also called \\"begging the question\\" (petitio principii) # Making jumps in logic (non sequitur) # Identifying a false cause and effect (post hoc ergo propter hoc) # Asserting that everyone agrees (argumentum ad populum, bandwagoning) # Creating a \\"false dilemma\\" (\\"either-or fallacy\\") in which the situation is oversimplified # Selectively using facts (card stacking) # Making false or misleading comparisons (false equivalence and false analogy) # Generalizing quickly and sloppily (hasty generalization) In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of amphiboly, for instance, to make ironic statements; Gary Larson and Scott Adams employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies. When someone uses logical fallacies intentionally to mislead in academic, political, or other high- stakes contexts, the breach of trust calls into question the authority and intellectual integrity of that person.Habick, Timothy, and Linda Cook. (2018) AICPA Test Development Fairness Guidelines. Association of International Certified Public Accounts, Ewing, NJ. Assessment: pragmatic theory According to the pragmatic theory, a fallacy can in some instances be a careless error, the unintentional use of a heuristic (short version of an argumentation scheme) to jump to a conclusion. However, in other instances it is a tactic or ploy intentionally used inappropriately in argumentation to try to win an argument unfairly. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy‚Äîthe perpetrator and the intended victim. The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant, but also collective (shared) goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply violation of a rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation, based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contest. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation, but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labeled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence on the pragmatic approach, each case needs to analyzed individually, to determine by the textual evidence whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

Plants within the Cornales usually have four-parted flowers, drupaceous fruits, and inferior to half-inferior gynoecia topped with disc-shaped nectaries. Taxonomy  In the classification system of Dahlgren the Cornales were in the superorder Corniflorae (also called Cornanae). Under the APG IV system, the Cornales order includes these families: * Cornaceae (the dogwood family) * Curtisiaceae (cape lancewood) * Grubbiaceae (the sillyberry family) * Hydrangeaceae (the hydrangea family) * Hydrostachyaceae * Loasaceae (the stickleaf family) * Nyssaceae, (the tupelos) The oldest fossils assigned with confidence to the order are Hironoia fusiformis, described from Coniacian age Japanese coalified fruits, and Suciacarpa starrii described from American permineralized fruits of Campanian age. =Phylogeny= Based on Figure 11.10 in The Cornales order is sister to the remainder of the large and diverse asterid clade. The Cornales are highly geographically disjunct and morphologically diverse, which has led to considerable confusion regarding the proper circumscription of the groups within the order and the relationships between them.Xiang, Q. Y., Soltis, D. E., Morgan, D. R., and Soltis, P. S. (1993). Phylogenetic relationships of Cornus L sensu lato and putative relatives inferred from rbcL sequence data. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 80, 723-734. Under the Cronquist system, the order comprised the families Cornaceae, Nyssaceae, Garryaceae, and Alangiaceae, and was placed among the Rosidae, but this interpretation is no longer followed. Many families and genera previously associated with the Cornales have been removed, including Garryaceae, Griselinia, Corokia, and Kaliphora, among others. Molecular data suggest four clades are within the Cornales: Cornus-Alangium, nyssoids-mastixioids, Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae, and Grubbia-Curtisia, with the Hydrostachyaceae in an uncertain position, possibly basal.Fan, C. Z., and Xiang, Q. Y. (2003). Phylogenetic analyses of Cornales based on 26S rRNA and combined 26S rDNA- matK-rbcL sequence data. American Journal of Botany 90, 1357-1372. However, the relationship between these clades is unclear, and as a result of many historical taxonomic interpretations and differing opinions regarding the significance of morphological variations, rankings of taxa within the order are inconsistent.Eyde, R. H. (1988). Comprehending Cornus - puzzles and progress in the systematics of the dogwoods. Botanical Review 54, 233-351. These difficulties in interpreting the systematics of Cornales may represent an early and rapid diversification of the groups within the order.

Two functors that stand in this relationship are known as adjoint functors, one being the left adjoint and the other the right adjoint. Pairs of adjoint functors are ubiquitous in mathematics and often arise from constructions of \\"optimal solutions\\" to certain problems (i.e., constructions of objects having a certain universal property), such as the construction of a free group on a set in algebra, or the construction of the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification of a topological space in topology. By definition, an adjunction between categories C and D is a pair of functors (assumed to be covariant) :F: \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{C} and G: \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{D} and, for all objects X in C and Y in D a bijection between the respective morphism sets :\\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}}(FY,X) \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal{D}}(Y,GX) such that this family of bijections is natural in X and Y. Naturality here means that there are natural isomorphisms between the pair of functors \\\\mathcal{C}(F-,X) : \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Set} and \\\\mathcal{D}(-,GX) : \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Set} for a fixed X in C, and also the pair of functors \\\\mathcal{C}(FY,-) : \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Set} and \\\\mathcal{D}(Y,G-) : \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Set} for a fixed Y in D. The functor F is called a left adjoint functor or left adjoint to G , while G is called a right adjoint functor or right adjoint to F . An adjunction between categories C and D is somewhat akin to a \\"weak form\\" of an equivalence between C and D, and indeed every equivalence is an adjunction. In many situations, an adjunction can be \\"upgraded\\" to an equivalence, by a suitable natural modification of the involved categories and functors.  Terminology and notation  Two different roots are being used: \\"adjunct\\" and \\"adjoint\\". From Oxford shorter English dictionary, \\"adjunct\\" is from Latin, \\"adjoint\\" is from French. In Mac Lane, Categories for the working mathematician, chap. 4, \\"Adjoints\\", one can verify the following usage. Given a family \\\\varphi_{XY}: \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}}(FY,X) \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal{D}}(Y,GX) of hom-set bijections, we call \\\\varphi an \\"adjunction\\" or an \\"adjunction between F and G \\". If f is an arrow in \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}}(FY,X) , \\\\varphi f is the right \\"adjunct\\" of f (p. 81). The functor F is left \\"adjoint\\" to G, and G is right adjoint to F. (Note that G may have itself a right adjoint that is quite different from F; see below for an example.) In general, the phrases \\" F is a left adjoint\\" and \\" F has a right adjoint\\" are equivalent. If F is left adjoint to G, we also write :F\\\\dashv G. The terminology comes from the Hilbert space idea of adjoint operators T, U with \\\\langle Ty,x\\\\rangle = \\\\langle y,Ux\\\\rangle, which is formally similar to the above relation between hom-sets. The analogy to adjoint maps of Hilbert spaces can be made precise in certain contexts.  Introduction and Motivation  The long list of examples in this article indicates that common mathematical constructions are very often adjoint functors. Consequently, general theorems about left/right adjoint functors encode the details of many useful and otherwise non-trivial results. Such general theorems include the equivalence of the various definitions of adjoint functors, the uniqueness of a right adjoint for a given left adjoint, the fact that left/right adjoint functors respectively preserve colimits/limits (which are also found in every area of mathematics), and the general adjoint functor theorems giving conditions under which a given functor is a left/right adjoint. = Solutions to optimization problems = In a sense, an adjoint functor is a way of giving the most efficient solution to some problem via a method which is formulaic. For example, an elementary problem in ring theory is how to turn a rng (which is like a ring that might not have a multiplicative identity) into a ring. The most efficient way is to adjoin an element '1' to the rng, adjoin all (and only) the elements which are necessary for satisfying the ring axioms (e.g. r+1 for each r in the ring), and impose no relations in the newly formed ring that are not forced by axioms. Moreover, this construction is formulaic in the sense that it works in essentially the same way for any rng. This is rather vague, though suggestive, and can be made precise in the language of category theory: a construction is most efficient if it satisfies a universal property, and is formulaic if it defines a functor. Universal properties come in two types: initial properties and terminal properties. Since these are dual notions, it is only necessary to discuss one of them. The idea of using an initial property is to set up the problem in terms of some auxiliary category E, so that the problem at hand corresponds to finding an initial object of E. This has an advantage that the optimization‚Äîthe sense that the process finds the most efficient solution‚Äîmeans something rigorous and is recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. The category E is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint. Back to our example: take the given rng R, and make a category E whose objects are rng homomorphisms R ‚Üí S, with S a ring having a multiplicative identity. The morphisms in E between R ‚Üí S1 and R ‚Üí S2 are commutative triangles of the form (R ‚Üí S1, R ‚Üí S2, S1 ‚Üí S2) where S1 ‚Üí S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). (Note that this is precisely the definition of the comma category of R over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng.) The existence of a morphism between R ‚Üí S1 and R ‚Üí S2 implies that S1 is at least as efficient a solution as S2 to our problem: S2 can have more adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than S1. Therefore, the assertion that an object R ‚Üí R* is initial in E, that is, that there is a morphism from it to any other element of E, means that the ring R* is a most efficient solution to our problem. The two facts that this method of turning rngs into rings is most efficient and formulaic can be expressed simultaneously by saying that it defines an adjoint functor. More explicitly: Let F denote the above process of adjoining an identity to a rng, so F(R)=R*. Let G denote the process of ‚Äúforgetting‚Ä≥ whether a ring S has an identity and considering it simply as a rng, so essentially G(S)=S. Then F is the left adjoint functor of G. Note however that we haven't actually constructed R* yet; it is an important and not altogether trivial algebraic fact that such a left adjoint functor R ‚Üí R* actually exists. =Symmetry of optimization problems= It is also possible to start with the functor F, and pose the following (vague) question: is there a problem to which F is the most efficient solution? The notion that F is the most efficient solution to the problem posed by G is, in a certain rigorous sense, equivalent to the notion that G poses the most difficult problem that F solves. This gives the intuition behind the fact that adjoint functors occur in pairs: if F is left adjoint to G, then G is right adjoint to F. Formal definitions There are various equivalent definitions for adjoint functors: * The definitions via universal morphisms are easy to state, and require minimal verifications when constructing an adjoint functor or proving two functors are adjoint. They are also the most analogous to our intuition involving optimizations. * The definition via hom-sets makes symmetry the most apparent, and is the reason for using the word adjoint. * The definition via counit‚Äìunit adjunction is convenient for proofs about functors which are known to be adjoint, because they provide formulas that can be directly manipulated. The equivalency of these definitions is quite useful. Adjoint functors arise everywhere, in all areas of mathematics. Since the structure in any of these definitions gives rise to the structures in the others, switching between them makes implicit use of a great deal of tedious details that would otherwise have to be repeated separately in every subject area. =Conventions= The theory of adjoints has the terms left and right at its foundation, and there are many components which live in one of two categories C and D which are under consideration. Therefore it can be helpful to choose letters in alphabetical order according to whether they live in the \\"lefthand\\" category C or the \\"righthand\\" category D, and also to write them down in this order whenever possible. In this article for example, the letters X, F, f, Œµ will consistently denote things which live in the category C, the letters Y, G, g, Œ∑ will consistently denote things which live in the category D, and whenever possible such things will be referred to in order from left to right (a functor F : D ‚Üí C can be thought of as \\"living\\" where its outputs are, in C). =Definition via universal morphisms= By definition, a functor F: D \\\\to C is a left adjoint functor if for each object X in C there exists a universal morphism from F to X. Spelled out, this means that for each object X in C there exists an object G(X) in D and a morphism \\\\epsilon_X: F(G(X)) \\\\to X such that for every object Y in D and every morphism f: F(Y) \\\\to X there exists a unique morphism g: Y \\\\to G(X) with \\\\epsilon_X \\\\circ F(g) = f. The latter equation is expressed by the following commutative diagram: Here the counit is a universal morphism. In this situation, one can show that G can be turned into a functor G : C \\\\to D in a unique way such that \\\\epsilon_X \\\\circ F(G(f)) = f \\\\circ \\\\epsilon_{X'} for all morphisms f: X' \\\\to X in C; F is then called a left adjoint to G. Similarly, we may define right-adjoint functors. A functor G: C \\\\to D is a right adjoint functor if for each object Y in D, there exists a universal morphism from Y to G. Spelled out, this means that for each object Y in D, there exists an object F(Y) in C and a morphism \\\\eta_Y: Y \\\\to G(F(Y)) such that for every object X in C and every morphism g: Y \\\\to G(X) there exists a unique morphism f: F(Y) \\\\to X with G(f) \\\\circ \\\\eta_Y = g. The existence of the unit, a universal morphism, can prove the existence of an adjunction. Again, this F can be uniquely turned into a functor F: D \\\\to C such that G(F(g)) \\\\circ \\\\eta_Y = \\\\eta_{Y'} \\\\circ g for g: Y \\\\to Y' a morphism in D; G is then called a right adjoint to F. It is true, as the terminology implies, that F is left adjoint to G if and only if G is right adjoint to F. These definitions via universal morphisms are often useful for establishing that a given functor is left or right adjoint, because they are minimalistic in their requirements. They are also intuitively meaningful in that finding a universal morphism is like solving an optimization problem. =Definition via Hom-set adjunction= A hom-set adjunction between two categories C and D consists of two functors F : D ‚Üí C and and a natural isomorphism :\\\\Phi:\\\\mathrm{hom}_C(F-,-) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{hom}_D(-,G-). This specifies a family of bijections :\\\\Phi_{Y,X}:\\\\mathrm{hom}_C(FY,X) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{hom}_D(Y,GX) for all objects X in C and Y in D. In this situation, F is left adjoint to G and G is right adjoint to F . This definition is a logical compromise in that it is somewhat more difficult to satisfy than the universal morphism definitions, and has fewer immediate implications than the counit‚Äìunit definition. It is useful because of its obvious symmetry, and as a stepping-stone between the other definitions. In order to interpret Œ¶ as a natural isomorphism, one must recognize and as functors. In fact, they are both bifunctors from to Set (the category of sets). For details, see the article on hom functors. Explicitly, the naturality of Œ¶ means that for all morphisms in C and all morphisms in D the following diagram commutes: 400px The vertical arrows in this diagram are those induced by composition. Formally, Hom(Fg, f) : HomC(FY, X) ‚Üí HomC(FY‚Ä≤, X‚Ä≤) is given by h ‚Üí f o h o Fg for each h in HomC(FY, X). Hom(g, Gf) is similar. =Definition via counit‚Äìunit adjunction= A counit‚Äìunit adjunction between two categories C and D consists of two functors F : D ‚Üí C and G : C ‚Üí D and two natural transformations :\\\\begin{align} \\\\varepsilon &: FG \\\\to 1_{\\\\mathcal C} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta &: 1_{\\\\mathcal D} \\\\to GF\\\\end{align} respectively called the counit and the unit of the adjunction (terminology from universal algebra), such that the compositions :F\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;F\\\\eta\\\\;}FGF\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\varepsilon F\\\\,}F :G\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\eta G\\\\;}GFG\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;G \\\\varepsilon\\\\,}G are the identity transformations 1F and 1G on F and G respectively. In this situation we say that F is left adjoint to G and G is right adjoint to F , and may indicate this relationship by writing (\\\\varepsilon,\\\\eta):F\\\\dashv G , or simply F\\\\dashv G . In equation form, the above conditions on (Œµ,Œ∑) are the counit‚Äìunit equations :\\\\begin{align} 1_F &= \\\\varepsilon F\\\\circ F\\\\eta\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1_G &= G\\\\varepsilon \\\\circ \\\\eta G \\\\end{align} which mean that for each X in C and each Y in D, :\\\\begin{align} 1_{FY} &= \\\\varepsilon_{FY}\\\\circ F(\\\\eta_Y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1_{GX} &= G(\\\\varepsilon_X)\\\\circ\\\\eta_{GX} \\\\end{align}. Note that 1_{\\\\mathcal C} denotes the identify functor on the category \\\\mathcal C, 1_F denotes the identity natural transformation from the functor F to itself, and 1_{FY} denotes the identity morphism of the object FY. These equations are useful in reducing proofs about adjoint functors to algebraic manipulations. They are sometimes called the triangle identities, or sometimes the zig-zag equations because of the appearance of the corresponding string diagrams. A way to remember them is to first write down the nonsensical equation 1=\\\\varepsilon\\\\circ\\\\eta and then fill in either F or G in one of the two simple ways which make the compositions defined. Note: The use of the prefix \\"co\\" in counit here is not consistent with the terminology of limits and colimits, because a colimit satisfies an initial property whereas the counit morphisms will satisfy terminal properties, and dually. The term unit here is borrowed from the theory of monads where it looks like the insertion of the identity 1 into a monoid. History The idea of adjoint functors was introduced by Daniel Kan in 1958. Like many of the concepts in category theory, it was suggested by the needs of homological algebra, which was at the time devoted to computations. Those faced with giving tidy, systematic presentations of the subject would have noticed relations such as :hom(F(X), Y) = hom(X, G(Y)) in the category of abelian groups, where F was the functor  \\\\otimes A (i.e. take the tensor product with A), and G was the functor hom(A,‚Äì) (this is now known as the tensor-hom adjunction). The use of the equals sign is an abuse of notation; those two groups are not really identical but there is a way of identifying them that is natural. It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that these are two alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from X √ó A to Y. That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the 'naturality' of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism. =Ubiquity= If one starts looking for these adjoint pairs of functors, they turn out to be very common in abstract algebra, and elsewhere as well. The example section below provides evidence of this; furthermore, universal constructions, which may be more familiar to some, give rise to numerous adjoint pairs of functors. In accordance with the thinking of Saunders Mac Lane, any idea, such as adjoint functors, that occurs widely enough in mathematics should be studied for its own sake. Concepts can be judged according to their use in solving problems, as well as for their use in building theories. The tension between these two motivations was especially great during the 1950s when category theory was initially developed. Enter Alexander Grothendieck, who used category theory to take compass bearings in other work‚Äîin functional analysis, homological algebra and finally algebraic geometry. It is probably wrong to say that he promoted the adjoint functor concept in isolation: but recognition of the role of adjunction was inherent in Grothendieck's approach. For example, one of his major achievements was the formulation of Serre duality in relative form‚Äîloosely, in a continuous family of algebraic varieties. The entire proof turned on the existence of a right adjoint to a certain functor. This is something undeniably abstract, and non- constructive, but also powerful in its own way. Examples  =Free groups= The construction of free groups is a common and illuminating example. Let F : Set ‚Üí Grp be the functor assigning to each set Y the free group generated by the elements of Y, and let G : Grp ‚Üí Set be the forgetful functor, which assigns to each group X its underlying set. Then F is left adjoint to G: Initial morphisms. For each set Y, the set GFY is just the underlying set of the free group FY generated by Y. Let \\\\eta_Y:Y\\\\to GFY be the set map given by \\"inclusion of generators\\". This is an initial morphism from Y to G, because any set map from Y to the underlying set GW of some group W will factor through \\\\eta_Y:Y\\\\to GFY via a unique group homomorphism from FY to W. This is precisely the universal property of the free group on Y. Terminal morphisms. For each group X, the group FGX is the free group generated freely by GX, the elements of X. Let \\\\varepsilon_X:FGX\\\\to X be the group homomorphism which sends the generators of FGX to the elements of X they correspond to, which exists by the universal property of free groups. Then each (GX,\\\\varepsilon_X) is a terminal morphism from F to X, because any group homomorphism from a free group FZ to X will factor through \\\\varepsilon_X:FGX\\\\to X via a unique set map from Z to GX. This means that (F,G) is an adjoint pair. Hom-set adjunction. Group homomorphisms from the free group FY to a group X correspond precisely to maps from the set Y to the set GX: each homomorphism from FY to X is fully determined by its action on generators, another restatement of the universal property of free groups. One can verify directly that this correspondence is a natural transformation, which means it is a hom-set adjunction for the pair (F,G). counit‚Äìunit adjunction. One can also verify directly that Œµ and Œ∑ are natural. Then, a direct verification that they form a counit‚Äìunit adjunction (\\\\varepsilon,\\\\eta):F\\\\dashv G is as follows: The first counit‚Äìunit equation 1_F = \\\\varepsilon F\\\\circ F\\\\eta says that for each set Y the composition :FY\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;F(\\\\eta_Y)\\\\;}FGFY\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\varepsilon_{FY}\\\\,}FY should be the identity. The intermediate group FGFY is the free group generated freely by the words of the free group FY. (Think of these words as placed in parentheses to indicate that they are independent generators.) The arrow F(\\\\eta_Y) is the group homomorphism from FY into FGFY sending each generator y of FY to the corresponding word of length one (y) as a generator of FGFY. The arrow \\\\varepsilon_{FY} is the group homomorphism from FGFY to FY sending each generator to the word of FY it corresponds to (so this map is \\"dropping parentheses\\"). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on FY. The second counit‚Äìunit equation 1_G = G\\\\varepsilon \\\\circ \\\\eta G says that for each group X the composition : GX\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\eta_{GX}\\\\;}GFGX\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;G(\\\\varepsilon_X)\\\\,}GX should be the identity. The intermediate set GFGX is just the underlying set of FGX. The arrow \\\\eta_{GX} is the \\"inclusion of generators\\" set map from the set GX to the set GFGX. The arrow G(\\\\varepsilon_X) is the set map from GFGX to GX which underlies the group homomorphism sending each generator of FGX to the element of X it corresponds to (\\"dropping parentheses\\"). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on GX. =Free constructions and forgetful functors= Free objects are all examples of a left adjoint to a forgetful functor which assigns to an algebraic object its underlying set. These algebraic free functors have generally the same description as in the detailed description of the free group situation above. =Diagonal functors and limits= Products, fibred products, equalizers, and kernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a limit. Any limit functor is right adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of limits in question), and the counit of the adjunction provides the defining maps from the limit object (i.e. from the diagonal functor on the limit, in the functor category). Below are some specific examples. * Products Let Œ† : Grp2 ‚Üí Grp the functor which assigns to each pair (X1, X2) the product group X1√óX2, and let Œî : Grp ‚Üí Grp2 be the diagonal functor which assigns to every group X the pair (X, X) in the product category Grp2. The universal property of the product group shows that Œ† is right-adjoint to Œî. The counit of this adjunction is the defining pair of projection maps from X1√óX2 to X1 and X2 which define the limit, and the unit is the diagonal inclusion of a group X into X√óX (mapping x to (x,x)). : The cartesian product of sets, the product of rings, the product of topological spaces etc. follow the same pattern; it can also be extended in a straightforward manner to more than just two factors. More generally, any type of limit is right adjoint to a diagonal functor. * Kernels. Consider the category D of homomorphisms of abelian groups. If f1 : A1 ‚Üí B1 and f2 : A2 ‚Üí B2 are two objects of D, then a morphism from f1 to f2 is a pair (gA, gB) of morphisms such that gBf1 = f2gA. Let G : D ‚Üí Ab be the functor which assigns to each homomorphism its kernel and let F : Ab ‚Üí D be the functor which maps the group A to the homomorphism A ‚Üí 0. Then G is right adjoint to F, which expresses the universal property of kernels. The counit of this adjunction is the defining embedding of a homomorphism's kernel into the homomorphism's domain, and the unit is the morphism identifying a group A with the kernel of the homomorphism A ‚Üí 0. : A suitable variation of this example also shows that the kernel functors for vector spaces and for modules are right adjoints. Analogously, one can show that the cokernel functors for abelian groups, vector spaces and modules are left adjoints. =Colimits and diagonal functors= Coproducts, fibred coproducts, coequalizers, and cokernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a colimit. Any colimit functor is left adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of colimits in question), and the unit of the adjunction provides the defining maps into the colimit object. Below are some specific examples. * Coproducts. If F : Ab2 ‚Üí Ab assigns to every pair (X1, X2) of abelian groups their direct sum, and if G : Ab ‚Üí Ab2 is the functor which assigns to every abelian group Y the pair (Y, Y), then F is left adjoint to G, again a consequence of the universal property of direct sums. The unit of this adjoint pair is the defining pair of inclusion maps from X1 and X2 into the direct sum, and the counit is the additive map from the direct sum of (X,X) to back to X (sending an element (a,b) of the direct sum to the element a+b of X). : Analogous examples are given by the direct sum of vector spaces and modules, by the free product of groups and by the disjoint union of sets. =Further examples=  Algebra  * Adjoining an identity to a rng. This example was discussed in the motivation section above. Given a rng R, a multiplicative identity element can be added by taking RxZ and defining a Z-bilinear product with (r,0)(0,1) = (0,1)(r,0) = (r,0), (r,0)(s,0) = (rs,0), (0,1)(0,1) = (0,1). This constructs a left adjoint to the functor taking a ring to the underlying rng. * Adjoining an identity to a semigroup. Similarly, given a semigroup S, we can add an identity element and obtain a monoid by taking the disjoint union S \\\\sqcup {1} and defining a binary operation on it such that it extends the operation on S and 1 is an identity element. This construction gives a functor that is a left adjoint to the functor taking a monoid to the underlying semigroup. * Ring extensions. Suppose R and S are rings, and œÅ : R ‚Üí S is a ring homomorphism. Then S can be seen as a (left) R-module, and the tensor product with S yields a functor F : R-Mod ‚Üí S-Mod. Then F is left adjoint to the forgetful functor G : S-Mod ‚Üí R-Mod. * Tensor products. If R is a ring and M is a right R-module, then the tensor product with M yields a functor F : R-Mod ‚Üí Ab. The functor G : Ab ‚Üí R-Mod, defined by G(A) = homZ(M,A) for every abelian group A, is a right adjoint to F. * From monoids and groups to rings. The integral monoid ring construction gives a functor from monoids to rings. This functor is left adjoint to the functor that associates to a given ring its underlying multiplicative monoid. Similarly, the integral group ring construction yields a functor from groups to rings, left adjoint to the functor that assigns to a given ring its group of units. One can also start with a field K and consider the category of K-algebras instead of the category of rings, to get the monoid and group rings over K. * Field of fractions. Consider the category Domm of integral domains with injective morphisms. The forgetful functor Field ‚Üí Domm from fields has a left adjoint‚Äîit assigns to every integral domain its field of fractions. * Polynomial rings. Let Ring* be the category of pointed commutative rings with unity (pairs (A,a) where A is a ring, a ‚àà A and morphisms preserve the distinguished elements). The forgetful functor G:Ring* ‚Üí Ring has a left adjoint ‚Äì it assigns to every ring R the pair (R[x],x) where R[x] is the polynomial ring with coefficients from R. * Abelianization. Consider the inclusion functor G : Ab ‚Üí Grp from the category of abelian groups to category of groups. It has a left adjoint called abelianization which assigns to every group G the quotient group Gab=G/[G,G]. * The Grothendieck group. In K-theory, the point of departure is to observe that the category of vector bundles on a topological space has a commutative monoid structure under direct sum. One may make an abelian group out of this monoid, the Grothendieck group, by formally adding an additive inverse for each bundle (or equivalence class). Alternatively one can observe that the functor that for each group takes the underlying monoid (ignoring inverses) has a left adjoint. This is a once-for- all construction, in line with the third section discussion above. That is, one can imitate the construction of negative numbers; but there is the other option of an existence theorem. For the case of finitary algebraic structures, the existence by itself can be referred to universal algebra, or model theory; naturally there is also a proof adapted to category theory, too. * Frobenius reciprocity in the representation theory of groups: see induced representation. This example foreshadowed the general theory by about half a century. Topology * A functor with a left and a right adjoint. Let G be the functor from topological spaces to sets that associates to every topological space its underlying set (forgetting the topology, that is). G has a left adjoint F, creating the discrete space on a set Y, and a right adjoint H creating the trivial topology on Y. * Suspensions and loop spaces. Given topological spaces X and Y, the space [SX, Y] of homotopy classes of maps from the suspension SX of X to Y is naturally isomorphic to the space [X, Œ©Y] of homotopy classes of maps from X to the loop space Œ©Y of Y. The suspension functor is therefore left adjoint to the loop space functor in the homotopy category, an important fact in homotopy theory. * Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification. Let KHaus be the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and G : KHaus ‚Üí Top be the inclusion functor to the category of topological spaces. Then G has a left adjoint F : Top ‚Üí KHaus, the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification. The unit of this adjoint pair yields a continuous map from every topological space X into its Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification. * Direct and inverse images of sheaves. Every continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ‚àó from the category of sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f ‚àí1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f ‚àí1 is left adjoint to f ‚àó. Here a more subtle point is that the left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets). * Soberification. The article on Stone duality describes an adjunction between the category of topological spaces and the category of sober spaces that is known as soberification. Notably, the article also contains a detailed description of another adjunction that prepares the way for the famous duality of sober spaces and spatial locales, exploited in pointless topology. Posets Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a category (where the elements of the poset become the category's objects and we have a single morphism from x to y if and only if x ‚â§ y). A pair of adjoint functors between two partially ordered sets is called a Galois connection (or, if it is contravariant, an antitone Galois connection). See that article for a number of examples: the case of Galois theory of course is a leading one. Any Galois connection gives rise to closure operators and to inverse order-preserving bijections between the corresponding closed elements. As is the case for Galois groups, the real interest lies often in refining a correspondence to a duality (i.e. antitone order isomorphism). A treatment of Galois theory along these lines by Kaplansky was influential in the recognition of the general structure here. The partial order case collapses the adjunction definitions quite noticeably, but can provide several themes: * adjunctions may not be dualities or isomorphisms, but are candidates for upgrading to that status * closure operators may indicate the presence of adjunctions, as corresponding monads (cf. the Kuratowski closure axioms) * a very general comment of William LawvereLawvere, F. William, \\"Adjointness in foundations\\", Dialectica, 1969. The notation is different nowadays; an easier introduction by Peter Smith in these lecture notes, which also attribute the concept to the article cited. is that syntax and semantics are adjoint: take C to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations), and D the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory T in C, let G(T) be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms T; for a set of mathematical structures S, let F(S) be the minimal axiomatization of S. We can then say that S is a subset of G(T) if and only if F(S) logically implies T: the \\"semantics functor\\" G is right adjoint to the \\"syntax functor\\" F. * division is (in general) the attempt to invert multiplication, but in situations where this is not possible, we often attempt to construct an adjoint instead: the ideal quotient is adjoint to the multiplication by ring ideals, and the implication in propositional logic is adjoint to logical conjunction. Category theory * Equivalences. If F : D ‚Üí C is an equivalence of categories, then we have an inverse equivalence G : C ‚Üí D, and the two functors F and G form an adjoint pair. The unit and counit are natural isomorphisms in this case. * A series of adjunctions. The functor œÄ0 which assigns to a category its set of connected components is left-adjoint to the functor D which assigns to a set the discrete category on that set. Moreover, D is left-adjoint to the object functor U which assigns to each category its set of objects, and finally U is left-adjoint to A which assigns to each set the indiscrete category on that set. * Exponential object. In a cartesian closed category the endofunctor C ‚Üí C given by ‚Äì√óA has a right adjoint ‚ÄìA. This pair is often referred to as currying and uncurrying; in many special cases, they are also continuous and form a homeomorphism. Categorical logic * Quantification. If \\\\phi_Y is a unary predicate expressing some property, then a sufficiently strong set theory may prove the existence of the set Y=\\\\\\\\{y\\\\mid\\\\phi_Y(y)\\\\\\\\} of terms that fulfill the property. A proper subset T\\\\subset Y and the associated injection of T into Y is characterized by a predicate \\\\phi_T(y)=\\\\phi_Y(y)\\\\land\\\\varphi(y) expressing a strictly more restrictive property. :The role of quantifiers in predicate logics is in forming propositions and also in expressing sophisticated predicates by closing formulas with possibly more variables. For example, consider a predicate \\\\psi_f with two open variables of sort X and Y. Using a quantifier to close X, we can form the set ::\\\\\\\\{y\\\\in Y\\\\mid \\\\exists x.\\\\,\\\\psi_f(x,y)\\\\land\\\\phi_{S}(x)\\\\\\\\} :of all elements y of Y for which there is an x to which it is \\\\psi_f-related, and which itself is characterized by the property \\\\phi_{S}. Set theoretic operations like the intersection \\\\cap of two sets directly corresponds to the conjunction \\\\land of predicates. In categorical logic, a subfield of topos theory, quantifiers are identified with adjoints to the pullback functor. Such a realization can be seen in analogy to the discussion of propositional logic using set theory but the general definition make for a richer range of logics. :So consider an object Y in a category with pullbacks. Any morphism f:X\\\\to Y induces a functor ::f^{*} : \\\\text{Sub}(Y) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\text{Sub}(X) :on the category that is the preorder of subobjects. It maps subobjects T of Y (technically: monomorphism classes of T\\\\to Y) to the pullback X\\\\times_Y T. If this functor has a left- or right adjoint, they are called \\\\exists_f and \\\\forall_f, respectively.Mac Lane, Saunders; Moerdijk, Ieke (1992) Sheaves in Geometry and Logic, Springer- Verlag. See page 58 They both map from \\\\text{Sub}(X) back to \\\\text{Sub}(Y). Very roughly, given a domain S\\\\subset X to quantify a relation expressed via f over, the functor/quantifier closes X in X\\\\times_Y T and returns the thereby specified subset of Y. : Example: In \\\\operatorname{Set}, the category of sets and functions, the canonical subobjects are the subset (or rather their canonical injections). The pullback f^{*}T=X\\\\times_Y T of an injection of a subset T into Y along f is characterized as the largest set which knows all about f and the injection of T into Y. It therefore turns out to be (in bijection with) the inverse image f^{-1}[T]\\\\subseteq X. :For S \\\\subseteq X, let us figure out the left adjoint, which is defined via ::{\\\\operatorname{Hom}}(\\\\exists_f S,T) \\\\cong {\\\\operatorname{Hom}}(S,f^{*}T), :which here just means ::\\\\exists_f S\\\\subseteq T \\\\leftrightarrow S\\\\subseteq f^{-1}[T]. :Consider f[S] \\\\subseteq T . We see S\\\\subseteq f^{-1}[f[S \\\\subseteq f^{-1}[T]. Conversely, If for an x\\\\in S we also have x\\\\in f^{-1}[T], then clearly f(x)\\\\in T . So S \\\\subseteq f^{-1}[T] implies f[S] \\\\subseteq T . We conclude that left adjoint to the inverse image functor f^{*} is given by the direct image. Here is a characterization of this result, which matches more the logical interpretation: The image of S under \\\\exists_f is the full set of y's, such that f^{-1} [\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}] \\\\cap S is non-empty. This works because it neglects exactly those y\\\\in Y which are in the complement of f[S]. So :: \\\\exists_f S = \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in Y \\\\mid \\\\exists (x \\\\in f^{-1}[\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}]).\\\\, x \\\\in S \\\\; \\\\\\\\} = f[S]. :Put this in analogy to our motivation \\\\\\\\{y\\\\in Y\\\\mid\\\\exists x.\\\\,\\\\psi_f(x,y)\\\\land\\\\phi_{S}(x)\\\\\\\\}. :The right adjoint to the inverse image functor is given (without doing the computation here) by :: \\\\forall_f S = \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in Y \\\\mid \\\\forall (x \\\\in f^{-1} [\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}]).\\\\, x \\\\in S \\\\; \\\\\\\\}. : The subset \\\\forall_f S of Y is characterized as the full set of y's with the property that the inverse image of \\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} with respect to f is fully contained within S.

Adjunctions in full There are hence numerous functors and natural transformations associated with every adjunction, and only a small portion is sufficient to determine the rest. An adjunction between categories C and D consists of *A functor F : D ‚Üí C called the left adjoint *A functor G : C ‚Üí D called the right adjoint *A natural isomorphism Œ¶ : homC(F‚Äì,‚Äì) ‚Üí homD(‚Äì,G‚Äì) *A natural transformation Œµ : FG ‚Üí 1C called the counit *A natural transformation Œ∑ : 1D ‚Üí GF called the unit An equivalent formulation, where X denotes any object of C and Y denotes any object of D, is as follows: ::For every C-morphism f : FY ‚Üí X, there is a unique D-morphism Œ¶Y, X(f) = g : Y ‚Üí GX such that the diagrams below commute, and for every D-morphism g : Y ‚Üí GX, there is a unique C-morphism Œ¶‚àí1Y, X(g) = f : FY ‚Üí X in C such that the diagrams below commute: 350px From this assertion, one can recover that: *The transformations Œµ, Œ∑, and Œ¶ are related by the equations :\\\\begin{align} f = \\\\Phi_{Y,X}^{-1}(g) &= \\\\varepsilon_X\\\\circ F(g) & \\\\in & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\mathrm{hom}_C(F(Y),X)\\\\\\\\\\\\ g = \\\\Phi_{Y,X}(f) &= G(f)\\\\circ \\\\eta_Y & \\\\in & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\mathrm{hom}_D(Y,G(X))\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Phi_{GX,X}^{-1}(1_{GX}) &= \\\\varepsilon_X & \\\\in & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\mathrm{hom}_C(FG(X),X)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Phi_{Y,FY}(1_{FY}) &= \\\\eta_Y & \\\\in & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\mathrm{hom}_D(Y,GF(Y))\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} *The transformations Œµ, Œ∑ satisfy the counit‚Äìunit equations :\\\\begin{align} 1_{FY} &= \\\\varepsilon_{FY} \\\\circ F(\\\\eta_Y)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1_{GX} &= G(\\\\varepsilon_X) \\\\circ \\\\eta_{GX} \\\\end{align} *Each pair (GX, ŒµX) is a terminal morphism from F to X in C *Each pair (FY, Œ∑Y) is an initial morphism from Y to G in D In particular, the equations above allow one to define Œ¶, Œµ, and Œ∑ in terms of any one of the three. However, the adjoint functors F and G alone are in general not sufficient to determine the adjunction. The equivalence of these situations is demonstrated below. =Universal morphisms induce hom-set adjunction= Given a right adjoint functor G : C ‚Üí D; in the sense of initial morphisms, one may construct the induced hom-set adjunction by doing the following steps. * Construct a functor F : D ‚Üí C and a natural transformation Œ∑.  For each object Y in D, choose an initial morphism (F(Y), Œ∑Y) from Y to G, so that Œ∑Y : Y ‚Üí G(F(Y)). We have the map of F on objects and the family of morphisms Œ∑.  For each f : Y0 ‚Üí Y1, as (F(Y0), Œ∑Y0) is an initial morphism, then factorize Œ∑Y1 o f with Œ∑Y0 and get F(f) : F(Y0) ‚Üí F(Y1). This is the map of F on morphisms.  The commuting diagram of that factorization implies the commuting diagram of natural transformations, so Œ∑ : 1D ‚Üí G o F is a natural transformation.  Uniqueness of that factorization and that G is a functor implies that the map of F on morphisms preserves compositions and identities. * Construct a natural isomorphism Œ¶ : homC(F-,-) ‚Üí homD(-,G-).  For each object X in C, each object Y in D, as (F(Y), Œ∑Y) is an initial morphism, then Œ¶Y, X is a bijection, where Œ¶Y, X(f : F(Y) ‚Üí X) = G(f) o Œ∑Y.  Œ∑ is a natural transformation, G is a functor, then for any objects X0, X1 in C, any objects Y0, Y1 in D, any x : X0 ‚Üí X1, any y : Y1 ‚Üí Y0, we have Œ¶Y1, X1(x o f o F(y)) = G(x) o G(f) o G(F(y)) o Œ∑Y1 = G(x) o G(f) o Œ∑Y0 o y = G(x) o Œ¶Y0, X0(f) o y, and then Œ¶ is natural in both arguments. A similar argument allows one to construct a hom-set adjunction from the terminal morphisms to a left adjoint functor. (The construction that starts with a right adjoint is slightly more common, since the right adjoint in many adjoint pairs is a trivially defined inclusion or forgetful functor.) =counit‚Äìunit adjunction induces hom-set adjunction= Given functors F : D ‚Üí C, G : C ‚Üí D, and a counit‚Äìunit adjunction (Œµ, Œ∑) : F \\\\dashv G, we can construct a hom-set adjunction by finding the natural transformation Œ¶ : homC(F-,-) ‚Üí homD(-,G-) in the following steps: *For each f : FY ‚Üí X and each g : Y ‚Üí GX, define :\\\\begin{align}\\\\Phi_{Y,X}(f) = G(f)\\\\circ \\\\eta_Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Psi_{Y,X}(g) = \\\\varepsilon_X\\\\circ F(g)\\\\end{align} :The transformations Œ¶ and Œ® are natural because Œ∑ and Œµ are natural. *Using, in order, that F is a functor, that Œµ is natural, and the counit‚Äìunit equation 1FY = ŒµFY o F(Œ∑Y), we obtain :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Psi\\\\Phi f &= \\\\varepsilon_X\\\\circ FG(f)\\\\circ F(\\\\eta_Y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f\\\\circ \\\\varepsilon_{FY}\\\\circ F(\\\\eta_Y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f\\\\circ 1_{FY} = f\\\\end{align} :hence Œ®Œ¶ is the identity transformation. *Dually, using that G is a functor, that Œ∑ is natural, and the counit‚Äìunit equation 1GX = G(ŒµX) o Œ∑GX, we obtain :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi\\\\Psi g &= G(\\\\varepsilon_X)\\\\circ GF(g)\\\\circ\\\\eta_Y \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= G(\\\\varepsilon_X)\\\\circ\\\\eta_{GX}\\\\circ g \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1_{GX}\\\\circ g = g\\\\end{align} :hence Œ¶Œ® is the identity transformation. Thus Œ¶ is a natural isomorphism with inverse Œ¶‚àí1 = Œ®. =Hom-set adjunction induces all of the above= Given functors F : D ‚Üí C, G : C ‚Üí D, and a hom-set adjunction Œ¶ : homC(F-,-) ‚Üí homD(-,G-), one can construct a counit‚Äìunit adjunction :(\\\\varepsilon,\\\\eta):F\\\\dashv G , which defines families of initial and terminal morphisms, in the following steps: *Let \\\\varepsilon_X=\\\\Phi_{GX,X}^{-1}(1_{GX})\\\\in\\\\mathrm{hom}_C(FGX,X) for each X in C, where 1_{GX}\\\\in\\\\mathrm{hom}_D(GX,GX) is the identity morphism. *Let \\\\eta_Y=\\\\Phi_{Y,FY}(1_{FY})\\\\in\\\\mathrm{hom}_D(Y,GFY) for each Y in D, where 1_{FY}\\\\in\\\\mathrm{hom}_C(FY,FY) is the identity morphism. *The bijectivity and naturality of Œ¶ imply that each (GX, ŒµX) is a terminal morphism from F to X in C, and each (FY, Œ∑Y) is an initial morphism from Y to G in D. *The naturality of Œ¶ implies the naturality of Œµ and Œ∑, and the two formulas :\\\\begin{align}\\\\Phi_{Y,X}(f) = G(f)\\\\circ \\\\eta_Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Phi_{Y,X}^{-1}(g) = \\\\varepsilon_X\\\\circ F(g)\\\\end{align} :for each f: FY ‚Üí X and g: Y ‚Üí GX (which completely determine Œ¶). *Substituting FY for X and Œ∑Y = Œ¶Y, FY(1FY) for g in the second formula gives the first counit‚Äìunit equation :1_{FY} = \\\\varepsilon_{FY}\\\\circ F(\\\\eta_Y), :and substituting GX for Y and ŒµX = Œ¶‚àí1GX, X(1GX) for f in the first formula gives the second counit‚Äìunit equation :1_{GX} = G(\\\\varepsilon_X)\\\\circ\\\\eta_{GX}.  Properties  =Existence= Not every functor G : C ‚Üí D admits a left adjoint. If C is a complete category, then the functors with left adjoints can be characterized by the adjoint functor theorem of Peter J. Freyd: G has a left adjoint if and only if it is continuous and a certain smallness condition is satisfied: for every object Y of D there exists a family of morphisms :fi : Y ‚Üí G(Xi) where the indices i come from a set I, not a proper class, such that every morphism :h : Y ‚Üí G(X) can be written as :h = G(t) o fi for some i in I and some morphism :t : Xi ‚Üí X in C. An analogous statement characterizes those functors with a right adjoint. An important special case is that of locally presentable categories. If F : C \\\\to D is a functor between locally presentable categories, then * F has a right adjoint if and only if F preserves small colimits * F has a left adjoint if and only if F preserves small limits and is an accessible functor =Uniqueness= If the functor F : D ‚Üí C has two right adjoints G and G‚Ä≤, then G and G‚Ä≤ are naturally isomorphic. The same is true for left adjoints. Conversely, if F is left adjoint to G, and G is naturally isomorphic to G‚Ä≤ then F is also left adjoint to G‚Ä≤. More generally, if „ÄàF, G, Œµ, Œ∑„Äâ is an adjunction (with counit‚Äìunit (Œµ,Œ∑)) and :œÉ : F ‚Üí F‚Ä≤ :œÑ : G ‚Üí G‚Ä≤ are natural isomorphisms then „ÄàF‚Ä≤, G‚Ä≤, Œµ‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤„Äâ is an adjunction where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\eta' &= (\\\\tau\\\\ast\\\\sigma)\\\\circ\\\\eta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon' &= \\\\varepsilon\\\\circ(\\\\sigma^{-1}\\\\ast\\\\tau^{-1}). \\\\end{align} Here \\\\circ denotes vertical composition of natural transformations, and \\\\ast denotes horizontal composition. =Composition= Adjunctions can be composed in a natural fashion. Specifically, if „ÄàF, G, Œµ, Œ∑„Äâ is an adjunction between C and D and „ÄàF‚Ä≤, G‚Ä≤, Œµ‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤„Äâ is an adjunction between D and E then the functor :F \\\\circ F' : E \\\\rightarrow C is left adjoint to :G' \\\\circ G : C \\\\to E. More precisely, there is an adjunction between F F' and G' G with unit and counit given respectively by the compositions: :\\\\begin{align} &1_{\\\\mathcal E} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta'} G' F' \\\\xrightarrow{G' \\\\eta F'} G' G F F' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &F; F' G' G \\\\xrightarrow{F \\\\varepsilon' G} F G \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\varepsilon} 1_{\\\\mathcal C}. \\\\end{align} This new adjunction is called the composition of the two given adjunctions. Since there is also a natural way to define an identity adjunction between a category C and itself, one can then form a category whose objects are all small categories and whose morphisms are adjunctions. =Limit preservation= The most important property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor that has a left adjoint (and therefore is a right adjoint) is continuous (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right adjoint (and therefore is a left adjoint) is cocontinuous (i.e. commutes with colimits). Since many common constructions in mathematics are limits or colimits, this provides a wealth of information. For example: * applying a right adjoint functor to a product of objects yields the product of the images; * applying a left adjoint functor to a coproduct of objects yields the coproduct of the images; * every right adjoint functor between two abelian categories is left exact; * every left adjoint functor between two abelian categories is right exact. =Additivity= If C and D are preadditive categories and F : D ‚Üí C is an additive functor with a right adjoint G : C ‚Üí D, then G is also an additive functor and the hom-set bijections :\\\\Phi_{Y,X} : \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal C}(FY,X) \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{hom}_{\\\\mathcal D}(Y,GX) are, in fact, isomorphisms of abelian groups. Dually, if G is additive with a left adjoint F, then F is also additive. Moreover, if both C and D are additive categories (i.e. preadditive categories with all finite biproducts), then any pair of adjoint functors between them are automatically additive. Relationships =Universal constructions= As stated earlier, an adjunction between categories C and D gives rise to a family of universal morphisms, one for each object in C and one for each object in D. Conversely, if there exists a universal morphism to a functor G : C ‚Üí D from every object of D, then G has a left adjoint. However, universal constructions are more general than adjoint functors: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of D (equivalently, every object of C). =Equivalences of categories= If a functor F : D ‚Üí C is one half of an equivalence of categories then it is the left adjoint in an adjoint equivalence of categories, i.e. an adjunction whose unit and counit are isomorphisms. Every adjunction „ÄàF, G, Œµ, Œ∑„Äâ extends an equivalence of certain subcategories. Define C1 as the full subcategory of C consisting of those objects X of C for which ŒµX is an isomorphism, and define D1 as the full subcategory of D consisting of those objects Y of D for which Œ∑Y is an isomorphism. Then F and G can be restricted to D1 and C1 and yield inverse equivalences of these subcategories. In a sense, then, adjoints are \\"generalized\\" inverses. Note however that a right inverse of F (i.e. a functor G such that FG is naturally isomorphic to 1D) need not be a right (or left) adjoint of F. Adjoints generalize two-sided inverses. =Monads= Every adjunction „ÄàF, G, Œµ, Œ∑„Äâ gives rise to an associated monad „ÄàT, Œ∑, Œº„Äâ in the category D. The functor :T : \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D} is given by T = GF. The unit of the monad :\\\\eta : 1_{\\\\mathcal{D}} \\\\to T is just the unit Œ∑ of the adjunction and the multiplication transformation :\\\\mu : T^2 \\\\to T\\\\, is given by Œº = GŒµF. Dually, the triple „ÄàFG, Œµ, FŒ∑G„Äâ defines a comonad in C. Every monad arises from some adjunction‚Äîin fact, typically from many adjunctions‚Äîin the above fashion. Two constructions, called the category of Eilenberg‚ÄìMoore algebras and the Kleisli category are two extremal solutions to the problem of constructing an adjunction that gives rise to a given monad.

","title":"Adjoint functors"},{"id":"53993","text":"In mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Peter Ludwig Sylow (1872) that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given finite group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups. For a prime number p, a Sylow p-subgroup (sometimes p-Sylow subgroup) of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G, i.e., a subgroup of G that is a p-group (so that the order of every group element is a power of p) that is not a proper subgroup of any other p-subgroup of G. The set of all Sylow p-subgroups for a given prime p is sometimes written Sylp(G). The Sylow theorems assert a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group G the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of G divides the order of G. The Sylow theorems state that for every prime factor p of the order of a finite group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G of order pn, the highest power of p that divides the order of G. Moreover, every subgroup of order pn is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and the Sylow p-subgroups of a group (for a given prime p) are conjugate to each other. Furthermore, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group for a given prime p is congruent to  Theorems  Collections of subgroups that are each maximal in one sense or another are common in group theory. The surprising result here is that in the case of Sylp(G), all members are actually isomorphic to each other and have the largest possible order: if G= pnm with n > 0 where p does not divide m, then every Sylow p-subgroup P has order P= pn. That is, P is a p-group and gcd(G : P, p) = 1. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of G. The following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872, and published in Mathematische Annalen. Theorem 1: For every prime factor p with multiplicity n of the order of a finite group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, of order pn. The following weaker version of theorem 1 was first proved by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and is known as Cauchy's theorem. Corollary: Given a finite group G and a prime number p dividing the order of G, then there exists an element (and hence a subgroup) of order p in G.Fraleigh, Victor J. Katz. A First Course In Abstract Algebra. p. 322. Theorem 2: Given a finite group G and a prime number p, all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other, i.e. if H and K are Sylow p-subgroups of G, then there exists an element g in G with g‚àí1Hg = K. Theorem 3: Let p be a prime factor with multiplicity n of the order of a finite group G, so that the order of G can be written as , where and p does not divide m. Let np be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then the following hold: * np divides m, which is the index of the Sylow p-subgroup in G. * np ‚â° 1 (mod p). * np = G : NG(P), where P is any Sylow p-subgroup of G and NG denotes the normalizer. = Consequences = The Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number p every Sylow p-subgroup is of the same order, pn. Conversely, if a subgroup has order pn, then it is a Sylow p-subgroup, and so is isomorphic to every other Sylow p-subgroup. Due to the maximality condition, if H is any p-subgroup of G, then H is a subgroup of a p-subgroup of order pn. A very important consequence of Theorem 2 is that the condition np = 1 is equivalent to saying that the Sylow p-subgroup of G is a normal subgroup (there are groups that have normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as S4). = Sylow theorems for infinite groups = There is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups. We define a Sylow p-subgroup in an infinite group to be a p-subgroup (that is, every element in it has p-power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all p-subgroups in the group. Such subgroups exist by Zorn's lemma. Theorem: If K is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and np = Cl(K)is finite, then every Sylow p-subgroup is conjugate to K, and np ‚â° 1 (mod p), where Cl(K) denotes the conjugacy class of K.  Examples  In D6 all reflections are conjugate, as reflections correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups. A simple illustration of Sylow subgroups and the Sylow theorems are the dihedral group of the n-gon, D2n. For n odd, 2 = 21 is the highest power of 2 dividing the order, and thus subgroups of order 2 are Sylow subgroups. These are the groups generated by a reflection, of which there are n, and they are all conjugate under rotations; geometrically the axes of symmetry pass through a vertex and a side. In D12 reflections no longer correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups, and fall into two conjugacy classes. By contrast, if n is even, then 4 divides the order of the group, and the subgroups of order 2 are no longer Sylow subgroups, and in fact they fall into two conjugacy classes, geometrically according to whether they pass through two vertices or two faces. These are related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation through œÄ/n, half the minimal rotation in the dihedral group. Another example are the Sylow p-subgroups of GL2(Fq), where p and q are primes ‚â• 3 and p ‚â° 1 (mod q) , which are all abelian. The order of GL2(Fq) is (q2 ‚àí 1)(q2 ‚àí q) = (q)(q + 1)(q ‚àí 1)2. Since q = pnm + 1, the order of GL2(Fq) = p2n m‚Ä≤. Thus by Theorem 1, the order of the Sylow p-subgroups is p2n. One such subgroup P, is the set of diagonal matrices \\\\begin{bmatrix}x^{im} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & x^{jm} \\\\end{bmatrix}, x is any primitive root of Fq. Since the order of Fq is q ‚àí 1, its primitive roots have order q ‚àí 1, which implies that x(q ‚àí 1)/pn or xm and all its powers have an order which is a power of p. So, P is a subgroup where all its elements have orders which are powers of p. There are pn choices for both a and b, making P= p2n. This means P is a Sylow p-subgroup, which is abelian, as all diagonal matrices commute, and because Theorem 2 states that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other, the Sylow p-subgroups of GL2(Fq) are all abelian. Example applications Since Sylow's theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, it's worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylow's theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not simple. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a normal subgroup. ;Example-1: Groups of order pq, p and q primes with p < q. ;Example-2: Group of order 30, groups of order 20, groups of order p2q, p and q distinct primes are some of the applications. ;Example-3: (Groups of order 60): If the order G= 60 and G has more than one Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is simple. = Cyclic group orders = Some non-prime numbers n are such that every group of order n is cyclic. One can show that n = 15 is such a number using the Sylow theorems: Let G be a group of order 15 = 3 ¬∑ 5 and n3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. Then n3 \\\\mid 5 and n3 ‚â° 1 (mod 3). The only value satisfying these constraints is 1; therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 3, and it must be normal (since it has no distinct conjugates). Similarly, n5 must divide 3, and n5 must equal 1 (mod 5); thus it must also have a single normal subgroup of order 5. Since 3 and 5 are coprime, the intersection of these two subgroups is trivial, and so G must be the internal direct product of groups of order 3 and 5, that is the cyclic group of order 15. Thus, there is only one group of order 15 (up to isomorphism). = Small groups are not simple = A more complex example involves the order of the smallest simple group that is not cyclic. Burnside's pa qb theorem states that if the order of a group is the product of one or two prime powers, then it is solvable, and so the group is not simple, or is of prime order and is cyclic. This rules out every group up to order 30 . If G is simple, and G= 30, then n3 must divide 10 ( = 2 ¬∑ 5), and n3 must equal 1 (mod 3). Therefore, n3 = 10, since neither 4 nor 7 divides 10, and if n3 = 1 then, as above, G would have a normal subgroup of order 3, and could not be simple. G then has 10 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3, each of which has 2 elements of order 3 (plus the identity). This means G has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3. As well, n5 = 6, since n5 must divide 6 ( = 2 ¬∑ 3), and n5 must equal 1 (mod 5). So G also has 24 distinct elements of order 5. But the order of G is only 30, so a simple group of order 30 cannot exist. Next, suppose G= 42 = 2 ¬∑ 3 ¬∑ 7. Here n7 must divide 6 ( = 2 ¬∑ 3) and n7 must equal 1 (mod 7), so n7 = 1. So, as before, G can not be simple. On the other hand, for G= 60 = 22 ¬∑ 3 ¬∑ 5, then n3 = 10 and n5 = 6 is perfectly possible. And in fact, the smallest simple non-cyclic group is A5, the alternating group over 5 elements. It has order 60, and has 24 cyclic permutations of order 5, and 20 of order 3. = Wilson's theorem = Part of Wilson's theorem states that :(p-1)!\\\\ \\\\equiv\\\\ -1 \\\\pmod p for every prime p. One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow's third theorem. Indeed, observe that the number np of Sylow's p-subgroups in the symmetric group Sp is (p ‚àí 2)!. On the other hand, np ‚â° 1 (mod p). Hence, (p ‚àí 2)! ‚â° 1 (mod p). So, (p ‚àí 1)! ‚â° ‚àí1 (mod p). = Fusion results = Frattini's argument shows that a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group. A slight generalization known as Burnside's fusion theorem states that if G is a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P and two subsets A and B normalized by P, then A and B are G-conjugate if and only if they are NG(P)-conjugate. The proof is a simple application of Sylow's theorem: If B=Ag, then the normalizer of B contains not only P but also Pg (since Pg is contained in the normalizer of Ag). By Sylow's theorem P and Pg are conjugate not only in G, but in the normalizer of B. Hence gh‚àí1 normalizes P for some h that normalizes B, and then Agh‚àí1 = Bh‚àí1 = B, so that A and B are NG(P)-conjugate. Burnside's fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a semidirect product: if G is a finite group whose Sylow p-subgroup P is contained in the center of its normalizer, then G has a normal subgroup K of order coprime to P, G = PK and P‚à©K = {1}, that is, G is p-nilpotent. Less trivial applications of the Sylow theorems include the focal subgroup theorem, which studies the control a Sylow p-subgroup of the derived subgroup has on the structure of the entire group. This control is exploited at several stages of the classification of finite simple groups, and for instance defines the case divisions used in the Alperin‚ÄìBrauer‚ÄìGorenstein theorem classifying finite simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroup is a quasi- dihedral group. These rely on J. L. Alperin's strengthening of the conjugacy portion of Sylow's theorem to control what sorts of elements are used in the conjugation. Proof of the Sylow theorems The Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves is the subject of many papers including , , , , and to some extent . One proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of group action in various creative ways. The group G acts on itself or on the set of its p-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems. The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of . In the following, we use a \\\\mid b as notation for \\"a divides b\\" and a mid b for the negation of this statement. > Theorem 1: A finite group G whose order Gis divisible by a prime power pk > has a subgroup of order pk. Proof: Let G= pkm = pk+ru such that p mid u, and let Œ© denote the set of subsets of G of size pk. G acts on Œ© by left multiplication: g‚ãÖœâ = { gx x ‚àà œâ }. For a given set œâ ‚àà Œ©, write Gœâ for its stabilizer subgroup {g ‚àà G g‚ãÖœâ = œâ } and Gœâ for its orbit {g‚ãÖœâ g ‚àà G} in Œ©. The proof will show the existence of some œâ ‚àà Œ© for which Gœâ has pk elements, providing the desired subgroup. This is the maximal possible size of a stabilizer subgroup Gœâ, since for any fixed element Œ± ‚àà œâ ‚äÜ G, the image of Gœâ under the bijective map G ‚Üí G of right-multiplication by Œ± (g ‚Ü¶ gŒ±) is contained in œâ; therefore, Gœâ‚â§ œâ= pk. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem we have GœâGœâ= Gfor each œâ ‚àà Œ©, and therefore using the additive p-adic valuation ŒΩp, which counts the number of factors p, one has ŒΩp(Gœâ) + ŒΩp(Gœâ) = ŒΩp(G) = k + r. This means that for those œâ with Gœâ= pk, the ones we are looking for, one has ŒΩp(Gœâ) = r, while for any other œâ one has ŒΩp(Gœâ) > r (as 0 < Gœâ< pk implies ŒΩp(Gœâ) < k). Since Œ©is the sum of Gœâover all distinct orbits Gœâ, one can show the existence of œâ of the former type by showing that ŒΩp(Œ©) = r (if none existed, that valuation would exceed r). This is an instance of Kummer's theorem (since in base p notation the number Gends with precisely k + r digits zero, subtracting pk from it involves a carry in r places), and can also be shown by a simple computation: :\\\\Omega ={p^km \\\\choose p^k} = \\\\prod_{j=0}^{p^k - 1} \\\\frac{p^k m - j}{p^k - j} = m\\\\prod_{j=1}^{p^{k} - 1} \\\\frac{p^{k - u_p(j)} m - j/p^{ u_p(j)}}{p^{k - u_p(j)} - j/p^{ u_p(j)}} and no power of p remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right. Hence ŒΩp(Œ©) = ŒΩp(m) = r, completing the proof. It may be noted that conversely every subgroup H of order pk gives rise to sets œâ ‚àà Œ© for which Gœâ = H, namely any one of the m distinct cosets Hg. > Lemma: Let G be a finite p-group, let Œ© be a finite set, let Œ©G be the set > generated by the action of G on all the elements of Œ©, and let Œ©0 denote the > set of points of Œ©G that are fixed under the action of G. Then Œ©G‚â° Œ©0> (mod p). Proof: Write Œ©G as a disjoint sum of its orbits under G. Any element x ‚àà Œ©G not fixed by G will lie in an orbit of order G/Gx(where Gx denotes the stabilizer), which is a multiple of p by assumption. The result follows immediately. > Theorem 2: If H is a p-subgroup of G and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then > there exists an element g in G such that g‚àí1Hg ‚â§ P. In particular, all Sylow > p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other (and therefore isomorphic), > that is, if H and K are Sylow p-subgroups of G, then there exists an element > g in G with g‚àí1Hg = K. Proof: Let Œ© be the set of left cosets of P in G and let H act on Œ© by left multiplication. Applying the Lemma to H on Œ©, we see that Œ©0‚â° Œ©= [G : P] (mod p). Now p mid [G : P] by definition so p mid Œ©0, hence in particular Œ©0‚â† 0 so there exists some gP ‚àà Œ©0. It follows that for some g ‚àà G and ‚àÄ h ‚àà H we have hgP = gP so g‚àí1HgP = P and therefore g‚àí1Hg ‚â§ P. Now if H is a Sylow p-subgroup, H= P= gPg‚àí1so that H = gPg‚àí1 for some g ‚àà G. > Theorem 3: Let q denote the order of any Sylow p-subgroup P of a finite > group G. Let np denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then np = G : > NG(P), np \\\\mid G/q and np ‚â° 1 (mod p), where NG(P) is the normalizer of P Proof: Let Œ© be the set of all Sylow p-subgroups of G and let G act on Œ© by conjugation. Let P ‚àà Œ© be a Sylow p-subgroup. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, np = [G : StabG(P)]. StabG(P) = { g ‚àà G gPg‚àí1 = P } = NG (P), the normalizer of P in G. Thus, np = G : NG(P), and it follows that this number is a divisor of G/[G : P]. Now let P act on Œ© by conjugation. Let Q ‚àà Œ©0 and observe that then Q = xQx‚àí1 for all x ‚àà P so that P ‚â§ NG(Q). By Theorem 2, P and Q are conjugate in NG(Q) in particular, and Q is normal in NG(Q), so then P = Q. It follows that Œ©0 = {P} so that, by the Lemma, Œ©‚â° Œ©0= 1 (mod p).  Algorithms  The problem of finding a Sylow subgroup of a given group is an important problem in computational group theory. One proof of the existence of Sylow p-subgroups is constructive: if H is a p-subgroup of G and the index [G:H] is divisible by p, then the normalizer N = NG(H) of H in G is also such that [N : H] is divisible by p. In other words, a polycyclic generating system of a Sylow p-subgroup can be found by starting from any p-subgroup H (including the identity) and taking elements of p-power order contained in the normalizer of H but not in H itself. The algorithmic version of this (and many improvements) is described in textbook form in , including the algorithm described in . These versions are still used in the GAP computer algebra system. In permutation groups, it has been proven in (; ) that a Sylow p-subgroup and its normalizer can be found in polynomial time of the input (the degree of the group times the number of generators). These algorithms are described in textbook form in , and are now becoming practical as the constructive recognition of finite simple groups becomes a reality. In particular, versions of this algorithm are used in the Magma computer algebra system.

Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that applies approaches and methods traditionally used in physics to study biological phenomena. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics, developmental biology and systems biology. The term biophysics was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892.Roland Glaser. Biophysics: An Introduction. Springer; 23 April 2012. . Ambiguously, the term biophysics is also regularly used in academia to indicate the study of the physical quantities (e.g. electric current, temperature, stress, entropy) in biological systems, which is, by definition, performed by physiology. Nevertheless, other biological sciences also perform research on the biophysical properties of living organisms including molecular biology, cell biology, biophysics, and biochemistry. Overview Molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology, seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena. Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions. A ribosome is a biological machine that utilizes protein dynamics Fluorescent imaging techniques, as well as electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle scattering (SAS) both with X-rays and neutrons (SAXS/SANS) are often used to visualize structures of biological significance. Protein dynamics can be observed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. Conformational change in structure can be measured using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry, circular dichroism, SAXS and SANS. Direct manipulation of molecules using optical tweezers or AFM, can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale. Molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting entities which can be understood e.g. through statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. By drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, biophysicists are often able to directly observe, model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual molecules or complexes of molecules. In addition to traditional (i.e. molecular and cellular) biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research, from bioelectronics to quantum biology involving both experimental and theoretical tools. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics, as well as mathematics and statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, populations and ecosystems. Biophysical models are used extensively in the study of electrical conduction in single neurons, as well as neural circuit analysis in both tissue and whole brain. Medical physics, a branch of biophysics, is any application of physics to medicine or healthcare, ranging from radiology to microscopy and nanomedicine. For example, physicist Richard Feynman theorized about the future of nanomedicine. He wrote about the idea of a medical use for biological machines (see nanomachines). Feynman and Albert Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would be possible to (as Feynman put it) \\"swallow the doctor\\". The idea was discussed in Feynman's 1959 essay There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.  History  Some of the earlier studies in biophysics were conducted in the 1840s by a group known as the Berlin school of physiologists. Among its members were pioneers such as Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Heinrich Weber, Carl F. W. Ludwig, and Johannes Peter M√ºller. Biophysics might even be seen as dating back to the studies of Luigi Galvani. The popularity of the field rose when the book What Is Life? by Erwin Schr√∂dinger was published. Since 1957, biophysicists have organized themselves into the Biophysical Society which now has about 9,000 members over the world. Some authors such as Robert Rosen criticize biophysics on the ground that the biophysical method does not take into account the specificity of biological phenomena. Focus as a subfield While some colleges and universities have dedicated departments of biophysics, usually at the graduate level, many do not have university- level biophysics departments, instead having groups in related departments such as biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, physics, and physiology. Depending on the strengths of a department at a university differing emphasis will be given to fields of biophysics. What follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics. This list is hardly all inclusive. Nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department. Each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments. *Biology and molecular biology ‚Äì Gene regulation, single protein dynamics, bioenergetics, patch clamping, biomechanics, virophysics. *Structural biology ‚Äì √Öngstrom-resolution structures of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and complexes thereof. *Biochemistry and chemistry ‚Äì biomolecular structure, siRNA, nucleic acid structure, structure-activity relationships. *Computer science ‚Äì Neural networks, biomolecular and drug databases. *Computational chemistry ‚Äì molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, quantum chemistry *Bioinformatics ‚Äì sequence alignment, structural alignment, protein structure prediction *Mathematics ‚Äì graph/network theory, population modeling, dynamical systems, phylogenetics. *Medicine ‚Äì biophysical research that emphasizes medicine. Medical biophysics is a field closely related to physiology. It explains various aspects and systems of the body from a physical and mathematical perspective. Examples are fluid dynamics of blood flow, gas physics of respiration, radiation in diagnostics/treatment and much more. Biophysics is taught as a preclinical subject in many medical schools, mainly in Europe. * Neuroscience ‚Äì studying neural networks experimentally (brain slicing) as well as theoretically (computer models), membrane permittivity, gene therapy, understanding tumors. *Pharmacology and physiology ‚Äì channelomics, biomolecular interactions, cellular membranes, polyketides. *Physics ‚Äì negentropy, stochastic processes, and the development of new physical techniques and instrumentation as well as their application. *Quantum biology ‚Äì The field of quantum biology applies quantum mechanics to biological objects and problems.

Within the United States, the government federally recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma. The Comanche became the dominant tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries. They are often characterized as \\"Lords of the Plains\\" and they presided over a large area called Comancheria, which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. Comanche power depended on bison, horses, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the Spanish, French, Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and (most famously) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.Fowles, Severin, Arterberry, Lindsay Montgomery, Atherton, Heather (2017), \\"Comanche New Mexico: The Eighteenth Century,\\" in New Mexico and the Pimeria Alta, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 158-160. Downloaded from JSTOR. They took captives from weaker tribes during warfare, using them as slaves or selling them to the Spanish and (later) Mexican settlers. They also took thousands of captives from the Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers and incorporated them into Comanche society. Decimated by European diseases, warfare, and encroachment by Americans on Comancheria, most Comanches were forced into life on the reservation; a few however sought refuge with the Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico, or with the Kickapoos in Mexico. A number of them returned in the 1890s and early 1900s. In the 21st century, the Comanche Nation has 17,000 members, around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton, Fort Sill, and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The Comanche Homecoming Annual Dance takes place annually in Walters, Oklahoma, in mid-July. The Comanche language is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family, sometimes classified as a Shoshoni dialect. Only about 1% of Comanches speak this language today. The name \\"Comanche\\" comes from the Ute name for the people: k…®mantsi (enemy),. The name Padouca, which before about 1740 was applied to Plains Apaches, was sometimes applied to the Comanche by French writers from the east. Government The Comanche Nation is headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is located in Caddo, Comanche, Cotton, Grady, Jefferson, Kiowa, Stephens, and Tillman Counties. Membership of the tribe requires a 1/8 blood quantum (equivalent to one great-grandparent). Economic development The tribe operates its own housing authority and issues tribal vehicle tags. They have their own Department of Higher Education, primarily awarding scholarships and financial aid for members' college educations. Additionally, they operate the Comanche Nation College in Lawton. They own 10 tribal smoke shops and four casinos. The casinos are Comanche Nation Casino in Lawton; Comanche Red River Casino in Devol; Comanche Spur Casino, in Elgin; and Comanche Star Casino in Walters, Oklahoma.\\"Oklahoma Indian Casinos.\\" 500 Nations.

(16 February 2009) History =Formation= The Proto-Comanche movement to the Plains was part of the larger phenomenon known as the ‚ÄúShoshonean Expansion‚Äù in which that language family spread across the Great Basin and across the mountains into Wyoming. The Kotsoteka (‚ÄòBuffalo Eaters‚Äô) were probably among the first. Other groups followed. Contact with the Shoshones of Wyoming was maintained until the 1830s when it was broken by the advancing Cheyennes and Arapahoes. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, various Plains peoples acquired horses, but probably never had very many for quite some time. As late as 1725, Comanches were described as using large dogs rather than horses to carry their buffalo hide \\"campaign tents.\\" Kavanagh 66 The horse was a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved southward to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of New Spain to the south (rather than search for new herds of buffalo.) The Comanche have the longest documented existence as horse-mounted Plains peoples; they had horses when the Cheyennes still lived in earth lodges.Kavanagh 7 The Comanche supplied horses and mules to all comers. As early as 1795, Comanches were selling horses to Anglo-American traders Kavanagh 63 and by the mid-19th century, Comanche supplied horses were flowing into St. Louis via other Indian middlemen (Seminole, Osage, Shawnee).Kavanagh 380 Their original migration took them to the southern Great Plains, into a sweep of territory extending from the Arkansas River to central Texas. The earliest references to them in the Spanish records date from 1706, when reports reached Santa Fe that Utes and Comanches were about to attack. In the Comanche advance, the Apaches were driven off the Plains. By the end of the eighteenth century the struggle between Comanches and Apaches had assumed legendary proportions: in 1784, in recounting the history of the southern Plains, Texas governor Domingo Cabello recorded that some sixty years earlier (i.e., ca. 1724) the Apaches had been routed from the southern Plains in a nine-day battle at La Gran Sierra del Fierro ‚ÄòThe Great Mountain of Iron‚Äô, somewhere northwest of Texas. There is, however, no other record, documentary or legendary, of such a fight. They were formidable opponents who developed strategies for using traditional weapons for fighting on horseback. Warfare was a major part of Comanche life. Comanche raids into Mexico traditionally took place during the full moon, when the Comanche could see to ride at night. This led to the term \\"Comanche Moon\\", during which the Comanche raided for horses, captives, and weapons.Wallace and Hoebel The majority of Comanche raids into Mexico were in the state of Chihuahua and neighboring northern states.Kavanagh (1996) =Divisions= Kavanagh has defined four levels of social-political integration in traditional pre-reservation Comanche society:Kavanagh 41‚Äì53 *Patrilineal and patrilocal nuclear family *Extended family group (n âm ânahkahni ‚Äì \\"the people who live together in a household\\", no size limits, but kinship recognition was limited to relatives two generations above or three below) *Residential local group or 'band', comprised one or more n âm ânahkahni, one of which formed its core. The band was the primary social unit of the Comanche. A typical band might number several hundred people. It was a family group, centered around a group of men, all of whom were relatives, sons, brothers or cousins. Since marriage with a known relative was forbidden, wives came from another group, and sisters left to join their husbands. The central man in that group was their grandfather, father, or uncle. He was called 'paraivo', 'chief'. After his death, one of the other men took his place; if none were available, the band members might drift apart to other groups where they might have relatives and/or establish new relations by marrying an existing member. There was no separate term for or status of 'peace chief' or 'war chief'; any man leading a war party was a 'war chief'. *Division (sometimes called tribe, Spanish naci√≥n, rama ‚Äì \\"branch\\", comprising several local groups linked by kinship, sodalities (political, medicine, and military) and common interest in hunting, gathering, war, peace, trade). In contrast to the neighboring Cheyenne and Arapaho to the north, there was never a single Comanche political unit recognized by all Comanches. or \\"Nation.\\" Rather the divisions, the most \\"tribe-like\\" units, acted independently, pursuing their own economic and political goals. Before the 1750s, the Spanish identified three Comanche Naci√≥nes (divisions): H âpen â â (Jupe, Hoipi), Yapar âhka (Yamparika), and K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka). After the Mescalero Apache, Jicarilla Apache and Lipan Apache had been largely displaced from the Southern Plains by the Comanche and allied tribes in the 1780s, the Spanish began to divide the now dominant Comanche into two geographical groups, which only partially corresponded to the former three Naci√≥nes. The K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka) ('Buffalo Eaters'), which had moved southeast in the 1750s and 1760s to the Southern Plains in Texas, were called Cuchanec Orientales (\\"Eastern Cuchanec/Kotsoteka\\") or Eastern Comanche, while those K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka) that remained in the northwest and west, together with H âpen â â (Jupe, Hoipi - 'Timber/Forest People') (and sometimes Yapar âhka (Yamparika)), which had moved southward to the North Canadian River, were called Cuchanec Occidentales (\\"Western Cuchanec/Kotsoteka\\") or Western Comanche. The \\"Western Comanche\\" lived in the region of the upper Arkansas, Canadian, and Red Rivers, and the Llano Estacado. The \\"Eastern Comanche\\" lived on the Edwards Plateau and the Texas plains of the upper Brazos and Colorado Rivers, and east to the Cross Timbers. They were probably the ancestors of the Penat âka N â â (Penateka - 'Honey Eaters'). Over time, these divisions were altered in various ways, primarily due to changes in political resources.Kavanagh 478 As noted above, the K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka) were probably the first proto-Comanche group to separate from the Eastern Shoshones. War on the plains: Comanche (right) trying to lance an Osage warrior. Painting by George Catlin, 1834 The name H âpen â â (Jupe, Hoipi) vanished from history in the early 19th century, probably merging into the other divisions, they are likely the forerunners of the Nokoni N â â (Nokoni), Kwaar â N â â (Kwahadi, Quohada), and the H âpen â â (Hois) local group of the Penat âka N â â (Penateka). Due pressure by southwards moving Kiowa and Plains Apache (Naishan) Raiders many Yapar âhka (Yamparika) moved southeast, joining the \\"Eastern Comanche\\" and becoming known as the Tahnahwah (Tenawa, Tenahwit). Many Kiowa and Plains Apache moved to northern Comancheria and became later closely associated with the Yapar âhka (Yamparika). In the mid 19th century, other powerfull divisions arose, such as the Nokoni N â â (Nokoni) ('wanderers', literally 'go someplace and return'), and the Kwaar â N â â (Kwahadi, Quohada) ('Antelope Eaters'). The latter originally some local groups of the K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka) from the Cimarron River Valley as well as descendants of some H âpen â â (Jupe, Hoipi), which had pulled both southwards. The northernmost Comanche division was the Yapar âhka (Yapai N â â or Yamparika ‚Äî ‚Äò(Yap)Root-Eaters‚Äô). As the last band to move onto the Plains, they retained much of their Eastern Shoshone tradition. The power and success of the Comanche attracted bands of neighboring peoples who joined them and became part of Comanche society; an Arapaho group became known as Saria T âhka (Chariticas, Sata Teichas - 'Dog Eaters') band, an Eastern Shoshone group as Pohoi (Pohoee - 'wild sage') band, and an Plains Apache group as Tasipenan â â band. The Texans and Americans divided the Comanche into five large dominant bands - the Yapar âhka (Yamparika), K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka), Nokoni N â â (Nokoni), Penat âka N â â (Penateka) and Kwaar â N â â (Kwahadi, Quohada), which in turn were divided by geographical terms into first three (later four) regional groupings: Northern Comanche, Middle Comanche, Southern Comanche, Eastern Comanche, and later Western Comanche. However, these terms generally do not correspond to the Native language terms. The \\"Northern Comanche\\" label encompassed the Yapar âhka (Yamparika) between the Arkansas River and Canadian River and the prominent and powerful K âhts ât âhka (Kotsoteka) who roamed the high plains of Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles between Red and Canadian River, the famous Palo Duro Canyon offered them and their horse herds of protection from strong winter storms as well as from enemies, because the two bands dominated and ranged in the northern Comancheria. The \\"Middle Comanche\\" label encompassed the aggressive Nokoni N â â (Nokoni) (\\"wanderers\\", \\"those who turn back\\") between the headwaters of the Red River and the Colorado River in the south and the Western Cross Timbers in the east, their preferred range were on the Brazos River headwaters and its tributaries, the Pease River offered protection from storms and enemies. With them shared two smaller bands the same tribal areas: the Tahnahwah (Tenawa, Tenahwit) (\\"Those Living Downstream\\") and Tanim â â (Tanima, Daha âi, Tevawish) (\\"Liver Eaters\\"). All three bands together were known as \\"Middle Comanche\\" because they lived \\"in the middle\\" of the Comancheria. The \\"Southern Comanche\\" label encompassed the Penat âka N â â (Penateka) (\\"Honey Eaters\\"), the southernmost, largest, and best known band among whites as they lived near the first Spanish and Texan settlements; their tribal areas extended from the upper reaches of the rivers in central Texas and Colorado River southward, including much of the Edwards Plateau, and eastward to the Western Cross Timbers; because they dominated the southern Comancheria they were called \\"Southern Comanche\\". The \\"Western Comanche\\" label encompassed the Kwaar â N â â (Kwahadi, Quohada) ('Antelope Eaters'), which is the last to develope as an independent band in the 19th century. They lived on the hot, low-shadow desert plateaus of Llano Estacado in eastern New Mexico and found shelter in Tule Canyon and Palo Duro Canyon in northeastern Texas. They were the only band that never signed a contract with the Texans or Americans, and they were the last to give up the resistance. Because of their relative isolation from the other bands on the westernmost edge of the Comancheria, they were called the \\"Western Comanche\\". There has been, and continues to be, much confusion in the presentation of Comanche group names. Groups on all levels of organization, families, n âm ânahkahni, bands, and divisions, were given names, but many 'band lists' do not distinguish these levels. In addition, there could be alternate names and nicknames. The spelling differences between Spanish and English add to the confusion. =Some of the Comanche group names = *Yapar âhka or Yamparika (also Yapai N â â ‚Äî ‚Äò(Yap)Root-Eaters‚Äô; One of its local groups may have been called Widy â N â â / Widy â / Widy â Yapa ‚Äî ‚ÄòAwl People‚Äô; after the death of a man named 'Awl' they changed their name to T âtsahk ânan â â or Ditsahkanah ‚Äî ‚ÄòSewing People‚Äô.

These were both expeditionary, as with the raids into Mexico, and defensive in nature. The Comanche were noted for being fierce warriors who fought vigorously to defend their homeland of Comancheria. However, the massive population of the settlers from the east and the diseases they brought with them led to mounting pressure and subsequent decline of the Comanche power and the cessation of their major presence in the southern Great Plains. =Relationship with settlers= Arthur Lee Comanche warriors, c. 1867‚Äì1874 Quanah Parker, prominent chief of the Comanche Indians with a feather fan. Photo by James Mooney, 1892. The Comanche maintained an ambiguous relationship with Europeans and later settlers attempting to colonize their territory. The Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the Comancheros of New Mexico, but were feared for their raids against settlers in Texas.Plummer, R., Narrative of the Capture and Subsequent Sufferings of Mrs. Rachel Plummer, 1839, in Parker's Narrative and History of Texas, Louisville: Morning Courier, 1844, pp. 88-118Lee, N., Three Years Among the Comanches, in Captured by the Indians, Drimmer, F., editor, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1961, , pp. 277-313Babb, T.A., In the Bosom of the Comanches, 1912, Dallas: John F.

At one point, Sam Houston, president of the newly created Republic of Texas, almost succeeded in reaching a peace treaty with the Comanche in the 1844 Treaty of Tehuacana Creek. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the Texas legislature refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria. While the Comanche managed to maintain their independence and increase their territory, by the mid-19th century, they faced annihilation because of a wave of epidemics due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and measles. Outbreaks of smallpox (1817, 1848) and cholera (1849)Gwynne, S.C., Empire of the Summer Moon, 2010, New York: Scribner, , p. 112 took a major toll on the Comanche, whose population dropped from an estimated 20,000 in midcentury to just a few thousand by the 1870s. The US began efforts in the late 1860s to move the Comanche into reservations, with the Treaty of Medicine Lodge (1867), which offered churches, schools, and annuities in return for a vast tract of land totaling over . The government promised to stop the buffalo hunters, who were decimating the great herds of the Plains, provided that the Comanche, along with the Apaches, Kiowas, Cheyenne, and Arapahos, move to a reservation totaling less than of land. However, the government did not prevent the slaughtering of the herds. The Comanche under Quenatosavit White Eagle (later called Isa-tai \\"Coyote's Vagina\\") retaliated by attacking a group of hunters in the Texas Panhandle in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls (1874). The attack was a disaster for the Comanche, and the US army was called in during the Red River War to drive the remaining Comanche in the area into the reservation, culminating in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Within just 10 years, the buffalo were on the verge of extinction, effectively ending the Comanche way of life as hunters. In May 1875, the last free band of Comanches, led by the Quahada warrior Quanah Parker, surrendered and moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma. The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered. The 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.Texas Beyond History ‚Äì The Passing of the Indian Era Cherokee Commission The Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache signed with the Cherokee Commission October 6‚Äì21, 1892, further reduced their reservation to at a cost of $1.25 per acre ($308.88/km2), with an allotment of per person per tribe to be held in trust. New allotments were made in 1906 to all children born after the agreement, and the remaining land was opened to white settlement. With this new arrangement, the era of the Comanche reservation came to an abrupt end. Meusebach‚ÄìComanche treaty The Peneteka band agreed to a peace treaty with the German Immigration Company under John O. Meusebach. This treaty was not affiliated with any level of government. Meusebach brokered the treaty to settle the lands on the Fisher- Miller Land Grant, from which were formed the 10 counties of Concho, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Schleicher, San Saba, Sutton, and Tom Green. In contrast to many treaties of its day, this treaty was very brief and simple, with all parties agreeing to a mutual cooperation and a sharing of the land. The treaty was agreed to at a meeting in San Saba County, and signed by all parties on May 9, 1847 in Fredericksburg, Texas. The treaty was very specifically between the Peneteka band and the German Immigration Company. No other band or tribe was involved. The German Immigration Company was dissolved by Meusebach himself shortly after it had served its purpose. By 1875, the Comanches had been relocated to reservations. Five years later, artist Friedrich Richard Petri and his family moved to the settlement of Pedernales, near Fredericksburg. Petri's sketches and watercolors gave witness to the friendly relationships between the Germans and various local Native American tribes. Fort Martin Scott treaty In 1850, another treaty was signed in San Saba, between the United States government and a number of local tribes, among which were the Comanches. This treaty was named for the nearest military fort, which was Fort Martin Scott. The treaty was never officially ratified by any level of government and was binding only on the part of the Native Americans. Captive Herman Lehmann One of the most famous captives in Texas was a German boy named Herman Lehmann. He had been kidnapped by the Apaches, only to escape and be rescued by the Comanches. Lehmann became the adoptive son of Quanah Parker. On August 26, 1901, Quanah Parker provided a legal affidavit verifying Lehman's life as his adopted son 1877‚Äì1878. On May 29, 1908, the United States Congress authorized the United States Secretary of the Interior to allot Lehmann, as an adopted member of the Comanche nation, 160 acres of Oklahoma land, near Grandfield. =Recent history= Mac Silverhorn (Comanche), grandson of Silver Horn, drumming with friend at Redstone Baptist Church Entering the Western economy was a challenge for the Comanche in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many tribal members were defrauded of whatever remained of their land and possessions. Appointed paramount chief by the United States government, Chief Quanah Parker campaigned vigorously for better deals for his people, meeting with Washington politicians frequently; and helped manage land for the tribe. Parker became wealthy as a cattleman. Parker also campaigned for the Comanches' permission to practice the Native American Church religious rites, such as the usage of peyote, which was condemned by European Americans. Before the first Oklahoma legislature, Quanah testified: > I do not think this legislature should interfere with a man's religion, also > these people should be allowed to retain this health restorer. These healthy > gentleman before you use peyote and those that do not use it are not so > healthy.Swan 19 During World War II, many Comanche left the traditional tribal lands in Oklahoma to seek jobs and more opportunities in the cities of California and the Southwest. About half of the Comanche population still lives in Oklahoma, centered on the town of Lawton. Recently, an 80-minute 1920 silent film was \\"rediscovered\\", titled The Daughter of Dawn. It features a cast of more than 300 Comanche and Kiowa.Daughter Of Dawn, Oklahoma Historical society Culture Uwat (Comanche), photograph by Edward Curtis, 1930 =Childbirth= Comanche mother and baby son in cradleboard, photo by Edward Curtis Comanche cradleboard held at the Birmingham Museum of Art If a woman went into labor while the band was in camp, she was moved to a tipi, or a brush lodge if it was summer. One or more of the older women assisted as midwives. Men were not allowed inside the tipi during or immediately after the delivery.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.142 First, the midwives softened the earthen floor of the tipi and dug two holes. One of the holes was for heating water and the other for the afterbirth. One or two stakes were driven into the ground near the expectant mother's bedding for her to grip during the pain of labor. After the birth, the midwives hung the umbilical cord on a hackberry tree. The people believed that if the umbilical cord was not disturbed before it rotted, the baby would live a long and prosperous life.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.143, 144 The newborn was swaddled and remained with its mother in the tipi for a few days. The baby was placed in a cradleboard, and the mother went back to work. She could easily carry the cradleboard on her back, or prop it against a tree where the baby could watch her while she collected seeds or roots. Cradleboards consisted of a flat board to which a basket was attached. The latter was made from rawhide straps, or a leather sheath that laced up the front. With soft, dry moss as a diaper, the young one was safely tucked into the leather pocket. During cold weather, the baby was wrapped in blankets, and then placed in the cradleboard. The baby remained in the cradleboard for about ten months; then it was allowed to crawl around.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.120 Both girls and boys were welcomed into the band, but boys were favored. If the baby was a boy, one of the midwives informed the father or grandfather, \\"It's your close friend\\". Families might paint a flap on the tipi to tell the rest of the tribe that they had been strengthened with another warrior. Sometimes a man named his child, but mostly the father asked a medicine man (or another man of distinction) to do so. He did this in the hope of his child living a long and productive life. During the public naming ceremony, the medicine man lit his pipe and offered smoke to the heavens, earth, and each of the four directions. He prayed that the child would remain happy and healthy. He then lifted the child to symbolize its growing up and announced the child's name four times. He held the child a little higher each time he said the name. It was believed that the child's name foretold its future; even a weak or sick child could grow up to be a great warrior, hunter, and raider if given a name suggesting courage and strength. Boys were often named after their grandfather, uncle, or other relative. Girls were usually named after one of their father's relatives, but the name was selected by the mother. As children grew up they also acquired nicknames at different points in their lives, to express some aspect of their lives.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.122, 123 =Children= The Comanche looked on their children as their most precious gift. Children were rarely punished.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) p.124 Sometimes, though, an older sister or other relative was called upon to discipline a child, or the parents arranged for a boogey man to scare the child. Occasionally, old people donned sheets and frightened disobedient boys and girls. Children were also told about Big Maneater Owl (Pia Mupitsi), who lived in a cave on the south side of the Wichita Mountains and ate bad children at night. Children learned from example, by observing and listening to their parents and others in the band. As soon as she was old enough to walk, a girl followed her mother about the camp and played at the daily tasks of cooking and making clothing. She was also very close to her mother's sisters, who were called not aunt but pia, meaning mother. She was given a little deerskin doll, which she took with her everywhere. She learned to make all the clothing for the doll. A boy identified not only with his father but with his father's family, as well as with the bravest warriors in the band. He learned to ride a horse before he could walk. By the time he was four or five, he was expected to be able to skillfully handle a horse. When he was five or six, he was given a small bow and arrows. Often, a boy was taught to ride and shoot by his grandfather, since his father and other warriors were on raids and hunts. His grandfather also taught him about his own boyhood and the history and legends of the Comanche. A 19th-century Comanche child. As the boy grew older, he joined the other boys to hunt birds. He eventually ranged farther from camp looking for better game to kill. Encouraged to be skillful hunters, boys learned the signs of the prairie as they learned to patiently and quietly stalk game. They became more self-reliant, yet, by playing together as a group, also formed the strong bonds and cooperative spirit that they would need when they hunted and raided. Comanches of West Texas in war regalia, c. 1830. Boys were highly respected because they would become warriors and might die young in battle. As he approached manhood, a boy went on his first buffalo hunt. If he made a kill, his father honored him with a feast. Only after he had proven himself on a buffalo hunt was a young man allowed to go to war. When he was ready to become a warrior, at about age fifteen or sixteen, a young man first \\"made his medicine\\" by going on a vision quest (a rite of passage). Following this quest, his father gave the young man a good horse to ride into battle and another mount for the trail. If he had proved himself as a warrior, a Give Away Dance might be held in his honor. As drummers faced east, the honored boy and other young men danced. His parents, along with his other relatives and the people in the band, threw presents at his feet ‚Äì especially blankets and horses symbolized by sticks. Anyone might snatch one of the gifts for themselves, although those with many possessions refrained; they did not want to appear greedy. People often gave away all their belongings during these dances, providing for others in the band, but leaving themselves with nothing.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.126‚Äì132 Girls learned to gather healthy berries, nuts, and roots. They carried water and collected wood, and when about twelve years old learned to cook meals, make tipis, sew clothing, prepare hides, and perform other tasks essential to becoming a wife and mother. They were then considered ready to be married.Wallace and Hoebel (1952) pp.124, 125 =Death= During the 19th century, the traditional Comanche burial custom was to wrap the deceased's body in a blanket and place it on a horse, behind a rider, who would then ride in search of an appropriate burial place, such as a secure cave. After entombment, the rider covered the body with stones and returned to camp, where the mourners burned all the deceased's possessions. The primary mourner slashed his arms to express his grief. The Quahada band followed this custom longer than other bands and buried their relatives in the Wichita Mountains. Christian missionaries persuaded Comanche people to bury their dead in coffins in graveyards,Kroeker which is the practice today. =Transportation and habitation= Comanche Tipis painted by George Catlin. Comanche warrior Ako and horse. Photo by James Mooney, 1892. Three mounted Comanche warriors, left, Frank Moetah. Photo by James Mooney, 1892. When they lived with the Shoshone, the Comanche mainly used dog-drawn travois for transportation. Later, they acquired horses from other tribes, such as the Pueblo, and from the Spaniards. Since horses are faster, easier to control and able to carry more, this helped with their hunting and warfare and made moving camp easier. Larger dwellings were made due to the ability to pull and carry more belongings. Being herbivores, horses were also easier to feed than dogs, since meat was a valuable resource.Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 20‚Äì24 The horse was of the utmost value to the Comanche. A Comanche man's wealth was measured by the size of his horse herd. Horses were prime targets to steal during raids; often raids were conducted specifically to capture horses. Often horse herds numbering in the hundreds were stolen by Comanche during raids against other Indian nations, Spanish, Mexicans, and later from the ranches of Texans. Horses were used for warfare with the Comanche being considered to be among the finest light cavalry and mounted warriors in history. Comanche Feats of Horsemenship, George Catlin 1834. The Comanche sheathed their tipis with a covering made of buffalo hides sewn together. To prepare the buffalo hides, women first spread them on the ground, then scraped away the fat and flesh with blades made from bones or antlers, and left them in the sun. When the hides were dry, they scraped off the thick hair, and then soaked them in water. After several days, they vigorously rubbed the hides in a mixture of animal fat, brains, and liver to soften the hides. The hides were made even more supple by further rinsing and working back and forth over a rawhide thong. Finally, they were smoked over a fire, which gave the hides a light tan color. To finish the tipi covering, women laid the tanned hides side by side and stitched them together. As many as 22 hides could be used, but 14 was the average. When finished, the hide covering was tied to a pole and raised, wrapped around the cone-shaped frame, and pinned together with pencil-sized wooden skewers. Two wing-shaped flaps at the top of the tipi were turned back to make an opening, which could be adjusted to keep out the moisture and held pockets of insulating air. With a fire pit in the center of the earthen floor, the tipis stayed warm in the winter. In the summer, the bottom edges of the tipis could be rolled up to let cool breezes in. Cooking was done outside during the hot weather. Tipis were very practical homes for itinerant people. Working together, women could quickly set them up or take them down. An entire Comanche band could be packed and chasing a buffalo herd within about 20 minutes. The Comanche women were the ones who did the most work with food processing and preparation.Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 29‚Äì30 =Food= Comanches chasing bison, painted by George Catlin. The bison were the primary food source for the Comanche. The Comanche were initially hunter-gatherers. When they lived in the Rocky Mountains, during their migration to the Great Plains, both men and women shared the responsibility of gathering and providing food. When the Comanche reached the plains, hunting came to predominate. Hunting was considered a male activity and was a principal source of prestige. For meat, the Comanche hunted buffalo, elk, black bear, pronghorn, and deer. When game was scarce, the men hunted wild mustangs, sometimes eating their own ponies. In later years the Comanche raided Texas ranches and stole longhorn cattle. They did not eat fish or fowl, unless starving, when they would eat virtually any creature they could catch, including armadillos, skunks, rats, lizards, frogs, and grasshoppers. Buffalo meat and other game was prepared and cooked by the women. The women also gathered wild fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, roots, and tubers ‚Äî including plums, grapes, juniper berries, persimmons, mulberries, acorns, pecans, wild onions, radishes, and the fruit of the prickly pear cactus. The Comanche also acquired maize, dried pumpkin, and tobacco through trade and raids. Most meats were roasted over a fire or boiled. To boil fresh or dried meat and vegetables, women dug a pit in the ground, which they lined with animal skins or buffalo stomach and filled with water to make a kind of cooking pot. They placed heated stones in the water until it boiled and had cooked their stew. After they came into contact with the Spanish, the Comanche traded for copper pots and iron kettles, which made cooking easier. Women used berries and nuts, as well as honey and tallow, to flavor buffalo meat. They stored the tallow in intestine casings or rawhide pouches called oy√≥ot√ª¬ø. They especially liked to make a sweet mush of buffalo marrow mixed with crushed mesquite beans. The Comanches sometimes ate raw meat, especially raw liver flavored with gall. They also drank the milk from the slashed udders of buffalo, deer, and elk. Among their delicacies was the curdled milk from the stomachs of suckling buffalo calves. They also enjoyed buffalo tripe, or stomachs. Comanche people generally had a light meal in the morning and a large evening meal. During the day they ate whenever they were hungry or when it was convenient. Like other Plains Indians, the Comanche were very hospitable people. They prepared meals whenever a visitor arrived in camp, which led to outsiders' belief that the Comanches ate at all hours of the day or night. Before calling a public event, the chief took a morsel of food, held it to the sky, and then buried it as a peace offering to the Great Spirit. Many families offered thanks as they sat down to eat their meals in their tipis. Comanche children ate pemmican, but this was primarily a tasty, high-energy food reserved for war parties. Carried in a parfleche pouch, pemmican was eaten only when the men did not have time to hunt. Similarly, in camp, people ate pemmican only when other food was scarce. Traders ate pemmican sliced and dipped in honey, which they called Indian bread. =Clothing= Comanche headdress at the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin. E.A Burbank, 1897. Comanche clothing was simple and easy to wear. Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth ‚Äî a long piece of buckskin that was brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back, and loose-fitting deerskin leggings. Moccasins had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers. The Comanche men wore nothing on the upper body except in the winter, when they wore warm, heavy robes made from buffalo hides (or occasionally, bear, wolf, or coyote skins) with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went without clothes except in cold weather. When they reached the age of eight or nine, they began to wear the clothing of a Comanche adult. In the 19th century, men used woven cloth to replace the buckskin breechcloths, and the men began wearing loose- fitting buckskin shirts. The women decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes made of deer-skin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes formed with beads and scraps of material. Comanche women wore long deerskin dresses. The dresses had a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, and were trimmed with buckskin fringes along the sleeves and hem. Beads and pieces of metal were attached in geometric patterns. Comanche women wore buckskin moccasins with buffalo soles. In the winter they, too, wore warm buffalo robes and tall, fur- lined buffalo-hide boots. Unlike the boys, young girls did not go without clothes. As soon as they were able to walk, they were dressed in breechcloths. By the age of twelve or thirteen, they adopted the clothes of Comanche women.Rollings, Deer (2004) p. 31 =Hair and headgear= Comanche people took pride in their hair, which was worn long and rarely cut. They arranged their hair with porcupine quill brushes, greased it and parted it in the center from the forehead to the back of the neck. They painted the scalp along the parting with yellow, red, or white clay (or other colors). They wore their hair in two long braids tied with leather thongs or colored cloth, and sometimes wrapped with beaver fur. They also braided a strand of hair from the top of their head. This slender braid, called a scalp lock, was decorated with colored scraps of cloth and beads, and a single feather. Comanche men rarely wore anything on their heads. Only after they moved onto a reservation late in the 19th century did Comanche men begin to wear the typical Plains headdress. If the winter was severely cold, they might wear a brimless, woolly buffalo hide hat. When they went to war, some warriors wore a headdress made from a buffalo's scalp. Warriors cut away most of the hide and flesh from a buffalo head, leaving only a portion of the woolly hair and the horns. This type of woolly, horned buffalo hat was worn only by the Comanche. Comanche women did not let their hair grow as long as the men did. Young women might wear their hair long and braided, but women parted their hair in the middle and kept it short. Like the men, they painted their scalp along the parting with bright paint.Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 31, 32 =Body decoration= Comanche men usually had pierced ears with hanging earrings made from pieces of shell or loops of brass or silver wire. A female relative would pierce the outer edge of the ear with six or eight holes. The men also tattooed their face, arms, and chest with geometric designs, and painted their face and body. Traditionally they used paints made from berry juice and the colored clays of the Comancheria. Later, traders supplied them with vermilion (red pigment) and bright grease paints. Comanche men also wore bands of leather and strips of metal on their arms. Except for black, which was the color for war, there was no standard color or pattern for face and body painting: it was a matter of individual preference. For example, one Comanche might paint one side of his face white and the other side red; another might paint one side of his body green and the other side with green and black stripes. One Comanche might always paint himself in a particular way, while another might change the colors and designs when so inclined. Some designs had special meaning to the individual, and special colors and designs might have been revealed in a dream. Comanche women might also tattoo their face or arms. They were fond of painting their bodies and were free to paint themselves however they pleased. A popular pattern among the women was to paint the insides of their ears a bright red and paint great orange and red circles on their cheeks. They usually painted red and yellow around their lips.Rollings, Deer (2004) pp. 32, 33 Comanche beaded ration bag, c. 1880, collection of the Oklahoma History Center =Arts and crafts= Because of their frequent traveling, Comanche Indians had to make sure that their household goods and other possessions were unbreakable. They did not use pottery that could easily be broken on long journeys. Basketry, weaving, wood carving, and metal working were also unknown among the Comanches. Instead, they depended upon the buffalo for most of their tools, household goods, and weapons. They made nearly 200 different articles from the horns, hide, and bones of the buffalo. Removing the lining of the inner stomach, women made the paunch into a water bag. The lining was stretched over four sticks and then filled with water to make a pot for cooking soups and stews. With wood scarce on the plains, women relied on buffalo chips (dried dung) to fuel the fires that cooked meals and warmed the people through long winters.Rollings, Deer (2004) p 28 Stiff rawhide was fashioned into saddles, stirrups and cinches, knife cases, buckets, and moccasin soles. Rawhide was also made into rattles and drums. Strips of rawhide were twisted into sturdy ropes. Scraped to resemble white parchment, rawhide skins were folded to make parfleches in which food, clothing, and other personal belongings were kept. Women also tanned hides to make soft and supple buckskin, which was used for tipi covers, warm robes, blankets, cloths, and moccasins. They also relied upon buckskin for bedding, cradles, dolls, bags, pouches, quivers, and gun cases. Sinew was used for bowstrings and sewing thread. Hooves were turned into glue and rattles. The horns were shaped into cups, spoons, and ladles, while the tail made a good whip, a fly-swatter, or a decoration for the tipi. Men made tools, scrapers, and needles from the bones, as well as a kind of pipe, and fashioned toys for their children. As warriors, however, men concentrated on making bows and arrows, lances, and shields. The thick neck skin of an old bull was ideal for war shields that deflected arrows as well as bullets. Since they spent most of each day on horseback, they also fashioned leather into saddles, stirrups, and other equipment for their mounts. Buffalo hair was used to fill saddle pads and was also used in rope and halters.Rollings, Deer (2004) pp 25, 26 =Language= Charles Chibitty, Comanche code talker in World War II The language spoken by the Comanche people, Comanche (N ~~u~~ m ~~u~~ tekwap _ ~~u~~_ ), is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan language group. It is closely related to the language of the Shoshone, from which the Comanche diverged around 1700. The two languages remain closely related, but a few low-level sound changes inhibit mutual intelligibility. The earliest records of Comanche from 1786 clearly show a dialect of Shoshone, but by the beginning of the 20th century, these sound changes had modified the way Comanche sounded in subtle, but profound, ways.McLaughlin (1992), 158-81McLaughlin (2000), 293‚Äì304 Although efforts are now being made to ensure survival of the language, most of its speakers are elderly, and less than one percent of the Comanches can speak it. In the late 19th century, many Comanche children were placed in boarding schools with children from different tribes. The children were taught English and discouraged from speaking their native language. Anecdotally, enforcement of speaking English was severe. Quanah Parker learned and spoke English and was adamant that his own children do the same. The second generation then grew up speaking English, because it was believed that it was better for them not to know Comanche.H√§m√§l√§inen (2008), p.171 During World War II, a group of 17 young men, referred to as \\"The Comanche Code Talkers\\", were trained and used by the U.S. Army to send messages conveying sensitive information that could not be deciphered by the Germans.

Oxford Dictionary of English. ) is a river. Its drainage basin is in the Paris Basin (a geological relative lowland) covering most of northern France. It rises at Source-Seine, northwest of Dijon in northeastern France in the Langres plateau, flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre (and Honfleur on the left bank). It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen, from the sea. Over 60 percent of its length, as far as Burgundy, is negotiable by large barges and most tour boats, and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating; excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the river banks in the capital city, Paris. There are 37 bridges in Paris (such as Pont Alexandre III and Pont Neuf built in 1607) and dozens more outside the city. A notable bridge along the course is the Pont de Normandie, one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world, which links Le Havre to Honfleur.  Sources  The source of the Seine The Seine rises in the commune of Source-Seine, about northwest of Dijon. The source has been owned by the city of Paris since 1864. A number of closely associated small ditches or depressions provide the source waters, with an artificial grotto laid out to highlight and contain a deemed main source. The grotto includes a statue of a nymph, a dog, and a dragon. On the same site are the buried remains of a Gallo-Roman temple. Small statues of the dea Sequana \\"Seine goddess\\" and other ex-votos found at the same place are now exhibited in the Dijon archaeological museum.  Course  The Seine can artificially be divided into five parts: * the Petite Seine \\"Small Seine\\" from the sources to Montereau-Fault-Yonne * the Haute Seine \\"Upper Seine\\" from Montereau-Fault- Yonne to Paris * the Travers√©e de Paris \\"the Paris waterway\\" * the Basse Seine \\"Lower Seine\\" from Paris to Rouen * the Seine maritime \\"Maritime Seine\\" from Rouen to the English channel. Navigation The Pont de Normandie over the Seine, between Le Havre and Honfleur, on the Normandy coast The Seine is dredged and ocean-going vessels can dock at Rouen, from the sea. Commercial craft (barges and push-tows) can use the river beginning at Marcilly-sur- Seine, to its mouth. At Paris, there are 37 bridges. The river is only above sea level from its mouth, making it slow flowing and thus easily navigable. The Seine Maritime, from the English Channel at Le Havre to Rouen, is the only portion of the Seine used by ocean-going craft.Fluviacarte, Seine maritime The tidal section of the Seine Maritime is followed by a canalized section (Basse Seine) with four large multiple locks until the mouth of the Oise at Conflans- Sainte-Honorine (). Smaller locks at Bougival and at Suresnes lift the vessels to the level of the river in Paris, where the junction with the Canal Saint- Martin is located. The distance from the mouth of the Oise is .Fluviacarte, Basse Seine The Haute Seine, from Paris to Montereau-Fault-Yonne, is long and has 8 locks.Fluviacarte, Haute Seine At Charenton-le-Pont is the mouth of the Marne. Upstream from Paris seven locks ensure navigation to Saint Mamm√®s, where the Loing mouth is situated. Through an eighth lock the river Yonne is reached at Montereau-Fault-Yonne. From the mouth of the Yonne, larger ships can continue upstream to Nogent-sur-Seine (, 7 locks).Fluviacarte, Petite Seine (aval) From there on, the river is navigable only by small craft to Marcilly-sur-Seine (, 4 locks).Fluviacarte, Petite Seine (amont) At Marcilly- sur-Seine the ancient Canal de la Haute-Seine used to allow vessels to continue all the way to Troyes. This canal has been abandoned since 1957. The average depth of the Seine today at Paris is about . Until locks were installed to raise the level in the 1800s, the river was much shallower within the city, and consisted of a small channel of continuous flow bordered by sandy banks (depicted in many illustrations of the period). Today the depth is tightly controlled and the entire width of the river between the built-up banks on either side is normally filled with water. The average flow of the river is very low, only a few cubic metres per second, but much higher flows are possible during periods of heavy runoff. Dams and flood control Four large storage reservoirs have been built since 1950 on the Seine as well as its tributaries Yonne, Marne, and Aube. These help in maintaining a constant level for the river through the city, but cannot prevent significant increases in river level during periods of extreme runoff. The dams are Lac d‚ÄôOrient, Lac des Settons, Lake Der-Chantecoq, and Auzon-Temple and Amance, respectively.http://www.lacs-champagne.fr/en/content/creation-lake-reservoirs Flooding A very severe period of high water in January 1910 resulted in extensive flooding throughout the city. The Seine again rose to threatening levels in 1924, 1955, 1982, 1999‚Äì2000, June 2016, and January 2018.Seine river Basin , United Nations Environment Programme Department of Early Warning and Assessment (accessed 5 June 2007). After a first-level flood alert in 2003, about 100,000 works of art were moved out of Paris, the largest relocation of art since World War II. Much of the art in Paris is kept in underground storage rooms that would have been flooded. A 2002 report by the French government stated the worst-case Seine flood scenario would cost 10 billion euros and cut telephone service for a million Parisians, leaving 200,000 without electricity and 100,000 without gas. =2018 Paris flood= In January 2018 the Seine again flooded, reaching a flood level of on 29 January. An official warning was issued on 24 January that heavy rainfall was likely to cause the river to flood. By 27 January, the river was rising. The Deputy Mayor of Paris, Colombe Brossel, warned that the heavy rain was caused by climate change, and that \\"We have to understand that climatic change is not a word, it's a reality.\\" Watershed The basin area, including a part of Belgium, is , 2 percent of which is forest and 78 percent cultivated land. In addition to Paris, three other cities with a population over 100,000 are in the Seine watershed: Le Havre at the estuary, Rouen in the Seine valley and Reims at the northern limit‚Äîwith an annual urban growth rate of 0.2 percent. The population density is 201 per square kilometer. Water quality Periodically the sewerage systems of Paris experience a failure known as sanitary sewer overflow, often in periods of high rainfall. Under these conditions untreated sewage is discharged into the Seine.Martin Seidl, The fate of organic matter in river Seine after a combined sewer overflow, ENPC ‚Äì University Paris Val de Marne Paris XII (France), 1997, 181 pp. The resulting oxygen deficit is principally caused by allochthonous bacteria larger than one micrometre in size. The specific activity of these sewage bacteria is typically three to four times greater than that of the autochthonous (background) bacterial population. Heavy metal concentrations in the Seine are relatively high.J.F.Chiffoleau. 2007. Metal contamination. the Seine-Aval scientific programme. Quae. 40 pages The pH level of the Seine at Pont Neuf has been measured to be 8.46. Despite this, the water quality has improved significantly over what several historians at various times in the past called an \\"open sewer\\". In 2009, it was announced that Atlantic salmon had returned to the Seine. History The Seine and Eiffel Tower =Name= The name comes from the Latin , sometimes associated with the Gallo-Roman goddess of the river. The word seems to derive from the same root as Latin sequor (I follow) and English sequence, namely Proto-Indo-European *seikw-, signifying 'to flow' or 'to pour forth'.Julius Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch (Francke, 1959), word 1664 https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/natlang/ie/pokorny.html =Events= On 28 or 29 March, 845, an army of Vikings led by a chieftain named Reginherus, which is possibly another name for Ragnar Lothbrok, sailed up the River Seine with siege towers and sacked Paris. On 25 November, 885, another Viking expedition led by Rollo was sent up the River Seine to attack Paris again. In March, 1314, King Philip IV of France had Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, burned on a scaffold on an island in the River Seine in front of Notre Dame de Paris.A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages Vol. III by Henry Charles Lea, NY: Hamper & Bros, Franklin Sq. 1888, p. 325. Not in copyright. After the burning at the stake of Joan of Arc in 1431, her ashes were thrown into the Seine from the medieval stone Mathilde Bridge at Rouen, though unserious counter-claims persist.In February 2006 a team of forensic scientists announced the beginning of a six-month study to assess relics from a museum at Chinon reputed to be the remains of Jeanne d'Arc. In 2007, the investigators reported their conclusion that the relics from Chinon came from an Egyptian mummy and a cat, see According to his will, Napoleon, who died in 1821, wished to be buried on the banks of the Seine. His request was not granted. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, the river hosted the rowing, swimming, and water polo events.1900 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 17‚Äì18. Twenty-four years later, it hosted the rowing events again at Bassin d'Argenteuil, along the Seine north of Paris.1924 Olympics official report. pp. 165‚Äì6. Until the 1930s, a towing system using a chain on the bed of the river existed to facilitate movement of barges upriver. Listed in World Canals by Charles Hadfield, David and Charles 1986. The Seine was one of the original objectives of Operation Overlord in 1944. The Allies' intention was to reach the Seine by 90 days after D-Day. That objective was met. An anticipated assault crossing of the river never materialized as German resistance in France crumbled by early September 1944. However, the First Canadian Army did encounter resistance immediately west of the Seine and fighting occurred in the For√™t de la Londe as Allied troops attempted to cut off the escape across the river of parts of the German 7th Army in the closing phases of the Battle of Normandy. Some of the Algerian victims of the Paris massacre of 1961 drowned in the Seine after being thrown by French policemen from the Pont Saint-Michel and other locations in Paris. Dredging in the 1960s mostly eliminated tidal bores on the lower river, known in French as \\"le mascaret.\\" In 1991 UNESCO added the banks of the Seine in Paris‚Äîthe Rive Gauche and Rive Droite‚Äîto its list of World Heritage Sites in Europe. Paris, Banks of the Seine , the World Heritage Site entry from the UNESCO website Since 2002 Paris-Plages has been held every summer on the Paris banks of the Seine: a transformation of the paved banks into a beach with sand and facilities for sunbathing and entertainment. In 2007, 55 bodies were retrieved from its waters; in February 2008, the body of supermodel-turned- activist Katoucha Niane was found there.Supermodel Katoucha Niane found dead from The Daily Telegraph  In fiction  The Seine was the river that Javert, the primary antagonist of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Mis√©rables, drowned himself in. In Ludwig Bemelmans' 1953 children's book Madeline's Rescue and the 1998 live-action adaptation of Madeline, Madeline accidentally falls into the Seine after standing on the ledge of a bridge. The notable difference between the two is that in the book, Madeline fell over after playing on the ledge, whereas in the film, she fell over trying to justify her actions towards Pepito that got all the girls in trouble. In the 2016 film La La Land, Mia, the female protagonist, sang about her aunt who jumped into the Seine without looking and how it is similar to all the dreamers in the world who keeps on dreaming, in her final audition ‚ÄúAudition (The Fools Who Dream)‚Äù. The song was nominated for Best Original Song in the 89th Academy Awards.  In art  During the 19th and the 20th centuries in particular the Seine inspired many artists, including: * Fr√©d√©ric Bazille * Maurice Boitel * Richard Parkes Bonington * Eug√®ne Boudin * Camille Corot * Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny * Guy Debord * Raoul Dufy * Othon Friesz * Carl Fredrik Hill * Eug√®ne Isabey * Johan Barthold Jongkind * Raimond Lecourt * Albert Marquet * Henri Matisse * Claude Monet * Luis F.

Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, politics, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means. In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or \\"marks\\" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. The person or group in league with the shill relies on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting. Shills may be employed by salespeople and professional marketing campaigns. Plant and stooge more commonly refer to a person who is secretly in league with another person or outside organization while pretending to be neutral or a part of the organization in which they are planted, such as a magician's audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization (see double agent). Shilling is illegal in many circumstances and in many jurisdictions because of the potential for fraud and damage; however, if a shill does not place uninformed parties at a risk of loss, but merely generates \\"buzz\\", the shill's actions may be legal. For example, a person planted in an audience to laugh and applaud when desired (see claque), or to participate in on-stage activities as a \\"random member of the audience\\", is a type of legal shill. Shill can also be used pejoratively to describe a critic who appears either all-too-eager to heap glowing praise upon mediocre offerings, or who acts as an apologist for glaring flaws. Etymology The origin of the term \\"shill\\" is uncertain; it may be an abbreviation of \\"shillaber\\". The word originally denoted a carnival worker who pretended to be a member of the audience in an attempt to elicit interest in an attraction. Some sources trace the usage back to 1914,Note: Shillaber as a surname was known in the US during the 19th century. or as far back as 1911. American humorist Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber (1814‚Äì1890), who often wrote under the guise of his fictional character Mrs. Ruth Partington, the American version of Mrs. Malaprop, is a possible source.  Internet  In online discussion media, satisfied consumers or \\"innocent\\" parties may express specific opinions in order to further the interests of an organization in which they have an interest, such as a commercial vendor or special interest group. In academia, this is called opinion spamming. Web sites can also be set up for the same purpose. For example, an employee of a company that produces a specific product might praise the product anonymously in a discussion forum or group in order to generate interest in that product, service, or group. In addition, some shills use \\"sock puppetry\\", where they sign on as one user soliciting recommendations for a specific product or service. They then sign on as a different user pretending to be a satisfied customer of a specific company. In some jurisdictions and circumstances, this type of activity is illegal. The plastic surgery company Lifestyle Lift ordered their employees to post fake positive reviews on websites. As a result, they were sued, and ordered to pay $300,000 in damages by the New York Attorney General's office. Reputable organizations may prohibit their employees and other interested parties (contractors, agents, etc.) from participating in public forums or discussion groups in which a conflict of interest might arise, or will at least insist that their employees and agents refrain from participating in any way that might create a conflict of interest.  Gambling  Both the illegal and legal gambling industries often use shills to make winning at games appear more likely than it actually is. For example, illegal three-card monte and shell- game peddlers are notorious employers of shills. These shills also often aid in cheating, disrupting the game if the mark is likely to win. In a legal casino, however, a shill is sometimes a gambler who plays using the casino's money in order to keep games (especially poker) going when there are not enough players. The title of one of Erle Stanley Gardner's mystery novels, Shills Can't Cash Chips, is derived from this type of shill. This is different from \\"proposition players\\" who are paid a salary by the casino for the same purpose, but bet with their own money.  Marketing  In marketing, shills are often employed to assume the air of satisfied customers and give testimonials to the merits of a given product. This type of shilling is illegal in some jurisdictions, but almost impossible to detect. It may be considered a form of unjust enrichment or unfair competition, as in California's Business & Professions Code ¬ß 17200, which prohibits any \\"unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising\\".  Auctions  Shills, or \\"potted plants\\", are sometimes employed in auctions. Driving prices up with phony bids, they seek to provoke a bidding war among other participants. Often they are told by the seller precisely how high to bid, as the seller actually pays the price (to her or himself, of course) if the item does not sell, losing only the auction fees. Shilling has a substantially higher rate of occurrence in online auctions, where any user with multiple accounts can bid on their own items. One detailed example of this has been documented in online auctions for used cars. The online auction site eBay forbids shilling; its rules do not allow friends or employees of a person selling an item to bid on the item, even though eBay has no means to detect if a bidder is related to a seller or is in fact the seller. In his book Fake: Forgery, Lies, & eBay, Kenneth Walton describes how he and his cohorts placed shill bids on hundreds of eBay auctions over the course of a year. Walton and his associates were charged and convicted of fraud by the United States Attorney for their eBay shill bidding. With the proliferation of live online auctions in recent years, shill bidding has become commonplace. Some websites allow shill bidding by participating auctioneers. These auctioneers are able to see bids placed in real time and can then place counter bids to increase the amount. One Proxibid auctioneers' website states, \\"At the request of the auction company, this auction permits bids to be placed by the seller or on the seller's behalf, even if such bids are placed solely for the purpose of increasing the bid.\\"  Media  The term can apply to journalists, commentators, and media outlets, who have vested interests in or associations with parties, and report in a way favorable to those interests. The term is often used by antiestablishment figures to denounce the media.  Research and experiments  confederate. The subject believes that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level. A shill in a psychology experiment, or the like, is called a \\"confederate\\". In Stanley Milgram's experiment, in which the subjects witnessed people getting electric shocks, a confederate would pretend to be one of the experimental subjects who would receive the fake shocks, so that the real experimental subject would think that a draw of names from a hat was random. The confederate would always play the role of the learner, and the subject would be the teacher, and the subject would think that this was a random draw from a hat containing papers that say \\"learner\\" and \\"teacher\\". In performance art, such as DECONference (Decontamination Conference), the confederates were called \\"deconfederates\\". When a large group of DECONference attendees were asked to remove all clothing prior to entry to the event, the deconfederates, planted among the attendees, would comply immediately with the request, causing all of the others to follow the orders and disrobe as well.  Interrogations  Police or military interrogators sometimes use undercover agents (called \\"plants\\") to assist with the interrogation of an individual or suspect. The plant can pose as a fellow inmate or internee, build a rapport and earn the confidence of the interviewee. The plant may subtly suggest that telling the interrogators what they want to know is the sensible or right thing to do. Even if no outright confessions are obtained, minor details and discrepancies that come out in supposedly innocent conversation can be used to chip away at the interviewee. Some plants are in reality inmates or prisoners of war who have been promised better treatment and conditions in return for helping with the interrogation; the character played by William Hurt in the film Kiss of the Spider Woman is an example of this. One notorious UK case is that of Colin Stagg, a man who was falsely accused of the murder of Rachel Nickell, in which a female police officer posed as a potential love interest to try to tempt Stagg to implicate himself.  Related concepts  = Puppet government = Puppet, vassal, quisling, or satellite states have been routinely used in exercises of foreign policy to give weight to the arguments of the country that controls them. Examples of this include the USSR's use of its satellites in the United Nations during the Cold War. These states are used to give the impression of legitimacy to domestic policies that are ultimately harmful to the population they control, while beneficial to the government that controls them. Even outside the spectrum of sovereign powers many multiparty democratic systems give foreign powers the capacity to influence political discourse through shills and pseudo sock-puppets. Thanks to the reliance of many political parties on external sources of revenue for campaigns it can be easy for a government or business to either choose which party it funds or to outright create one. This way they can either choose to support existing minority voices that echo their views or form their own, using their funds and usually semi-covert influence to make them a more prominent voice. Another concept in foreign policy is seen in sovereign alliances. In these instances, an allied country acts on behalf of another's interests so that it appears that the original power does not want to get involved. This is useful in situations where there is little public support in the original country for the actions. This type of collusion is typically practiced between countries that share common goals and are capable of returning favours. An example of this may be Cuba's role during the Cold War, in sending active combat troops to wars in Africa when it was unpalatable for the USSR to do so. = Undercover operations = During covert operations or police investigations agents may routinely claim to be of political views or a part of an organization in order to gain the confidence of the people they wish to surveil. Sometimes this goes further with the agents participating in acts on behalf of the organizations they infiltrate or falsely represent as was the case during the Operations like Gladio and Chaos. Often the end goal is not just to gain information about the organization but to discredit them in the eyes of the public. However, these kinds of actions are more similar to false flag operations than typical undercover operations. In other examples, operatives may act in a manner they deem positive to assist an organization to which they cannot have overt ties.

That same year he received a scholarship and traveled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870. There, he met Felix Klein and they became close friends. When he left Berlin, Lie traveled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met Camille Jordan and Gaston Darboux. But on 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Klein (who was Prussian) had to leave France very quickly. Lie left for Fontainebleau where after a while he was arrested under suspicion of being a German spy, an event that made him famous in Norway. He was released from prison after a month, thanks to the intervention of Darboux. Lie obtained his PhD at the University of Christiania (present day Oslo) in 1871 with a thesis entitled Over en Classe geometriske Transformationer (On a Class of Geometric Transformations). It would be described by Darboux as \\"one of the most handsome discoveries of modern Geometry\\". The next year, the Norwegian Parliament established an extraordinary professorship for him. That same year, Lie visited Klein, who was then at Erlangen and working on the Erlangen program. At the end of 1872, Sophus Lie proposed to Anna Birch, then eighteen years old, and they were married in 1874. The couple had three children: Marie (b. 1877), Dagny (b. 1880) and Herman (b. 1884). In 1884, Friedrich Engel arrived at Christiania to help him, with the support of Klein and Adolph Mayer (who were both professors at Leipzig, by then). Engel would help Lie to write his most important treatise, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen, published in Leipzig in three volumes from 1888 to 1893. Decades later, Engel would also be one of the two editors of Lie's collected works. In 1886 Lie became professor at Leipzig, replacing Klein, who had moved to G√∂ttingen. In November 1889, Lie suffered a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized until June 1890. After that, he returned to his post, but over the years his anaemia progressed to the point where he decided to return to his homeland. Consequently, in 1898 he tendered his resignation in May, and left for home (for good) in September the same year. He died the following year, 1899. He was made Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society in 1878, Member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1892, Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1895 and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1895. Sophus Lie died at the age of 56, due to pernicious anemia, a disease caused by impaired absorption of vitamin B12.  Legacy  Lie's principal tool, and one of his greatest achievements, was the discovery that continuous transformation groups (now called, after him, Lie groups) could be better understood by \\"linearizing\\" them, and studying the corresponding generating vector fields (the so-called infinitesimal generators). The generators are subject to a linearized version of the group law, now called the commutator bracket, and have the structure of what is today called a Lie algebra. Hermann Weyl used Lie's work on group theory in his papers from 1922 and 1923, and Lie groups today play a role in quantum mechanics. However, the subject of Lie groups as it is studied today is vastly different from what the research by Sophus Lie was about and \\"among the 19th century masters, Lie's work is in detail certainly the least known today\\".

He was the final prime minister of the State of Vietnam (1954‚Äì55), and then served as President of South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam) from 1955 until he was deposed and assassinated during the 1963 military coup. Di·ªám was born into a prominent Catholic family, the son of a high-ranking civil servant, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£. He was educated at French-speaking schools and considered following his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c into the priesthood, but eventually chose to pursue a civil-service career. He progressed rapidly in the court of Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, becoming governor of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province in 1929 and interior minister in 1933. However, he resigned the latter position after three months and publicly denounced the emperor as a tool of the French. Di·ªám came to support Vietnamese nationalism, promoting an anti-communist and anti-colonialist \\"third way\\" opposed to both B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i and communist leader H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh. He established the Can Lao Party to support his political doctrine of Person Dignity Theory. After several years in exile, Di·ªám returned home in July 1954 and was appointed prime minister by B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, the head of the Western-backed State of Vietnam. The Geneva Accords were signed soon after he took office, formally partitioning Vietnam along the 17th parallel. Di·ªám soon consolidated power in South Vietnam, aided by his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu. After a rigged referendum in 1955, he proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as president. His government was supported by other anti-communist countries, most notably the United States. Di·ªám pursued a series of nation-building schemes, emphasising industrial and rural development. From 1957, he was faced with a communist insurgency backed by North Vietnam, eventually formally organized under the banner of the Vi·ªát C·ªông. He was subject to a number of assassination and coup attempts, and in 1962 established the Strategic Hamlet Program as the cornerstone of his counterinsurgency effort. Di·ªám's favoritism towards Catholics and persecution of South Vietnam's Buddhist majority led to the \\"Buddhist crisis\\" of 1963. The violence damaged relations with the United States and other previously sympathetic countries, and his regime lost favour with the leadership of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On 1 November 1963, the country's leading generals launched a coup d'√©tat with assistance from the CIA. He and his younger brother Nhu initially escaped, but were recaptured the following day and assassinated on the orders of D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, who succeeded him as president. Di·ªám has been a controversial historical figure in historiography on the Vietnam War. Some historians have considered him a tool of the United States, while others portrayed him as an avatar of Vietnamese tradition. Some recent studies have portrayed Di·ªám from a more Vietnamese-centred perspective as a competent leader focused on nation building and the modernisation of South Vietnam.The Lost Mandate of Heaven: the American Betrayal of Ngo Dinh Diem, President of Vietnam. Shaw, Geoffrey. Ignatius Press, 2015. Family and early life Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám was born in 1901 in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, a province in central Vietnam. His family originated in Ph√∫ Cam Village, a Catholic village adjacent to Hu·∫ø City. His clan had been among Vietnam's earliest Catholic converts in the 17th century.Fall, Bernard B. (1963). The Two Viet-Nams. Praeger Publishers, p. 235. Di·ªám was given a saint's name at birth, Gioan Baotixita (a Vietnamized form of Jean Baptiste), following the custom of the Catholic Church.Miller, p. 19. The Ng√¥-ƒê√¨nh family suffered under the anti-Catholic persecutions of Emperors Minh M·∫°ng and T·ª± ƒê·ª©c. In 1880, while Di·ªám's father, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£ (1850‚Äì1925), was studying in British Malaya, an anti-Catholic riot led by Buddhist monks almost wiped out the Ng√¥-ƒê√¨nh clan. Over 100 of the Ng√¥ clan were \\"burned alive in a church including Kh·∫£'s parents, brothers, and sisters.\\"Jacobs, Seth (2006) [Not true: https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng√¥_ƒê√¨nh_Kh·∫£ , under Th√¢n Th·∫ø (biography): sau khi b·ªë m·∫•t v√¨ b·ªã b·ªánh (khi ·∫•y √¥ng kho·∫£ng 6 tu·ªïi) ƒë∆∞·ª£c m·ªôt linh m·ª•c ng∆∞·ªùi Ph√°p ƒë∆∞a v·ªÅ nu√¥i cho √¥ng h·ªçc Nho h·ªçc: after his (Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£'s) father died of disease (when he/Kh·∫£ was 6 years old), a French priest took care of him, nourished and had him learn Chinese characters ...] Cold War Mandarin: Ngo Dinh Diem and the Origins of America's War in Vietnam, 1950‚Äì1963. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, p. 18. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£ was educated in a Catholic school in British Malaya, where he learned English and studied the European- style curriculum.Miller, p. 23. He was a devout Catholic and scrapped plans to become a Roman Catholic priest in the late 1870s. He worked for the commander of the French armed forces as an interpreter and took part in campaigns against anti-colonial rebels in the mountains of Tonkin during 1880. He rose to become a high-ranking Mandarin, the first headmaster of the National Academy in Hu·∫ø (founded in 1896) and a counselor to Emperor Th√†nh Th√°i under the French colonial regime.Fall, p. 235. He was appointed minister of the rites and chamberlain and keeper of the eunuchs. Despite his collaboration with the French colonizers, Kh·∫£ was \\"motivated less by Francophilia than by certain reformist ambitions\\".Miller, pp. 23‚Äì24. Like Phan Ch√¢u Trinh, Kh·∫£ believed that independence from France could be achieved only after changes in Vietnamese politics, society and culture had occurred. In 1907, after the ouster of emperor Th√†nh Th√°i, Kh·∫£ resigned his appointments, withdrew from the imperial court, and became a farmer in the countryside. After the tragedy of his family, Kh·∫£ decided to abandon preparation for the priesthood and married. After his first wife died childless, Kh·∫£ remarried and had twelve children with his second wife, Ph·∫°m Th·ªã Th√¢n (in a period of twenty-three years) of whom nine survived infancy ‚Äì six sons and three daughters.Jarvis, p. 20. These were Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ªã Giao, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ªã Hi·ªáp, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ªã Ho√†ng, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n and Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Luy·ªán. As a devout Roman Catholic, Kh·∫£ took his entire family to Mass each morning and encouraged his sons to study for the priesthood.Jacobs, p. 19. Having learned both Latin and classical Chinese, Kh·∫£ strove to make sure his children were well educated in both Christian scriptures and Confucian classics.Miller, p. 22. During his childhood, Di·ªám laboured in the family's rice fields while studying at a French Catholic primary school (Pellerin School) in Hu·∫ø, and later entered a private school started by his father, where he studied French, Latin, and classical Chinese. At the age of fifteen he briefly followed his elder brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, who would become Vietnam's highest-ranking Catholic bishop, into seminary.Jarvis, p. 21. Di·ªám swore himself to celibacy to prove his devotion to his faith, but found monastic life too rigorous and decided not to pursue a clerical career.Miller, p. 24. According to Moyar, Di·ªám's personality was too independent to adhere to the discipline of the Church, while Jarvis recalls Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c's ironic observation that the Church was \\"too worldly\\" for Di·ªám.Jarvis, p. 37. Di·ªám also inherited his father's antagonism toward the French colonialists who occupied his country.Moyar, p. 11 At the end of his secondary schooling at Lyc√©e Qu·ªëc h·ªçc, the French lyc√©e in Hu·∫ø, Diem's outstanding examination results elicited the offer of a scholarship to study in Paris. He declined and, in 1918, enrolled at the prestigious School of Public Administration and Law in Hanoi, a French school that prepared young Vietnamese to serve in the colonial administration. It was there that he had the only romantic relationship of his life, when he fell in love with one of his teacher's daughters. After she chose to persist with her vocation, entering a convent, he remained celibate for the rest of his life.Fall, p. 239. Di·ªám's family background and education, especially Catholicism and Confucianism, had influences on his life and career, on his thinking on politics, society, and history. According to Miller, Di·ªám \\"displayed Christian piety in everything from his devotional practices to his habit of inserting references to the Bible into his speeches\\"; he also enjoyed showing off his knowledge of classical Chinese texts.Miller, p. 21 Early career After graduating at the top of his class in 1921, Di·ªám followed in the footsteps of his eldest brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i, joining the civil service in Th·ª´a Thi√™n as a junior official. Starting from the lowest rank of mandarin, Di·ªám steadily rose over the next decade. He first served at the royal library in Hu·∫ø, and within one year was the district chief in both Th·ª´a Thi√™n and nearby Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã province, presiding over seventy villages. Di·ªám was promoted to be a provincial chief (Tu·∫ßn ph·ªß) in Ninh Thu·∫≠n at the age of 28, overseeing 300 villages.Moyar, p. 12. The five high-ranking mandarins of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty (from left to right): H·ªì ƒê·∫Øc Kh·∫£i, Ph·∫°m Qu·ª≥nh, Th√°i VƒÉn To·∫£n, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, B√πi B·∫±ng ƒêo√†n During his career as a mandarin, Di·ªám was known for his workaholism and incorruptibility, and as a Catholic leader and nationalist. Catholic nationalism in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s facilitated Di·ªám's ascent in his bureaucratic career. Di·ªám's rise was also facilitated through Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i's marriage to the daughter of Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i (1863‚Äì1935), the Catholic head of the Council of Ministers at the Hu·∫ø court and also supported the indigenization of the Vietnamese Church and more administrative powers to the monarchy.Miller, p. 25. Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i was highly regarded among the French, and Di·ªám's religious and family ties impressed him and he became Di·ªám's patron. The French were impressed by his work ethic but were irritated by his frequent calls to grant more autonomy to Vietnam. Di·ªám replied that he contemplated resigning but encouragement from the populace convinced him to persist. In 1925, he first encountered communists distributing propaganda while riding horseback through the region near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Revolted by calls for violent socialist revolution contained in the propaganda leaflets, Di·ªám involved himself in anti-communist activities for the first time, printing his own pamphlets.Jacobs, p. 20. In 1929, he was promoted to the governorship of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province and was known for his work ethic. In 1930 and 1931, he helped the French suppress the first peasant revolts organized by the communists. According to Fall, Di·ªám put the revolution down because he thought it could not sweep out the French, but might threaten the leadership of the mandarins. In 1933, with the ascension of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i to the throne, Di·ªám accepted B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's invitation to be his interior minister following lobbying by Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i. Soon after his appointment, Di·ªám headed a commission to advise on potential administration reforms. After calling for the French to introduce a Vietnamese legislature and many other political reforms, he resigned after three months in office when his proposals were rejected. Di·ªám denounced Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i as \\"nothing but an instrument in the hands of the French,\\" and renounced his decorations and titles from B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. The French then threatened him with arrest and exile. For the next decade, Di·ªám lived as a private citizen with his family in Hu·∫ø, although he was kept under surveillance. He spent his time reading, meditating, attending church, gardening, hunting, and in amateur photography.Moyar, p. 13 Di·ªám also conducted extensive nationalist activities during those 21 years, engaging in meetings and correspondence with various leading Vietnamese revolutionaries, such as his friend, Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, a Vietnamese anti-colonial activist, whom Di·ªám respected for his knowledge of Confucianism and argued that Confucianism's teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam. With the start of the World War II in the Pacific, seeing an opportunity for Vietnam to challenge French colonization, he attempted to persuade the Japanese forces to declare independence for Vietnam in 1942 but was ignored. Di·ªám also tried to establish relationships with Japanese diplomats, army officers, and intelligence operatives who supported Vietnam's independence.Miller, p. 30. In 1943, Di·ªám's Japanese friends helped him to contact Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, an anti-colonial activist, who was in exile in Japan.Tr·∫ßn, M·ªπ V√¢n (2005). Vietnamese royal in Exile: Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ (1882‚Äì1951), Routledge, pp. 32‚Äì67. After contacting C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, Di·ªám formed a secret political party, the Association for the Restoration of Great Vietnam (Vi·ªát Nam ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Ph·ª•c H∆∞ng H·ªôi), which was dominated by his Catholic allies in Hue.Keith, Charles (2012). Catholic Vietnam: A Church from Empire to Nation. University of California Press, p. 212. When its existence was discovered in the summer of 1944, the French declared Di·ªám to be a subversive and ordered his arrest. He flew to Saigon under Japanese military protection, staying there until the end of WWII. In 1945, after the coup against French colonial rule, the Japanese offered Di·ªám the post of prime minister in the Empire of Vietnam under B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, which they organized on leaving the country. He declined initially, but reconsidered his decision and attempted to reverse the refusal. However, B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i had already given the post to Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim. In September 1945, after the Japanese withdrawal, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in the Northern half of Vietnam, his Vi·ªát Minh began fighting the French. Di·ªám attempted to travel to Hu·∫ø to dissuade B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i from joining H·ªì, but was arrested by the Vi·ªát Minh along the way and exiled to a highland village near the border. He might have died of malaria, dysentery, and influenza had the local tribesmen not nursed him back to health. Six months later, he was taken to meet H·ªì, who recognized Di·ªám's virtues and, wanting to extend the support for his new government,Jacobs, p. 22. asked Di·ªám to be minister of the interior. Di·ªám refused to join the Vi·ªát Minh, assailing H·ªì for the murder of his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i by Vi·ªát Minh cadres.Jacobs, pp. 20‚Äì25 During the Indochina War, Di·ªám and other non- communist nationalists had to face a dilemma: they did not want to restore colonial rule and did not want to support the Vi·ªát Minh. Di·ªám proclaimed his neutrality and attempted to establish a Third Force movement that was both anti-colonialist and anti-communistMiller, p. 32. In 1947, he became the founder and chief of the National Union Bloc (Kh·ªëi Qu·ªëc Gia Li√™n Hi·ªáp) and then folded it into the Vietnam National Rally (Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc Gia Li√™n Hi·ªáp), which united non-communist Vietnamese nationalists. He also established relationships with some leading Vietnamese anti-communists like Nguy·ªÖn T√¥n Ho√†n (1917‚Äì2001), a fellow Catholic and political activist. His other allies and advisors were dominated by Catholics, especially his family members and their friends.Miller, pp. 32‚Äì33. Di·ªám also secretly maintained contact with high-ranking leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to convince them to leave H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's government and join him. At the same time, he lobbied French colonial officials for a \\"true independence\\" for Vietnam, Di·ªám was disappointed when in June 1948, B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i signed an agreement to grant Vietnam status as an \\"associated state\\" within the French Union, which allowed France to maintain its diplomatic, economic, and military policies in Vietnam.Miller, p. 35. In the meantime, the French had created the State of Vietnam and Di·ªám refused B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's offer to become the Prime Minister. On 16 June 1949, he then published a new manifesto in newspapers proclaiming a third force different from Vietminh and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, but it raised little interest and further, his statement provided evidence to both the French and Vi·ªát Minh that Di·ªám was a dangerous rival.Miller, p. 36. In 1950, the Vi·ªát Minh lost patience and sentenced him to death in absentia, and the French refused to protect him. H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's cadres tried to assassinate him while he was traveling to visit his elder brother Th·ª•c, bishop of the Vƒ©nh Long diocese in the Mekong Delta. Recognizing his political status, Di·ªám decided to leave Vietnam in 1950. According to Miller, during his early career, there were at least three ideologies which influenced Di·ªám's social and political views in the 1920s and 1930s. The first of these was Catholic nationalism, which Di·ªám inherited from his family's tradition, especially from Bishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, his brother, and Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i, who advised him to \\"return the seal\\" in 1933 to oppose French policies. The second was Di·ªám's understanding of Confucianism, especially through his friendship with Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u who argued that Confucianism's teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam. Lastly, instructed by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, Di·ªám began to examine Personalism, which originated from French Catholicism's philosophy and then applied this doctrine as the main ideology of his regime.Miller, pp. 20‚Äì30. Exile Di·ªám applied for permission to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c. Before going to Europe, Di·ªám went to Japan, where he met with Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, his former ally, and discussed C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ's efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland.Tr·∫ßn M·ªπ V√¢n, pp. 213‚Äì214. Di·ªám's friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and Wesley Fishel, an American political science professor at the University of California, who was working for the CIA in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti- communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Di·ªám and helped him organize connections in the United States.Fall, p. 242. In 1951, Di·ªám flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials. Nevertheless, Di·ªám was not successful in winning US support for Vietnamese anti-communists.Miller, pp. 39‚Äì40. In Rome, Di·ªám obtained an audience with Pope Pius XII at the Vatican before undertaking further lobbying across Europe. He also met with French and Vietnamese officials in Paris and sent a message indicating that he was willing to be the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam to B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. But B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i then refused to meet him.Jacobs, p. 27. Di·ªám returned to the United States to continue building support among Americans. Nonetheless, to Americans, the fact that Di·ªám was an anti-communist was not enough to distinguish him from B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i and other State of Vietnam leaders. Some American officials worried that his devout Catholicism could hinder his ability to mobilize support in a predominantly non-Catholic country. Di·ªám recognized that concern and broadened his lobbying efforts to include a development focus in addition to anti-communism and religious factors. Di·ªám was motivated by the knowledge that the US was enthusiastic in applying their technology and knowledge to modernize postcolonial countries.Miller, p. 34. With the help of Fishel, then at Michigan State University (MSU), Di·ªám was appointed as a consultant to MSU's Government Research Bureau. MSU was administering government-sponsored assistance programs for cold war allies, and Di·ªám helped Fishel to lay the foundation for a program later implemented in South Vietnam, the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group.Jacobs, p. 30. The Americans' assessments of Di·ªám were varied. Some were unimpressed with him, some admired him. Di·ªám gained favor with some high-ranking officials, such as Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Roman Catholic cardinal Francis Spellman, Representative Mike Mansfield of Montana, and Representative John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts along with numerous journalists, academics, and the legendary spy chief of the CIA William J. Donovan. Although he did not succeed in winning official support from the US, his personal interactions with American political leaders promised the prospect of gaining more support in the future. Mansfield remembered after the luncheon with Di·ªám held on 8 May 1953, he felt that \\"if anyone could hold South Vietnam, it was somebody like Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám\\". During Di·ªám's exile, his brothers Nhu, C·∫©n, and Luy·ªán played important roles in helping him build international and internal networks and support in different ways for his return to Vietnam. In the early 1950s, Nhu established the C·∫ßn Lao Party, which played a key role in helping Di·ªám attain and consolidate his power. Becoming Prime Minister and consolidation of power Until 1953, the State of Vietnam was nominally independent from Paris. Since dissatisfaction with France and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i was rising among non-communist nationalists, and support from non-communist nationalists and Di·ªám's allies was rising for his \\"true independence\\" point of view, Di·ªám sensed that it was time for him to come to power in Vietnam.Miller, pp. 94‚Äì95. In early 1954, B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i offered Di·ªám the position of Prime Minister in the new government in Vietnam. In May 1954, the French surrendered at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß and the Geneva Conference began in April 1954. On 16 June 1954, Di·ªám met with B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i in France and agreed to be the Prime Minister if B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i would give him military and civilian control. On 25 June 1954, Di·ªám returned from exile, arriving at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t airport in Saigon. On 7 July 1954, Di·ªám established his new government with a cabinet of 18 people.Moyar, p. 33. In the first period of his premiership, Di·ªám did not have much power in the government; he lacked control of the military and police forces, and the civil system's key positions were still held by French officials. He also could not control the Bank of Indochina. Besides, Di·ªám had to face massive obstacles: refugee issues; the French colonists wanting to remove Di·ªám to protect France's interest in South Vietnam; general Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh, a Francophile, the leader of National Army was ready to oust Di·ªám; the leaders of the H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i sectarian armies wanted positions in Di·ªám's cabinet and complete administrative control over the areas in which they had large numbers of followers; and the major threat of B√¨nh Xuy√™n, an organized crime syndicate that controlled the National Police led by L√™ VƒÉn Vi·ªÖn, whose power was focused in SaigonMoyar, p. 41. In summer 1954, the three organizations controlled approximately one-third of the territory and population of South Vietnam.Chapman, p. 74 In that situation, besides his own political skills, Di·ªám had to trust in his relatives and the backing of his American supporters to overcome the obstacles and neutralize his opponents.Moyar, pp. 41‚Äì42. = Partition = On 21 July 1954, the Geneva Accords temporarily partitioned Vietnam at the 17th parallel, pending elections in 1956 to reunify the country. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam controlled the north, while the French-backed State of Vietnam controlled the south with Di·ªám as the Prime Minister. Di·ªám criticized the French for abandoning North Vietnam to the Communists at Geneva, claimed that the terms did not represent the will of the Vietnamese people, and refused French suggestions to include more pro-French officials in the government. The Geneva Accords allowed for freedom of movement between the two zones until October 1954; this put a large strain on the south. Di·ªám had only expected 10,000 refugees, but by August, there were more than 200,000 waiting for evacuation from Hanoi and H·∫£i Ph√≤ng. Nevertheless, the migration helped to strengthen Di·ªám's political base of support. To deal with the refugee situation, Diem's government arranged for their relocation into fertile and under-populated provinces in the western Mekong Delta. The Di·ªám regime also provided them with food and shelter, farm tools, and housing material. The government also dug irrigation canals, built dikes, and dredged swamp-lands to help stabilise their lives.Moyar, p. 40. = Establishing control = In August 1954, Di·ªám also had to face the \\"Hinh crisis\\" when Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh launched a series of public attacks on Di·ªám, proclaiming that South Vietnam needed a \\"strong and popular\\" leader. Hinh also bragged that he was preparing a coup. However, at the end of 1954, Di·ªám successfully forced Hinh to resign from his post. Hinh had to flee to Paris and hand over his command of the national army to general Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Vy.Chapman, p. 84. But the National Army officers favoured Di·ªám's leadership over General Vy, which forced him to flee to Paris.Moyar, p. 52. Despite the failure of Hinh's alleged coup, the French continued to encourage Di·ªám's enemies in an attempt to destabilize him. On 31 December 1954, Di·ªám established the National Bank of Vietnam and replaced the Indochinese banknotes with new Vietnamese banknotes. In early 1955, although American advisors encouraged Di·ªám to negotiate with the leaders of the political- religious forces who threatened to overthrow his position and to forge an anti-communist bloc, he was determined to attack his enemies to consolidate his power.Chapman, p. 75. In April 1955, Di·ªám's army forces took most of B√¨nh Xuy√™n's posts in Saigon after a victory in the Battle of Saigon. Within a few months, Di·ªám's troops wiped out the B√¨nh Xuy√™n's remnants, leaving only a few small bands, who then joined forces with the communists. The failure of B√¨nh Xuy√™n marked the end of French efforts to remove Di·ªám.Moyar, pp. 51‚Äì53. After the defeat of B√¨nh Xuy√™n, the authority and prestige of Di·ªám's government increased. Most of the Cao ƒê√†i leaders chose to rally to Di·ªám's government.Moyar, p. 55. Di·ªám then dismantled the private armies of the Cao ƒê√†i and H√≤a H·∫£o religious sects. By the end of 1955, Di·ªám had almost taken control of South Vietnam, and his government was stronger than ever before.Moyar, p. 59. In April 1956, along with the capture of Ba C·ª•t, the leader of the last H√≤a H·∫£o rebels, Di·ªám almost subdued all of his non- communist enemies, and could focus on his Vietnamese communist opponents.Chapman, p. 128. According to Miller, Di·ªám's capacity in subduing his enemies and consolidating his power strengthened US support of his government, although the US government had planned to withdraw its backing from Di·ªám during his early difficult years of leadership.Miller, p. 6. Presidency (1955‚Äì1963) =Establishment of Republic of Vietnam= Presidential Standard of South Vietnam (1955‚Äì1963) In South Vietnam, a referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955 to determine the future direction of the south, in which the people would choose Di·ªám or B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i as the leader of South Vietnam.Moyar, p. 54. During the election, Di·ªám's brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu and the C·∫ßn Lao Party supplied Di·ªám's electoral base in organizing and supervising the elections, especially the propaganda campaign for destroying B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's reputation. Supporters of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i were not allowed to campaign, and were physically attacked by Nhu's workers. Official results showed 98.2 per cent of voters favoured Di·ªám, an implausibly high result that was condemned as fraudulent. The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000, further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged.Karnow, pp. 223‚Äì24Jacobs, p. 95. For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for Di·ªám. On 26 October 1955, Di·ªám proclaimed the formation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as its first President, although only until 26 October 1956. The first Constitution provided articles to establish the republic and organize the election of its president. The 1954 Geneva Accords prescribed elections to reunify the country in 1956. Di·ªám refused to hold these elections, claiming that a free election was not possible in the North.Unheralded Victory: The Defeat Of The Viet Cong And The North Vietnamese ... ‚Äì Mark William Woodruff ‚Äì Google Books According to Taylor, Di·ªám's rejection of the Geneva accords was a way of objecting to the French colonization of Vietnam. Di·ªám's disposition of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i and the establishment of the First Republic of Vietnam was a way to claim Vietnamese independence from France.Taylor, p. 6. At the same time, the first Constitution of the Republic of Vietnam was promulgated. According to the Constitution, Di·ªám had almost absolute power over South Vietnam. His governance style became increasingly dictatorial over time.Miller, p. 137. Di·ªám's rule was authoritarian and nepotistic. His most trusted official was Nhu, leader of the primary pro-Di·ªám Can Lao political party, who was an opium addict and admirer of Adolf Hitler. He modeled the Can Lao secret police's marching style and torture styles on Nazi designs.Olson, p. 65. C·∫©n was put in charge of the former Imperial City of Hu·∫ø. Although neither C·∫©n or Nhu held any official role in the government, they ruled their regions of South Vietnam, commanding private armies and secret police. His youngest brother Luy·ªán, was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom. His elder brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, was the archbishop of Hu·∫ø. Despite this, Thuc lived in the Presidential Palace, along with Nhu, Nhu's wife and Di·ªám. Di·ªám was nationalistic, devoutly Catholic, anti-Communist, and preferred the philosophies of personalism and Confucianism.Karnow, p. 326.Moyar,p. 36. Di·ªám's rule was also pervaded by family corruption. Can was widely believed to be involved in illegal smuggling of rice to North Vietnam on the black market and opium throughout Asia via Laos, as well as monopolising the cinnamon trade, amassing a fortune stored in foreign banks.Buttinger, pp. 954‚Äì955.Langguth, p. 258. With Nhu, Can competed for U.S. contracts and rice trade.Karnow, p. 246. Thuc, the most powerful religious leader in the country, was allowed to solicit \\"voluntary contributions to the Church\\" from Saigon businessmen, which was likened to \\"tax notices\\".Jacobs, p. 89. Thuc also used his position to acquire farms, businesses, urban real estate, rental property and rubber plantations for the Catholic Church. He also used Army of the Republic of Vietnam personnel to work on his timber and construction projects. The Nhus amassed a fortune by running numbers and lottery rackets, manipulating currency and extorting money from Saigon businesses. Luyen became a multimillionaire by speculating in piasters and pounds on the currency exchange using inside government information.Olson, p. 98. The Can Lao Party played a key role in Di·ªám's regime. Initially, the party acted secretly based on a network of cells, and each member only knew the identities of a few other members. When necessary, the Party could assume the role of the government. After 1954, the existence of the party was recognized, but its activities were hidden from public view. In the early 1950s, Di·ªám and Nhu used the party to mobilize support for Di·ªám's political movements. According to the decree 116/BNV/CT of the Republic of Vietnam, the Can Lao Party was established on 2 September 1954. Personalism (Vietnamese: Ch·ªß nghƒ©a nh√¢n v·ªã) officially became the basic doctrine of Di·ªám's regime since the Constitution's preface declared that \\"Building Politics, Economy, Society, Culture for the people based on respecting Personalism\\".Nguy·ªÖn, Xu√¢n Ho√†i (2011). Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô Vi·ªát Nam c·ªông h√≤a ·ªü mi·ªÅn Nam Vi·ªát Nam giai ƒëo·∫°n 1955‚Äì1963 Republic of Vietnam regime in South Vietnam (1955‚Äì1963), Dissertation. Ho Chi Minh city: University of Social Sciences and Humanities ‚Äì Ho Chi Minh city. pp. 43‚Äì47. = Elections = According to Miller, democracy, to Di·ªám, was rooted in his dual identity as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with communitarianism and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as \\"a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty\\", not in the US sense of \\"political right\\" or political pluralism and in the context of an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Di·ªám was not a reactionary mandarin lacking an interest in democracy as he has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became a key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform.Miller, pp. 137‚Äì39. On 4 March 1956, the elections for the first National Assembly were held. On this occasion, non-government candidates were allowed to campaign, but the government retained the right to ban candidates deemed to be linked to the communists or other 'rebel' groups, and campaign material was screened. The police were also used to intimidate opposition candidates, and military personnel were driven around to cast multiple ballots for regime members.Miller, p. 144 However, Di·ªám's regime of \\"democratic one man rule\\" faced increasing difficulties. After coming under pressure from within Vietnam and from the United States, Di·ªám agreed to hold legislative elections in August 1959 for South Vietnam. But in reality, newspapers were not allowed to publish names of independent candidates or their policies, and political meetings exceeding five people were prohibited. Candidates who ran against government-supported opponents faced harassment and intimidation. In rural areas, candidates who ran were threatened using charges of conspiracy with the Vi·ªát C·ªông, which carried the death penalty. Phan Quang ƒê√°n, the government's most prominent critic, was allowed to run. Despite the deployment of 8,000 ARVN plainclothes troops into his district to vote, ƒê√°n still won by a ratio of six to one. The busing of soldiers to vote for regime approved candidates occurred across the country. When the new assembly convened, ƒê√°n was arrested.Jacobs, pp. 112‚Äì15 In May 1961, U.S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Di·ªám the \\"Winston Churchill of Asia.\\" Asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, \\"Di·ªám's the only boy we got out there.\\" Johnson assured Di·ªám of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.Jacobs, pp. 123‚Äì125. =Socio-economic policies= During his presidency, Di·ªám imposed programs to reform Saigon society in accordance with Catholic and Confucian values. Brothels and opium dens were closed, divorce and abortion were made illegal, and adultery laws were strengthened.Kolko, Gabriel (1987). Vietnam: Anatomy of a War, 1940‚Äì1975. Unwin Paperbacks, p. 89. Additionally, Di·ªám's government established many schools and universities, such as the National Technical Center at Ph√∫ Th·ªç in 1957, the University of Saigon (1956), the University of Hue (1957), and the University of Dalat (1957). =Rural development= During Di·ªám's rule setting up a democratic basis and to promote a rural and material rearmament among the people\\". The Civic Action was considered a practical tool of Di·ªám's government to serve \\"the power vacuum\\" and make a rural influence for Di·ªám's government in countryside due to the departure of Vi·ªát Minh cadres after the Geneva Accords (1954). Steward's study provides a clearer picture of Di·ªám's domestic policies and a further understanding of his government's efforts in reaching and connecting with local communities in South Vietnam that shows \\"an indigenous initiative\\" of the government in building an independent and viable nation. Land Reform: In South Vietnam, especially in Mekong Delta, landholdings in rural areas were concentrated in small number of rich landlord families. Thus, it was urgent to implement land reform in South Vietnam. Di·ªám had two attempts to control the excesses of the land tenancy system by promulgating the Ordinance 2 on 28 January 1955 to reduce land rent between 15% to 25% of the average harvest and the Ordinance 7 on 5 February 1955 to protect the rights of tenants on new and abandoned land and enhancing cultivation. In October 1956, with the urge from Wolf Ladejinsky, Di·ªám's personal adviser on agrarian reform, Di·ªám promulgated a more serious ordinance on the land reform, in which he proclaimed a \\"land to the tiller\\" (not to be confused with other Land reform in South Vietnam like Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu's later 'Land to the Tiller\\" program) program to put a relatively high 100 hectares limit on rice land and 15 hectares for ancestral worship. However, this measure had no real effect because many landlords evaded the redistribution by transferring the property to the name of family members. Besides, during the 1946‚Äì54 war against the French Union forces, the Vi·ªát Minh had gained control of parts of southern Vietnam, initiated land reform, confiscated landlords' land and distributed it to the peasants. Additionally, the ceiling limit was more than 30 times that allowed in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and the 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of the Catholic Church's landownings in Vietnam were exempted. The political, social, and economic influences of the land reform was minimal.Tr·∫ßn Quang Minh, p. 53. From 1957 to 1963, only 50 percent of expropriated land was redistributed, and only 100,000 out of approximately one million tenant farmers in South Vietnam benefited from the reform.Tr·∫ßn Quang Minh, p. 54. Resettlement: According to Miller, Di·ªám, who described tenant farmers as a \\"real proletariat\\" and pursued the goal of \\"middle peasantization\\", was not a beholden to large landowners, instead of vigorously implementing Land Reform, Di·ªám had his own vision in Vietnamese rural development based on resettlement, which focused on redistribution of people (rather than land), could reduce overpopulation and lead to many benefits in socio-economic transformation as well as military affairs and security, especially anti-communist infiltration. Moreover, Di·ªám was ambitious to envision Resettlement as a tactic to practice the government's ideological goals. The differences between the US and Di·ªám over nation building in countryside shaped the clashes in their alliance.Miller, p. 160. The C√°i S·∫Øn resettlement project: In late 1955, with the help of US material support and expertise, Di·ªám's government implemented the project C√°i S·∫Øn in An Giang province, which aimed to resettle one hundred thousand northern refugees.Miller, pp. 165‚Äì84. Land Development program (Khu dinh ƒëi·ªÅn): In early 1957, Di·ªám started a new program called the Land Development to relocate poor inhabitants, demobilized soldiers, and minority ethnic groups in central and southern Vietnam into abandoned or unused land in Mekong Delta and Central Highlands, and cultivating technological and scientific achievements to transform South Vietnam and ensure security and prevent communist infiltration. Di·ªám believed that the program would help improve civilians' lives, teach them the values of being self-reliant and hard working. At the end of 1963, the program had built more than two hundred settlements for a quarter of a million people. Nevertheless, the lacks of conditions in these areas along with the corruption and mercilessness of local officials failed the program. Agroville program (khu tr√π m·∫≠t): During late 1959 and early 1960, motivated by the idea of population regroupment, Di·ªám introduced the Agroville Program, which he intended to physically relocate residents who lived in remote and isolated regions in Mekong delta into new settlements in \\"dense and prosperous areas\\"‚Äîproposing to offer them urban modernity and amenities without leaving their farms, and to keep them far away from the communists. Nonetheless, by late 1960, Di·ªám had to admit that the program's objective failed since the residents were not happy with the program and the communists infiltrated it, and he had to discard it. According to Miller, the disagreement between the US and Di·ªám over agrarian reform made their alliance \\"move steadily from bad to worse\\". =Counter-insurgency= During his presidency, Di·ªám strongly focused on his central concern: internal security to protect his regime as well as maintain order and social change: staunch anti- subversion and anti-rebellion policies. After the B√¨nh Xuy√™n was defeated and the H√≤a H·∫£o, Cao ƒê√†i were subdued, Di·ªám concentrated on his most serious threat: the communists. Di·ªám's main measures for internal security were threats, punishment and intimidation.Miller, p.187 According to Gabriel Kolko about 12,000 suspected opponents of Di·ªám were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed.Kolko, p. 89. By the end of 1959, Di·ªám was able to entirely control each family and the communists had to suffer their \\"darkest period\\" in their history. Membership declined by two thirds and they had almost no power in the countryside of South Vietnam.Jacobs, p. 90; Moyar, pp. 85‚Äì86. Di·ªám's repression extended beyond communists to anti-communist dissidents and anti- corruption whistleblowers. In 1956, after the \\"Anti-Communist Denunciation Campaign\\", Di·ªám issued Ordinance No. 6, which placed anyone who was considered a threat to the state and public order in jail or house arrest.Jacobs, pp. 89‚Äì90. Nevertheless, Di·ªám's hard policies led to fear and resentment in many quarters in South Vietnam and negatively affected his relations with the US in terms of counter-insurgent methods. On 22 February 1957, when Di·ªám delivered a speech at an agricultural fair in Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt, a communist named H√† Minh Tri attempted to assassinate the president. He approached Di·ªám and fired a pistol from close range, but missed, hitting the Secretary for Agrarian Reform's left arm. The weapon jammed and security overpowered Tri before he was able to fire another shot. Di·ªám was unmoved by the incident.Moyar, pp. 66‚Äì67 The assassination attempt was the desperate response of the communists to Di·ªám's relentless anti-communist policies. As opposition to Di·ªám's rule in South Vietnam grew, a low-level insurgency began to take shape there in 1957. Finally, in January 1959, under pressure from southern Viet Cong cadres who were being successfully targeted by Di·ªám's secret police, Hanoi's Central Committee issued a secret resolution authorizing the use of armed insurgency in the South with supplies and troops from the North. On 20 December 1960, under instructions from Hanoi, southern communists established the Viet Cong (NLF) in order to overthrow the government of the south. On 11 November 1960, \\"a failed coup attempt against President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám of South Vietnam was led by Lieutenant Colonel V∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒê√¥ng and Colonel Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi of the Airborne Division of the ARVN (ARVN)\\".Karnow, A history of Vietnam, pp. 252‚Äì53 There was a further attempt to assassinate Di·ªám and his family in February 1962 when two air force officers‚Äîacting in unison‚Äîbombarded the Presidential Palace.Karnow, 280‚Äì81Jacobs, pp. 131‚Äì32.Moyar, pp. 151‚Äì52. South Vietnamese \\"Strategic Hamlet\\" In 1962, the cornerstone of Di·ªám's counterinsurgency effort ‚Äì the Strategic Hamlet Program (Vietnamese: ·∫§p Chi·∫øn l∆∞·ª£c), \\"the last and most ambitious of Diem's government's nation building schemes\\", was implemented, calling for the consolidation of 14,000 villages of South Vietnam into 11,000 secure hamlets, each with its own houses, schools, wells, and watchtowers supported by South Vietnamese government. The hamlets were intended to isolate the National Liberation Front (NLF) from the villages, their source for recruiting soldiers, supplies, and information, and to transform the countryside. In the end, because of many shortcomings, the Strategic Hamlet Program was not as successful as had been expected and was cancelled after the assassination of Di·ªám. However, according to Miller, the program created a remarkable turnabout in Di·ªám's regime in their war against communism.Miller, p. 247. =Religious policies and the Buddhist crisis= In a country where surveys of the religious composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70% and 90%,The 1966 Buddhist Crisis in South Vietnam HistoryNetGettleman, pp. 275‚Äì76, 366.Moyar, pp. 215‚Äì216.Tucker, pp. 49, 291, 293.Maclear, p. 63.SNIE 53-2-63, \\"The Situation in South Vietnam, 10 July 1963 Di·ªám's policies generated claims of religious bias. Diem was widely regarded by historians as having pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, the government was regarded as being biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions.Tucker, p. 291. Di·ªám also once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting that he was a Buddhist, \\"Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted.\\" Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam converted to Catholicism in the belief that their military prospects depended on it.Gettleman, pp. 280‚Äì282. The distribution of weapons to village self-defense militias intended to repel Vi·ªát C·ªông guerrillas saw weapons only given to Catholics. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to Catholicism in order to receive aid or to avoid being forcibly resettled by Di·ªám's regime,Buttinger, p. 993 with Buddhists in the army being denied promotion if they refused to convert to Catholicism. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies,Warner, p. 210. and in some areas forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.Fall, p. 199. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the \\"private\\" status imposed on Buddhism by the French required official permission to conduct public Buddhist activities and was never repealed by Di·ªám.Karnow, p. 294 Catholics were also de facto exempt from the corv√©e labor that the government obliged all citizens to perform; US aid was disproportionately distributed to Catholic-majority villages.Jacobs p. 91 The land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from land reform.Buttinger p. 933. Under Di·ªám, the Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and in 1959, Di·ªám dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at all major public events in South Vietnam. The newly constructed Hue and Dalat universities were placed under Catholic authority to foster a Catholic-skewed academic environment. Nonetheless, Di·ªám had contributed to Buddhist communities in South Vietnam by giving them permission to carry out activities that were banned by French and supported money for Buddhist schools, ceremonies, and building more pagodas. Among the eighteen members of Di·ªám's cabinet, there were five Catholics, five Confucians, and eight Buddhists, including a vice-president and a foreign minister. Only three of the top nineteen military officials were Catholics.Moyar, p. 216 The regime's relations with the United States worsened during 1963, as discontent among South Vietnam's Buddhist majority was simultaneously heightened. In May, in the heavily Buddhist central city of Hu·∫ø, where Di·ªám's elder brother was the Catholic Archbishop, the Buddhist majority was prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags.Miller, p. 266. A few days earlier, however, white and yellow Catholic papal flags flew at the 25th anniversary commemoration of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c's elevation to the rank of bishop.Jarvis, p. 59. According to Miller, Di·ªám then proclaimed the flag embargo because he was annoyed with the commemoration for Th·ª•c.Miller, p. 266 However, the ban on religious flag led to a protest led by Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang against the government, which was suppressed by Di·ªám's forces, and unarmed civilians were killed in the clash. Di·ªám and his supporters blamed the Vi·ªát C·ªông for the deaths and claimed the protesters were responsible for the violence.Moyar, pp. 212‚Äì13 Although the provincial chief expressed sorrow for the killings and offered to compensate the victims' families, they resolutely denied that government forces were responsible for the killings and blamed the Viet Cong. According to Di·ªám, it was the communists who threw a grenade into the crowd.Jacobs, p. 143. The Buddhists pushed for a five-point agreement: freedom to fly religious flags, an end to arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Hu·∫ø victims, punishment for the officials responsible, and religious equality. Di·ªám then banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. On 3 June 1963, protesters attempted to march towards the T·ª´ ƒê√†m pagoda. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowds. Finally, brownish-red liquid chemicals were doused on praying protesters, resulting in 67 being hospitalized for chemical injuries. A curfew was subsequently enacted.Jacobs, p. 145 The turning point came in June when a Buddhist monk, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, set himself on fire in the middle of a busy Saigon intersection in protest of Di·ªám's policies; photos of this event were disseminated around the world, and for many people these pictures came to represent the failure of Di·ªám's government.Moyar, p. 220. A number of other monks publicly self-immolated, and the US grew increasingly frustrated with the unpopular leader's public image in both Vietnam and the United States. Di·ªám used his conventional anti-communist argument, identifying the dissenters as communists. As demonstrations against his government continued throughout the summer, the special forces loyal to Di·ªám's brother, Nhu, conducted an August raid of the X√° L·ª£i pagoda in Saigon. Pagodas were vandalized, monks beaten, and the cremated remains of Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, which included his heart, a religious relic, were confiscated. Simultaneous raids were carried out across the country, with the T·ª´ ƒê√†m pagoda in Hu·∫ø looted, the statue of Gautama Buddha demolished, and the body of a deceased monk confiscated.Jacobs, pp. 147‚Äì54. When the populace came to the defense of the monks, the resulting clashes saw 30 civilians killed and 200 wounded. In all 1,400 monks were arrested, and some thirty were injured across the country. The United States indicated its disapproval of Di·ªám's administration when ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. visited the pagoda. No further mass Buddhist protests occurred during the remainder of Di·ªám's rule.Moyar, pp. 212‚Äì16, 231‚Äì34 Madame Nhu Tr·∫ßn L·ªá Xu√¢n, Nhu's wife, inflamed the situation by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, \\"If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline.\\"Jacobs, p. 149. The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Hu·∫ø University. When high school students demonstrated, Di·ªám arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Di·ªám's foreign minister V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest.Jacobs, p. 154. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest. At the same time that the Buddhist crisis was taking, a French diplomatic initiative to end the war had launched known to the historians as the \\"Maneli affair\\", after Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission who served as an intermediary between the two Vietnams. In 1963, North Vietnam was suffering its worst drought in a generation, and Maneli had carried messages back and forth between Hanoi and Saigon under which a ceasefire would be declared in exchange for a barter trade would be launched with South Vietnamese rice to be traded for North Vietnamese coal.Jacobs, p. 165. On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Nhu at his office in the Gia Long Palace, a meeting that Nhu subsequently leaked to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who revealed it to the world in his \\"A Matter of Fact\\" column in the Washington Post.Langguth, p. 234. Through Nhu's purpose in leaking the meeting was to blackmail the United States with the message if Kennedy continued to criticize Diem's handling of the Buddhist crisis, then Diem would reach an understanding with the Communists, the Kennedy administration reacted with fury at what Alsop had revealed.Karnow, p. 292. Roger Hilsman in a message to the Secretary of State Dean Rusk urged that a coup against Diem be encouraged to take place promptly, saying that the mere possibility that Diem might make a deal with the Communists meant that he had to go.Karnow, p. 292. There have been many interpretations of the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c in 1963. Relating the events to the larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in the 20th century and looking at the interactions between Di·ªám and Buddhist groups, the Buddhist protests during Di·ªám's regime were not only the struggles against discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom, but also the resistance of Vietnamese Buddhism to Di·ªám's nation-building policies centered by a personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power.Miller, p. 262. Until the end of his life, Di·ªám, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation-building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like what they had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the B√¨nh Xuy√™n in 1955.Miller, pp. 277‚Äì78. Di·ªám, accompanied by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, arrives at Washington National Airport in 1957. Di·ªám is shown shaking hands with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. =Foreign policy= The foreign policy of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), according to Fishel, \\"to a very considerable extent\\", was the policy of Ngo Dinh Diem himself during this period.Henderson and Fishel, p. 4. He was the decisive factor in formulating foreign policies of the RVN, besides the roles of his adviser ‚Äì Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu and his foreign ministers: Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê·ªô (1954‚Äì1955), V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u (1955‚Äì1963) and Ph·∫°m ƒêƒÉng L√¢m (1963) who played subordinate roles in his regime. Nevertheless, since Di·ªám had to pay much attention to domestic issues in the context of the Vietnam War, foreign policy did not receive appropriate attention from him. Di·ªám paid more attention to countries that affected Vietnam directly and he seemed to personalize and emotionalize relations with other nations.Henderson and Fishel, p. 5. The issues Di·ªám paid more attention in foreign affairs were: the Geneva Accords, the withdrawal of the French, international recognition, the cultivation of the legitimacy of the RVN and the relations with the United States, Laos (good official relations) and Cambodia (complicated relations, especially due to border disputes and minority ethnicities), and especially North Vietnam. Besides, the RVN also focused on diplomatic relations with other Asian countries to secure its international recognition. Di·ªám's attitude toward India was not harmonious due to India's non-alignment policy, which Di·ªám assumed favored communism. It was not until in 1962, when India voted for a report criticizing the communists for supporting the invasion of South Vietnam, that Di·ªám eventually reviewed his opinions toward India.Henderson and Fishel, p. 22. For Japan, Di·ªám's regime established diplomatic relations for the recognition of war reparations, which led to a reparation agreement in 1959 with the amount of $49 million. Di·ªám also established friendly relations with non-communist states, especially South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Laos and the Federation of Malaya, where Di·ªám's regime shared the common recognition of communist threats.Henderson and Fishel, pp. 23‚Äì24. The RVN established diplomatic relations with Cambodia, India, Burma, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Morocco, and Tunisia. Regarding the relations with communist North Vietnam, Di·ªám maintained total hostility and never made a serious effort to establish any relations with it. In relations with France, as an anti-colonialism nationalist, Di·ªám did not believe in France and France was always a negative factor in his foreign policy. He also never \\"looked up on France as a counterweight to American influence\\".Henderson and Fishel, p. 21. Concerning relations with the US, although Di·ªám admitted the importance of the US-RVN alliance, he perceived that the US's assistance to the RVN was primarily serving its own national interest, rather than the RVN's national interest.Henderson and Fishel, p. 9. Keith Taylor adds that Di·ªám's distrust of the US grew because of its Laotian policy, which gave North Vietnam access to South Vietnam's border through southern Laos. Di·ªám also feared the escalation of American military personnel in South Vietnam, which threatened his nationalist credentials and the independence of his government.Taylor, p. 3. In early 1963, the Ng√¥ brothers even revised their alliance with the US.Miller, p. 253‚Äì 60}} Moreover, they also disagreed with the US on how to best react to the threat from North Vietnam. While Di·ªám believed that before opening the political system for the participation of other political camps, military, and security matters should be taken into account; the US wanted otherwise and was critical of Di·ªám's clientelistic government, where political power based on his family members and trusted associates. The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam decreased American confidence in Di·ªám, and eventually led to the coup d'√©tat sanctioned by the US. Ultimately, nation-building politics \\"shaped the evolution and collapse of the US-Diem alliance\\". The different visions in the meanings of concepts ‚Äì democracy, community, security, and social change ‚Äì were substantial, and were a key cause of the strains throughout their alliance. Coup and assassination As the Buddhist crisis deepened in July 1963, non-communist Vietnamese nationalists and the military began preparations for a coup. B√πi Di·ªÖm, later South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, reported in his memoirs that General L√™ VƒÉn Kim requested his aid in learning what the United States might do about Di·ªám's government.B. Di·ªÖm and D. Chanoff, In the Jaws of History, p. 100. Di·ªÖm had contacts in both the embassy and with the high-profile American journalists then in South Vietnam, David Halberstam (New York Times), Neil Sheehan (United Press International), and Malcolm Browne (Associated Press).B. Di·ªÖm and D. Chanoff, In the Jaws of History, p. 101. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup The coup d'√©tat was designed by a military revolutionary council including ARVN generals led by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh. Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Conein, a CIA officer, had become a liaison between the US Embassy and the generals, who were led by Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n. They met each other for the first time on 2 October 1963 at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t airport. Three days later, Conein met with General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh to discuss the coup and the stance of the US towards it.Miller, p. 312. Conein then delivered the White House's message of American non-intervention, which was reiterated by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the US ambassador, who gave secret assurances to the generals that the United States would not interfere.Jacobs, p. 2. The coup was chiefly planned by the Vietnamese generals. Unlike the coup in 1960, the plotters of the 1963 coup knew how to gain broad support from other ARVN officer corps. They obtained the support of General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê·ªãnh, General ƒê·ªó Cao Tr√≠, General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, and the I Corps and II Corps Commanders. Only General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao of IV Corps remained loyal to Di·ªám.Miller, p. 320. On 1 November 1963, Conein donned his military uniform and stuffed three million Vietnamese piastres into a bag to be given to General Minh. Conein then called the CIA station and gave a signal indicating that the planned coup against President Diem was about to start.Annie Jacobsen, \\"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\\" (New York: Little Brown and Company, 2019), p. 148 Minh and his co-conspirators swiftly overthrew the government. With only the palace guard remaining to defend Di·ªám and his younger brother Nhu, the generals called the palace offering Di·ªám exile if he surrendered. That evening, however, Di·ªám and his entourage escaped via an underground passage to Cha Tam Catholic Church in Cholon, where they were captured the following morning. On 2 November 1963, the brothers were assassinated together in the back of an M113 armoured personnel carrier with a bayonet and revolver by Captain Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung, under orders from Minh given while en route to the Vietnamese Joint General Staff headquarters.B. Diem, In the Jaws of History, p. 105. Di·ªám was buried in an unmarked grave in a cemetery next to the house of the US Ambassador. Aftermath Upon learning of Di·ªám's ouster and assassination, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh reportedly stated: \\"I can scarcely believe the Americans would be so stupid.\\"Moyar, p. 286 The North Vietnamese Politburo was more explicit: > The consequences of the 1 November coup d'√©tat will be contrary to the > calculations of the US imperialists ... Di·ªám was one of the strongest > individuals resisting the people and Communism. Everything that could be > done in an attempt to crush the revolution was carried out by Di·ªám. Di·ªám was > one of the most competent lackeys of the US imperialists ... Among the > anti-Communists in South Vietnam or exiled in other countries, no one has > sufficient political assets and abilities to cause others to obey. > Therefore, the lackey administration cannot be stabilized. The coup d'√©tat > on 1 November 1963 will not be the last. After Di·ªám's assassination, South Vietnam was unable to establish a stable government and several coups took place after his death. While the United States continued to influence South Vietnam's government, the assassination bolstered North Vietnamese attempts to characterize the South Vietnamese as \\"supporters of colonialism\\".Moyar, pp. 287‚Äì90 Di·ªám's legacy Di·ªám's assassination led to the collapse of his regime and the end of the first Republic of Vietnam. Nevertheless, Di·ªám's contribution over his nine years of power from 1954 to 1963 can be appreciated at many levels due to his part in resolving the northern refugees issue, establishing and consolidating the power of his regime, subduing the sects, and pacifying the country. Di·ªám stabilized an independent South Vietnam that had suffered in the First Indochina War and built a relatively stable government in Saigon during the late 1950s. The normalcy and domestic security created conditions for economic recovery and development of education in South Vietnam, which contributed educated human resources to serve the nation. Many universities were established during Di·ªám's presidency, such as Hu·∫ø University, ƒê√† L·∫°t University, University of Pedagogy, the University of Saigon, University of Agriculture and Forestry, Medical University of Hu·∫ø, and the National Institute of Administration, which applied the methods of European and American-style vocational schools, contributing to education in the Republic of Vietnam.

Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.Costea, M. 2007-onwards. Digital Atlas of Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae). Wilfrid Laurier University Herbarium, Ontario, Canada. Folk names include: strangle tare, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, strangleweed, angel hair, and witch's hair. Description Dodder can be identified by its thin stems appearing leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales. In these respects it closely resembles the similarly parasitic, but unrelated genus, Cassytha. From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are approximately the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species such as Cuscuta reflexa can photosynthesize slightly, while others such as C. europaea are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition. Cuscuta europaea in flower Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are minute and produced in large quantities. They have a hard coating, and typically can survive in the soil for 5‚Äì10 years, sometimes longer. Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Although dodder germination can occur without a host, it has to reach a green plant quickly and is adapted to grow towards the nearby plants by following chemosensory clues. If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons, though present, are vestigial. Punjab, Pakistan Parasitism After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food beneficial to dodder, the dodder produces haustoria that insert themselves into the vascular system of the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies. The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas, it can grow more or less continuously and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees; in cold temperate regions, it is an annual plant and is restricted to relatively low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring. Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, lespedeza, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, helenium, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias. It is an ectoparasite and is categorized as holoparasitic plant, or a plant that is non-photosynthetic and is completely dependent on a host. Dodder ranges in severity based on its species and the species of the host, the time of attack, and whether any viruses are also present in the host plant. By debilitating the host plant, dodder decreases the ability of plants to resist viral diseases, and dodder can also spread plant diseases from one host to another if it is attached to more than one plant. This is of economic concern in agricultural systems, where an annual drop of 10% yield can be devastating. There has been an emphasis on dodder vine control in order to manage plant diseases in the field.

Epidermal tissue 8). A Cuscuta haustorium growing into the phloem of the host plant. Host location A report published in Science in 2006 demonstrated that dodder use airborne volatile organic compound cues to locate their host plants. Seedlings of C. pentagona exhibit positive growth responses to volatiles released by tomato and other species of host plants. When given a choice between volatiles released by the preferred host tomato and the non-host wheat, the parasite grew toward the former. Further experiments demonstrated attraction to a number of individual compounds released by host plants and repellence by one compound released by wheat. These results do not rule out the possibility that other cues, such as light, may also play a role in host location. Host defenses Less is known about host defenses against dodder and other parasitic plants than is known about plant defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In one study, tomato plants were found to employ complex mechanisms to defend against dodder. Two pathways, using jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, were activated in response to attack by Cuscuta pentagona. Dodder attack was also found to induce production of volatiles, including 2-carene, Œ±-pinene, limonene, and Œ≤-phellandrene. It is not known if or how these volatiles defend the host, but they could potentially interfere with the dodder's ability to locate and select hosts. Also, the presence of trichomes on the tomato stem effectively blocks the dodder from attaching to the stem. Prevention and treatment Cuscuta on sage in the Mojave Desert Many countries have laws prohibiting import of dodder seed, requiring crop seeds to be free of dodder seed contamination. Before planting, all clothes should be inspected for dodder seed when moving from an infested area to a non-infested crop. When dealing with an infested area, swift action is necessary. Recommendations include planting a non-host crop for several years after the infestation, pulling up host crops immediately, particularly before the dodder produces seed, and use of preemergent herbicides such as Dacthal in the spring. Examples of non-host crops include grasses and many other monocotyledons. If dodder is found before it chokes a host plant, it may be simply removed from the soil. If choking has begun, the host plant must be pruned significantly below the dodder infestation, as dodder is versatile and able to grow back from its haustoria. Use in Chinese traditional medicine C. chinensis seeds () have long been used for osteoporosis in China and some other Asian countries. C. chinensis is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine which is believed to strengthen the liver and kidneys. Cuscuta species are also used as medicine in Himalayan regional medical traditions.

The use of the word \\"equity\\" in other law systems is outside the topic of by this article; let it just be mentioned that under Napoleonic law, the civil judge, judging en droit et en √©quit√© (in [written] law and in equity) must \\"say the law\\" even if there is no appropriate or conclusive written law applying to the case brought before him. (Under French law, most of which is written, precedent is not binding, but une jurisprudence constante (a stable jurisprudence) is highly persuasive, especially if coming from higher courts.) For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the Court of Chancery. The Judicature Reforms in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not effect any substantive fusion, however. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a \\"fusion fallacy\\". Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their current treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things: * The law relating to express, resulting, and constructive trusts; * Fiduciary law; * Equitable estoppel (including promissory and proprietary estoppel); * Relief against penalties and relief against forfeiture;There is currently a divergence of opinion between the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of England on this point. In Australia, the continuing existence of the equitable jurisdiction to relieve against penalties has been confirmed: . In England, this view was not adopted: . * The doctrines of contribution, subrogation and marshalling; and * Equitable set-off. The latter part of the twentieth century saw increased debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the \\"fusion wars\\"..For an example of the pro- fusionist view, see Andrew Burrows, . A particular flashpoint in this debate centred on the concept of unjust enrichment and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the law of unjust enrichment.  History  = Origins of the common law = After the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, royal justice came to be administered in three central courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, it was necessary to fit one's claim within a form of action. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the Chancery, the head of which was the Lord Chancellor. If the law provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself who was himself deemed the ‚ÄúKeeper of the Royal Conscience‚Äù. In the early history of the United States, common law was viewed as a birthright. Both the individual states and the federal government supported common law after the American Revolution. U.S. courts draw on decisions of English courts, individual state courts, and federal courts in formulating common law. = Emergence of the Court of Chancery = By the 14th century it appears that Chancery was operating as a court, affording remedies for which the strict procedures of the common law worked injustice or provided no remedy to a deserving plaintiff. Chancellors often had theological and clerical training and were well versed in Roman law and canon law. By the 15th century the judicial power of Chancery was clearly recognised. Equity, as a body of rules, varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, until the end of the 16th century. After the end of the 17th century, only lawyers were appointed to the office of Chancellor. Over time, Equity developed a system of precedent much like its common-law cousin. One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of uses, a role that the rigid framework of land law could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between legal and equitable interests. = Development of equity in England = It was early provided that, in seeking to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a writ of entry. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right under the protection of the Crown if need be, hence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, Parliament provided in the Provisions of Oxford that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a \\"writ for right\\" package known as a form of action. However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King. People began petitioning the King for relief against unfair judgments of the common law courts. As the number of petitioners rapidly grew, the King delegated the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor, who was literally the Keeper of the King's Conscience. Since the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking the beginning of a new era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Chancery continued to be the subject of extensive criticism, the most famous of which was 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism: > Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; > equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that > is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the > standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an > uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a > short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a > Chancellor's conscience.J. Selden, Table Talk; quoted in A criticism of Chancery practice as it developed in the early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules and that the Lord Chancellor was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counter-argument was that Equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking to substance rather than to form. Litigants would go 'jurisdiction shopping' and often would seek an equitable injunction prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order. The penalty for disobeying an equitable ‚Äòcommon injunction‚Äô and enforcing a common law judgment was imprisonment. The Chief Justice of the King's Bench, Sir Edward Coke, began the practice of issuing writs of habeas corpus that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders. This tension climaxed in the Earl of Oxford's case (1615) where a judgment of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, issued a common injunction from the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the Attorney-General, Sir Francis Bacon. Sir Francis, by authority of King James I, upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system. = Ecclesiastical laws = Ecclesiastical laws are a branch of English law and were English laws that dealt with matters concerning the church, this was so that religion and law was differentiated. These laws are considered an unwritten law of England and cannot be withheld in the court of law. Ecclesiastical laws are not currently established in the U.S as Common law. = Statute of Uses 1535 = In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called ‚Äòthe use‚Äô that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity. Henry VIII enacted the Statute of Uses in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue. The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner and therefore liable for feudal dues. The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the 'use upon a use'. The Statute recognized only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land. For an example, see Godwyne v. Profyt (after 1393): a petition to the ChancellorGodwyne v. Profyt in .  Comparison of equity traditions in common law countries  = Australia = Equity remains a cornerstone of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the High Court of Australia re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines.See, e.g., . The High Court has recently affirmed the importance of Equity and dismissed the suggestion that unjust enrichment has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as subrogation.. The state of New South Wales is particularly well known for the strength of its Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW to grant relief in either equity or common law. In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail. Nevertheless, in 1984 three alumni of Sydney Law School and judges of the NSW Supreme Court, Roderick Meagher, William Gummow and John Lehane produced Equity: Doctrines & Remedies. It remains one of the most highly regarded practitioner texts in Australia and England. The work is now in its 5th edition and edited by Dyson Heydon, former Justice of the High Court, Justice Mark Leeming of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, and Dr Peter Turner of Cambridge University. =United Kingdom=  England and Wales  Equity remains a distinct part of the law of England and Wales. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the law of unjust enrichment. Scholars such as Professor Birks and Professor Burrows argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label \\"legal\\" or \\"equitable\\" before a substantive rule is often unnecessary. Many English universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include Snell's Equity, Lewin on Trusts, and Hayton & Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees.  Scotland  The courts of Scotland have never recognised a division between the normal common law and equity, and as such the Court of Session (the supreme civil court of Scotland) has exercised an equitable and inherent jurisdiction and called the nobile officium. The nobile officium enables the Court to provide a legal remedy where statute or the common law are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to injustice. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to precedent, and when legislation or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a statutory power, but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a casus improvisus. = India = In India the common law doctrine of equity had traditionally been followed even after it became independent in 1947. However, in 1963 the \\"Specific Relief Act\\" was passed by the Parliament of India following the recommendation of the Law Commission of India and repealing the earlier \\"Specific Relief Act\\" of 1877. Under the 1963 Act, most equitable concepts were codified and made statutory rights, thereby ending the discretionary role of the courts to grant equitable reliefs. The rights codified under the 1963 Act were as under: * Recovery of possession of immovable property (ss. 5‚Äì8) * Specific performance of contracts (ss. 9‚Äì25) * Rectification of Instruments (s. 26) * Recession of Contracts (ss. 27‚Äì30) * Cancellation of Instruments (ss. 31‚Äì33) * Declaratory Decrees (ss. 34‚Äì35) * Injunctions (ss. 36‚Äì42) With this codification, the nature and tenure of the equitable reliefs available earlier have been modified to make them statutory rights and are also required to be pleaded specifically to be enforced. Further to the extent that these equitable reliefs have been codified into rights, they are no longer discretionary upon the courts or as the English law has it, \\"Chancellor's foot\\" but instead are enforceable rights subject to the conditions under the 1963 Act being satisfied. Nonetheless, in the event of situations not covered under the 1963 Act, the courts in India continue to exercise their inherent powers in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which applies to all civil courts in India. There is no such inherent powers with the criminal courts in India except with the High Courts in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Further, such inherent powers are vested in the Supreme Court of India in terms of Article 142 of the Constitution of India which confers wide powers on the Supreme Court to pass orders \\"as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it\\". = United States = In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is \\"no adequate remedy at law\\"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called \\"writs\\" (such as a writ of habeas corpus), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an injunction. Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity: the judge is the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity. Thomas Jefferson explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity: \\"If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule.\\" The US Supreme Court, however, has concluded that courts have wide discretion to fashion relief in cases of equity. The first major statement of this power came in Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557 (1869). The Court concluded that \\"relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case.\\" Willard v. Tayloe was for many years the leading case in contract law regarding intent and enforcement. as well as equity. In the United States today, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality.See, e.g., (Roberts, C.J. for a unanimous court) (reviewing the scope of equitable relief as authorized by the ERISA statute). This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like the Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifically authorize only equitable relief, which forces American courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity. Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern United States following the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in the states in the mid-19th century, when David Dudley Field II convinced New York State to adopt what became known as the Field Code of 1848. The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938. Today three states still have separate courts for law and equity; the most notable is Delaware, whose Court of Chancery is where most cases involving Delaware corporations are decided.The other two are Mississippi and Tennessee. Sources that mention four states (i.e., Laycock 2002) generally include Arkansas, which abolished its separate chancery courts as of January 1, 2002. . However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and New Jersey) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court. Virginia had separate law and equity dockets (in the same court) until 2006.Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Rule 3:1; W.H. Bryson, \\"The Merger of Common-Law and Equity Pleading in Virginia\\", University of Richmond Law Review 41:77-82 (2006). Besides corporate law, which developed out of the law of trusts, areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included wills and probate, adoptions and guardianships, and marriage and divorce. Bankruptcy was also historically considered an equitable matter; although bankruptcy in the United States is today a purely federal matter, reserved entirely to the United States Bankruptcy Courts by the enactment of the United States Bankruptcy Code in 1978, bankruptcy courts are still officially considered \\"courts of equity\\" and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code. After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts. The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as joinder, counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the courts of equity.

It consists of terrestrial trees, shrubs, lianas, or herbs that are recognizable by simple, opposite leaves with interpetiolar stipules. The family contains about 13,500 species in 611 genera, which makes it the fourth-largest angiosperm family. Rubiaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution; however, the largest species diversity is concentrated in the tropics and subtropics. Economically important species include Coffea, the source of coffee, Cinchona, the source of the antimalarial alkaloid quinine, some dye plants (e.g., Rubia), and ornamental cultivars (e.g., Gardenia, Ixora, Pentas). Description The Rubiaceae are morphologically easily recognizable as a coherent group by a combination of characters: opposite leaves that are simple and entire, interpetiolar stipules, tubular sympetalous actinomorphic corollas and an inferior ovary. A wide variety of growth forms are present: shrubs are most common (e.g. Coffea, Psychotria), but members of the family can also be trees (e.g. Cinchona, Nauclea), lianas (e.g. Psychotria samoritourei), or herbs (e.g. Galium, Spermacoce). Some epiphytes are also present (e.g. Myrmecodia). The plants usually contain iridoids, various alkaloids, and raphide crystals are common. The leaves are simple, undivided, and entire; there is only one case of pinnately compound leaves (Pentagonia osapinnata). Leaf blades are usually elliptical, with a cuneate base and an acute tip. In three genera (Pavetta, Psychotria, Sericanthe), bacterial leaf nodules can be observed as dark spots or lines on the leaves. The phyllotaxis is usually decussate, rarely whorled (e.g. Fadogia), or rarely alternate resulting from the suppression of one leaf at each node (e.g. Sabicea sthenula). Characteristic for the Rubiaceae is the presence of stipules that are mostly fused to an interpetiolar structure on either side of the stem between the opposite leaves. Their inside surface often bears glands called \\"colleters\\", which produce mucilaginous compounds protecting the young shoot. The \\"whorled\\" leaves of the herbaceous tribe Rubieae have classically been interpreted as true leaves plus interpetiolar leaf-like stipules. The inflorescence is a cyme, rarely of solitary flowers (e.g. Rothmannia), and is either terminal or axillary and paired at the nodes. The flowers are usually bisexual and usually epigynous. The perianth is usually biseriate, although the calyx is absent in some taxa (e.g. Theligonum). The calyx has four or five sepals with basally fused lobes. The corolla is sympetalous with four, five or six (e.g. Richardia) lobes, mostly actinomorphic, usually tubular, mostly white or creamy but also yellow (e.g. Gardenia spp., Mycelia basiflora), and rarely blue (e.g. Faramea calyptrata) or red (e.g. Alberta magna, Ixora coccinea). They have four or five stamens, which are alternipetalous and epipetalous. Anthers are longitudinal in dehiscence, but some genera are poricidal (e.g. Rustia). The gynoecium is syncarpous with an inferior ovary (rarely secondarily superior, e.g. Gaertnera, Pagamea). Placentation is axial, rarely parietal (e.g. Gardenia); ovules are anatropous to hemitropous, unitegmic, with a funicular obturator, one to many per carpel. Nectaries are often present as a nectariferous disk atop the ovary. The fruit is a berry, capsule (e.g. Oldenlandia), drupe (e.g. Coffea, Psychotria), or schizocarp (e.g. Cremocarpon). Red fruits are fairly dominant (e.g. Coffea arabica); yellow (e.g. Rosenbergiodendron formosum), orange (e.g. Vangueria infausta), or blackish fruits (e.g. Pavetta gardeniifolia) are equally common; blue fruits are rather exceptional save in the Psychotrieae and associated tribes. Most fruits are about 1 cm in diameter; very small fruits are relatively rare and occur in herbaceous tribes; very large fruits are rare and confined to the Gardenieae. The seeds are endospermous. Distribution and habitat Rubiaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found in nearly every region of the world, except for extreme environments such as the polar regions and deserts. The distribution pattern of the family is very similar to the global distribution of plant diversity overall. However, the largest diversity is distinctly concentrated in the humid tropics and subtropics. An exception is the tribe Rubieae, which is cosmopolitan but centered in temperate regions. Only a few genera are pantropical (e.g. Ixora, Psychotria), many are paleotropical, while Afro-American distributions are rare (e.g. Sabicea). Endemic rubiaceous genera are found in most tropical and subtropical floristic regions of the world. The highest number of species is found in Colombia, Venezuela, and New Guinea. When adjusted for area, Venezuela is the most diverse, followed by Colombia and Cuba. The Rubiaceae consist of terrestrial and predominantly woody plants. Woody rubiaceous shrubs constitute an important part of the understorey of low- and mid-altitude rainforests. Rubiaceae are tolerant of a broad array of environmental conditions (soil types, altitudes, community structures, etc.) and do not specialize in one specific habitat type (although genera within the family often specialize). Ecology =Flower biology= Most Rubiaceae are zoophilous. Entomophilous species produce nectar from an epigynous disk at the base of the corolla tube to attract insects. Ornithophily is rare and is found in red-flowered species of Alberta, Bouvardia, and Burchellia. Anemophilous species are found in the tribes Anthospermeae and Theligoneae and are characterized by hermaphroditic or unisexual flowers that exhibit a set of specialized features, such as striking sexual dimorphism, increased receptive surface of the stigmas and pendulous anthers. Although most Rubiaceae species are hermaphroditic, outbreeding is promoted through proterandry and spatial isolation of the reproductive organs. More complex reproductive strategies include secondary pollen presentation, heterodistyly, and unisexual flowers. Secondary pollen presentation (also known as stylar pollen presentation or ixoroid pollen mechanism) is especially known from the Gardenieae and related tribes. The flowers are proterandrous and the pollen is shed early onto the outside of the stigmas or the upper part of the style, which serve as a 'receptaculum pollinis'. Increased surface area and irregularity of the pollen receptacle, caused by swellings, hairs, grooves or ridges often ensure a more efficient pollen deposition. After elongation of the style, animals transport the pollen to flowers in the female or receptive stage with exposed stigmatic surfaces. A pollen catapult mechanism is present in the genera Molopanthera and Posoqueria (tribe Posoquerieae) that projects a spherical pollen mass onto visiting sphingidae. Heterodistyly is another mechanism to avoid inbreeding and is widely present in the family Rubiaceae. The tribes containing the largest number of heterostylous species are Spermacoceae and Psychotrieae. Heterostyly is absent in groups that have secondary pollen presentation (e.g. Vanguerieae). Unisexual flowers also occur in Rubiaceae and most taxa that have this characteristic are dioecious. The two flower morphs are however difficult to observe as they are rather morphologically similar; male flowers have a pistillode with the ovaries empty and female flowers have empty, smaller anthers (staminodes). Flowers that are morphologically hermaphrodite, but functionally dioecious are for example found in Pyrostria. = Fruit biology = The dispersal units in Rubiaceae can be entire fruits, syncarps, mericarps, pyrenes or seeds. Fleshy fruit taxa are probably all (endo)zoochorous (e.g. tribes Pavetteae, Psychotrieae), while the dispersal of dry fruits is often unspecialized (e.g. tribes Knoxieae, Spermacoceae). When seeds function as diaspores, the dispersal is either anemochorous or hydrochorous. The three types of wind-dispersed diaspores in Rubiaceae are dust seeds (rare, e.g. Lerchea), plumed seeds (e.g. Hillia), and winged seeds (e.g. Coutarea). Long-distance dispersal by ocean currents is very rare (e.g. the seashore tree Guettarda speciosa). Other dispersal mechanisms are absent or at least very rare. Some Spermacoceae having seeds with elaiosomes are probably myrmecochorous (e.g. Spermacoce hepperiana). Epizoochorous taxa are limited to herbaceous Rubiaceae (e.g. Galium aparine fruits are densely covered with hooked bristly hairs). = Associations with other organisms = The genera Anthorrhiza, Hydnophytum, Myrmecodia, Myrmephytum, and Squamellaria are succulent epiphytes that have evolved a mutualistic relationship with ants. Their hypocotyl grows out into an ant-inhabited tuber. Some shrubs or trees have ant holes in their stems (e.g. Globulostylis). Some Rubiaceae species have domatia that are inhabited by mites (viz. acarodomatia; e.g. Plectroniella armata). An intimate association between bacteria and plants is found in three rubiaceous genera (viz. Pavetta, Psychotria, and Sericanthe). The presence of endophytic bacteria is visible by eye because of the formation of dark spots or nodules in the leaf blades. The endophytes have been identified as Burkholderia bacteria. A second type of bacterial leaf symbiosis is found in the genera Fadogia, Fadogiella, Globulostylis, Rytigynia, Vangueria (all belonging to the tribe Vanguerieae), where Burkholderia bacteria are found freely distributed among the mesophyll cells and no leaf nodules are formed. The hypothesis regarding the function of the symbiosis is that the endophytes provide chemical protection against herbivory by producing certain toxic secondary metabolites. Systematics The family Rubiaceae is named after Rubia, a name used by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia for madder (Rubia tinctorum). The roots of this plant have been used since ancient times to extract alizarin and purpurin, two red dyes used for coloring clothes. The name rubia is therefore derived from the Latin word ruber, meaning red. The well-known genus Rubus (blackberries and raspberries) is unrelated and belongs to Rosaceae, the rose family. =Taxonomy= The name Rubiaceae (nomen conservandum) was published in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, but the name was already mentioned in 1782. Several historically accepted families are since long included in Rubiaceae: Aparinaceae, Asperulaceae, Catesbaeaceae, Cephalanthaceae, Cinchonaceae, Coffeaceae, Coutariaceae, Galiaceae, Gardeniaceae, Guettardaceae, Hameliaceae, Hedyotidaceae, Houstoniaceae, Hydrophylacaceae, Lippayaceae, Lygodisodeaceae, Naucleaceae, Nonateliaceae, Operculariaceae, Pagamaeaceae, Psychotriaceae, Randiaceae, Sabiceaceae, Spermacoceaceae. More recently, the morphologically quite different families Dialypetalanthaceae, Henriqueziaceae, and Theligonaceae were reduced to synonymy of Rubiaceae. Subfamilies and tribes The classical classification system of Rubiaceae distinguished only two subfamilies: Cinchonoideae, characterized by more than one ovule in each locule, and Coffeoideae, having one ovule in each locule. This distinction, however, was criticized because of the distant position of two obviously related tribes, viz. Gardenieae with many ovules in Cinchonoideae and Ixoreae with one ovule in Coffeoideae, and because in species of Tarenna the number of ovules varies from one to several in each locule. During the twentieth century other characters were used to delineate subfamilies, e.g. stylar pollen presentation, raphides, endosperm, heterostyly, etc. On this basis, three or eight subfamilies were recognised. The last subfamilial classification solely based on morphological characters divided Rubiaceae into four subfamilies: Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, Antirheoideae, and Rubioideae. In general, problems of subfamilies delimitation in Rubiaceae based on morphological characters are linked with the extreme naturalness of the family, hence a relatively low divergence of its members. The introduction of molecular phylogenetics in Rubiaceae research has corroborated or rejected several of the conclusions made in the pre-molecular era. There is support for the subfamilies Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, and Rubioideae, although differently circumscribed, and Antirheoideae is shown to be polyphyletic. The tribe Coptosapelteae including the genera Acranthera and Coptosapelta, and the monogeneric tribe Luculieae have not been placed within a subfamily and are sister to the rest of Rubiaceae. Currently, in most molecular research concerning the family Rubiaceae, the classification with three subfamilies (Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, and Rubioideae) is followed. However, an alternative view is proposed where only two subfamilies are recognized, an expanded Cinchonoideae (that includes Ixoroideae, Coptosapeltaeae and Luculieae) and Rubioideae. The adoption of the Melbourne Code for botanical nomenclature had an unexpected impact on many names that have been long in use and are well-established in literature. According to the Melbourne Code, the subfamilial name Ixoroideae should be replaced by Dialypetalanthoideae. However, Dialypetalanthus is morphologically quite aberrant in Rubiaceae and if it should be excluded from Rubiaceae, the subfamilial name remains Ixoroideae. Molecular studies also have substantial impact on tribal delimitations and taxonomic changes are still being made. Also here, according to the Melbourne Code, the tribe Condamineeae should be renamed to Dialypetalantheae. The following list contains the validly published tribe names, however, some tribes might be disputed. The approximate number of species is indicated between brackets, however, several genera and species are not yet placed in a tribe. {- valign=top * basal Rubiaceae (60 sp.)

This makes it the fourth-largest family of flowering plants by number of species and fifth-largest by number of genera. Although taxonomic adjustments are still being made, the total number of accepted genera remains stable. In total, around 1338 genus names have been published, indicating that more than half of the published names are synonyms. Psychotria, with around 1530 species, is the largest genus within the family and the third-largest genus of the angiosperms, after the legume Astragalus and the orchid Bulbophyllum. However, the delimitation of Psychotria remains problematic and its adjustment might reduce the number of species. In total, 30 genera have more than 100 species. However, 138 genera are monotypic, which account for 22% of all genera, but only for 1.1% of all species. =Phylogeny= Molecular studies have demonstrated the phylogenetic placement of Rubiaceae within the order Gentianales and the monophyly of the family is confirmed. The relationships of the three subfamilies of Rubiaceae together with the tribes Coptosapelteae and Luculieae are shown in the phylogenetic tree below. The placement of these two groups relative to the three subfamilies has not been fully resolved. =Evolution= The fossil history of the Rubiaceae goes back at least as far as the Eocene. The geographic distribution of these fossils, coupled with the fact that they represent all three subfamilies, is indicative of an earlier origin for the family, probably in the Late Cretaceous or Paleocene. Although fossils dating back to the Cretaceous and Palaeocene have been referred to the family by various authors, none of these fossils has been confirmed as belonging to the Rubiaceae. The oldest confirmed fossils, which are fruits that strongly resemble those of the genus Emmenopterys, were found in the Washington and are 48‚Äì49 million years old. A fossil infructescence and fruit found in 44 million-year-old strata in Oregon was assigned to Emmenopterys dilcheri, an extinct species. The next-oldest fossils date to the Late Eocene and include Canthium from Australia, Faramea from Panama, Guettarda from New Caledonia, and Paleorubiaceophyllum, an extinct genus from the southeastern United States. Fossil Rubiaceae are known from three regions in the Eocene (North America north of Mexico, Mexico-Central America- Caribbean, and Southeast Pacific-Asia). In the Oligocene, they are found in these three regions plus Africa. In the Miocene, they are found in these four regions plus South America and Europe. Uses =Food= Staple foods are not found in the Rubiaceae but some species are consumed locally and fruits may be used as famine food. Examples are African medlar fruits (e.g. V. infausta, V. madagascariensis), African peach (Nauclea latifolia), and noni (Morinda citrifolia). =Beverage= The most economically important member of the family is the genus Coffea used in the production of coffee. Coffea includes 124 species, but only three species are cultivated for coffee production: C. arabica, C. canephora, and C. liberica. =Medicinal= The bark of trees in the genus Cinchona is the source of a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is quinine, one of the first agents effective in treating malaria. Woodruff (Galium odoratum) is a small herbaceous perennial that contains coumarin, a natural precursor of warfarin, and the South American plant Carapichea ipecacuanha is the source of the emetic ipecac. Psychotria viridis is frequently used as a source of dimethyltryptamine in the preparation of ayahuasca, a psychoactive decoction. The bark of the species Breonadia salicina have been used in traditional African medicine for many years. The leaves of the Kratom plant (Mitragyna speciosa) contain a variety of alkaloids, including several psychoactive alkaloids and is traditionally prepared and consumed in Southeast Asia, where it has been known to exhibit both painkilling and stimulant qualities, behaving as a Œº-opioid receptor agonist, and often being used in traditional Thai medicine in a similar way to and often as a replacement for opioid painkillers like morphine. =Ornamentals= Originally from China, the common gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides) is a widely grown garden plant and flower in frost-free climates worldwide. Several other species from the genus are also seen in horticulture. The genus Ixora contains plants cultivated in warmer-climate gardens; the most commonly grown species, Ixora coccinea, is frequently used for pretty red- flowering hedges. Mussaenda cultivars with enlarged, colored calyx lobes are shrubs with the aspect of Hydrangea; they are mainly cultivated in tropical Asia. The New Zealand native Coprosma repens is a commonly used plant for hedges. The South African Rothmannia globosa is seen as a specimen tree in horticulture. Nertera granadensis is a well-known house plant cultivated for its conspicuous orange berries. Other ornamental plants include Mitchella, Morinda, Pentas, and Rubia. =Dyes= Rose madder, the crushed root of Rubia tinctorum, yields a red dye, and the tropical Morinda citrifolia yields a yellow dye.

Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. They are known colloquially as gambier, cat's claw or u√±a de gato. The latter two names are shared with several other plants. The type species for the genus is Uncaria guianensis.Uncaria In: Index Nominum Genericorum.

The South American U. tomentosa is called U√±a de Gato. Uncaria sinensis is common in China. Uncaria was named in 1789 by Johann von Schreber in his Genera Plantarum edition 8[a] (not to be confused with books of the same title by Linnaeus, Jussieu, and others).Uncaria in International Plant Names Index.

The plant extract contains some 150 identified phytochemicals, including catechins, proanthocyanins, and chalcone- flavan-3-ol dimers, called gambiriins. Cat's claw (U. tomentosa) and the Chinese Uncaria species are used in traditional medicine, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence they have any medicinal properties. Adverse effects Although cat's claw appears to be safe for human use below 350 milligrams per day over 6 weeks, its adverse effects may include nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, and an increased risk of bleeding if used with an anticoagulant drug.

It is an English-language adaptation of Alejandro Amen√°bar's 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which was written by Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil, with Pen√©lope Cruz reprising her role from the original film. The film has been described as \\"an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp\\". The film stars Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell in supporting roles. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, as well as Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award nominations for Diaz's performance. Plot David Aames, the owner of a large publishing company he inherited from his father, is in prison. Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe. In flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father's trusted associates while living as a playboy in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia's apartment and fall in love, unaware that David's current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride, and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and drastically disfiguring David. Doctors cannot completely repair David's face using plastic surgery, leaving it scarred and misshapen. David wears a prosthetic mask around others, but the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club, but David ends up drunk and insults the two. They leave him to wallow in the street outside the club. The next morning, Sofia returns to David, asleep on the street, and apologizes to him. She takes him home, and over time, helps David emotionally recover. Doctors find a way to surgically repair David's face despite their prior prognosis. While David's life seems perfect, he notices strange oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man at a bar who tells David that he could control the world and everyone in it. One day, while at Sofia's, David wakes up to find himself facing Julie, with all the photos of Sofia's face replaced by Julie's. Out of confusion and shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned, and finds his face no longer reconstructed and he's once again wearing the mask. Dr. McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name \\"Life Extension\\". Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. The company representative Rebecca explains how Life Extension uses cryonic suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a lucid dream state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in his own lucid dream, escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for \\"tech support\\", and rushes for the building's lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar, who invites him in. As the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains to David he is tech support, and that David has been in suspension for 150 years, starting shortly after the night at the club where Sofia broke up with him. David opted for Life Extension to be woken when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father's associates. As part of the program, David had opted for a lucid dream based on the \\"vanilla sky\\" from a Claude Monet painting The Seine at Argenteuil, starting the morning after Sofia's breakup. However, the equipment had merged elements of his subconscious, such as Julie, or McCabe as his father figure, within his dream, forcing them to pull him out of the lucid dream state. They emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech support tells David that while they have fixed his lucid dream, he has a choice of either being put back into the dream, or to be woken up in reality, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David opts to wake up, despite a vision of McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. David jumps and his life flashes before his eyes before hitting the ground. A female voice commands him to \\"open your eyes\\", and David opens his eyes. =Alternative ending version= The 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternative ending. This ending expands on the details at the end of the film. While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternative takes, and alternative dialogue. After Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator. He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he's only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music. At this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded: David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura, who tells him what happened at the end of his real life. Once they reach the roof, McCabe re-enters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David's interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but \\"can't settle for a dream\\". He then jumps off the building, screaming \\"I want to wake up!\\" as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him \\"Open your eyes. You're going to be fine.\\" Cast Production =Development= After the American debut of Alejandro Amen√°bar's 1997 Spanish film Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes) at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned the remake rights. Hoping to entice director Cameron Crowe, who collaborated with Cruise on Jerry Maguire, Cruise invited Crowe over to his house to view the film. Cruise has stated: > I've been offered a lot of films to buy and remake, and I never have because > I felt it was too connected with the culture of that place, whatever country > it was from. But this was a universal story that was still open-ended, that > still felt like it needed another chapter to be told. The title Vanilla Sky refers to the sky as painted by Claude Monet, specifically as in The Seine at Argenteuil (1873) which is featured in the film. The title of the film is a reference to depictions of skies in certain paintings by Claude Monet.Mentioned by the director in the commentary track for the DVD release. In addition to Monet's impressionistic artwork, the film's tone was derived from the acoustic ballad \\"By Way of Sorrow\\" by Julie Miller and a line from an early interview of Elvis Presley in which he said, \\"I feel lonely, even in a crowded room.\\" =Filming= Principal photography for Vanilla Sky began in late 2000 and lasted six weeks. On November 12, 2000, shooting for the scene of the deserted Times Square in New York took place in the early hours of the day. A large section of traffic was blocked off around Times Square while the scene was shot. \\"There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up,\\" said Steadicam operator Larry McConkey. \\"Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmovable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around. [Cruise] participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be.\\" Filming lasted for six weeks around the New York City area, which included scenes in Central Park, the Upper West Side, SoHo, and Brooklyn. One prominent location in the area was the Cond√© Nast Building that served as Aames Publishing and David's office. After filming finished in New York, production moved to Los Angeles, where the remaining interior shots were completed at Paramount Studios. Crowe intentionally left in shots of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks as a tribute. Despite the film's distorted aspects of reality, the style of cinematography remains grounded for much of the film. \\"I didn't do anything that was overtly obvious, because the story revolves around the main character not knowing whether he's in a state of reality, a dream or a nightmare, so we want it to feel a little ambiguous,\\" said cinematographer John Toll. \\"We want the audience to make discoveries as [Cruise]'s character does, rather than ahead of him.\\" American Cinematographer magazine wrote a feature story on the lighting designer Lee Rose's work on the film. =Music= Aside from the opening sequence featuring Radiohead's song \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" and selected works by Icelandic group Sigur R√≥s, Vanilla Sky's score was by Crowe's then wife, Nancy Wilson, who also scored Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. Wilson spent nine months on the film's music, which was done through experimentation of sound collages. \\"We were trying to balance out the heaviness of the story with sugary pop-culture music,\\" she said. \\"We made sound collages of all kinds. We were channeling Brian Wilson to a large extent. I was recording things through hoses, around corners, playing guitars with cello bows, and with [music editor] Carl Kaller, we tried all kinds of wacky stuff. In the murder‚Äìsex scene sound collage, Cameron even used Brian Wilson's speaking voice from a Pet Sounds mix session.\\" Interpretations According to Cameron Crowe's commentary, there are five different interpretations of the ending: * \\"Tech support\\" is telling the truth: 150 years have passed since Aames killed himself and subsequent events form a lucid dream. * The entire film is a dream, evidenced by a sticker on Aames' car that reads \\"2/30/01\\" (February 30 does not occur in the Gregorian calendar). * The events following the crash form a dream that occurs while Aames is in a coma. * The entire film is the plot of the book that Brian is writing. * The entire film after the crash is a hallucination caused by the drugs that were administered during Aames' reconstructive surgery. Crowe notes that the presence of \\"Vanilla Sky\\"‚Äîthe morning reunion after the club scene‚Äîmarks the first lucid dream scene, and that everything that follows is a dream. Reception =Box office= Vanilla Sky opened at #1 at the box office in the United States when it was first presented on December 14, 2001. The opening weekend took in a gross income of $25,015,518 (24.9%). The final domestic gross income was $100.61 million while the international gross income was slightly higher at $102.76m for a total worldwide gross income of $203,388,341. =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 170 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise's performance lacks depth, and it's hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade D- on a scale from A to F. Roger Ebert's printed review of Vanilla Sky awarded the film three out of four stars: \\"Think it all the way through, and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky is a scrupulously moral picture. It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because‚Äîwell, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don't want to analyze until you've seen it two times.\\" Ebert interpreted the ending as an explanation for \\"the mechanism of our confusion\\", rather than a device that tells \\"us for sure what actually happened.\\" Film critic Richard Roeper ranked the film the second best of 2001. Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls Vanilla Sky a \\"highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory\\", but then says: \\"As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year's most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), Vanilla Sky loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganised and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science's utopian discoveries. David's redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction.\\" Salon.com called Vanilla Sky an \\"aggressively plotted puzzle picture, which clutches many allegedly deep themes to its heaving bosom without uncovering even an onion-skin layer of insight into any of them.\\" The review rhetorically asks: \\"Who would have thought that Cameron Crowe had a movie as bad as Vanilla Sky in him? It's a punishing picture, a betrayal of everything that Crowe has proved he knows how to do right. ... But the disheartening truth is that we can see Crowe taking all the right steps, the most Crowe-like steps, as he mounts a spectacle that overshoots boldness and ambition and idiosyncrasy and heads right for arrogance and pretension‚Äîand those last two are traits I never would have thought we'd have to ascribe to Crowe.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 2/4 and wrote: \\"The film's aim‚Äîto dazzle and inspire‚Äîis sapped by Cruise's vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Gareth Von Kallenbach of the publication Film Threat compared Vanilla Sky unfavorably to Open Your Eyes. Bradshaw says Open Your Eyes is \\"certainly more distinctive than\\" Vanilla Sky, which he describes as an \\"extraordinarily narcissistic high-concept vanity project for producer-star Tom Cruise.\\" Other reviewers extrapolate from the knowledge that Cruise had bought the rights to do a version of Amen√°bar's film. A Village Voice reviewer characterized Vanilla Sky as \\"hauntingly frank about being a manifestation of its star's cosmic narcissism\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called Cameron Diaz \\"compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality\\" and The New York Times reviewer said she gives a \\"ferociously emotional\\" performance. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly says of the film, \\"most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal- attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.\\" For her performance, Diaz won multiple critics' groups awards, as well as being nominated for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Saturn Award, and AFI Award. Pen√©lope Cruz's performance, however, earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (in addition to her roles in Blow and Captain Corelli's Mandolin).

The word is a variant of the Latinized name of Burchard of Worms (died AD 1025), Bishop of Worms, Germany, who compiled 20 volumes of Ecclesiastical Rules. History Begun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the Collectarium Canonum or Decretum, became a primary source for canon law. Along with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the Old Testament and Saint Augustine of Hippo, Burchard included the Canon Episcopi in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal \\"Council of Anquira\\" in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of canon law, Burchard's Decretum was supplanted around 1150 by the Decretum Gratiani, a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of canon law. Burchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis, a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated. Although the Romans first came to Britain in 55 BC, Roman Law has had negligible influence on English common law. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the lingua franca of the Medieval era. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as res ipsa loquitur, novus actus interveniens, talem qualem,http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195557558.001.0001/acref-9780195557558-e-3249?rskey=0DnFO4&result;=3248 de minimis non curat lex, and consensus ad idem, the common law is not premised on the principles of civil law, and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, Black's Law Dictionary previously included numerous brocards among its entries. Examples ;Actori incumbit onus probatio : \\"On the plaintiff rests the proving\\". The burden of proof falls to the plaintiff, claimant, or petitioner. ;Actio libera in causa : \\"Action committed while intoxicated\\". A person who voluntarily and deliberately gets drunk or causes mental illness in order to commit a crime may under certain circumstances be held liable for that crime even though at the time he commits the prohibited conduct he may be blind-drunk and acting involuntarily. ;Audi alteram partem or audiatur et altera pars : \\"Listen to the other side\\", or \\"let the other side be heard as well\\". Refers to the idea that one cannot be fairly judged unless the cases for and against them have been heard. ;Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur : \\"No one suffers punishment for mere intent.\\" A crime is only committed through some act, not through a mere thought. ;Consensus facit legem : \\"Consensus makes law\\". Stipulates that when two or more persons arrive at a good faith agreement, the law will insist on that agreement being carried out. ;Consuetudo pro lege servatur : \\"Custom is held as law.\\" Where no laws apply to a given situation, the customs of the place and time will have the force of law. ;Contra non valentem agere nulla [or non] currit praescriptio : A statute of limitation does not run against those who cannot act; this is the basis of the American discovery rule limiting prescriptive limitation periods. ;Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos : \\"Whoever's is the soil, all the way to heaven and to the depths is theirs.\\" Used in reference to the rights of property owners to the air above, and land below, their property. ;Delegatus non potest delegare : \\"That which has been delegated cannot delegate further.\\" ;De minimis non curat lex : \\"The law does not concern itself with the smallest things\\". There must be a minimal level of substance or impact in order to bring a legal action. ;Dubia in meliorem partem interpretari debent : \\"Doubtful things should be interpreted in the best way.\\" Often spoken as \\"to give the benefit of the doubt\\". ;Dura lex, sed lex : \\"The law [is] harsh, but [it is] the law.\\" It follows from the principle of the rule of law that even draconian laws must be followed and enforced; if one disagrees with the result, one must seek to change the law. ;Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit : \\"Proof lies on the one who asserts.\\" The concept that one is innocent until proven guilty. ;Ex factis jus oritur : \\"The law arises from the facts.\\" A principle in international law that one must take facts on the ground into account when considering the legality of certain kinds of questions. ;Expressio unius est exclusio alterius : \\"The express mention of one thing excludes all others.\\" When items are listed, anything not explicitly stated is assumed to not be included. ;Ex turpi causa non oritur actio : \\"From a dishonorable cause an action does not arise.\\" A party cannot bring a legal action for consequences of his own illegal act. ;Fiat justitia et pereat mundus : \\"Let there be justice, though the world perish.\\" Often used as a motto, notably by Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. ;Fiat justitia ruat caelum : \\"Let justice be done though the heavens fall.\\" Also sometimes a motto, a legal maxim that justice must be done regardless of the result otherwise. ;Generalia specialibus non derogant : \\"The general does not detract from the specific.\\" Specifies that a certain matter of law be covered by the most specific laws pertaining, in the event that broader laws conflict with the specific one. ;Ignorantia juris non excusat : \\"Ignorance of the law is no excuse.\\" Not knowing that one's actions are forbidden by the law is not a defense. ;In claris non fit interpretatio : \\"In clear things no interpretation is made.\\" When a rule is clearly intelligible, there is no need of proposing a (usually extensive) interpretation. ;Inadimplenti non est adimplendum : \\"One has no need to respect his obligation if the counter-party has not respected his own.\\" This is used in civil law to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) referred to as the synallagmatic contract. ;Inter arma enim silent leges : \\"For among arms, the laws fall silent.\\" A concept that during war, many illegal activities occur. Also taken to mean that in times of war, laws are suppressed, ostensibly for the good of the country. ; Iura novit curia : \\"The court knows the law.\\" Concept that parties to a case do not need to define how the law applies to their case. The court is solely responsible for determining what laws apply. ;Iudex non calculat : \\"The judge does not calculate.\\" A principle that calculation errors made by the court do not invalidate the judgement on a technicality. Also taken to mean that the judge does not tally up the arguments of both sides and decide in favor of the more numerous, but rather weighs all of the evidence without regard to the number of arguments made. ;Leges humanae nascuntur, vivunt, moriuntur : \\"The laws of man are born, live, and die.\\" Illustrates that laws are made, are in force for a period, and then become obsolete. ;Lex posterior derogat priori : \\"Later law removes the earlier.\\" More recent law overrules older ones on the same matter. ;Lex retro non agit : \\"The law does not operate retroactively.\\" A law cannot make something illegal that was legal at the time it was performed. See ex post facto law. ; Lex specialis derogat legi generali : \\"A law governing a specific subject matter overrides a law which only governs general matters.\\" ;Maleficia propositis distinguuntur : \\"Evil acts are distinguished from (evil) purposes\\" citing Jenk. Cent. 290 or \\"crimes are distinguished by evil intent\\".Black's Law Dictionary, 9th edition ;Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans : \\"No one can be heard, who invokes his own guilt.\\" Nobody can bring a case that stems from their own illegal act. ; Nemo dat quod non habet: \\"No one gives what they do not have.\\"http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100228794 The basic rule that a person who does not own property (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true owner's authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of estoppel prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell. ;Nemo debet esse iudex in propria : \\"No one shall be a judge in his own case.\\" In the past it was thought that it included just two rules, namely (1) nemo debet esse iudex in propria causa (no one shall be a judge in his own case). ;Nemo ius ignoratur censetur : \\"Not knowing the law is harmful.\\" Everyone should know the law. This is used in European Law-countries with a history of Roman law; the 'sentence' was first made by Aristotle. ;Nemo judex in sua causa : \\"No one shall be a judge in his own case.\\" Prevents conflict of interest in courts. Often invoked when there is really no conflict, but when there is even the appearance of one. ;Nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet : \\"No one can transfer a greater right than he himself has.\\" A purchaser of stolen goods will not become the rightful owner thereof, since the seller himself was not the owner to begin with. ;Non faciat malum, ut inde veniat bonum : \\"Not to do evil that good may come.\\" Performing some illegal action is not excused by the fact that a positive result came therefrom. Often used to argue that some forms of expression, such as graffiti or pornographic films, cannot be given the protection of law (e.g. copyright) as they are or may be considered illegal or morally reprehensible. ;Nulla poena sine culpa: \\"No punishment without fault.\\" A person can not be punished for a crime that they are not guilty of. ;Nulla poena sine lege or nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali : \\"No penalty without law\\" or \\"no crime, no punishment without a previous penal law\\". (1) One cannot be prosecuted for doing something that is not prohibited by law. (2) One cannot be prosecuted for doing something that was not prohibited by law at the time and place it was committed, notwithstanding laws made since that time. A form of prohibition on retroactive laws. ;Pacta sunt servanda: \\"Agreements are to be kept.\\" Contracts are the law or contracts establish obligations (between those who sign them). ;Par in parem non habet imperium: \\"Equals have no sovereignty over each other.\\" ;Prior tempore potior iure : \\"Earlier in time, stronger in law.\\" A legal principle that older laws take precedence over newer ones. Another name for this principle is lex posterior. ;Prius quam exaudias ne iudices : \\"Before you hear, do not judge.\\" ;Probatio vincit praesumptionem : \\"Proof overcomes presumption.\\" ;Prout patet per recordum : \\"As appears in the record\\". Used to cite something that has already been admitted into the record. It was frequently used in pleadings, generally abbreviated \\"prout &c.;\\", to indicate that a fact was supported by documentary evidence. Failure to use this phrase correctly could be a fatal defect and so cause a case to fail. ;Qui facit per alium facit per se : \\"Who acts through another, acts himself.\\" One who delegates a task to another, takes full responsibility for the performance of that act as if he himself had done it. Basis for the law of agency. ;Quod est necessarium est licitum : \\"What is necessary is lawful.\\" ; Quod non est in registro, non est in Mundo : \\"What is not in the register is not in the world.\\" What is not reported in the (related, referring) registry, has no legal relevance. Used when a formal act (usually a recording or a transcription) is required in order to give consistence, content or efficacy to a right. ;Res ipsa loquitur : \\"The thing speaks for itself.\\" Used in tort law when there is no proof of what caused the harm, but it is most likely only the thing that could have caused the harm. ; Res inter alios acta vel iudicata, aliis nec nocet nec prodocet : What has been agreed/decided between people (a specific group) can neither benefit nor harm a third party (meaning: two or more people cannot agree amongst each other to establish an obligation for a third party who was not involved in the negotiation; furthermore, any benefit that may be established will have to be accepted by the third party before it can be implemented). ;Rex non potest peccare : \\"The king can do no wrong.\\" Used to describe the basis for sovereign immunity. ;Salus populi suprema lex esto : \\"The good of the people shall be the supreme law.\\" Used variously as a motto, a reminder, or a notion of how the law and governments in general should be. ; Sententia quae in rem iudicatam transit, pro veritate habetur : When a definitive sentence is declared, it is considered to be the truth. In the case of a sentence in rem iudicatam (that finally consents to consider a judgement completed), its content will then be the only legally relevant consideration of a fact. ;Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas : \\"Use your property so as not to injure that of your neighbours.\\" While an individual is entitled to the use and enjoyment of one's estate, the right is not without limits. Restrictions can give rise to tort actions including trespass, negligence, and nuisance. ; Solve et repete : \\"Solve and resume.\\" Respect your obligation first, then you can ask for reimbursement. Used in those situations in which one of the two (or more) parties needs to complete his obligation before being allowed to ask for the opposite obligation to be respected by his counter party. Usually this principle is used in fields and subjects in which a certain general steadiness or uniformity of the system has been considered a relevant value by the legislator. The case is typical of service contracts with repeated obligations (like with gas, water, electricity providers and similars), in which irregularities on one side cannot be balanced if not in a regular situation (i.e., of payments) on the other side. The customer, for example, might be asked to pay regularly the new bill, before contesting the previous one in which he found irregular calculations, and asking for a balancement with newer bills; he thus cannot by himself determine a discount in the next payment. ; Ubi lex voluit, dixit; ubi noluit, tacuit : \\"When the law wills, it speaks; when it does not will, it is silent.\\" When the law wants to regulate a matter in further detail, it does regulate the matter; when it does not want to regulate a matter in further detail, it remained silent (in the interpretation of a law, an excessively expansive interpretation might perhaps go beyond the intention of the legislator, thus we must adhere to what is in the text of the law and draw no material consequences from the law's silence). ;Ultra posse nemo obligatur : \\"No one is obligated (to do) more than he can.\\" Specifies that one should do what he can to support the community, but since everyone has different levels of ability, it cannot be expected that all will perform the same. ;Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit : \\"Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping.\\" Concept that if an opposing party unreasonably delays bringing an action, that it is no longer considered just to hear their claim, due to fundamental changes in circumstance brought on by their delay. ;Volenti non fit injuria : \\"Injury is not done to the willing.\\" Notion that a person cannot bring a claim against another for injury, if said person willingly placed themselves in a situation where they knew injury could result.

While there is no scientifically accepted definition of the term \\"breed\\",The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. 2007 a breed is generally defined as having distinct true-breeding characteristics over a number of generations. Its members may be called \\"purebred\\". In most cases, bloodlines of horse breeds are recorded with a breed registry. The concept is somewhat flexible in horses, as open stud books are created for developing horse breeds that are not yet fully true-breeding. Registries also are considered the authority as to whether a given breed is listed as a \\"horse\\" or a \\"pony\\". There are also a number of \\"color breed\\", sport horse, and gaited horse registries for horses with various phenotypes or other traits, which admit any animal fitting a given set of physical characteristics, even if there is little or no evidence of the trait being a true-breeding characteristic. Other recording entities or specialty organizations may recognize horses from multiple breeds, thus, for the purposes of this article, such animals are classified as a \\"type\\" rather than a \\"breed\\". The breeds and types listed here are those that already have a Wikipedia article. For a more extensive list, see the List of all horse breeds in DAD-IS. For additional information, see horse breed, horse breeding, and the individual articles listed below. Additional articles may be listed under :Horse breeds and :Types of horse.  Horse breeds  In some cultures and for some competition-sanctioning organizations, a horse that normally matures less than about when fully grown may be classified as a \\"pony\\". Unless the principal breed registry or breed standard describes the breed as a pony, it is listed in this section, even if some or all representatives are small or have some pony characteristics. Ponies are listed in the section below. = A‚ÄìC = = D-K = = L-R = = S-Z =  Pony breeds  If a breed is described as a \\"pony\\" by the breed standard or principal breed registry, it is listed in this section, even if some individuals have horse characteristics. All other breeds are listed in the section above. (Because of this designation by the preference of a given breed registry, most miniature horse breeds are listed as \\"horses,\\" not ponies.) = A-K = = L-Z =  Color \\"breeds\\"  There are some registries that accept horses (and sometimes ponies and mules) of almost any breed or type for registration. Color is either the only criterion for registration or the primary criterion. These are called \\"color breeds,\\" because unlike \\"true\\" horse breeds, there are few other physical requirements, nor is the stud book limited in any fashion. As a general rule, the color also does not always breed on (in some cases due to genetic impossibility), and offspring without the stated color are usually not eligible for recording with the color breed registry. There are breeds that have color that usually breeds \\"true\\" as well as distinctive physical characteristics and a limited stud book. These horses are true breeds that have a preferred color, not color breeds, and include the Friesian horse, the Cleveland Bay, the Appaloosa, and the American Paint Horse. The best-known \\"color breed\\" registries that accept horses from many different breeds are for the following colors: * Buckskin: a color which cannot breed \\"true\\" due to the cream gene which creates it being an incomplete dominant * Palomino: a color which cannot breed \\"true\\" due to the cream gene which creates it being an incomplete dominant * Pinto: there exists a registry for Pinto-colored horses of varying breeds, distinct from the American Paint Horse registry, though some qualifying horses may be registered in both. * White: some of these animals are registered in the United States with the American creme and white horse registry, which was once called an \\"Albino\\" registry until it was understood that true albino does not exist in horses. (see White (horse) and Dominant white for details)  Types of horse  A \\"type\\" of horse is not a breed but is used here to categorize groups of horses or horse breeds that are similar in appearance (phenotype) or use. A type usually has no breed registry, and often encompasses several breeds. However, in some nations, particularly in Europe, there is a recording method or means of studbook selection for certain types to allow them to be licensed for breeding. Horses of a given type may be registered as one of several different recognized breeds, or a grouping may include horses that are of no particular pedigree but meet a certain standard of appearance or use. = Modern types = = Archaic types = Prior to approximately the 13th century, few pedigrees were written down, and horses were classified by physical type or use. Thus, many terms for Horses in the Middle Ages did not refer to breeds as we know them today, but rather described appearance or purpose. These terms included: *Charger, see Courser (horse) *Courser (horse) *Destrier or \\"Great Horse\\" *Hobby, see Irish Hobby *Jennet, sometimes called Spanish Jennet *Palfrey *Rouncey *Steppe horse, refers to various domesticated horse and wild horse species, particularly those from Siberia and other parts of western Asia  Extinct subspecies and breeds  These members of equus ferus either were a recognized, distinct breed of horse that no longer exists as such, or subspecies that have become extinct at some point since domestication of the horse. This section does not include any species within evolution of the horse prior to modern Equus ferus caballus. =Extinct subspecies= * Tarpan = Early prototypes = Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes, labeled the \\"Tarpan\\", \\"Forest horse\\", Draft and \\"Oriental\\", each of which was hypothesized to have adapted to their environment prior to domestication.Bennett, Conquerors, p.7 However, more recent studies suggest that all domesticated horses originated from a single wild species and that the different body types of horses were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication,Edwards, G. The Arabian, pp 1, 3 or possibly landrace adaptation. = Extinct breeds = These were human-developed breeds which no longer exist.

Description  Explosive blasts expand directly away from, and perpendicular to, the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (i.e. most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be reflected in the direction away from the mass.Practical Bomb Scene Investigation, James T.

Jus soli was part of the English common law, in contrast to jus sanguinis, which derives from the Roman law that influenced the civil-law systems of continental Europe.Ayelet Shachar, The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 120.Rey Koslowski, Migrants and Citizens: Demographic Change in the European State System (Cornell University Press, 2000), p. 77. Jus soli is the predominant rule in the Americas, but it is rare elsewhere. Since the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was enacted in 2004, no European country grants citizenship based on unconditional or near-unconditional jus soli. Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of jus sanguinis (\\"right of blood\\"), in which citizenship is inherited through parents rather than birthplace, or a restricted version of jus soli in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants. Jus soli in many cases helps prevent statelessness.Lung-chu Chen, An Introduction to Contemporary International Law: A Policy-Oriented Perspective (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 223. Countries that have acceded to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness are obligated to grant nationality to persons born in their territory who would otherwise become stateless persons.Ivan Shearer & Brian Opeskin, \\"Nationality and Statelessness\\" Foundations of International Migration Law (eds. Brian Opeskin, Richard Perruchoud & Jillyanne Redpath-Cross: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 99. The American Convention on Human Rights similarly provides that \\"Every person has the right to the nationality of the state in whose territory he was born if he does not have the right to any other nationality.\\"  National laws  Lex soli is a law used in practice to regulate who and under what circumstances an individual can assert the right of jus soli. Most states provide a specific lex soli‚Äîin application of the respective jus soli‚Äîand it is the most common means of acquiring nationality. However, a frequent exception to lex soli is imposed when a child is born to a parent in the diplomatic or consular service of another state on a mission to the state in question.Guimezanes, Nicole. \\"What Laws for Naturalisation?\\" The OECD Observer.

Jus soli has been restricted in the following countries: = Africa = * : According to Article 4 of the Nationality Law of the Arab Republic of Egypt, children born in Egypt gain citizenship at birth if their father was also born in Egypt. * : A person who was born in Morocco to parents also born in Morocco and whose immigration is legal, can register as a Moroccan two years prior to becoming adult. * : A person born in Namibia to a Namibian citizen parent or a foreign parent who is ordinarily resident in Namibia, is a Namibian citizen at birth (see Namibian nationality law). * : Since 6 October 1995, a person born in South Africa to South African citizens or permanent residents is automatically granted South African citizenship (see South African nationality law). * : A person born before 1994 gains Sudanese nationality at birth if his father was also born in Sudan. If his father was not born in Sudan, he can apply to the Minister to be granted Sudanese nationality. * : Individuals born in Tunisia are citizens by birth if their father and grandfather were born in Tunisia. Additionally, the person must declare before becoming an adult (20 years) that he wants to be a citizen. = Americas = * : The constitution was amended on 26 January 2010. The amendment broadened the definition of the 2004 migration law ‚Äì which excluded from citizenship children born to individuals that were \\"in transit\\" ‚Äì to include \\"non-residents\\" (including individuals with expired residency visas and undocumented workers). = Asia = * : Children born to a foreign father with valid residency permits who himself was born in Bahrain have right to citizenship. * : In 1996, Cambodia changed the law to only grant citizenship to children born to foreign parents living legally in the Kingdom of Cambodia (under Article 4(2)(a) of the 1996 Nationality Law).Law on Nationality of 20 August 1996 (unofficial translation) published by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees CHAPTER II KHMER NATIONALITY/CITIZENSHIP BY BIRTH Promulgated on 9 October 1996, \\"...shall obtain Khmer nationality/citizenship, by having been born in the Kingdom of Cambodia: a. any child who is born from a foreign mother and father (parents) who were born and living legally in the Kingdom of Cambodia.\\" * India: A person that was born in India from 26 January 1950 until 1 July 1987 is a citizen by birth, regardless of the parents' nationality. It began to be restricted in 1987. As of 2020, a person born in India is a citizen if at least one parent is a citizen, and the other parent is a citizen or a legal migrant. These measures were brought in largely in reaction to illegal migration from Bangladesh. * : A person born in Malaysia on or after 16 September 1963 with at least one parent being a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident is automatically a Malaysian citizen (see Malaysian nationality law). * Hong Kong: Since the July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, most political rights and eligibility for most benefits are conferred to permanent residents regardless of citizenship. Conversely, PRC citizens who are not permanent residents (such as residents of Mainland China and Macao) are not conferred these rights and privileges. The Basic Law provides that all citizens of the People's Republic of China (PRC) born in the territory are permanent residents of the territory and have the right of abode in Hong Kong. The 2001 case Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen clarified that the parents need not have right of abode and as a consequence many women from Mainland China began coming to Hong Kong to give birth. By 2008, the number of babies in the territory born to Mainland China mothers had grown to twenty-five times the number five years prior. Furthermore, persons of Chinese ethnicity (wholly or partly) born in Hong Kong are PRC citizens with permanent residence, even if their parents are non-PRC citizens (e.g. overseas-born Chinese). Non-PRC citizens born to non- PRC citizen permanent resident parents in Hong Kong also receive permanent residence at birth. Other persons must have \\"ordinarily resided\\" in Hong Kong for seven continuous years in order to gain permanent residence (Articles 24(2) and 24(5)). * : Thailand operated a system of pure jus soli prior to 1972. Due to illegal immigration from Burma, the Nationality Act was amended to require that both parents be legally resident and domiciled in Thailand for at least five years for their child to be granted Thai citizenship at birth. Furthermore, someone who has Thai citizenship by sole virtue of jus soli may be stripped of Thai citizenship under various conditions (such as living abroad), which does not apply to people who have Thai citizenship by virtue of jus sanguinis. * : Article 976(4) of the Civil Code of Iran grants citizenship at birth to persons born in Iran of foreign parents if one or both of the parents were themselves born in Iran. See Iranian nationality law. * : Children born in Israel who have never acquired another citizenship are eligible to apply for Israeli citizenship between their 18th and 21st birthday if they have lived in Israel for over 5 years (see Israeli citizenship law). = Europe = * : Children born in France (including overseas territories) to at least one parent who is either (i) a French citizen or (ii) born in France, automatically acquire French citizenship at birth. Children born to foreign parents who do not fulfil either of these two conditions may acquire citizenship from age 13 subject to residence conditions (see French nationality law). A child born in France to foreign parents becomes a French citizen automatically upon turning 18, provided that they reside in France on their 18th birthday and have had their primary residence in France for a total (but not necessarily continuous) period of at least 5 years since the age of 11. * : prior to 2000 Germany's nationality law was based entirely on jus sanguinis, but now children born in Germany on or after 1 January 2000 to non- German parents acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit (and had this status for at least three years) and resided in Germany for at least eight years prior to the child's birth. However, jus soli citizens will lose their German citizenship upon turning 23 unless they: (i) reside in Germany for at least 8 years during their first 21 years of life; or (ii) attend school in Germany for at least 6 years; or (iii) graduate from high school/college in Germany; or (iv) complete professional/vocational training in Germany. * Greece: Apart from regulations in past and historic nationality laws of Greece granting nationality jus soli,e.g., child born in Greece to alien parents after coming of age (Nationality law of 1835, Article 2), child born in Greece of unknown father and mother (Greek Civil Law of 1856, Article 14, Paragraph c), child born in Greece and not automatically acquiring another nationality (Greek Nationality Code of 1955, Article 1, Paragraph d) Greek Nationality Code of 2004 states that \\"A person born in Greek territory acquires by birth the Greek nationality if not acquiring alien nationality or is of unknown nationality\\". Additionally, as from 2015's amendment of 2004 Cod (Law 4332 of 2015, G.G. A/76/9 July 2015), a child born in Greece by foreign parents, shall acquire the right of Greek nationality with a combination of preliminary school attendance and parents' legal residence in Greece (5 years, 10 if the child is born prior to 5 years of legal residence).\\"Article 1 A child of foreigner parents born in Greece acquires the right to Greek nationality under the following preconditions: a) He/she has enrolled in the first grade of elementary school and is still attending Greek school at the time the application-declaration of paragraph 2 is being lodged. b) One of their parents has been living legally and continuously for at least five (5) years in the country before the child was born. In case the child was born before this five year period had been completed, then the necessary period of legal and continuous residence of the parents is extended to ten (10) years.\\" See, Law 4332 of 2015 One year after the implementation of the law (as from July 2016), 6,029 children had been granted Greek nationality, out of 27,720 submitted applications. * : On 1 January 2005, the law was amended to require that at least one of the parents be an Irish citizen; a British citizen; a resident with a permanent right to reside in Ireland or in Northern Ireland; or a legal resident residing three of the last four years in the country (excluding students and asylum seekers) (see Irish nationality law). The amendment was prompted by the case of Man Chen, a Chinese woman living in mainland United Kingdom who travelled to Belfast (Northern Ireland, part of the UK) to give birth in order to benefit from the previous rule whereby anyone born on any part of the island of Ireland was automatically granted Irish citizenship. The Chinese parents used their daughter's Irish (and thereby European Union) citizenship to obtain permanent residence in the UK as parents of a dependent EU citizen. Ireland was the last country in Europe to abolish unrestricted jus soli. (see Irish nationality law). * : A person born in Luxembourg is automatically a Luxembourg citizen if at least one of their parents was also born in Luxembourg. Additionally, a person born in Luxembourg to foreign, non-Luxembourg-born parents can become a Luxembourg citizen from the age of 12 if they have resided uninterrupted in Luxembourg for at least 5 years immediately prior to submitting the application, and if at least one of their parents lived in Luxembourg uninterrupted for at least 12 months immediately preceding their birth. Furthermore, a person born in Luxembourg to foreign, non-Luxembourg-born parents gains Luxembourg citizenship automatically upon reaching the age of 18, provided that they have lived uninterrupted in Luxembourg for the preceding 5 years and at least one of their parents lived uninterrupted in Luxembourg for at least 12 months immediately preceding their birth. * : A child born in Portuguese territory to who does not possess another nationality is a Portuguese citizen. Also, a person born to foreign parents who were not serving their respective States at the time of birth is a Portuguese citizen if the person declares that they want to be Portuguese and provided that one of the parents has legally resided in Portugal for at least two years at the time of birth. * : A child born in Spain to foreign parents may acquire Spanish citizenship jus soli if either one of the parents was also born in Spain or neither of the parents can transmit their nationality to the child (such as stateless parents). * : Since 1 January 1983, at least one parent must be a British citizen or be legally \\"settled\\" in the country or upon the 10th birthday of the child regardless of their parent's citizenship status (see British nationality law). * : A person born in Malta on or after 1 August 2001 is automatically a Maltese citizen if at least one of their parents is Maltese or was born in Malta. Anyone born in Malta before 1 August 2001, regardless of their parents' circumstances, is automatically a Maltese citizen, as the country conferred unconditional jus soli until this date (see Maltese nationality law). = Oceania = * : Since 20 August 1986, a person born in Australia acquires Australian citizenship by birth only if at least one parent was an Australian citizen or permanent resident; or else after living the first ten years of their life in Australia, regardless of their parent's citizenship status (see Australian nationality law). * : Since 1 January 2006, a person born in New Zealand acquires New Zealand citizenship by birth only if at least one parent was a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident (includes Australian citizens and Permanent Residents) (see New Zealand nationality law), or if to prevent being stateless. * (): As mentioned above, people born in American Samoa do not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth, unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen.  Abolition of jus soli  Some countries that formerly observed jus soli have moved to abolish it entirely, conferring citizenship on children born in the country only if at least one of the parents is a citizen of that country. * Malta: Changed the principle of citizenship to jus sanguinis on 1 August 1989 in a move that also relaxed restrictions against multiple citizenship. However, anyone born in Malta before 1 August 2001 falls under unconditional jus soli and is a Maltese citizen.

Children at birth may be citizens of a particular state if either or both of their parents have citizenship of that state. It may also apply to national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins. Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a diaspora and were not themselves citizens of the state conferring citizenship. This principle contrasts with jus soli (\\"right of soil\\"), which is solely based on the place of birth. Today, almost all states apply some combination of jus soli and jus sanguinis in their nationality laws to varying degrees, one exception being the Vatican City State. The most common application of jus sanguinis is a right of a child to his / her father‚Äôs nationality. Some countries extend this right on an equal basis to the mother. Some apply this right irrespective of the place of birth, while others may limit to those born in the state. Some countries provide that a child acquires the nationality of the mother if the father is unknown or stateless, and some irrespective of the place of birth. Some such children may acquire the nationality automatically while others may need to apply for a parent‚Äôs nationality. Modern development At the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as Ernest Renan, oppose the German conception, exemplified by Johann Fichte, who believed in an \\"objective nationality\\", based on blood, race or language. Renan's republican conception, but perhaps also the presence of a German-speaking population in Alsace- Lorraine, explains France's early adoption of jus soli. =Mixed standards= Many nations have a mixture of jus sanguinis and jus soli, including the United States, Canada, Israel, Greece, the Republic of Ireland, and recently Germany. Today French nationality law narrowly applies jus sanguinis, but it is still the most common means of passing on citizenship in many continental European nations. =Complications due to imposed boundaries= Some modern European states which arose out of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian or Ottoman empires have huge numbers of ethnic populations outside of their new 'national' boundaries, as do most of the former Soviet states. Such long- standing diasporas do not conform to codified 20th-century European rules of citizenship. In many cases, jus sanguinis rights are mandated by international treaty, with citizenship definitions imposed by the international community. In other cases, minorities are subject to legal and extra-legal persecution and choose to immigrate to their ancestral home country. States offering jus sanguinis rights to ethnic citizens and their descendants include Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Armenia and Romania. Each is required by international treaty to extend those rights. Jus sanguinis states today * : Austrian nationality law * : Armenian nationality law * : Under Canadian nationality law any person born to a Canadian-citizen parent is automatically a Canadian citizen. An exception to this was introduced in 2009 to limit citizenship by descent to one generation born outside Canada: those born outside Canada within one generation of a native-born or naturalized citizen parent are Canadian citizens by descent, but their children are no longer granted citizenship by descent. * : Chilean nationality law *: Nationality law of the People's Republic of China * : Colombian nationality law * : under Czech nationality law, children and some grandchildren of citizens automatically receive citizenship regardless of birth location * : Danish nationality law * : According to the Dominican constitution, a child born abroad, to at least one of whose parents is a Dominican, is a citizen. *: Article 8 of the Estonian Constitution states that every child with at least one parent who is an Estonian citizen shall have the right, by birth, to Estonian citizenship. * : Finnish nationality law * : French nationality law *: German nationality law. Any person born to a German-citizen parent is a German citizen. However, this is not the case for children born abroad if their German parent(s) was / were born abroad after 31 December 1999 and do(es) not have their primary residence in Germany: the child is not automatically a German citizen by birth, but can acquire German citizenship as long as their German parent(s) register(s) their birth with the responsible German diplomatic mission within one year of the child's birth. This limitation does not apply if the child would otherwise be stateless or if one foreign-born German parent was born on or before 31 December 1999. Thus, the German citizenship of future generations born abroad can be preserved by having each child's birth registered with the German diplomatic mission within one year of birth. Furthermore, Article 116(1) of the German Basic Law confers, within the confines of the laws regulating the details, a right to citizenship upon any person who is admitted to Germany (in its borders of 1937) as \\"refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person.\\" At one time, ethnic Germans living abroad in a country in the former Eastern Bloc (Aussiedler) could obtain citizenship through a virtually automatic procedure.The Federal Expellee Law (), ¬ß 6, specifies that also foreign citizens of states of the Eastern Bloc (and their desdendants), who were persecuted between 1945 and 1990 for their German ethnicity by their respective governments, are entitled to become Germans. The argument was that the Federal Republic of Germany had to administer to their needs because the respective governments in charge of guaranteeing their equal treatment as citizens severely neglected or contravened that obligation. Since 1990 the law has been steadily tightened to limit the number of immigrants each year. It now requires immigrants to prove language skills and cultural affiliation. Article 116(2) entitles persons (and their descendants) who were denaturalised by the Nazi government, to be renaturalised if they wish. Those among them who took their residence in Germany after 8 May 1945, are automatically to be considered German. Both paragraphs (1) and (2) result in a considerable number of Poles and Israelis, residing in Poland and Israel respectively, being concurrently German. *: Every child born to a Haitian father or mother, no matter where he or she was born, is Haitian by the Haitian Constitution. This has been a big issue in the current Dominican nationality law; because of this and other factors, illegal migrants' children born in the DR of Haitian origin are considered non-Dominicans, and therefore Haitians. *: Hungarian nationality law. A person acquires Hungarian citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a Hungarian citizen. The place of birth is irrelevant. Furthermore, Section 4(3) of the Act on Nationality permits ethnic Hungarians (defined as persons \\"at least one of whose relatives in ascendant line was a Hungarian citizen\\") to obtain citizenship on preferential terms after one year of residence. In addition, the \\"Status Law\\" of 2001 grants certain privileges to ethnic Hungarians living in territories that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It permits them to obtain an identification card but does not confer the right to full Hungarian citizenship. According to the latest Citizenship Law adopted in 2010, anybody, possessing certain evidence (certificates, documents) of his or her Hungarian roots from around the World can apply for Hungarian citizenship. The interview is led in Hungarian either in Hungary or at one of the Consulates abroad. * : Icelandic nationality law *: A child born in India must have at least one parent who is an Indian citizen to be conferred citizenship. Earlier, people born in India were given citizenship regardless of the citizenship held by parents, but this was changed on 3 December 2004. Persons with at least one Indian grandparent may apply for a Person of Indian Origin card, provided that neither the applicant nor any ancestor has ever been a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, or China. The government may add other countries to the list. This card is a travel document and permits the holder to enter and stay in India without a visa, work, start a business, own land, and attend educational institutions, but it does not give the right to vote or hold office. In addition, persons of Indian origin who are nationals of countries not on the list may apply for Overseas citizenship of India, which confers similar rights and also permits the holder to apply for full Indian nationality after one year of residence. *: Under Irish nationality law, any person with a parent born on the island of Ireland (including Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom) is automatically an Irish citizen. Anyone with a grandparent (but not a parent) born on the island of Ireland can become an Irish citizen by registering in the Foreign Births Register at an Irish embassy or consular office, or at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin. Such an individual may also pass their entitlement to Irish citizenship on to their children by registering in the Foreign Births Register, provided that they do so before the birth of those children. Thus, the Irish citizenship of future generations born abroad can be preserved as long as the youngest generation registers onto the Foreign Births Register before having any children. The minister may also waive the usual requirements for naturalisation as an Irish citizen for those of \\"Irish descent or Irish associations\\", although this power is rarely used. *: According to the Iranian nationality law the following people are considered to be Iranian subjects: (1) All people residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such people is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the Iranian Government. (2) Those born in Iran or outside whose fathers are Iranian. (3) Those born in Iran of unknown parentage.(4) People born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran. (5) People born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband. (7) Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality. *: Israeli nationality law confers citizenship upon all children of Israeli citizens born in Israel, as well as the first generation of descendants of Israeli expatriates living abroad. *: Italian nationality law *: Japanese nationality law *: According to Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 a person becomes a citizen by birth if on the day of the person birth either parent is a citizen of Kenya *: Maltese nationality law grants citizenship to any person descended from \\"an ascendant who was born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta.\\" * The Mexican Constitution (Article 30) indicates that Mexicans are also persons born abroad, to a parent or parents who at that time were Mexicans born in Mexican territory. Also, a person born abroad is also Mexican, if at the time of birth either or both parents were Mexicans by naturalization. Mexico‚Äôs Constitution considers them Mexicans by birth. *: Mongolian nationality law allows citizens to gain citizenship if one parent is a Mongolian. * : Dutch nationality law * : Norwegian nationality law * : According to the Nigerian Constitution, Chapter 3, section 25 1C *: The Philippine nationality law is based upon the principles of jus sanguinis and therefore descent from a parent who is a citizen or national of the Philippines is the primary method of acquiring Philippine citizenship. *: The definition of Polish citizenship has been based for years on article 34 of the Polish Constitution; this article is based on a jus sanguinis right to citizenship.English translation of the Polish Constitution. Moreover, any child born by Polish parent(s) is a de jure citizen of Poland. In 1967‚Äì1968 the Communist State issued to Jews emigrating from Poland to Israel, instead of passports, a so-called travel document which granted them the right to exit Poland but not of re-entering it, in effect taking away their Polish citizenship on the assumption that, in emigrating or traveling to Israel, they renounced it themselves. In a 2005 verdict, the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland ruled that this action was illegal based on the state of law at that time. Consequently, it is now assumed the Jews who emigrated after 1968 have remained Polish citizens and their citizenship will be certified on request. * : Romanian nationality law *: Persons with at least one Slovak grandparent and \\"Slovak cultural and language awareness\\" may apply for an expatriate identity card entitling them to live, work, study and own land in Slovakia. Expatriate status is not full citizenship and does not entitle the holder to vote, but a holder who moves his or her domicile to Slovakia may obtain citizenship under preferential terms. Slovakia grants full Slovak citizenship to children of Slovak parents (one or both parents) irrespective of the place of birth. *: South Korean nationality law * : Swedish nationality law *: Swiss nationality law is exceptionally restrictive: someone who was born in Switzerland and has spent their entire life there has no automatic right to Swiss citizenship if neither of their parents are Swiss citizens, even if their parents are permanent residents or have themselves spent their entire lives in Switzerland. In fact, the citizenship criteria are simpler for a foreigner with no previous ties to Switzerland who marries a Swiss citizen, than for people born and raised in Switzerland but with foreign parents. Due to Switzerland's high immigrant population, there are more than a million people who were born and have spent their entire lives in Switzerland but are not Swiss citizens due to their parents being immigrants. Some Swiss-born third-generation immigrants even have Swiss-born parents but are not Swiss citizens if neither of their parents have naturalised. To obtain Swiss citizenship, people in this position must undergo naturalisation proceedings, which have a high bar to satisfy the \\"integration\\" criterion. The unusual rules hit international headlines in 2017 when a woman born in Switzerland to Turkish parents, who is a native Swiss- German speaker and has spent her entire life in Switzerland, had her citizenship application denied by the local municipality on \\"integration\\" grounds as she could not name enough Swiss mountains, cheeses and retail brands, and was deemed not to have gone skiing often enough. The decision was overruled by the cantonal government several months later. In 2017, Swiss voters in a nationwide referendum agreed to relax the citizenship criteria for third-generation immigrants slightly: although they will still not be Swiss citizens at birth and will need to apply for citizenship, they will no longer have to take naturalisation tests or interviews if their parents and grandparents are long-time permanent residents. *: Thai nationality law *:Taiwan nationality act Article 2: A person shall have the nationality of the ROC under any of the conditions provided by the following Subparagraphs:1. His/her father or mother was a national of the ROC when he/she was born. *: When one of the parents is Tunisian, a child is considered Tunisian regardless of the child‚Äôs place of birth or whether the child has acquired the nationality of another country. Children with at least one Tunisian parent, no matter where they are born, are considered Tunisian citizens, and must travel to and from Tunisia only with a Tunisian passport. *: Article 8 of the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine permits any person with at least one Ukrainian grandparent to become a citizen upon renunciation of the former nationality. *: Emirati nationality law is covered by United Arab Emirates (UAE) federal law No. 17 of year 1972 which states a child born to at least one parent who is an Emirati citizen is an Emirati national by descent. *: By birth abroad, which constitutes \\"by descent\\" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad. (British nationality law) *: United States nationality law states that a child born abroad is given United States citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a citizen or national, subject to certain conditions. *: Articles 32 to 42 of the Constitution of Venezuela. Leges sanguinis states today Many countries provide citizenship on preferential terms to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (so- called leges sanguinis): *: Connection to the Afghan diaspora. There have been controversial proposals to people of Pashtun origin. *: Article 14 of the Constitution of Armenia (1995) provides that \\"individuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure.\\" This provision is consistent with the Declaration on Independence of Armenia, issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that \\"Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia\\". *: Article 25 of the 1991 constitution specifies that a \\"person of Bulgarian origin shall acquire Bulgarian citizenship through a facilitated procedure.\\" Article 15 of the Law on Bulgarian Citizenship provides that an individual \\"of Bulgarian origin\\" (ethnicity) may be naturalized without any waiting period and without having to show a source of income, knowledge of the Bulgarian language, or renunciation of his former citizenship. This approach has been a tradition since the new constitutional foundation of Bulgaria in 1879, following the liberation from Ottoman yoke in 1878, when large numbers of ethnic Bulgarians remained outside of the state borders. Bulgaria and Greece were subject to a population exchange following the Second Balkan War. The conditions of the treaty settlement mandated that they accept individuals claiming respective ethnic origin. *: Article 11 of the Law on Croatian Citizenship allows emigrants and their descendants to acquire Croatian nationality upon return, without passing a language examination or renouncing former citizenship. In addition, Article 16 allows ethnic Croats living outside Croatia to \\"acquire Croatian citizenship\\" by making a written declaration and by submitting proof of attachment to Croatian culture. *: Finnish law provides a right of return to ethnic Finns from the former Soviet Union, including Ingrians. Applicants must now pass an examination in one of the official languages of the country, Finnish or Swedish. Certain persons of Finnish descent who live outside the former Soviet Union also have the right to establish permanent residency, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship. *: Article 116(1) of the German Basic Law confers, subject to laws regulating the details, a right to citizenship for anyone admitted to Germany within it's 1937 borders as a \\"refugee or expelled of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person.\\"https://www.legislationline.org/download/id/5922/file/Germany_Basic%20Law_2012_en.pdf#:~:text=(1)%20No%20German%20may%20be,become%20stateless%20as%20a%20result. Until 1990, ethnic Germans from the Eastern bloc could obtain citizenship through a virtually automatic procedure, but since then the law was tightened, requiring applicants to prove German language skills and cultural affiliation. *: Ethnic Greeks can obtain Greek citizenship by two methods under the Code of Greek Nationality. Article 5 allows ethnic Greeks who are stateless (which, in practice, includes those who voluntarily renounce their nationality) to obtain citizenship upon application to a Greek consular official. In addition, ethnic Greeks who join the armed forces acquire automatic citizenship by operation of Article 10, with the military oath taking the place of the citizenship oath. This position arises from the fact that approximately 85% of known ethnic Greeks were outside the boundaries when the country was formed, and 40% remained outside the final boundaries at the beginning of World War I. Most were de jure stripped of their host country citizenship with the outbreak of war if the host country was at war with Greece. In the late 19th century, Greece had a wider diaspora because of poverty and limited opportunities. (See Greek nationality law). * While the child or a grandchild of an Irish citizen born in Ireland is entitled to Irish citizenship, Section 16(a) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act permits the Minister of Justice, at their discretion, to waive the residence requirements for a person \\"of Irish descent or associations\\". *: The Law of Return offers citizenship to Jews wishing to immigrate, as well as non-Jews with at least one Jewish grandparent (see Who is a Jew under the Law of Return?) and spouses of Jews. Exceptions can be made for those considered by the Minister of Interior to be a threat to the welfare or security of the state. While those with sufficient Jewish ancestry to qualify for the Law of Return who grew up with a religion other than Judaism and secular Jews are eligible to immigrate to Israel, Jews who voluntarily convert to another religion are not. Converts to Judaism who wish to immigrate to Israel are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the Israeli Interior Ministry, which determines whether the conversion was sincere in its view.https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-after-conversion-to-judaism/ Israeli law also recognizes the descendants of Israeli emigrants living abroad as Israelis; this applies only to the first generation born abroad. Non-Jews can become naturalized after five years of residency and acquisition of a basic knowledge of Hebrew. *: The nationality law of Italy bestows citizenship jure sanguinis. There is no limit of generations for the citizenship via blood. However, the first citizens of the modern Italian state were alive on 17 March 1861 when the state was officially formed, and for this reason all claims of Italian citizenship by jure sanguinis must stem from an ancestor who was living after 16 March 1861. Each descendant of the ancestor through whom citizenship is claimed jure sanguinis could pass Italian citizenship to the next generation only if this descendant was entitled to Italian citizenship at the time of the birth of the next person in the line. So if any person in the line lost the Italian citizenship and then had a child, that child did not inherit Italian citizenship jure sanguinis, except if the child could inherit the citizenship from the other parent. Cases of dual citizenship were possible, which is to say, for example, that a person in the line could have had Italian and Canadian citizenship concurrently. Minor children of Italian citizens were at risk of losing Italian citizenship if the child's parent naturalized in another country, unless the child was subject to an exception to this risk‚Äîand children born and residing in a country where they held dual citizenship by jus soli were subject to such an exception since 1 July 1912. Until 1 January 1948, Italian law did not generally permit women to pass on citizenship. Persons born before that date are in most cases not Italian citizens jure sanguinis if their line of descent from an Italian citizen depends on a female at some point before 1948. On several occasions, this limitation of deriving Italian citizenship only from fathers before 1948 has been successfully challenged in court. *: Articles 19 and 23 of the constitution provides, \\"Every person of I-Kiribati descent... shall... become or have and continue to have thereafter the right to become a citizen of Kiribati.... Every person of I-Kiribati descent who does not become a citizen of Kiribati on Independence Day... shall, at any time thereafter, be entitled upon making application in such manner as may be prescribed to be registered as a citizen of Kiribati.\\" *: the Liberian constitution allows only Negros (regardless of cultural or national affiliation) to become citizens, though people of other races may live in Liberia as permanent residents. *: The Constitution of Lithuania grants a right to citizenship to foreigners of ethnic Lithuanian origins. *: The Burma Citizenship Law of 1982 states: \\"Nationals such as the Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine or Shan and ethnic groups as have settled in any of the territories included within the State as their permanent home from a period anterior to 1185 B.E., 1823 A.D. are Burma citizens.\\" https://www.scribd.com/doc/188517608/The-1982-Burmese-Nationality-Law-Myanmar- Version *: The Rwandan constitution provides that \\"[a]ll persons originating from Rwanda and their descendants shall, upon their request, be entitled to Rwandan nationality.\\" *: Article 23 of the 2004 citizenship law provides that the descendants of emigrants from Serbia, or ethnic Serbs residing abroad, may take up citizenship upon written declaration. *: A Spanish law passed in 2015 allows individuals who can prove descent from the Sephardic Jews who were exiled in 1492 following the Alhambra Decree and who can show a \\"special link\\" to Spain to apply for dual citizenship. Spain had previously allowed application for such individuals but had required that they give up their citizenship from their other country. The new law has no such requirement. *: South Korean nationality law grants special status to ethnic Koreans and their descendants in the Korean diaspora. Under the Constitution of South Korea, North Korea is part of the Republic of Korea. Therefore, North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. All North Koreans of good conduct are granted citizenship upon arrival to South Korea. *: Turkish law allows people of Turkish origin and their spouse and children, to apply for naturalization without the five-year waiting period applicable to other immigrants. Turkey and Greece reciprocally expelled their minorities in the early 1920s after World War I.

of the classical tradition, best known for his social action theory and structural functionalism. Parsons is considered one of the most influential figures in sociology in the 20th century. After earning a PhD in economics, he served on the faculty at Harvard University from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was among the first professors in its new sociology department. Later, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Department of Social Relations at Harvard. Based on empirical data, Parsons' social action theory was the first broad, systematic, and generalizable theory of social systems developed in the United States and Europe. Some of Parsons' largest contributions to sociology in the English-speaking world were his translations of Max Weber's work and his analyses of works by Weber, √âmile Durkheim, and Vilfredo Pareto. Their work heavily influenced Parsons' view and was the foundation for his social action theory. Parsons viewed voluntaristic action through the lens of the cultural values and social structures that constrain choices and ultimately determine all social actions, as opposed to actions that are determined based on internal psychological processes. Although Parsons is generally considered a structural functionalist, towards the end of his career, in 1975, he published an article that stated that \\"functional\\" and \\"structural functionalist\\" were inappropriate ways to describe the character of his theory. From the 1970s, a new generation of sociologists criticized Parsons' theories as socially conservative and his writings as unnecessarily complex. Sociology courses have placed less emphasis on his theories than at the peak of his popularity (from the 1940s to the 1970s). However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in his ideas. Parsons was a strong advocate for the professionalization of sociology and its expansion in American academia. He was elected president of the American Sociological Association in 1949 and served as its secretary from 1960 to 1965.  Early life  He was born on December 13, 1902, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was the son of Edward Smith Parsons (1863‚Äì1943) and Mary Augusta Ingersoll (1863‚Äì1949). His father had attended Yale Divinity School, was ordained as a Congregationalist minister, and served first as a minister for a pioneer community in Greeley, Colorado. At the time of Parsons' birth, his father was a professor in English and vice-president at Colorado College. During his Congregational ministry in Greeley, Edward had become sympathetic to the Social Gospel movement but tended to view it from a higher theological position and was hostile to the ideology of socialism.Edward S. Parsons, \\"A Christian Critique of Socialism\\". Andover Review XI. 1889. pp. 597‚Äì611. Also, both he and Talcott would be familiar with the theology of Jonathan Edwards. The father would later become the president of Marietta College in Ohio. Parsons' family is one of the oldest families in American history. His ancestors were some of the first to arrive from England in the first half of the 17th century.Charles Parsons (2004). \\"Some Remarks on Talcott Parsons's Family\\". In: Journal The American Sociologist. Vol 35, Nr 3, Sept 2004. pp. 4‚Äì22. The family's heritage had two separate and independently developed Parsons lines, both to the early days of American history deeper into British history. On his father's side, the family could be traced back to the Parsons of York, Maine. On his mother's side, the Ingersoll line was connected with Edwards and from Edwards on would be a new, independent Parsons line because Edwards' eldest daughter, Sarah, married Elihu Parsons on June 11, 1750.  Education  =Amherst College= As an undergraduate, Parsons studied biology and philosophy at Amherst College and received his BA in 1924. Amherst College had become the Parsons' family college by tradition; his father and his uncle Frank had attended it, as had his elder brother, Charles Edward. Initially, Parsons was attracted to a career in medicine, as he was inspired by his elder brother so he studied a great deal of biology and spent a summer working at the Oceanographic Institution at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Parsons' biology professors at Amherst were Otto C. Glaser and Henry Plough. Gently mocked as \\"Little Talcott, the gilded cherub,\\" Parsons became one of the student leaders at Amherst. Parsons also took courses with Walton Hale Hamilton and the philosopher Clarence Edwin Ayres, both known as \\"institutional economists\\". Hamilton, in particular, drew Parsons toward social science. They exposed him to literature by authors such as Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, and William Graham Sumner. Parsons also took a course with George Brown in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and a course in modern German philosophy with Otto Manthey- Zorn, who was a great interpreter of Kant. Parsons showed from early on, a great interest in the topic of philosophy, which most likely was an echo of his father's great interest in theology in which tradition he had been profoundly socialized, a position unlike with his professors'. Two term papers that Parsons wrote as a student for Clarence E. Ayres's class in Philosophy III at Amherst have survived. They are referred to as the Amherst Papers and have been of strong interest to Parsons scholars. The first was written on December 19, 1922, \\"The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects.\\" The American Sociologist Vol.27.no.4. Winter 1996. pp.13‚Äì23. The second was written on March 27, 1923, \\"A Behavioristic Conception of the Nature of Morals\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"A Behavioristic Concept of the Nature of Morals\\". The American Sociologist Vol.27.no.4. Winter 1996. pp. 24‚Äì37. The papers reveal Parsons' early interest in social evolution.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \\"Beyond the Myth of \\"Radical Breaks\\" in Talcott Parsons's Theory: An Analysis of the Amherst Papers.\\" The American Sociologist. Winter 1996. Volume 27. no.4. pp. 48‚Äì54. The Amherst Papers also reveal that Parsons did not agree with his professors since he wrote in his Amherst papers that technological development and moral progress are two structurally-independent empirical processes. =London School of Economics= After Amherst, he studied at the London School of Economics for a year, where he was exposed to the work of Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, R. H. Tawney, L. T. Hobhouse, and Harold Laski. During his days at LSE, he made friends with E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Meyer Fortes, and Raymond Firth, who all participated in the Malinowski seminar. Also, he made a close personal friendship with Arthur and Eveline M. Burns. At LSE he met a young American girl in the students' common room called Helen Bancroft Walker whom he married on April 30, 1927. The couple had three children: Anne, Charles, and Susan and eventually four grandchildren. Walker's father was born in Canada but had moved to the Boston area and later become an American citizen. =University of Heidelberg= In June, Parsons went on to the University of Heidelberg, where he received his PhD in sociology and economics in 1927. At Heidelberg, he worked with Alfred Weber, Max Weber's brother; Edgar Salin, his dissertation adviser; Emil Lederer; and Karl Mannheim. He was examined on Kant's \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\" by the philosopher Karl Jaspers.Alexander Stingl Between Discursivity and Sensus Communis: Kant, Kantianism and the Social Media Theory of Talcott Parsons. Inaugural- Dissertation, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t, edited for publication, OPUS Erlangen-N√ºrnberg University Press, 2008. * Alexander I. Stingl Anthropos' Scaffoldings: Studies in the Coevolution of Sociology, Biology, Medicine, and Philosophy. (with a foreword by Sal Restivo) forthcoming. At Heidelberg, Parsons was also examined by Willy Andreas on the French Revolution. Parsons wrote his Dr. Phil. thesis on The Concept of Capitalism in the Recent German Literature, with his main focus on the work of Werner Sombart and Weber. It was clear from his discussion that he rejected Sombart's quasi-idealistic views and supported Weber's attempt to strike a balance between historicism, idealism and neo-Kantianism. The most crucial encounter for Parsons at Heidelberg was his encounter with the work of Max Weber about whom he had never heard before. Weber became tremendously important for Parsons because his upbringing with a liberal but strongly-religious father had made the question of the role of culture and religion in the basic processes of world history a persistent puzzle in his mind. Weber was the first scholar who truly provided Parsons with a compelling theoretical \\"answer\\" to the question so Parsons became totally absorbed in the reading of Weber. Parsons decided to translate Weber's work into English and approached Marianne Weber, Weber's widow. Parsons would eventually translate several of Weber's works to English.Talcott Parsons, \\"The Circumstances of My Encounter with Max Weber\\" in Robert K. Merton & Matilda White Riley (eds.) Sociological Traditions from Generation to Generation. Norwood, NJ.: Ablex, 1980.Uta Gerhardt, \\"Much More than a Mere Translation Talcott Parsons' Translation into English of Max Weber's Protestantische Ethik und der Geist der Kapitalismus: An Essay in Intellectual History.\\" The Canadian Journal of Sociology. Vol.32. No.1. Winter 2007. pp. 41‚Äì62. His time in Heidelberg had him invited by Marianne Weber to \\"sociological teas\\", which were study group meetings that she held in the library room of her and Max's old apartment. One scholar that Parsons met at Heidelberg who shared his enthusiasm for Weber was Alexander von Schelting. Parsons later wrote a review article on von Schelting's book on Weber.Talcott Parsons, \\"Review of Max Webers Wissenschaftslehre, by Alexander von Schelting,\\" American Sociological Review vol.1. 1936: 675‚Äì81. Generally, Parsons read extensively in religious literature, especially works focusing on the sociology of religion. One scholar who became especially important for Parsons was Ernst D. Troeltsch (1865‚Äì1923). Parsons also read widely on Calvinism. His reading included the work of Emile Doumerque,Emile Doumerque, Jean Calvin: Les hommes et les choses de son temps, 7 volumes. Lausanne, 1899‚Äì1927. Eug√©ne Choisy, and Henri Hauser. Early academic career =Harvard= Economics Department In 1927, after a year of teaching at Amherst (1926‚Äì1927), Parsons entered Harvard, as an instructor in the Economics Department,Edward S. Mason, \\"The Harvard Department of Economics from the Beginning to World War II.\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics 97. 1982. pp. 383‚Äì433. where he followed F. W. Taussig's lectures on tags economist Alfred Marshall and became friends with the economist historian Edwin Gay, the founder of Harvard Business School. Parsons also became a close associate of Joseph Schumpeter and followed his course General Economics. Parsons was generally at odds with some of the trends in Harvard's department which then went in a highly-technical and a mathematical direction. Parsons looked for other options at Harvard and gave courses in \\"Social Ethics\\" and in the \\"Sociology of Religion\\". Although Parsons entered Harvard through the Economics Department, his activities and his basic intellectual interest propelled him toward sociology. However no Sociology Department existed in his first years at Harvard. Harvard Sociology Department The chance for a shift to sociology came in 1930, when Harvard's first Sociology Department was created under Russian scholar Pitirim Sorokin. Sorokin, who had fled the Russian Revolution from Russia to the United States in 1923, was given the opportunity to establish the department. Parsons became one of the new department's two instructors, along with Carl Joslyn. Parsons established close ties with biochemist and sociologist Lawrence Joseph Henderson, who took personal interest in Parsons' career at Harvard. Parsons became part of L. J. Henderson's famous Pareto study group in which some of the most important intellectuals at Harvard participated, including Crane Brinton, George C. Homans, and Charles P. Curtis. Parsons wrote an article on Pareto's theoryTalcott Parsons, \\"Pareto's Central Analytical Scheme\\". In Talcott Parsons, The Early Essays Edited C. Camic. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991. and later explained that he had adopted the concept of \\"social system\\" from reading Pareto. Parsons also made strong connections with two other influential intellectuals with whom he corresponded for years: economist Frank H. Knight and Chester Barnard, one of the most dynamic businessmen of the US. The relationship between Parsons and Sorokin quickly ran sour. A pattern of personal tensions was aggravated by Sorokin's deep dislike for American civilization, which he regarded as a sensate culture that was in decline. Sorokin's writings became increasingly anti-scientistic in his later years, widening the gulf between his work and Parsons' and turning the increasingly positivisitic American sociology community against him. Sorokin also tended to belittle all sociology tendencies that differed from his own writings, and by 1934, Sorokin was quite unpopular at Harvard. Some of Parsons' students in the first years of the new department of sociology were people like Robin Williams Jr., Robert K. Merton, Kingsley Davis, Wilbert Moore, Edward C. Devereux, Logan Wilson, Nicholas Demereth, John Riley Jr., and Mathilda White Riley. Later cohorts of students had with Harry Johnson, Bernard Barber, Marion Levy and Jesse R. Pitts. Parsons established, at the students' request, a little, informal study group which met year after year in Adams' house. Toward the end of Parsons' career, German systems theorist Niklas Luhmann also attended his lectures. In 1932, Parsons bought his famous farmhouse in New Hampshire for $2,500 in a wooded area near the small town of Acworth, but Parsons often, in his writing, referred to it as \\"the farmhouse in Alstead.\\" The farmhouse was not big and impressive; indeed, it was a very humble structure with almost no modern utilities. The farmhouse still became central to Parsons' life, and many of his most important works were written in its peace and quiet. In the spring of 1933, Susan Kingsbury, a pioneer of women's rights in America, wrote to Parsons and offered him a position at Bryn Mawr College; however, Parsons declined the offer because, as he wrote to Kingsbury, \\"neither salary nor rank is really definitely above what I enjoy here.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Susan Kingsbury, April 15, 1933. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. In the academic year of 1939‚Äì1940 Parsons and Schumpeter conducted an informal faculty seminar at Harvard, which met in Emerson Hall and discussed the concept of rationality. Among the participants in the seminary were D. V. McGranahan, Abram Bergson, Wassily Leontief, Gottfried Haberler, and Paul Sweezy. Schumpeter contributed with the essay \\"Rationality in Economics\\" to the seminar, and Parsons submitted the paper \\"The Role of Rationality in Social Action\\" for a general discussion.See Robert Loring Allen, Opening Doors: The Life and Work of Joseph Schumpeter Vol 2: America. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1991. p. 98. An edited version of Schumpeter's paper to the seminary was published in Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft. Vol.140. no.4. December 1984: 577‚Äì93. Schumpeter suggested to Parsons that they should write or edit a book together on rationality, but the project never materialized. =Neoclassical economics vs. institutionalists= In the prevailing discussion between neoclassical economics and the institutionalists, which was one of the conflicts that prevailed within the field of economics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Parsons attempted to walk a very fine line. He was very critical about neoclassical theory, an attitude that prevailed all the way through his life and is reflected in his critique of Milton Friedman and Gary Becker. He was opposed to the utilitarian bias within the neoclassical approach and could not embrace them fully. However, he agreed partly on their theoretical and methodological style of approach, which should be distinguished from its substance. He was thus unable to accept the institutionalist solution. In an interview in 1975, Parsons would recall a conversation with Schumpeter on the institutionalist methodological position: \\"An economist like Schumpeter, by contrast, would absolutely have none of that. I remember talking to him about the problem and .. I think Schumpeter was right. If economics had gone that way [like the institutionalists] it would have had to become a primarily empirical discipline, largely descriptive, and without theoretical focus. That's the way the 'institutionalists' went, and of course Mitchell was affiliated with that movement.\\"Martin U. Martel, Dialogues with Parsons. Transcript, 1975. =Anti-Nazism= Parsons returned to Germany in the summer of 1930 and became a direct eyewitness to the feverish atmosphere in Weimar Germany during which the Nazi Party rose to power. Parsons would receive constant reports about the rise of Nazism through his friend, Edward Y. Hartshorne, who was travelling there. Parsons began, in the late 1930s, to warn the American public about the Nazi threat, but he had little success, as a poll showed that 91 percent of the country opposed the Second World War.Christian Science Monitor, May 25, 1940. Most of the US thought also that the country should have stayed out of the First World War and that the Nazis were, regardless of what they did in Germany or even Europe, no threat to the US. Many Americans even sympathized with Germany, as many had ancestry from there, and the latter both was strongly anticommunist and had gotten itself out of the Great Depression while the US was still suffering from it. One of the first articles that Parsons wrote was \\"New Dark Age Seen If Nazis Should Win\\". Parsons became one of the key initiators of the Harvard Defense Committee, aimed at rallying the American public against the Nazis. Parsons' voice would sound again and again over Boston's local radio stations, and he also spoke against Nazism during a dramatic meeting at Harvard, which was disturbed by antiwar activists. Together with graduate student Charles O. Porter, Parsons would rally graduate students at Harvard for the war effort. (Porter would later become a Democratic US Representative for Oregon.) During the war, Parsons conducted a special study group at Harvard, which analyzed what its members considered the causes of Nazism, and the topic's leading experts participated. Second World War In the spring of 1941, a discussion group on Japan began to meet at Harvard. The group's five core members were Parsons, John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, William M. McGovern, and Marion Levy Jr. A few others would also occasionally join the group, including Ai-Li Sung (also known as Ai-Li Sung Chin) and Edward Y. Hartshorne. The group rose out of a strong desire to understand the country whose power in the East had grown tremendously and had allied itself with Germany), but as Levy frankly admitted, \\"Reischauer was the only one who knew anything about Japan.\\"Telephone conversations between William Buxton and Marion Levy, April 14 and May 19, 2000. In William Buxton and William J. Buxton and Lawrence T. Nichols, \\"Talcott Parsons and the \\"Far East\\" at Harvard, 1941-48: Comparative Institutions and National Policy.\\" American Sociologist, Summer 2000. Parsons, however, was eager to learn more about it and was \\"concerned with general implications.\\" Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Parsons wrote in a letter to Arthur Upham Pope (1881‚Äì1969) that the importance of studies of Japan certainly had intensified.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Arthur U. Pope, December 1941. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. In 1942, Parsons worked on arranging a major study of occupied countries with Bartholomew Landheer of the Netherlands Information Office in New York.Talcott Parsons and Bartholomew Landheer, \\"Memorandum of a Proposed Sociological Study of Social Consequences of Conquest and Occupation in Certain European Countries.\\" Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Parsons had mobilized Georges Gurvitch, Conrad Arnsberg, Dr. Safranek and Theodore Abel to participate,Uta Gerhardt, Talcott Parsons: An Intellectual Biography. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 90. but it never materialized for lack of funding. In early 1942, Parsons unsuccessfully approached Hartshorne, who had joined the Psychology Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) in Washington to interest his agency in the research project. In February 1943, Parsons became the deputy director of Harvard School of Overseas Administration, which educated administrators to \\"run\\" the occupied territories in Germany and the Pacific Ocean. The task of finding relevant literature on both Europe and Asia was mindboggling and occupied a fair amount of Parsons' time. One scholar Parsons came to know was Karl August Wittfogel and discussed Weber. On China, Parsons received fundamental information from Chinese scholar Ai-Li Sung Chin and her husband, Robert Chin. Another Chinese scholar Parsons worked closely with there period was Hsiao-Tung Fei (or Fei Xiaotong) (1910‚Äì2005), who had studied at the London School of Economics and was an expert on the social structure of the Chinese village. =Intellectual exchanges= Parsons met Alfred Schutz (or Sch√ºtz) during the rationality seminar, which he conducted, together with Schumpeter, at Harvard in the spring of 1940. Schutz has been close to Edmund Husserl and was deeply embedded in his phenomenological philosophy.Alfred Schutz's phenomenology is not a simple \\"copy\\" of Husserl but was close: Helmuth R. Wagner, \\"The Limitation of Phenomenology: Alfred Schutz's critical dialogue with Edmund Husserl.\\" Husserl Studies Vol.1. No.1. December 1984. Schutz was born in Vienna but moved to the US in 1939, and for years, he worked on the project of developing a phenomenological sociology, primarily based on an attempt to find some point between Husserl's method and Weber's sociology.Alfred Schutz, Der sinnhafte Aufbau der Sociale Welt: eine Einleitung in die verstehende Soziology. Wien: J. Springer, 1932. The work appeared in English under the title: Alfred Schutz, The Phenomenology of the Social World. Northwestern University Press, 1967. Parsons had asked Schutz to give a presentation at the rationality seminar, which he did on April 13, 1940, and Parsons and Schutz had lunched together afterward. Schutz was fascinated with Parsons' theory, which he regarded as the state-of-the-art social theory, and wrote an evaluation of Parsons' theory that he kindly asked Parsons to comment. That led to a short but intensive correspondence, which generally revealed that the gap between Schutz's sociologized phenomenology and Parsons concept of voluntaristic action was far too great.Richard Grathoff (ed.) The Correspondence between Alfred Schutz and Talcott Parsons: The Theory of Social Action. Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1978 (German version, 1977). From Parsons' point of view, Schutz's position was too speculative and subjectivist that tended to reduce social processes to the articulation of a Lebenswelt consciousness. For Parsons, the defining edge of human life was action as a catalyst for historical change, and it was essential for sociology, as a science, to pay strong attention to the subjective element of action, but it should never become completely absorbed in it since the purpose of a science was to explain causal relationships, by covering laws or by other types of explanatory devices. Schutz's basic argument was that sociology cannot ground itself and that epistemology was not a luxury but a necessity for the social scientist. Parsons agreed but stressed the pragmatic need to demarcate science and philosophy and insisted moreover that the grounding of a conceptual scheme for empirical theory construction cannot aim at absolute solutions but need to take a sensible stock-taking of the epistemological balance at each point in time. However, the two men shared many basic assumptions about the nature of social theory, which has kept the debate simmering ever since.Bennetta Jules-Rosette, \\"Talcott Parsons and the Phenomenological Tradition in Sociology: An Unresolved Debate.\\" Human Studies, vol.3. 1980. pp. 311‚Äì330.Matthew M. Chew, \\"The Theoretical Quandary of Subjectivity: An Intellectual Historical Note on the Action Theories of Talcott Parsons and Alfred Schutz.\\" Review of European Studies. Vol.1, No.1, June 2009. By request from Ilse Schutz, after her husband's death, Parsons gave, on July 23, 1971, permission to publish the correspondence between him and Schutz. Parsons also wrote \\"A 1974 Retrospective Perspective\\" to the correspondence, which characterized his position as a \\"Kantian point of view\\" and found that Schutz's strong dependence on Husserl's \\"phenomenological reduction\\" would make it very difficult to reach the kind of \\"conceptual scheme\\", which Parsons found essential for theory-building in social sciences.Talcott Parsons, \\"A 1974 Retrospective Perspective.\\" in Richard Grathoff (ed.)

Milano: FrancoAngeli, 2000. Parsons had probably met Voegelin in 1938 and 1939, when Voegelin held a temporary instructor appointment at Harvard. The bouncing point for their conversation was Parsons' manuscript on anti-Semitism and other materials that he had sent to Voegelin. Discussion touched on the nature of capitalism, the rise of the West, and the origin of Nazism. The key to the discussion was the implication of Weber's interpretation of Protestant ethics and the impact of Calvinism on modern history. Although the two scholars agreed on many fundamental characteristics about Calvinism, their understanding of its historical impact was quite different. Generally, Voegelin regarded Calvinism as essentially a dangerous totalitarian ideology; Parsons argued that its current features were temporary and that the functional implications of its long-term, emerging value-l system had revolutionary and not only \\"negative\\" impact on the general rise of the institutions of modernity. The two scholars also discussed Parsons' debate with Sch√ºtz and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz. Parsons found that Schutz, rather than attempting to build social science theory, tended to get consumed in philosophical detours. Parsons wrote to Voegelin: \\"Possibly one of my troubles in my discussion with Schuetz lies in the fact that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist. I do not want to be a philosopher ‚Äì I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work. By the same token I don't think he wants to be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties. If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no Newtonian system.\\"Talcott Parsons to Eric Voegelin, October 19, 1941. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archive. In 1942, Stuart C. Dodd published a major work, Dimensions of Society,Stuart C. Dodd, Dimensions of Society: A Quantitative Systematics for the Social Sciences. New York: Macmillan, 1942. which attempted to build a general theory of society on the foundation of a mathematical and quantitative systematization of social sciences. Dodd advanced a particular approach, known as an \\"S-theory\\". Parsons discussed Dodd's theoretical outline in a review article the same year.Talcott Parsons, \\"Review of Dimensions of Society: A Quantitative Systematics for the Social Sciences by Stuart Carter Dodd.\\" American Sociological Review Vol.7. No.5. October 1942. pp. 709‚Äì714. Parsons acknowledged Dodd's contribution to be an exceedingly formidable work but argued against its premises as a general paradigm for the social sciences. Parsons generally argued that Dodd's \\"S-theory\\", which included the so-called \\"social distance\\" scheme of Bogardus, was unable to construct a sufficiently sensitive and systematized theoretical matrix, compared with the \\"traditional\\" approach, which has developed around the lines of Weber, Pareto, √âmile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, William Isaac Thomas, and other important agents of an action-system approach with a more clear dialogue with the cultural and motivational dimensions of human interaction. In April 1944, Parsons participated in a conference, \\"On Germany after the War\\", of psychoanalytical oriented psychiatrists and a few social scientists analyze the causes of Nazism and to discuss the principles for the coming occupation.Uta Gerhardt, Talcott Parsons: An Intellectual Biography. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 110. During the conference, Parsons opposed what he found to be Lawrence S. Kubie's reductionism. Kubie was a psychoanalyst, who strongly argued that the German national character was completely \\"destructive\\" and that it would be necessary for a special agency of the United Nations to control the German educational system directly. Parsons and many others at the conference were strongly opposed to Kubie's idea. Parsons argued that it would fail and suggested that Kubie was viewing the question of Germans' reorientation \\"too exclusively in psychiatric terms\\". Parsons was also against the extremely harsh Morgenthau Plan, published in September 1944. After the conference, Parsons wrote an article, \\"The Problem of Controlled Institutional Change\\", against the plan.Talcott Parsons, \\"The Problem of Controlled Institutional Change: An Essay in Applied Social Science.\\" Psychiatry. Vol.8. 1945. pp. 79‚Äì101. Parsons participated as a part-time adviser to the Foreign Economic Administration Agency between March and October 1945 to discuss postwar reparations and deindustrialization.Uta Gerhardt, \\"Introduction: Talcott Parsons's Sociology of National Socialism.\\" In Uta Gerhardt, Talcott Parsons on National Socialism. New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1993. p. 57.For a further discussion of his influence on the postwar situation and policies on Germany, see Uta Gerhardt, \\"Talcott Parsons and the Transformation from Totalitarianism to Democracy in the end of World War II.\\" European Sociological Review, Vol.12. 1996. pp. 303‚Äì325. For further discussion, see Uta Gerhardt, \\"Talcott Parsons und die Re-Education-Politik der amerikanischen Besatzungsmacht. Schweizerische Zeitschrift f√ºr Soziologie, Jg.24. Heft.4. 1998. pp. 121‚Äì154. Parsons was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1945. =Taking charge at Harvard= Parsons' situation at Harvard University changed significantly in early 1944, when he received a good offer from Northwestern University. Harvard reacted to the offer from Northwestern by appointing Parsons as the chairman of the department, promoting him to the rank of full professor and accepting the process of reorganization, which could lead to the establishment of the new department of Social Relations. Parsons' letter to Dean Paul Buck, on April 3, 1944, reveals the high point of this moment.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Dean Paul Buck, April 3, 1944. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Because of the new development at Harvard, Parsons chose to decline an offer from William Langer to join the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Langer proposed for Parsons to follow the American army in its march into Germany and to function as a political adviser to the administration of the occupied territories. Late in 1944, under the auspices of the Cambridge Community Council, Parsons directed a project together with Elizabeth Schlesinger. They investigated ethnic and racial tensions in the Boston area between students from Radcliffe College and Wellesley College. This study was a reaction to an upsurge of anti-Semitism in the Boston area, which began in late 1943 and continued into 1944.Uta Gerhardt, \\"A World from Brave to New: Talcott Parsons and the War Effort at Harvard University\\". Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences Vol.15 (3), 257‚Äì289, Summer 1999. p. 266. At the end of November 1946, the Social Research Council (SSRC) asked Parsons to write a comprehensive report of the topic of how the social sciences could contribute to the understanding of the modern world. The background was a controversy over whether the social sciences should be incorporated into the National Science Foundation. Parsons' report was in form of a large memorandum, \\"Social Science: A Basic National Resource\\", which became publicly available in July 1948 and remains a powerful historical statement about how he saw the role of modern social sciences.Talcott Parsons, \\"Social Science: A Basic National Resource\\". In Samuel Z. Klauser & Victor M. Lidz (eds.) The Nationalization of the Social Sciences. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986. Postwar =Russian Research Center= Parsons became a member of the Executive Committee of the new Russian Research Center at Harvard in 1948, which had Parsons' close friend and colleague, Clyde Kluckhohn, as its director. Parsons went to Allied- occupied Germany in the summer of 1948, was a contact person for the RRC, and was interested in the Russian refugees who were stranded in Germany. He happened to interview in Germany a few members of the Vlasov Army, a Russian Liberation Army that had collaborated with the Germans during the war.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \\"The Political Orientation of Talcott Parsons: The Second World War and its Aftermath\\". In Roland Robertson & Bryan S. Turner (eds.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity. London: Sage Publications, 1991. The movement was named after Andrey Vlasov, a Soviet general captured by the Germans in June 1942. The Vlasov movement's ideology was a hybrid of elements and has been called \\"communism without Stalin\\", but in the Prague Manifesto (1944), it had moved toward the framework of a constitutional liberal state.Catherine Andreyev, Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet reality and √©migr√© theories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987. In Germany in the summer of 1948 Parsons wrote several letters to Kluckhohn to report on his investigations. =Anticommunism= Parsons' fight against communism was a natural extension of his fight against fascism in the 1930s and the 1940s. For Parsons, communism and fascism were two aspects of the same problem; his article \\"A Tentative Outline of American Values\\", published posthumously in 1989,Talcott Parsons, \\"A Tentative Outline of American Values\\" in Roland Robertson and Bryan S. Turner (eds.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity.London: Sage Publication, 1991. \\"A Tentative Outline of the American Value System\\" was written in 1959 or 1960 and can be seen as a kind of prelude of Parsons' long-term interest in writing a major work about American society and was an attempt to facilitate the theoretical fundament of the concept of the \\"societal community,\\" which represented the I-factor (the integrative function) of the social system and the extreme importance in the fact that Parsons regarded it as the epicenter (or the logical \\"starting-point\\") of the general process of differentiation in and of society. called both collectivistic types \\"empirical finalism\\", which he believed was a secular \\"mirror\\" of religious types of \\"salvationalism\\". In contrast, Parsons highlighted that American values generally were based on the principle of \\"instrumental activism\\", which he believed was the outcome of Puritanism as a historical process. It represented what Parsons called \\"worldly asceticism\\" and represented the absolute opposite of empirical finalism. One can thus understand Parsons' statement late in life that the greatest threat to humanity is every type of \\"fundamentalism\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"Some Theoretical Considerations on the Nature and Trends of Change of Ethnicity\\" in Talcott Parsons, Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory New York: The Free Press, 1977, originally published 1975, p. 393. By the term empirical finalism, he implied the type of claim assessed by cultural and ideological actors about the correct or \\"final\\" ends of particular patterns of value orientation in the actual historical world (such as the notion of \\"a truly just society\\"), which was absolutist and \\"indisputable\\" in its manner of declaration and in its function as a belief system. A typical example would be the Jacobins' behavior during the French Revolution. Parsons' rejection of communist and fascist totalitarianism was theoretically and intellectually an integral part of his theory of world history, and he tended to regard the European Reformation as the most crucial event in \\"modern\\" world history. Like Weber,Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Roxbury Publishing Company, 2002. he tended to highlight the crucial impact of Calvinist religiosity in the socio-political and socio-economic processes that followed.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \\"Are there Cultural Limits to Inclusion? An Analysis of the Relation Between Culture and Social Evolution in Talcott Parsons' Theory.\\" In Gabriele Pollini & Giuseppe Sciortino (eds). Parsons' The Structure of Social Action and Contemporary Debates. Milano, Italy: FrancoAngeli, 2001. He maintained it reached its most radical form in England in the 17th century and gave in effect birth to the special cultural mode, which has characterized the American value system and history ever since. The Calvinist faith system, authoritarian in the beginning, eventually released in its accidental long-term institutional effects a fundamental democratic revolution in the world.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Eric Voegelin, May 13, 1941. Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archive. Parsons maintained that the revolution was steadily unfolding, as part of an interpenetration of Puritan values in the world at large.See among others: Talcott Parsons, \\"Religious and Economic Symbolism in the Western World.\\" Sociological Inquiry. Vol.49. (1) 1979. pp. 1‚Äì48. =American exceptionalism= Parsons defended American exceptionalism and argued that because of a variety of historical circumstances, the impact of the Reformation had reached a certain intensity in British history. Puritan, essentially Calvinist, value patterns had become institutionalized in Britain's internal situation. The outcome was that Puritan radicalism was reflected in the religious radicalism of the Puritan sects, in the poetry of John Milton, in the English Civil War, and in the process leading to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It was the radical fling of the Puritan Revolution that provided settlers in early 17th-century Colonial America, and the Puritans who settled in America represented radical views on individuality, egalitarianism, skepticism to state power, and the zeal of the religious calling. The settlers established something unique in the world that was under the religious zeal of Calvinist values. Therefore, a new kind of nation was born, the character of which became clear by the time of the American Revolution and in the US constitution,Talcott Parsons, American Society: A Theory of Societal Community. Paradigm Publishers, 2007. See the chapter on American history. and its dynamics were later studied by Alexis de Tocqueville.Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America. New York: Schocken Books, 1961. Originally published in 1835‚Äì1840. The French Revolution was a failed attempt to copy the American model. Although America has changed in its social composition since 1787, Parsons maintained that it preserves the basic revolutionary Calvinist value pattern. That has been further revealed in the pluralist and highly individualized America, with its thick, network-oriented civil society, which is of crucial importance to its success and these factors have provided it with its historical lead in the process of industrialization. Parsons maintained that this has continued to place it in the leading position in the world, but as a historical process and not in \\"the nature of thing\\". Parsons viewed the \\"highly special feature of the modern Western social world\\" as \\"dependent on the peculiar circumstances of its history, and not the necessary universal result of social development as a whole\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"Sociological Reflections on the United States in Relation to the European War\\" (1941). In Uta Gerhardt (ed.) Talcott Parsons on National Socialism. New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1993. p. 194. =Defender of modernity= In contrast to some \\"radicals\\", Parsons was a defender of modernity. He believed that modern civilization, with its technology and its constantly evolving institutions, was ultimately strong, vibrant, and essentially progressive. He acknowledged that the future had no inherent guarantees, but as sociologists Robert Holton and Bryan Turner said that Parsons was not nostalgic and that he did not believe in the past as a lost \\"golden age\\" but that he maintained that modernity generally had improved conditions, admittedly often in troublesome and painful ways but usually positively. He had faith in humanity's potential but not na√Øvely. When asked at the Brown Seminary in 1973 if he was optimistic about the future, he answered, \\"Oh, I think I'm basically optimistic about the human prospects in the long run.\\" Parsons pointed out that he had been a student at Heidelberg at the height of the vogue of Oswald Spengler, author of The Decline of the West, \\"and he didn't give the West more than 50 years of continuing vitality after the time he wrote.... Well, its more than 50 years later now, and I don't think the West has just simply declined. He was wrong in thinking it was the end.\\" =Harvard Department of Social Relations= At Harvard, Parsons was instrumental in forming the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary venture among sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The new department was officially created in January 1946 with him as the chairman and with prominent figures at the faculty, such as Stouffer, Kluckhohn, Henry Murray and Gordon Allport. An appointment for Hartshorne was considered but he was killed in Germany by an unknown gunman as he driving on the highway. His position went instead to George C. Homans. The new department was galvanized by Parsons idea of creating a theoretical and institutional base for a unified social science. Parsons also became strongly interested in systems theory and cybernetics and began to adopt their basic ideas and concepts to the realm of social science, giving special attention to the work of Norbert Wiener (1894‚Äì1964). Some of the students who arrived at the Department of Social Relations in the years after the Second World War were David Aberle, Gardner Lindzey, Harold Garfinkel, David G. Hays, Benton Johnson, Marian Johnson, Kaspar Naegele, James Olds, Albert Cohen, Norman Birnbaum, Robin Murphy Williams, Jackson Toby, Robert N. Bellah, Joseph Kahl, Joseph Berger, Morris Zelditch, Ren√©e Fox, Tom O'Dea, Ezra Vogel, Clifford Geertz, Joseph Elder, Theodore Mills, Mark Field, Edward Laumann, and Francis Sutton. Ren√©e Fox, who arrived at Harvard in 1949, would become a very close friend of the Parsons family. Joseph Berger, who also arrived at Harvard in 1949 after finishing his BA from Brooklyn College, would become Parsons' research assistant from 1952 to 1953 and would get involved in his research projects with Robert F. Bales. According to Parsons' own account, it was during his conversations with Elton Mayo (1880‚Äì1949) that he realized it was necessary for him to take a serious look at the work of Freud. In the fall of 1938, Parsons began to offer a series of non-credit evening courses on Freud. As time passed, Parsons developed a strong interest in psychoanalysis. He volunteered to participate in nontherapeutic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, where he began a didactic analysis with Grete Bibring in September 1946. Insight into psychoanalysis is significantly reflected in his later work, especially reflected in The Social System and his general writing on psychological issues and on the theory of socialization. That influence was also to some extent apparent in his empirical analysis of fascism during the war. Wolfgang K√∂hler's study of the mentality of apes and Kurt Koffka's ideas of Gestalt psychology also received Parsons' attention. =The Social System and Toward a General Theory of Action= During the late 1940s and the early 1950s, he worked very hard on producing some major theoretical statements. In 1951, Parsons published two major theoretical works, The Social SystemTalcott Parsons, The Social System. New York: The Free Press, 1951. and Toward a General Theory of Action.Talcott Parsons & Edward Shils (eds.) Toward a General Theory of Action. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1951. The latter work, which was coauthored with Edward Tolman, Edward Shils and several others, was the outcome of the so-called Carnegie Seminar, which had taken place in the period of September 1949 and January 1950. The former work was Parsons' first major attempt to present his basic outline of a general theory of society since The Structure of Social Action (1937). He discusses the basic methodological and metatheoretical principles for such a theory. He attempts to present a general social system theory that is built systematically from most basic premises and so he featured the idea of an interaction situation based on need-dispositions and facilitated through the basic concepts of cognitive, cathectic, and evaluative orientation. The work also became known for introducing his famous pattern variables, which in reality represented choices distributed along a Gemeinschaft vs. Gesellschaft axis. The details of Parsons' thought about the outline of the social system went through a rapid series of changes in the following years, but the basics remained. During the early 1950s, the idea of the AGIL model took place in Parsons's mind gradually. According to Parsons, its key idea was sparked during his work with Bales on motivational processes in small groups.Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales & Edward A. Shils (eds.) Working Papers in The Theory of Action. New York: The Free Press, 1953. Parsons carried the idea into the major work that he co-authored with a student, Neil Smelser, which was published in 1956 as Economy and Society.Talcott Parsons & Neil J. Smelser, Economy and Society. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1956. Within this work, the first rudimentary model of the AGIL scheme was presented. It reorganized the basic concepts of the pattern variables in a new way and presented the solution within a system- theoretical approach by using the idea of a cybernetic hierarchy as an organizing principle. The real innovation in the model was the concept of the \\"latent function\\" or the pattern maintenance function, which became the crucial key to the whole cybernetic hierarchy. During its theoretical development, Parsons showed a persistent interest in symbolism. An important statement is Parsons' \\"The Theory of Symbolism in Relation to Action.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"The Theory of Symbolism in Relation to Action\\" in Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales & Edward A. Shils, Working Papers in the Theory of Action'.' New York: The Free Press, 1953. The article was stimulated by a series of informal discussion group meetings, which Parsons and several other colleagues in the spring of 1951 had conducted with philosopher and semiotician Charles W. Morris.Charles W. Morris, Signs, Language and Behavior. New York: Prentice- Hall, 1946. His interest in symbolism went hand in hand with his interest in Freud's theory and \\"The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems\\", written in May 1951 for a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. The paper can be regarded as the main statement of his own interpretation of Freud,Talcott Parsons, \\"The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems.\\" In Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales & Edward A. Shils, Working Papers in the Theory of Action. New York: The Free Press, 1953. but also as a statement of how Parsons tried to use Freud's pattern of symbolization to structure the theory of social system and eventually to codify the cybernetic hierarchy of the AGIL system within the parameter of a system of symbolic differentiation. His discussion of Freud also contains several layers of criticism that reveal that Parsons's use of Freud was selective, rather than orthodox. In particular, he claimed that Freud had \\"introduced an unreal separation between the superego and the ego\\". =Subscriber to systems theory= Parsons was an early subscriber to systems theory. He had early been fascinated by the writings of Walter B. Cannon and his concept of homeostasisWalter B. Cannon, The Wisdom of the Body. New York: Norton, 1932. as well as the writings of French physiologist Claude Bernard.Claude Bernard, An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine. New York: Dover, 1957. First published in French in 1865. His interest in systems theory had been further stimulated by his contract with LJ Henderson. Parsons called the concept of \\"system\\" for an indispensable master concept in the work of building theoretical paradigms for social sciences.Talcott Parsons, \\"The Present Status of \\"Structural-Functional\\" Theory in Sociology.\\" In Talcott Parsons, Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory. New York: The Free Press, 1977. p. 101. From 1952 to 1957, Parsons participated in an ongoing Conference on System Theory under the chairmanship of Roy R. Grinker, Sr., in Chicago. Parsons came into contact with several prominent intellectuals of the time and was particularly impressed by the ideas of social insect biologist Alfred Emerson. Parsons was especially compelled by Emerson's idea that, in the sociocultural world, the functional equivalent of the gene was that of the \\"symbol\\". Parsons also participated in two of the meetings of the famous Macy Conferences on systems theory and on issues that are now classified as cognitive science, which took place in New York from 1946 to 1953 and included scientists like John von Neumann. Parsons read widely on systems theory at the time, especially works of Norbert WienerNorbert Wiener, Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in Man and the Machine.Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1948. and William Ross Ashby,W.R. Ashby, Design for a Brain. Chapman & Hall, 1952. who were also among the core participants in the conferences. Around the same time, Parsons also benefited from conversations with political scientist Karl Deutsch on systems theory. In one conference, the Fourth Conference of the problems of consciousness in March 1953 at Princeton and sponsored by the Macy Foundation, Parsons would give a presentation on \\"Conscious and Symbolic Processes\\" and embark on an intensive group discussion which included exchange with child psychologist Jean Piaget.Harold A. Abramson (ed.) Problems of Consciousness: Transactions of the Fourth Conference, March 29,30 and 31, 1953, Princeton, NJ. New York: Corlies, Macy & Company, Inc, 1954. Among the other participants were Mary A.B. Brazier, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Nathaniel Kleitman, Margaret Mead and Gregory Zilboorg. Parsons would defend the thesis that consciousness is essentially a social action phenomenon, not primarily a \\"biological\\" one. During the conference, Parsons criticized Piaget for not sufficiently separating cultural factors from a physiologistic concept of \\"energy\\". =McCarthy era= During the McCarthy era, on April 1, 1952, J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, received a personal letter from an informant who reported on communist activities at Harvard. During a later interview, the informant claimed that \\"Parsons... was probably the leader of an inner group\\" of communist sympathizers at Harvard. The informant reported that the old department under Sorokin had been conservative and had \\"loyal Americans of good character\\" but that the new Department of Social Relations had turned into a decisive left-wing place as a result of \\"Parsons's manipulations and machinations\\". On October 27, 1952, Hoover authorized the Boston FBI to initiate a security-type investigation on Parsons. In February 1954, a colleague, Stouffer, wrote to Parsons in England to inform him that Stouffer had been denied access to classified documents and that part of the stated reason was that Stouffer knew Communists, including Parsons, \\"who was a member of the Communist Party\\".Letter from Samuel Stouffer to Talcott Parsons, February 5, 1954. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Parsons immediately wrote an affidavit in defense of Stouffer, and he also defended himself against the charges that were in the affidavit: \\"This allegation is so preposterous that I cannot understand how any reasonable person could come to the conclusion that I was a member of the Communist Party or ever had been.\\"Affidavit of February 23, 1954, from Talcott Parsons: Before the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board: Matter of Samuel Stouffer\\". Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. In a personal letter to Stouffer, Parsons wrote, \\"I will fight for you against this evil with everything there is in me: I am in it with you to the death.\\" The charges against Parsons resulted in Parsons being unable to participate in a UNESCO conference, and it was not until January 1955 that he was acquitted of the charges. =Family, Socialization and Interaction Process= Since the late 1930s, Parsons had continued to show great interest in psychology and in psychoanalysis. In the academic year of 1955‚Äì1956, he taught a seminar at Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute entitled \\"Sociology and Psychoanalysis.\\" In 1956, he published a major work, Family, Socialization and Interaction Process,Talcott Parsons et al., Family, Socialization and Interaction Process. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1956. which explored the way in which psychology and psychoanalysis bounce into the theories of motivation and socialization, as well into the question of kinship, which for Parsons established the fundamental axis for that subsystem he later would call \\"the social community.\\" It contained articles written by Parsons and articles written in collaboration with Robert F. Bales, James Olds, Morris Zelditch Jr., and Philip E. Slater. The work included a theory of personality as well as studies of role differentiation. The strongest intellectual stimuli that Parsons most likely got then was from brain researcher James Olds, one of the founders of neuroscience and whose 1955 book on learning and motivation was strongly influenced from his conversations with Parsons.James Olds, The Growth and Structure of Motives. Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1955. Some of the ideas in the book had been submitted by Parsons in an intellectual brainstorm in an informal \\"work group\\" which he had organized with Joseph Berger, William Caudill, Frank E. Jones, Kaspar D. Naegele, Theodore M. Mills, Bengt G. Rundblad, and others. Albert J. Reiss from Vanderbilt University had submitted his critical commentary. In the mid-1950s, Parsons also had extensive discussions with Olds about the motivational structure of psychosomatic problems, and at this time Parsons' concept of psychosomatic problems was strongly influenced by readings and direct conversations with Franz Alexander (a psychoanalyst (originally associated with Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute) who was a pioneer of psychosomatic medicine), Grinker and John Spiegel.Letter from Talcott Parsons to James Olds of March 21, 1956. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. In 1955, Fran√ßois Bourricaud was preparing a reader of some of Parsons' work for a French audience, and Parsons wrote a preface for the book \\"Au lecteur fran√ßais\\" (To the French Reader); it also went over Bourricaud's introduction very carefully. In his correspondence with Bourricaud, Parsons insisted that he did not necessarily treat values as the only, let alone \\"the primary empirical reference point\\" of the action system since so many other factors were also involved in the actual historical pattern of an action situation.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Francois Bourricaud, February 7, 1955. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. =Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences= Parsons spent 1957 to 1958 at the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California, where he met for the first time Kenneth Burke; Burke's flamboyant, explosive temperament made a great impression on Parsons, and the two men became close friends.Keith Doubt, \\"The Untold Friendship of Kenneth Burke and Talcott Parsons.\\" The Social Science Journal Vol.34. No.4. 1997. pp. 527‚Äì537. Parsons explained in a letter the impression Burke had left on him: \\"The big thing to me is that Burke more than anyone else has helped me to fill a major gap in my own theoretical interests, in the field of the analysis of expressive symbolism.\\" Another scholar whom Parsons met at the Center of Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto was Alfred L. Kroeber, the \\"dean of American anthropologists\\". Kroeber, who had received his PhD at Columbia and who had worked with the Arapaho Indians, was about 81 when Parsons met him. Parsons had the greatest admiration for Kroeber and called him \\"my favorite elder statesman\\". In Palo Alto, Kroeber suggested to Parsons that they write a joint statement to clarify the distinction between cultural and social systems, then the subject of endless debates. In October 1958, Parsons and Kroeber published their joint statement in a short article, \\"The Concept of Culture and the Social System\\", which became highly influential.Alfred L. Kroeber and Talcott Parsons, \\"The Concept of Culture and the Social System.\\" American Sociological Review, Vol.23. No.5. 1958. pp. 582‚Äì583. Parsons and Kroeber declared that it is important both to keep a clear distinction between the two concepts and to avoid a methodology by which either would be reduced to the other. Later career =Public conferences= In 1955 to 1956, a group of faculty members at Cornell University met regularly and discussed Parsons' writings. The next academic year, a series of seven widely attended public seminars followed and culminated in a session at which he answered his critics. The discussions in the seminars were summed up in a book edited by Max Black, The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination. It included an essay by Parsons, \\"The Point of View of the Author\\".Max Black (ed.) The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1961. The original edition was published by Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, in 1961. The scholars included in the volume were Edward C. Devereux Jr., Robin M. Williams Jr., Chandler Morse, Alfred L. Baldwin, Urie Bronfenbrenner, Henry A. Landsberger, William Foote Whyte, Black, and Andrew Hacker. The contributions converted many angles including personality theory, organizational theory, and various methodological discussions. Parsons' essay is particularly notable because it and another essay, \\"Pattern Variables Revisited\\",Talcott Parsons, \\"Pattern Variables Revisited: A Response to Robert Dubin.\\" American Sociological Review, Vol.25. no.4. August 1960. both represented the most full-scale accounts of the basic elements of his theoretical strategy and the general principles behind his approach to theory- building when they were published in 1960. One essay also included, in metatheoretical terms, a criticism of the theoretical foundations for so- called conflict theory. =Criticism of theories= From the late 1950s to the student rebellion in the 1960s and its aftermath, Parsons' theory was criticized by some scholars and intellectuals of the left, who claimed that Parsons's theory was inherently conservative, if not reactionary. Gouldner even claimed that Parsons had been an opponent of the New Deal. Parsons' theory was further regarded as unable to reflect social change, human suffering, poverty, deprivation, and conflict. Theda Skocpol thought that the apartheid system in South Africa was the ultimate proof that Parsons's theory was \\"wrong\\".Theda Skocpol, States and Social Revolution. London: Cambridge University Press, 1979. p.xii. At the same time, Parsons' idea of the individual was seen as \\"oversocialized\\", \\"repressive\\", or subjugated in normative \\"conformity\\". In addition, J√ºrgen HabermasJ√ºrgen Habermas, \\"Talcott Parsons: Problems of Theory Construction\\". Sociological Inquiry. vol. 51. no. 3‚Äì4. 1981. and countless others were of the belief that Parsons' system theory and his action theory were inherently opposed and mutually hostile and that his system theory was especially \\"mechanical\\", \\"positivistic\\", \\"anti- individualistic\\", \\"anti-voluntaristic\\", and \\"de-humanizing\\" by the sheer nature of its intrinsic theoretical context. By the same token, his evolutionary theory was regarded as \\"uni-linear\\", \\"mechanical\\", \\"biologistic\\", an ode to world system status quo, or simply an ill-concealed instruction manual for \\"the capitalist nation-state\\". The first manifestations of that branch of criticism would be intellectuals like Lewis Coser,Lewis Coser, The Function of Social Conflict. New York: The Free Press, 1956.

London: Heineman, 1970. =Democrat supporter= Parsons supported John F. Kennedy on November 8, 1960; from 1923, with one exception, Parsons voted for Democrats all his life.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \\"The Political Orientation of Talcott Parsons: The Second World War and its Aftermath\\". In Roland Robertson and Bryan S. Turner (ed.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity. London: Sage Publications, 1991. He discussed the Kennedy election widely in his correspondence at the time. Parsons was especially interested in the symbolic implications involved in the fact of Kennedy's Catholic background for the implications for the United States as an integral community. (It was the only time a Catholic became President of the United States.) In a letter to Robert N. Bellah, he wrote, \\"I am sure you have been greatly intrigued by the involvement of the religious issue in our election.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, November 25, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Parsons, who described himself as a \\"Stevenson Democrat\\", was especially enthusiastic that his favored politician, Adlai Stevenson II, had been appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Parsons had supported Stevenson in both 1952 and 1956 and was greatly disappointed that Stevenson lost heavily both times. =Modernization theory influence= In the early 1960s, it became obvious that his ideas had a great impact on much of the theories of modernization at the time. His influence was very extensive but at the same time, the concrete adoption of his theory was often quite selective, half-hearted, superficial, and eventually confused. Many modernization theorists never used the full power of Parsons' theory but concentrated on some formalist formula, which often was taken out of the context that had the deeper meaning with which Parsons originally introduced them. In works by Gabriel A. Almond and James S. Coleman, Karl W. Deutsch, S. N. Eisenstadt, Seymour Martin Lipset, Samuel P. Huntington, David E. Apter, Lucian W. Pye, Sidney Verba, and Chalmers Johnson, and others, Parsons' influence is clear. Indeed, it was the intensive influence of Parsons' ideas in political sociology that originally got scholar William Buxton interested in his work.William Buxton, Talcott Parsons and the Capitalist Nation-State. University of Toronto Press, 1985. p. x. In addition, David Easton would claim that in the history of political science, the two scholars who had made any serious attempt to construct a general theory for political science on the issue of political support were Easton and Parsons.David Easton, \\"Theoretical Approaches to Political Support.\\" Canadian Journal of Political Science, IX, no.3. September 1976. p. 431. =Interest in religion= One of the scholars with whom he corresponded extensively with during his lifetime and whose opinion he highly valued was Robert N. Bellah. Parsons's discussion with Bellah would cover a wide range of topics, including the theology of Paul Tillich.Letter from Robert N. Bellah to Talcott Parsons, March 23, 1959. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. The correspondence would continue when Bellah, in the early fall of 1960, went to Japan to study Japanese religion and ideology. In August 1960, Parsons sent Bellah a draft of his paper on \\"The Religious Background of the American Value System\\" to ask for his commentary.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, August 19, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection, Harvard University Archives. In a letter to Bellah of September 30, 1960, Parsons discussed his reading of Perry Miller's An Errand into the Wilderness.Perry Miller, Errand into the Wilderness. Harvard University Press, 1956. Parsons wrote that Miller's discussion of the role of Calvinism \\"in the early New England theology... is a first rate and fit beautifully with the broad position I have taken.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, September 30, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Miller was a literary Harvard historian whose books such as The New England MindPerry Miller, The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1983. established new standards for the writing of American cultural and religious history. Miller remained one of Parsons' most favoured historians throughout his life. Indeed, religion had always a special place in Parsons' heart, but his son, in an interview, maintained that he that his father was probably not really \\"religious.\\" Throughout his life, Parsons interacted with a broad range of intellectuals and others who took a deep interest in religious belief systems, doctrines, and institutions. One notable person who interacted with Parsons was Marie Augusta Neal, a nun of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur who sent Parsons a huge number of her manuscripts and invited him to conferences and intellectual events in her Catholic Church. Neal received her PhD from Harvard under Parsons's supervision in 1963, and she would eventually become professor and then chair of sociology at Emmanuel College in Boston. She was very enthusiastic about the Second Vatican Council and became known for the National Sisters Survey, which aimed at improving women's position in the Catholic Church. =Criticism of Riesman= Parsons and Winston White cowrote an article, \\"The Link Between Character and Society\\", which was published in 1961.Talcott Parsons and Winston White, \\"The Link Between Character and Society.\\" In Seymour Martin Lipset and Leo Lowenthal (ed.) Culture and Social Character. New York: The Free Press, 1961. Also reprinted in Talcott Parsons, Social Structure and Personality. New York: The Free Press, 1964. It was a critical discussion of David Riesman's The Lonely Crowd,David Riesman, Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney, The Lonely Crowd. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1950. which had been published a decade earlier and had turned into an unexpected bestseller, reaching 1 million sold copies in 1977. Riesman was a prominent member of the American academic left, influenced by Erich Fromm and the Frankfurt School. In reality, Riesman's book was an academic attempt to give credit to the concept of \\"mass society\\" and especially to the idea of an America suffocated in social conformity. Riesman had essentially argued that at the emerging of highly advanced capitalism, the America basic value system and its socializing roles had change from an \\"inner-directed\\" toward an \\"other-directed\\" pattern of value-orientation. Parsons and White challenged Riesman's idea and argued that there had been no change away from an inner-directed personality structure. The said that Riesman's \\"other-directness\\" looked like a caricature of Charles Cooley's looking-glass self,Charles H. Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order. New York: Scribner's, 1902. pp. 183‚Äì184. and they argued that the framework of \\"institutional individualism\\" as the basic code-structure of America's normative system had essentially not changed. What had happen, however, was that the industrialized process and its increased pattern of societal differentiation had changed the family's generalized symbolic function in society and had allowed for a greater permissiveness in the way the child related to its parents. Parsons and White argued that was not the prelude to greater \\"otherdirectness\\" but a more complicated way by which inner-directed pattern situated itself in the social environment. =Political power and social influence= 1963 was a notable year in Parsons's theoretical development because it was the year when he published two important articles: one on political powerTalcott Parsons, \\"On the Concept of Political Power\\". Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 107 (1963). Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, Politics and Social Structure. New York: Free Press, 1969. and one on the concept of social influence.Talcott Parsons, \\"On the Concept of Influence.\\" Public Opinion Quarterly Spring 1963. Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, Sociological Theory and Modern Society. New York: The Free Press, 1967. Also published in Talcott Parsons, Politics and Social Structure. New York: The Free Press, 1969. The two articles represented Parsons's first published attempt to work out the idea of Generalized Symbolic Media as an integral part of the exchange processes within the AGIL system. It was a theoretical development, which Parsons had worked on ever since the publication of Economy and Society (1956). The prime model for the generalized symbolic media was money and Parsons was reflecting on the question whether the functional characteristics of money represented an exclusive uniqueness of the economic system or whether it was possible to identify other generalized symbolic media in other subsystems as well. Although each medium had unique characteristics, Parsons claimed that power (for the political system) and influence (for the societal community) had institutional functions, which essentially was structurally similar to the general systemic function of money. Using Roman Jakobson's idea of \\"code\\" and \\"message\\", Parsons divided the components of the media into a question of value-principle versus coordination standards for the \\"code-structure\\" and the question of factor versus product control within those social process which carried the \\"message\\" components. While \\"utility\\" could be regarded as the value-principle for the economy (medium: money), \\"effectiveness\\" was the value-principle for the political system (by political power) and social solidarity for the societal community (by social influence). Parsons would eventually chose the concept of value-commitment as the generalized symbolic medium for the fiduciary system with integrity as the value principle.Talcott Parsons, \\"On the Concept of Value-Commitment.\\" Sociological Inquiry 38. No.2. Spring 1968. pp. 135‚Äì160. Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, Politics and Social Structure. New York: The Free Press, 1969. =Contacts with other scholars= In August 1963, Parsons got a new research assistant, Victor Lidz, who would become an important collaborator and colleague. In 1964, Parsons flew to Heidelberg to celebrate the 100th birthday of Weber and discuss Weber's work with Habermas, Herbert Marcuse, and others.Otto Stammler (ed.), Max Weber and Sociology Today. New York: Harper & Row, 1971. Parsons delivered his paper \\"Evaluation and Objectivity in Social Science: An Interpretation of Max Weber's Contribution.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"Evaluation and Objectivity in Social Science: An Interpretation of Max Weber's Contribution.\\" in Talcott Parsons, Sociological Theory and Modern Society.New York: Free Press, 1967. pp. 79‚Äì101. (Originally delivered at the Weber Centennial, April 1964, Heidelberg.) The meeting became in reality a clash between pro-Weberian scholars and the Frankfurt School. Before leaving for Germany, Parsons discussed the upcoming meeting with Reinhard Bendix and commented, \\"I am afraid I will be something of a Daniel in the Lion's den.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Reinhard Bendix, April 6, 1964. Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. Bendix wrote back and told Parsons that Marcuse sounded very much like Christoph Steding, a Nazi philosopher.Letter from Reinhard Bendix to Talcott Parsons, April 6, 1964. Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. Parsons conducted a persistent correspondence with noted scholar Benjamin Nelson,For a discussion of Nelson, see Donald A. Nielsen, \\"Rationalization, Transformations of Consciousness and Intercivilizational Encounters: Reflections on Benjamin Nelson's Sociology of Civilizations.\\" International Sociology, Vol. 16. no. 3. September 2001: 406‚Äì420. and they shared a common interest in the rise and the destiny of civilizations until Nelson's death in 1977. The two scholars also shared a common enthusiasm for the work of Weber and would generally agree on the main interpretative approach to the study of Weber. Nelson had participated in the Weber Centennial in Heidelberg. Parsons was opposed to the Vietnam War but was disturbed by what he considered the anti-intellectual tendency in the student rebellion: that serious debate was often substituted by handy slogans from communists Karl Marx, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro. =Opposition to the Frankfurt School= Nelson got into a violent argument with Herbert Marcuse and accused him of tarnishing Weber.For Nelson's written critique of Marcuse, see \\"Discussion of Industrialization and Capitalism by Herbert Marcuse.\\" In Otto Stammer (ed.) Max Weber and Sociology Today. New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1971. (Originally in German in 1965). In reading the written version of Nelson's contribution to the Weber Centennial, Parsons wrote, \\"I cannot let the occasion pass without a word of congratulations which is strong enough so that if it were concert I should shout bravo.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Benjamin Nelson, February 13, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. In several letters, Nelson would keep Parsons informed of the often-turbulent leftist environment of Marcuse.Letter from Benjamin Nelson to Talcott Parsons, September 18, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. In the letter of September 1967, Nelson would tell Parsons how much he enjoyed reading Parsons' essay on Kinship and The Associational Aspect of Social Structure.Letter from Benjamin Nelson to Talcott Parsons, September 15, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Also, one of the scholars on whose work Parsons and Nelson would share internal commentaries was Habermas. =Ethnicity, kinship, and diffuse solidarity= Parsons had for years corresponded with his former graduate student David M. Schneider, who had taught at the University of California Berkeley until the latter, in 1960, accepted a position as professor in anthropology at the University of Chicago. Schneider had received his PhD at Harvard in social anthropology in 1949 and had become a leading expert in the American kinship system. Schneider, in 1968, published American Kinship: A Cultural AccountDavid M. Schneider, American Kinship: A Cultural Account Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice-Hall, 1968. that became a classic within the field, and he had sent Parsons a copy of the copyedited manuscript before its publication. Parsons was highly appreciative of Schneider's work, which became in many ways a crucial turing point in his own attempt to understand the fundamental elements of the American kinship system, a key to understanding the factor of ethnicity and especially building the theoretical foundation of his concept of the societal community, which, by the beginning of the early 1970s, had become a strong priority in the number of theoretical projects of his own intellectual life. Parsons borrowed the term \\"diffuse enduring solidarity\\" from Schneider, as a major concept for his own considerations on the theoretical construction of the concept of the societal community. In the spring of 1968, Parsons and Schneider had discussed Clifford Geertz's article on religion as a cultural systemClifford Geertz, \\"Religion as a Cultural System\\" in Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures. New York: Basic Books, 1973. pp. 87‚Äì125. Originally published in 1966. on which Parsons wrote a review.Talcott Parsons, \\"Comment on 'Religion as a Cultural System' by Clifford Geertz\\". in Donald R. Cutler (ed.) The Religious Situation, 1968. Boston: Beason,1968. Parsons, who was a close friend of Geertz, was puzzled over Geertz's article. In a letter to Schneider, Parsons spoke about \\"the rather sharp strictures on what he [Geertz] calls the extremely narrow intellectual tradition with special reference to Weber, but also to Durkheim. My basic point is in this respect, he greatly overstated his case seeming to argue that this intellectual tradition was by now irrelevant.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to David Schneider, April 25, 1968. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. Schneider wrote back to Parsons, \\"So much, so often, as I read Cliff's stuff I cannot get a clear consistent picture of just what the religious system consist in instead only how it is said to work.\\"Letter from David M. Schneider to Talcott Parsons, April 28, 1968. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. In a letter of July 1968 to Gene Tanke of the University of California Press, Parsons offered a critical note on the state of psychoanalytical theory and wrote: \\"The use of psychoanalytical theory in interpretation of social and historical subject matter is somewhat hazardous enterprise, and a good deal of nonsense has been written in the name of such attempts.\\"Letter from Talcott Parsons to Gene Tanke, the University of California Press, July 25, 1968. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. Around 1969, Parsons was approached by the prestigious Encyclopedia of the History of Idea about writing an entry in the encyclopedia on the topic of the \\"Sociology of Knowledge\\". Parsons accepted and wrote one of his most powerful essays, \\"The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas\\",Talcott Parsons, \\"The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas\\". In Helmut Staubmann (ed.)Action Theory: Methodological Studies. LIT Verlag, Wien, 2006. in 1969 or 1970. Parsons discussed how the sociology of knowledge, as a modern intellectual discipline, had emerged from the dynamics of European intellectual history and had reached a kind of cutting point in the philosophy of Kant and further explored by Hegel but reached its first \\"classical\\" formulation in the writing of Mannheim,Karl Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936 [1929]. whose brilliance Parsons acknowledged but disagreed with his German historicism for its antipositivistic epistemology; that was largely rejected in the more positivistic world of American social science. For various reasons, the editors of the encyclopedia turned down Parsons' essay, which did not fit the general format of their volume. The essay was not published until 2006.Victor Lidz, \\"Talcott Parsons' \\"Sociology of Knowledge: Introductory Comments\\". In Helmut Staubmann (ed.) Action Theory: Methodological Studies. LIT verlag, Wien 2006. Parsons had several conversations with Daniel Bell on a \\"post-industrial society\\", some of which were conducted over lunch at William James Hall. After reading an early version of Bell's magnum opus, \\"The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society\\", Parsons wrote a letter to Bell, dated November 30, 1971, to offer his criticism. Among his many critical points, Parsons stressed especially that Bell's discussion of technology tended to \\"separate off culture\\" and treat the two categories \\"as what I would call culture minus the cognitive component.\\" Parsons' interest in the role of ethnicity and religion in the genesis of social solidarity within the local community heavily influenced another of his early 1960s graduate students, Edward Laumann. As a student, Laumann was interested in the role of social network structure in shaping community-level solidarity. Combining Parsons' interest in the role of ethnicity in shaping local community solidarity with W. Lloyd Warner's structural approach to social class, Laumann argued that ethnicity, religion, and perceived social class all play a large role in structuring community social networks.Edward O. Laumann. (1965). \\"Subjective Social Distance and Urban Occupational Stratification\\". American Journal of Sociology, 71:26‚Äì36.Edward O Laumann. (1973). Bonds of Pluralism: The Form and Substance of Urban Social Networks. New York: Wiley Interscience.Edward O. Laumann, Richard Senter. (1976). \\"Subjective Social Distance, Occupational Stratification, and Forms of Status and Class Consciousness: A Cross-national Replication and Extension\\". American Journal of Sociology 81:1304‚Äì1338. Laumann's work found that community networks are highly partitioned along lines of ethnicity, religion, and occupational social status. It also highlighted the tension individuals experience between their preference to associate with people who are like them (homophily) and their simultaneous desire to affiliate with higher-status others. Later, at the beginning of his career at the University of Chicago, Laumann would argue that how the impulses are resolved by individuals forms the basis of corporate or competitive class consciousness within a given community.Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-Year Retrospective on Doing Networks\\". Connections 27:65‚Äì90. In addition to demonstrating how community solidarity can be conceptualized as a social network and the role of ethnicity, religion, and class in shaping such networks, Laumann's dissertation became one of the first examples of the use of population-based surveys in the collection of social network data, and thus a precursor to decades of egocentric social network analysis.Freeman, Linton C. The Development of Social Network Analysis. Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2004. Parsons thus played an important role in shaping social network analysis's early interest in homophily and the use of egocentric network data to assess group- and community-level social network structures. =Systems theory on biological and social systems= In his later years, Parsons became increasingly interested in working out the higher conceptual parameters of the human condition, which was in part what led him toward rethinking questions of cultural and social evolution and the \\"nature\\" of telic systems, the latter which he especially discussed with Bellah, Lidz, Fox, Willy de Craemer, and others. Parsons became increasingly interested in clarifying the relationship between biological and social theory. Parsons was the initiator of the first Daedalus conference on \\"Some Relations between Biological and Social Theory\\", sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Parsons wrote a memorandum dated September 16, 1971, in which he spelled out the intellectual framework for the conference. As Parsons explained in the memo, the basic goal of the conference was to establish a conceptual fundament for a theory of living systems. The first conference was held on January 7, 1972. Among the participants beside Parsons and Lidz were Ernst Mayr, Seymour Kety, Gerald Holton, A. Hunter Dupree, and William K. Wimsatt. A second Daedalus Conference on Living Systems was held on March 1‚Äì2, 1974 and included Edward O. Wilson, who was about to publish his famous work on sociobiology. Other new participants were John T. Bonner, Karl H. Pribram, Eric Lennenberg, and Stephen J. Gould. =Sociology of law= Parsons began in the fall of 1972 to conduct a seminar on \\"Law and Sociology\\" with legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, well known for his book The Morality of Law (1964). The seminar and conversations with Fuller stimulated Parsons to write one of his most influential articles, \\"Law as an Intellectual Stepchild\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"Law as an Intellectual Stepchild\\" Sociological Inquiry Vol.47. Nos 3‚Äì4, 1977. Parsons discuses Roberto Mangabeira Unger's Law in Modern Society (1976). Another indication of Parsons' interest in law was reflected in his students, such as John Akula, who wrote his dissertation in sociology, Law and the Development of Citizenship (1973). In September 1972, Parsons participated in a conference in Salzburg on \\"The Social Consequences of Modernization in Socialist Countries\\". Among the other participants were Alex Inkeles, Ezra Vogel, and Ralf Dahrendorf. =Criticism of Bendix= In 1972, Parsons wrote two review articles to discuss the work of Bendix, which provide a clear statement on Parsons' approach to the study of Weber. Bendix had become well known for his interpretations of Weber. In the first review article, Parsons analyzed the immigrant Bendix's Embattled Reason,Reinhard Bendix, Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge. New York: Oxford University Press, 1970. and he praised its attempt to defend the basic values of cognitive rationality, which he unconditionally shared, and he agreed with Bendix that the question of cognitive rationality was primarily a cultural issue, not a category that could be reduced from biologial, economic, and social factors. However, Parsons criticized how Bendix had proceeded, who he felt especially had misrepresented the work of Freud and Durkheim. Parsons found that the misrepresentation was how Bendix tended to conceive the question of systematic theorizing, under the concept of \\"reductionism\\".Talcott Parsons, Review essay: Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge, by Reinhard Bendix. The American Journal of Sociology. Vol.77. no.4. January 1972. pp. 766‚Äì768. Parsons further found that Bendix approach suffered from a \\"conspicuous hostility\\" to the idea of evolution. Although Parsons assessed that Weber rejected the linear evolutionary approaches of Marx and Herbert Spencer, Weber may not have rejected the question of evolution as a generalized question. In a second article, a review of Bendix and Guenther Roth's Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber,Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth, Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber. University of California Press, 1970. Parsons continued his line of criticism. Parsons was especially concerned with a statement by Bendix that claimed Weber believed Marx's notion that ideas were \\"the epiphenomena of the organization of production.\\" Parsons strongly rejected that interpretation: \\"I should contend that certainly the intellectual 'mature' Weber never was an 'hypothetical' Marxist.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"Review of Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber, by Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth\\". Contemporary Sociology, Vol.1.no.3. May 1972. pp. 200‚Äì203. Somewhere behind the attitudes of Bendix, Parsons detected a discomfort for the former to move out of an \\"idiographic\\" mode of theorizing. =Study of US university= In 1973, Parsons published The American University, which he had authored with Gerald M. Platt.Talcott Parsons and Gerald M. Platt, The American University. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973. The idea had originally emerged when Martin Meyerson and Stephen Graubard of the American Academy of the Art and Sciences, in 1969, asked Parsons to undertake a monographic study of the American university system. The work on the book went on for years until it was finished in June 1972. From a theoretical point of view, the book had several functions. It substantiated Parsons' concept of the educational revolution, a crucial component in his theory of the rise of the modern world. What was equally intellectually compelling, however, was Parsons' discussion of \\"the cognitive complex\\", aimed at explaining how cognitive rationality and learning operated as an interpenetrative zone on the level of the general action-system in society. In retrospect, the categories of the cognitive complex are a theoretical foundation to understand what has been called the modern knowledge-based society. Retirement He officially retired from Harvard in 1973 but continued his writing, teaching, and other activities in the same rapid pace as before. Parsons also continued his extensive correspondence with a wide group of colleagues and intellectuals. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Rutgers University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California at Berkeley. At Parsons' retirement banquet, on May 18, 1973, Robert K. Merton was asked to preside, while John Riley, Bernard Barber, Jesse Pitts, Neil J. Smelser, and John Akula were asked to share their experiences of the man with the audience. =Brown seminars= One scholar who became important in Parsons' later years was professor Martin U. Martel, of Brown University. They had made contact in the early 1970s at a discussion of an article that Martel had written about Parsons' work.Martin U. Martel, \\"Academentia Praecox: The Scope of Parsons' Multi-systemic Language Rebellion\\". In Herman Turk and Richard L. Simpson (eds.) Institutions and Social Exchange: The Sociologies of Talcott Parsons and George C. Homans. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1971. pp. 175‚Äì211. Martel arranged a series of seminars at Brown University in 1973 to 1974, and Parsons spoke about his life and work and answered questions from students and faculty.A Seminar with Talcott Parsons at Brown University: \\"My Life and Work\\", March 10, 1973. In Laurence S. Moss and Andrew Savchenko (ed.) Talcott Parsons: Economic Sociologist of the 20th Century. Blackwell, 2006. Among the participants at the seminars were Martel, Robert M. Marsh, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, C. Parker Wolf, Albert F. Wessen, A. Hunter Dupree, Philip L. Quinn, Adrian Hayes and Mark A. Shields. In February to May 1974, Parsons also gave the Culver Lectures at Brown and spoke on \\"The Evolution of Society\\". The lectures and were videotaped. =Refinement of AGIL model= Late in life, Parsons began to work out a new level of the AGIL model, which he called \\"A Paradigm of the Human Condition\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"A Paradigm of the Human Condition\\" in Talcott Parsons, Action Theory and the Human Condition. New York: Free Press, 1978. The new level of the AGIL model crystallized in the summer of 1974. He worked out the ideas of the new paradigm with a variety of people but especially Lidz, Fox and Harold Bershady. The new metaparadigm featured the environment of the general action system, which included the physical system, the biological system, and what Parsons called the telic system. The telic system represents the sphere of ultimate values in a sheer metaphysical sense. Parsons also worked toward a more comprehensive understanding of the code- structure of social systemsTalcott Parsons, \\"Action, Symbols and Cybernetic Control\\". in Ino Rossi (ed.) Structural Sociology. New York: Columbia University Press, 1982. and on the logic of the cybernetic pattern of control facilitating the AGIL model. He wrote a bulk of notes: two being \\"Thoughts on the Linking of Systems\\" and \\"Money and Time\\".Letter from Talcott Parsons to Adrian Hayes, March 20, 1979. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. He had also extensive discussions with Larry Brownstein and Adrian Hayes on the possibility of a mathematical formalization of Parsons' theory.Letter from Adrian Hayes to Talcott Parsons, March 28, 1975. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. =Sick role theory= Parsons had worked intensively with questions of medical sociology, the medical profession, psychiatry, psychosomatic problems, and the questions of health and illness. Most of all Parsons had become known for his concept of \\"the Sick role\\". The last field of social research was an issue that Parsons constantly developed through elaboration and self-criticism. Parsons participated at the World Congress of Sociology in Toronto in August 1974 at which he presented a paper, \\"The Sick Role Revisited: A Response to Critics and an Updating in Terms of the Theory of Action\\", which was published under a slightly different title, \\"The Sick Role and the Role of the Physician Reconsidered\\", in 1975.Talcott Parsons, \\"The Sick Role and the Role of the Physician Reconsidered\\". Millbank Memorial Fund Quarterly vol.53.no.3. Summer 1975. pp. 257‚Äì278. In his essay, Parsons highlighted that his concept of \\"sick role\\" never was meant to be confined to \\"deviant behavior\\", but \\"its negative valuation should not be forgotten.\\" It was also important to keep a certain focus on the \\"motivatedness\\" of illness since there always is a factor of unconscious motivation in the therapeutic aspects of the sick role. =Criticism of broken covenant theory= In 1975, Bellah published The Broken Covenant.Robert N. Bellah, The Broken Covenant: American Civil Religion in Time of Trial. New York: Seabury Press, 1975. Bellah referred was the sermon delivered by John Winthrop (1587‚Äì1649) to his flock on the ship Arbella on the evening of the landing in Massachusetts Bay in 1630. Winthrop declared that the Puritan colonists' emigration to the New World was part of a covenant, a special pact with God, to create a holy community and noted: \\"For we must consider that we shall be a city on the hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.\\" Parsons disagreed strongly with Bellah's analysis and insisted that the covenant was not broken. Parsons later used much of his influential article, \\"Law as an Intellectual Stepchild\\",Talcott Parsons, \\"Law as an Intellectual Stepchild\\" in Harry M. Johnson (ed.) System and Legal Process San Francisco, 1978 to discuss Bellah's position. Parsons thought that Bellah trivialized the tensions of individual interests and society's interests by reducing them to \\"capitalism\\"; Bellah, in his characterization of the negative aspects of American society, was compelled by a charismatic-based optimalism moral absolutism. =Symbolic interactionism= In 1975, Parsons responded to an article by Jonathan H. Turner, \\"Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction Theory\\".Jonathan Turner, \\"Parsons as a symbolic interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction theory\\". Sociological Inquiry Vol.44. no.4. 1974. Parsons acknowledged that action theory and symbolic interactionism should not be regarded as two separate, antagonistic positions but have overlapping structures of conceptualization.Talcott Parsons, \\"Comment on 'Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist' by Jonathan Turner.Sociological Inquiry. Vol.45. no.1. 1975. pp. 62‚Äì65. Parsons regarded symbolic interactionism and the theory of George Herbert Mead as valuable contributions to action theory that specify certain aspects of the theory of the personality of the individual. Parsons, however, criticized the symbolic interactionism of Herbert Blumer since Blumer's theory had no end to the openness of action. Parsons regarded Blumer as the mirror image of Claude L√©vi-Strauss,Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Garden City, New York, 1963. who tended to stress the quasi-determined nature of macro-structural systems. Action theory, Parsons maintained, represented a middle ground between both extremes. =Review of Piaget= In 1976, Parsons was asked to contribute to a volume to celebrate the 80th birthday of Jean Piaget. Parsons contributed with an essay, \\"A Few Considerations on the Place of Rationality in Modern Culture and Society\\". Parsons characterized Piaget as the most eminent contributor to cognitive theory in the 20th century. However, he also argued that the future study of cognition had to go beyond its narrow encounter with psychology to aim at a higher understanding of how cognition as a human intellectual force was entangled in the processes of social and cultural institutionalization.Talcott Parsons, \\"A Few Considerations on the Place of Rationality in Modern Culture and Society\\". Revue europ√©enne des sciences sociales. Tome XIV, No.38‚Äì39, 1976. In 1978, when James Grier Miller published his famous work Living Systems,James Grier Miller, Living Systems. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978. Parsons was approached by Contemporary Sociology to write a review article on Miller's work. Parsons had already complained in a letter to A. Hunter DupreeLetter from Talcott Parsons to A. Hunter Dupree, January 10, 1979. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives. that American intellectual life suffered from a deep-seated tradition of empiricism and saw Miller's book the latest confirmation of that tradition. In his review, \\"Concrete Systems and \\"Abstracted Systems\\",Talcott Parsons, \\"Review Essay: Concrete Systems and Abstracted Systems\\". Contemporary Sociology Vol.8, No.5, 1979. pp. 696‚Äì705. he generally praised the herculean task behind Miller's work but criticized Miller for getting caught in the effort of hierarchize concrete systems but underplay the importance of structural categories in theory building. Parsons also complained about Miller's lack of any clear distinction between cultural and non-cultural systems. =Lectures in Japan= Japan had long been a keen interest in Parsons' work. As early as 1958, a Japanese translation of Economy and Society appeared. Also, The Structure of Social Action was translated into Japanese.William J. Buxton, \\"Talcott Parsons and Japan in the 1970s\\". The American Sociologist Summer 2000. The Social System was translated into Japanese by Tsutomu Sato in 1974. Indeed, Ryozo Takeda had, as early as 1952 in his Shakaigaku no Kozo (\\"The Framework of Sociology\\") introduced Japanese scholars to some of Parsons' ideas. Parsons had visited Japan for the first time in 1972 and he gave a lecture on November 25 to the Japanese Sociological Association, \\"Some Reflections on Post-Industrial Society\\" that was published in The Japanese Sociological Review.Talcott Parsons, \\"Some Reflections on Post-Industrial Society\\". The Japanese Sociological Review. 24, 2. September 1973. pp.103‚Äì109. At the same time, Parsons participated in an international symposium on \\"New Problems of Advanced Societies\\", held in Tokyo, and he wrote short articles written that appeared in the proceedings of the symposium.Talcott Parsons, \\"The Problem of Balancing Rational Efficiency with Communal Solidarity in Modern Society\\" in International Symposium on New Problems of Advanced Society. Tokyo: Japan Economic Research Institute, 1973. pp. 9‚Äì14.Talcott Parsons, \\"Nature and Extent of Changes in Value Systems of Modern Societies.\\" International Symposium on New Problems of Advanced Society. Tokyo: Japan Economic Research Institute, 1973. pp. 137‚Äì142. Tominaga, born in 1931, a leading figure in Japanese sociology and a professor at the University of Tokyo, was asked by Lidz to contribute to a two-volume collection of essays to honor Parsons. Tominaga wrote an essay on the industrial growth model of Japan and used Parsons' AGIL model.Ken'ichi Tominaga, \\"Growth, Development, and Structural Change of the Social System.\\" in Jan J. Loubser, Rainer V. Baum, Andrew Effrat and Victor M. Lidz (eds.) Explorations in General Theory in Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons. Vol.2. New York: The Free Press, 1976. In 1977, Washio Kurata, the new dean of the Faculty of Sociology of Kwansei Gakuin University, wrote to Parsons and invited him to visit Japan during the 1978‚Äì1979 academic year. In early spring, Parsons accepted the invitation, and on October 20, 1978, Parsons arrived at the Osaka Airport, accompanied by his wife, and was greeted royally by a large entourage. Parsons began weekly lectures at Kwansei's sociology department from October 23 to December 15. Parsons gave his first public lecture to a huge mass of undergraduates, \\"The Development of Contemporary Sociology\\". Professor Hideichiro Nakano served as an interpreter. On November 17‚Äì18, when the Sengari Seminar House was opened, Parsons was invited as the key speaker at the event and gave two lectures, \\"On the Crisis of Modern Society\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"On the Crisis of Modern Society\\". Transcript of the public lecture given a Sengari House, Kwansei Gakuin University, November 17, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archives. and \\"Modern Society and Religion\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"Modern Society and Religion\\". Transcript of the public lecture given a Sengari House, Kwansei Gakuin University, November 18, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archives. Present were Tominaga, Mutsundo Atarashi, Kazuo Muto, and Hideichiro Nakano. On November 25, lectures at Kobe University were organized by Hiroshi Mannari. Parsons lectured on organization theory to the faculty and the graduate students from the Departments of Economics, Management and Sociology. Also, faculty members from Kyoto and Osaka universities were present. A text was published the next year.Talcott Parsons, \\"An Approach to the Theory of Organizations\\" Organizational Science. Vol.13. no.1. April 1979. On November 30 to December 1, Parsons participated in a Tsukuba University Conference in Tokyo; Parsons spoke on \\"Enter the New Society: The Problem of the Relationship of Work and Leisure in Relation to Economic and Cultural Values\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"Enter the New Society: The Problem of the Relationship of Work and Leisure in Relation to Economic and Cultural Values\\". Transcript of the public lecture given at the Tsukuba Conference, Tsukuba University, December 1, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. On December 5, Parsons gave a lecture at Kyoto University on \\"A Sociologist Looks at Contemporary U.S. Society\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"A Sociologist Looks at Contemporary U.S. Society\\". Transcript of the lecture given at the Kyoto University, December 5, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives. At a special lecture at Osaka on December 12, Parsons spoke, at the suggestion of Tominaga, on \\"Social System Theory and Organization Theory\\" to the Japanese Sociological Association. Earlier that day, Parsons had a discussion with Tominaga at Iwanami Shoten, which was published in a journal SHISO. On December 14, Kwansei Gakuin University granted Parsons an honorary doctor degree. Some of his lectures would be collected into a volume by Kurata and published in 1983. The Parsons flew back to the US in mid-December 1978. As a sign of friendship Hideichiro Nakano sent Parsons a Buddha mask. Parsons had especially been captivated by certain aspects of Zen Buddhism. He told his friends that after his experience in Japan, he was going to reconsider certain aspects of his interpretation of the origins of modern civilizations. Death Parsons died May 8, 1979, in Munich on a trip to Germany, where he was celebrating the 50th anniversary of his degree at Heidelberg. The day before, he had given a lecture on social class to an audience of German intellectuals, including Habermas, Niklas Luhmann and Wolfgang Schluchter. Work Parsons produced a general theoretical system for the analysis of society, which he called \\"theory of action\\", based on the methodological and epistemological principle of \\"analytical realism\\" and on the ontological assumption of \\"voluntaristic action\\".Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937. Parsons' concept of analytical realism can be regarded as a kind of compromise between nominalist and realist views on the nature of reality and human knowledge.Rainer C. Baum and Victor Lidz, \\"Introduction to Meta-Theory\\" in Jan J. Loubser et al. (eds.) Explorations in General Theory in Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons. Volume One. New York: The Free Press, 1976. p. 27. Parsons believed that objective reality can be related to only by a particular encounter of such reality and that general intellectual understanding is feasible through conceptual schemes and theories. Interaction with objective reality on an intellectual level should always be understood as an approach. Parsons often explained the meaning of analytical realism by quoting a statement by Henderson: \\"A fact is a statement about experience in terms of a conceptual scheme.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"On Building Social System Theory: A Personal History\\" in Talcott Parsons, Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory. New York: The Free Press, 1977. p. 27. Generally, Parsons maintained that his inspiration regarding analytical realism had been Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Alfred North WhiteheadFor the complex relationship between Parsons' action theory and Whitehead's philosophy, see Thomas J. Fararo, \\"On the Foundations of the Theory of Action in Whitehead and Parsons\\" in Jan J. Loubser et al. (ed.) Explorations in General Theory in Social Science. New York: The Free Press, 1976. Chapter 5. although he might have gotten the idea much earlier. It is important for Parsons' \\"analytical realism\\" to insist on the reference to an objective reality since he repeatedly highlighted that his concept of \\"analytical realism\\" was very different from the \\"fictionalism\\" of Hans Vaihiger (Hans Vaihinger):Hans Vaihiger, The Philosophy of \\"As If\\". trans. C.K. Cohen. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1952. =The Structure of Social Action= The Structure of Social Action (SSA), Parsons' most famous work, took form piece by piece. Its central figure was Weber, and the other key figures in the discussion were added, little by little, as the central idea took form. One important work that helped Parsons' central argument in was, in 1932, unexpectedly found: √âlie Hal√©vy's La formation du radicalisme philosophique (1901‚Äì1904); he read the three-volume work in French. Parsons explained, \\"Well, Hal√©vy was just a different world ... and helped me to really get in to many clarifications of the assumptions distinctive to the main line of British utilitarian thought; assumptions about the 'natural identity of interest', and so on. I still think it is one of the true masterpieces in intellectual history.\\" Parsons first achieved significant recognition with the publication of The Structure of Social Action (1937), his first grand synthesis, combining the ideas of Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, and others. In 1998, the International Sociology Association listed it as the third most important sociological book of the 20th Century =Action theory= Parsons' action theory can be characterized as an attempt to maintain the scientific rigour of positivism while acknowledging the necessity of the \\"subjective dimension\\" of human action incorporated in hermeneutic types of sociological theories. It is cardinal in Parsons' general theoretical and methodological view that human action must be understood in conjunction with the motivational component of the human act. Social science must consider the question of ends, purpose, and ideals in its analysis of human action. Parsons' strong reaction to behavioristic theory as well as to sheer materialistic approaches derives from the attempt of the theoretical positions to eliminate ends, purpose, and ideals as factors of analysis. Parsons, in his term papers at Amherst, was already criticizing attempts to reduce human life to psychological, biological, or materialist forces. What was essential in human life, Parsons maintained, was how the factor of culture was codified. Culture, however, was to Parsons an independent variable in that it could not be \\"deducted\\" from any other factor of the social system. That methodological intention is given the most elaborate presentation in The Structure of Social Action, which was Parsons' first basic discussion of the methodological foundation of the social sciences. Some of the themes in The Structure of Social Action had been presented in a compelling essay two years earlier in \\"The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory\\".Talcott Parsons, \\"The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory.\\" In Talcott Parsons, The Early Essays. Edited by Charles Camic. Chicago & London: The University of Chicago, 1991. (The essay was originally published in 1935.) An intense correspondence and dialogue between Talcott Parsons and Alfred Schutz serves to highlight the meaning of central concepts in The Structure of Social Action. =Relations to cybernetics and system theory= Parsons developed his ideas during a period when systems theory and cybernetics were very much on the front burner of social and behavioral science. In using systems thinking, he postulated that the relevant systems treated in social and behavioral science were \\"open:\\" they were embedded in an environment with other systems. For social and behavioral science, the largest system is \\"the action system,\\" the interrelated behaviors of human beings, embedded in a physical-organic environment.A good summary of the \\"action frame of reference\\" as it developed over time is found in Leonard Mayhew's introduction to his anthology of Parsons' major essays, Mayhew, Leonard (1982) \\"Introduction\\" in Talcott Parsons, Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution, pp: 1‚Äì62. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. As Parsons developed his theory, it became increasingly bound to the fields of cybernetics and system theory but also to Emerson's concept of homeostasisAlfred E. Emerson, \\"Homeostasis and comparison of systems\\" in Roy R. Grinker (ed.) Toward a Unified Theory of Human Behavior: An Introduction to General Systems Theory.New York: Basic Books, 1956. and Ernst Mayr's concept of \\"teleonomic processes\\".Ernst Mayr, \\"Teleological and teleonomic: A New Analysis.\\" pp. 78‚Äì104 in Marx Wartofsky (ed.) Method and Metaphysics: Methodological and Historical Essays in the Natural and Social Sciences. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1974 On the metatheoretical level, Parson attempted to balance psychologist phenomenology and idealism on the one hand and pure types of what Parsons called the utilitarian- positivistic complex, on the other hand. The theory includes a general theory of social evolution and a concrete interpretation of the major drives of world history. In Parsons' theory of history and evolution, the constitutive- cognitive symbolization of the cybernetic hierarchy of action-systemic levels has, in principle, the same function as genetic information in DNA's control of biological evolution, but that factor of metasystemic control does not \\"determine\\" any outcome but defines the orientational boundaries of the real pathfinder, which is action itself. Parsons compares the constitutive level of society with Noam Chomsky's concept of \\"deep structure\\". As Parsons wrote, \\"The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning. The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs. The connecting link between them is a set of rules of transformation, to use Chomsky's own phase.\\"Talcott Parsons, \\"Action, Symbol, and Cybernetic Control.\\" In Ino Rossi (ed.) Structural Sociology New York: Columbia University Press, 1982. p. 53. The transformative processes and entities are generally, at least on one level of empirical analysis, performed or actualized by myths and religions,Roland Robertson, \\"The Central Significance of 'religion' in Social Theory: Parsons as an epical theorist.\\" In Roland Robertson and Bryan S. Turner (ed.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity London: Sage Publications, 1991. but philosophies, art systems, or even semiotic consumer behavior can, in principle, perform that function.Victor Lidz, \\"Religion and Cybernetic Concepts in the Theory of Action.\\" Sociological Analysis. vol.43.no.4.1982. pp. 287‚Äì306. =Unified concept of social science= Parsons' theory reflects a vision of a unified concept of social science and indeed of living systemsParsons discussed the concept of living systems many times in later life both in publications as well in his correspondence with Dupree, Lidz, Martel, and others. An important discussion of living system is in \\"Concrete Systems and Abstracted\\" Systems: Review article of Living Systems by James Grier Miller\\". Contemporary Sociology Vol.8. no.5. Sep. 1979. pp. 696‚Äì705. in general. His approach differs in essence from Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems because Parsons rejects the idea that systems can be autopoietic, short of the actual action system of individual actors. Systems have immanent capacities but only as an outcome of the institutionalized processes of action-systems, which, in the final analysis, is the historical effort of individual actors. While Luhmann focused on the systemic immanence, Parsons insisted that the question of autocatalytic and homeostatic processes and the question about the actor as the ultimate \\"first mover\\" on the other hand was not mutually exclusive. Homeostatic processes might be necessary if and when they occur but action is necessitating. It is only that perspective of the ultimate reference in action that Parsons' dictum (that higher-order cybernetic systems in history will tend to control social forms that are organized on the lower levels of the cybernetic hierarchy) should be understood. For Parsons, the highest levels of the cybernetic hierarchy as far as the general action level is concerned is what Parsons calls the constitutive part of the cultural system (the L of the L). However, within the interactional processes of the system, attention should be paid especially to the cultural-expressivistic axis (the L-G line in the AGIL). By the term constitutive, Parsons generally referred to very highly codified cultural values especially religious elements (but other interpretation of the term \\"constitutive\\" is possible).The complete structure of Parsons AGIL system was scattered around in dozens of his works and not presented in any handy form. However, the most elementary key elements was presented in chapter 2 in Talcott Parsons and Gerald M. Platt, The American University Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973. To understand the AGIL system, one needs to understand that it functions (in a sense) on three major levels: the highest level is the paradigm of the human condition, the next mediative level is what he calls the general action-system and the third level is the social system. (All three levels are active in any empirical social object at any time). Another important point is that Parsons, in a sense, operates with two cultural systems: there is the cultural system of the general action level and the so-called fiduciary system as the L-function of the social system. Common sense associates both systems with the idea of \\"culture.\\" However, Parsons' separation of \\"culture\\" into the two distinct levels of conceptual analysis is fundamental. Cultural systems have an independent status from that of the normative and orientational pattern of the social system; neither system cannot be reduced to the other. For example, the question of the \\"cultural capital\\" of a social system as a sheer historical entity (in its function as a \\"fiduciary system\\"), is not identical to the higher cultural values of that system; that is, the cultural system is embodied with a metastructural logic that cannot be reduced to any given social system or cannot be viewed as a materialist (or behavioralist) deduction from the \\"necessities\\" of the social system (or from the \\"necessities\\" of its economy).Helmuth Staubmann, \\"Culture as a Subsystem of Action: Talcott Parsons and Cultural Sociology.\\" Presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Atlanta, 2003. Within that context, culture would have an independent power of transition, not only as factors of actual sociocultural units (like Western civilization) but also how original cultural bases would tend to \\"universalize\\" through interpenetration and spread over large numbers of social systems as with Classical Greece and Ancient Israel, where the original social bases had died but the cultural system survived as an independently \\"working\\" cultural pattern, as in the case of Greek philosophy or in the case of Christianity, as a modified derivation from its origins in Israel.Talcott Parsons, Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1966. =Parsons and Habermas= The difference between Parsons and J√ºrgen Habermas lies essentially in how Habermas uses Parsons' theory to establish the basic propositions of his own.J√ºrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action Volume 2. Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason. Boston: Beacon, 1987. (Original, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1981). Habermas takes the division between Parsons' separation between the \\"outer\\" and the \\"inner\\" dimensions of the social system and labels them \\"system\\" (outer dimension (A-G)) and \\"lifeworld\\" (inner dimension (I-L)). The problem with this model from Parsons' point of view is a) that conflict within the social system can in reality emerge from any relational point and not simply from the system-lifeworld dichotomy, and b) by relating the system-lifeworld model to some kind of \\"liberation\\"-epic, Habermas produces the Utopian notion that the potentiality of conflict within the social system has some kind of \\"final solution,\\" which produces a misleading concept of the nature of systemic conflict. =General theory= It is important to highlight that Parsons distinguished two \\"meanings\\" or modes of the term general theory. He sometimes wrote about general theory as aspects of theoretical concerns of social sciences whose focus is on the most \\"constitutive\\" elements of cognitive concern for the basic theoretical systematization of a given field. Parsons would include the basic conceptual scheme for the given field, including its highest order of theoretical relations and naturally also the necessary specification of this system's axiomatic, epistemological, and methodological foundations from the point of view of logical implications.The issues were generally those that Parsons discussed in his first major work: Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937.For another discussion of such questions, see Rainer C. Baum and Victor Lidz, \\"Introduction to Meta-Theory\\" In Jan Loubser et al. (eds.) Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons. New York: The Free Press, 1976 All the elements would signify the quest for a general theory on the highest level of theoretical concern. However, general theory could also refer to a more fully/operational system whose implications of the conceptual scheme were \\"spelled out\\" on lower levels of cognitive structuralization, levels standing closer to a perceived \\"empirical object\\". In his speech to the American Sociological Society in 1947, he spoke of five levels:Talcott Parsons, \\"The Prospects of Sociological Theory\\". (1948). In Talcott Parsons, Essays in Sociological Theory. New York: The Free Press, 1954. # The General Theory level, which took form primarily as a theory of social systems. # The theory of motivation of social behavior, which especially addressed questions of the dynamics of the social system and naturally presupposed theories of motivation, personality and socialization. # The theoretical bases of systematic comparative analysis of social structure, which would involve a study of concrete cultures in concrete systems on various levels of generalization. # Special theories around particular empirical problem areas. # The \\"fitting\\" of the theories to specific empirical research techniques, such as statistics, and survey techniques. During his life, he would work on developing all five fields of theoretical concerns but pay special attention to the development on the highest \\"constitutive\\" level, as the rest of the building would stand or fall on the solidity of the highest level.For one discussion of his efforts, see Jan J. Loubser, \\"General Introduction\\" in Jan Loubser et al. (eds.) Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons. New York: The Free Press, 1976. Despite myths, Parsons never thought that modern societies exist in some kind of perfect harmony with their norms or that most modern societies were necessarily characterized by some high level of consensus or a \\"happy\\" institutional integration. Parsons highlighted that is almost logically impossible that there can be any \\"perfect fit\\" or perfect consensus in the basic normative structure of complex modern societies because the basic value pattern of modern societies is generally differentiated in such a way that some of the basic normative categories exist in inherent or at least potential conflict with each other. For example, freedom and equality are generally viewed as fundamental and non-negotiable values of modern societies. Each represents a kind of ultimate imperative about what the higher values of humanity. However, as Parsons emphasizes, no simple answer on the priority of freedom or equality or any simple solution on how they possibly can be mediated, if at all. Therefore, all modern societies are faced with the inherent conflict prevailing between the two values, and there is no \\"eternal solution\\" as such. There cannot be any perfect match between motivational pattern, normative solutions, and the prevailing value pattern in any modern society. Parsons also maintained that the \\"dispute\\" between \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" has something to do with the fact that they both defend ultimately \\"justified\\" human values (or ideals), which alone is indispensable as values but are always in an endless conflictual position to each other. Parsons always maintained that the integration of the normative pattern in society is generally problematic and that the level of integration that is reached in principle is always far from harmonious and perfect. If some \\"harmonious pattern\\" emerges, it is related to specific historical circumstances but is not a general law of the social systems. =AGIL paradigm= The heuristic scheme that Parsons used to analyze systems and subsystems is called the AGIL paradigm or the AGIL scheme.P. McNeill, C. Townley, Fundamentals of Sociology, (Hutchinson Educational, 1981) To survive or maintain equilibrium with respect to its environment, any system must to some degree adapt to that environment (adaptation), attain its goals (goal attainment), integrate its components (integration), and maintain its latent pattern (latency pattern Maintenance), a sort of cultural template. The concepts can be abbreviated as AGIL and are called the system's functional imperatives. It is important to understand that Parsons AGIL model is an analytical scheme for the sake of theoretical \\"production\\", but it is not any simple \\"copy\\" or any direct historical \\"summary\\" of empirical reality. Also, the scheme itself does not explain \\"anything\\", just as the periodical table nothing by itself in the natural sciences. The AGIL scheme is a tool for explanations and is no better than the quality of the theories and explanation by which it is processed. In the case of the analysis of a social action system, the AGIL paradigm, according to Parsons, yields four interrelated and interpenetrating subsystems: the behavioral systems of its members (A), the personality systems of those members (G), the social system (as such) (I), and the cultural system of that society (L). To analyze a society as a social system (the I subsystem of action), people are posited to enact roles associated with positions. The positions and roles become differentiated to some extent and, in a modern society, are associated with things such as occupational, political, judicial, and educational roles. Considering the interrelation of these specialized roles as well as functionally differentiated collectivities (like firms and political parties), a society can be analyzed as a complex system of interrelated functional subsystems: The pure AGIL model for all living systems: * (A) Adaptation. * (G) Goal attainment. * (I) Integration. * (L) Latency (pattern maintenance). The Social System Level: * The economy ‚Äî social adaptation to its action and non-action environmental systems * The polity ‚Äî collective goal attainment * The societal community ‚Äî the integration of its diverse social components * The fiduciary system ‚Äî processes that function to reproduce historical culture in its \\"direct\\" social embeddedness. The General Action Level: * The behavioral organism (or system), in later versions, the foci for generalized \\"intelligence\\". * The personality system. * The social system. * The cultural system. (See cultural level.) The cultural level: * Cognitive symbolization. * Expressive symbolization. * Evaluative symbolization. (Sometimes called: moral-evaluative symbolization.) * Constitutive symbolization. The Generalized Symbolic media: Social System level: * (A) Economic system: Money. * (G) Political system: Political power. * (I) The Societal Community: Influence. * (L) The Fiduciary system (cultural tradition): Value-commitment. Parsons elaborated upon the idea that each of these systems also developed some specialized symbolic mechanisms of interaction analogous to money in the economy, like influence in the social community. Various processes of \\"interchange\\" among the subsystems of the social system were postulated. Parsons' use of social systems analysis based on the AGIL scheme was established in his work Economy and Society (with N. Smelser, 1956) and has prevailed in all his work ever since. However, the AGIL system existed only in a \\"rudimentary\\" form in the beginning and was gradually elaborated and expanded in the decades which followed. A brief introduction to Parsons' AGIL scheme can be found in Chapter 2 of The American University (with G. Platt, 1973). There is, however, no single place in his writing in which the total AGIL system is visually displayed or explained: the complete system have to be reconstructed from multiple places in his writing. The system displayed in \\"The American University\\" has only the most basic elements and should not be mistaken for the whole system. =Social evolutionism= Parsons contributed to social evolutionism and neoevolutionism. He divided evolution into four sub-processes: # differentiation, which creates functional subsystems of the main system, as discussed above; # adaptation, in which those systems evolve into more efficient versions; # inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; # generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the increasingly-complex system. Furthermore, Parsons explored the sub-processes within three stages of evolution: # primitive, # archaic and # modern Parsons viewed Western civilization as the pinnacle of modern societies and the United States as the one that is most dynamically developed. Parsons' late work focused on a new theoretical synthesis around four functions that he claimed are common to all systems of action, from the behavioral to the cultural, and a set of symbolic media that enables communication across them. His attempt to structure the world of action according to a scheme that focused on order was unacceptable for American sociologists, who were retreating from the grand pretensions of the 1960s to a more empirical, grounded approach. =Pattern variables= Parsons asserted that there are not two dimensions to societies: instrumental and expressive but that there are qualitative differences between kinds of social interaction. He observed that people can have personalized and formally detached relationships, based on the roles that they play. The pattern variables are what he called the characteristics that are associated with each kind of interaction. An interaction can be characterized by one of the identifiers of each contrastive pair: * affectivity ‚Äì affective neutrality * self-orientation ‚Äì collectivity-orientation * universalism ‚Äì particularism * ascription ‚Äì achievement * specificity ‚Äì diffusity Legacy From the 1940s to the 1970s, Parsons was one of the most famous and most influential but also most controversial sociologists in the world, particularly in the US. His later works were met with criticism and were generally dismissed in the 1970s by the view that his theories were too abstract, inaccessible, and socially conservative. Recently, interest has increased in Parsons' ideas and especially often-overlooked later works. Attempts to revive his thinking have been made by Parsonsian sociologists and social scientists like Jeffrey Alexander, Bryan Turner, Richard M√ºnch, and Roland Robertson, and Uta Gerhardt has written about Parsons from a biographical and historical perspective. In addition to the United States, the key centers of interest in Parsons today are Germany, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Parsons had a seminal influence and early mentorship of many American and international scholars, such as Ralf Dahrendorf, Alain Touraine, Niklas Luhmann, and Habermas. His best-known pupil was Merton. Selected bibliography =Author= * 1983.

Raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries are common, widely distributed members of the genus. Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term \\"cane fruit\\" (or \\"cane-fruit\\"), or \\"cane berry\\" (or \\"caneberry\\"), applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.  Overview  Rubus caesius R. arcticus R. odoratus R. saxatilis R. ellipticus var. obcordatus R. ulmifolius R. chamaemorus Most species are hermaphrodites, Rubus chamaemorus being an exception. The blackberries, as well as various other Rubus species with mounding or rambling growth habits, are often called brambles. However, this name is not used for those like the raspberry that grow as upright canes, or for trailing or prostrate species, such as most dewberries, or various low- growing boreal, arctic, or alpine species. The generic name means blackberry in Latin and was derived from the word ruber, meaning \\"red\\". The scientific study of brambles is known as \\"batology\\".

His collection stands at over 200 species and, although not within the scope of the National Collection, he also grows many cultivars.National Collection of Rubus Species, Houghton, England, United Kingdom  Hybrid berries  R. phoenicolasius R. hirsutus The term \\"hybrid berry\\" is often used collectively for those fruits in the genus Rubus which have been developed mainly in the U.S. and U.K. in the last 130 years. As Rubus species readily interbreed and are apomicts (able to set seed without fertilisation), the parentage of these plants is often highly complex, but is generally agreed to include cultivars of blackberries (Rubus ursinus, R. fruticosus) and raspberries (R. idaeus). The hybrid berries include:- * loganberry (California, U.S., 1883) R. √ó loganobaccus, a spontaneous hybrid between R. ursinus 'Aughinbaugh' and R. idaeus 'Red Antwerp' * boysenberry (U.S., 1920s) a hybrid between R. idaeus and R. √ó loganobaccus * olallieberry (U.S., 1930s) a hybrid between the loganberry and youngberry, themselves both hybrid berries * veitchberry (Europe, 1930s) a hybrid between R. fruticosus and R. idaeus * skellyberry (Texas, U.S., 2000s), a hybrid between R. invisus and R. phoenicolasius * marionberry (1956) now thought to be a blackberry cultivar R. 'Marion' * silvanberry, R. 'Silvan', a hybrid between R. 'Marion' and the boysenberry * tayberry (Dundee, Scotland, 1979), another blackberry/raspberry hybrid * tummelberry, R. 'Tummel', from the same Scottish breeding programme as the tayberry * hildaberry (1980s), a tayberry/boysenberry hybrid discovered by an amateur grower * youngberry, a complex hybrid of raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries  Scientific classification  R. caesius R. parviflorus The genus Rubus is a very complex one, particularly the blackberry/dewberry subgenus (Rubus), with polyploidy, hybridization, and facultative apomixis apparently all frequently occurring, making species classification of the great variation in the subgenus one of the grand challenges of systematic botany. Rubus species have a basic chromosome number of seven. Polyploidy from the diploid (14 chromosomes) to the tetradecaploid (98 chromosomes) is exhibited. Some treatments have recognized dozens of species each for what other, comparably qualified botanists have considered single, more variable species. On the other hand, species in the other Rubus subgenera (such as the raspberries) are generally distinct, or else involved in more routine one-or-a-few taxonomic debates, such as whether the European and American red raspberries are better treated as one species or two (in this case, the two-species view is followed here, with Rubus idaeus and R. strigosus both recognized; if these species are combined, then the older name R. idaeus has priority for the broader species). Molecular data have backed up classifications based on geography and chromosome number, but following morphological data, such as the structure of the leaves and stems, do not appear to produce a phylogenetic classification. The classification presented below recognizes 13 subgenera within Rubus, with the largest subgenus (Rubus) in turn divided into 12 sections. Representative examples are presented, but many more species are not mentioned here. A comprehensive 2019 study found subgenera Orobatus and Anoplobatus to be monophyletic, while all other subgenera to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic.

Compare: Steppe biomes may include: * the montane grasslands and shrublands biome * the temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome The prairie of North America (especially the shortgrass and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. A steppe may be semi-arid or covered with grass or with shrubs or with both, depending on the season and latitude. The term \\"steppe climate\\" denotes the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest but not dry enough to be a desert. Steppe soils are typically of the chernozem type. Steppes are usually characterized by a semi- arid or continental climate. Extremes can be recorded in the summer of up to and in winter, . Besides this huge seasonal difference, fluctuation between day and night is also very great. In both the highlands of Mongolia and northern Nevada, can be reached during the day with sub-freezing readings at night. Steppe in Russia Mid-latitude steppes feature hot summers and cold winters, averaging of precipitation per year. Precipitation level alone does not define a steppe climate; potential evapotranspiration also plays a role. Two types Southern Siberian steppe: windbreaker trees in the wintertime Steppe can be classified by climate: * Temperate steppe: the \\"true\\" steppe, found in continental areas of the world; they can be further subdivided, as in the Rocky Mountains Steppes * Subtropical steppe: a similar association of plants that can be found in the driest areas with a Mediterranean-like climate; it usually has a short wet period It can also be classified by vegetation type, e.g. shrub-steppe and alpine-steppe. The Eurasian Grass- Steppe of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands had a role in the spread of the horse, the wheel, and the Indo-European languages. The Indo- European expansion and diverse invasions of horse archer civilizations of the steppe eventually led to the rise of Mycenaean Greece by amalgamation of Indo- Europeans with the autochthonous pre-Greek population and also its destruction during the Dorian invasion in the Late Bronze Age collapse, followed by the demise of the Achaeans, the spread of the Sea Peoples, and eventually the rise of Archaic and ultimately Classical Greece. Locations Cold Patagonian steppe near Fitz Roy, Argentina =Cold steppe= The world's largest steppe region, often referred to as \\"the Great Steppe\\", is found in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and neighbouring countries stretching from Ukraine in the west through Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to the Altai, Koppet Dag and Tian Shan ranges in China. The inner parts of Anatolia in Turkey, Central Anatolia and East Anatolia in particular and also some parts of Southeast Anatolia, as well as much of Armenia and Iran are largely dominated by cold steppe. The Pannonian Plain is another steppe region in Central Europe, primarily Hungary. Prairie in Alberta, Canada Another large steppe area (prairie) is located in the central United States, western Canada and northern part of Mexico. The shortgrass prairie steppe is the westernmost part of the Great Plains region. The Columbia Plateau in Southern British Columbia, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington state, is an example of a steppe region in North America outside of the Great Plains. In South America, cold steppe can be found in Patagonia and much of the high elevation regions east of the southern Andes. Relatively small steppe areas can be found in the interior of the South Island of New Zealand. Sagebrush steppe in northeastern Nevada along US 93 =Subtropical steppe= In Europe, some Mediterranean areas have a steppe-like vegetation, such as central Sicily in Italy, southern Portugal, parts of Greece in the southern Athens area, and central-eastern Spain, especially the southeastern coast (around Murcia), and places cut off from adequate moisture due to rain shadow effects such as Zaragoza. In Asia, a subtropical steppe can be found in semi-arid lands that fringe the Thar Desert of the Indian subcontinent and the Badia of the Arabian peninsula. In Australia, \\"subtropical steppe\\" can be found in a belt surrounding the most severe deserts of the continent and around the Musgrave Ranges. In North America this environment is typical of transition areas between zones with a Mediterranean climate and true deserts, such as Reno, Nevada, the inner part of California, and much of western Texas and adjacent areas in Mexico.

Springer, 1997. The mountain is crowned by a grassy summit which has views over Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the surrounding region. The summit can be reached via the eponymous Wankbahn, a cable car system that runs during the summer months, or by a network of footpaths that criss-cross the area. A mountain hut on the summit, the Wank-Haus, provides food and accommodation, and a nearby scientific observatory plays a role in monitoring atmospheric and climatic conditions. The Wank is a destination for hikers, day-trippers from Garmisch-Partenkirchen and paragliders. Physical characteristics The mountain's geology, which is dominated by calcareous rocks, is typical of the Bavarian Alps. Its climate is also typical of the region. Precipitation is high, ranging from about at valley level to at the summit. It peaks in the summer and is lowest in winter. The Wank's mean annual air temperature ranges from in the valley to at the summit. The prevailing wind comes from a westerly direction but for about 30 to 40 days a year the mountain experiences a warm, dry f√∂hn wind. A local wind system also operates in the area giving a daily uphill/downhill circulation. Inversion layers occur for about 30 days per year, predominantly in the autumn and winter. The Wank was originally covered by a forest consisting of a mix of spruce, fir and beech trees. A process of man-made deforestation that began in the Roman period, when the trees were cut down and the mountain's slopes were grazed by horses, sheep, goats and cattle, resulted in much of the forest being destroyed by the 15th century. Forestry in the area was taken over by the Bavarian government in 1803 but the former forest cover did not regenerate due in part to the continued use of forest lands as pasture, storms and browsing by game animals. As a result, the current Wank forest is predominantly spruce (about 75%) and pine (15%). Forestry programmes are currently underway to improve the arboreal diversity of the mountain.

Nearby is an observatory and the Wank-Haus, also known as the Alois Huber Haus, a mountain hut that provides food and accommodation to visitors. The Wank-Haus was built by the local branch of the German Alpine Association (DAV) in 1911. Its construction was originally proposed in 1894 and was approved by the Bavarian Forest Service in 1903. It was designed by the Partenkirchen DAV's Treasurer, Alois Huber, and work began in July 1910. It was opened on 28 May 1911 and was renamed after Huber following his death in 1922.

Editions  Rolemaster has a total of four editions. = First edition (RM1): 1980‚Äì1982 = This edition includes the original versions of Arms Law, Claw Law, Spell Law, Character Law and Campaign Law. These were available initially as individual books, and later as combined volumes and in boxed sets. = Second edition (RM2): 1984‚Äì1994 = In 1984, an initial boxed set was issued containing both expanded and revised rules. The box included Spell Law, a combined Arms Law & Claw Law, Character Law, as well as the Vog Mur campaign module for the Loremaster setting. Shortly after the first box, a new boxed set was released, containing all of the previous contents as well as The Cloudlords of Tanara, a detailed setting and adventure supplement. The supplement introduced ICE's original Loremaster setting, which would later develop into the more sophisticated Shadow World. Several additional supplementary books were published individually for the second edition, including three Creatures & Treasures books, and a lot of companion books, expanding the core rules. = Rolemaster Standard System: 1994 = In 1994 the game was revamped and re-released as Rolemaster Standard System (RMSS). The biggest changes were to character generation, particularly in the number of skills available and the method for calculating bonuses for skills. Skills were now grouped into Categories of similar skills and one could buy ranks separately in the category and the actual skill. The combat sequence was revised, and some of the details of spellcasting were changed. The method for learning spell lists was completely overhauled and most of the lists were adjusted and rebalanced. The new rules were published in the Rolemaster Standard Rules book from 1995, but as with other editions of the game, a plethora of supplementary rulebooks and accessories were subsequently published. = Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing: 1999 = In 1999 the game underwent a slight restructuring when Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing (RMFRP) was released, but this was mostly a rearranging of material with very few changes to the rules themselves. The older single-volume Spell Law was divided into three separate books, Of Essence, Of Channelling and Of Mentalism, each of which expands that realm of power with additional professions and spell lists. = Variant systems = Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) went defunct in 2000, and sold the intellectual rights of Rolemaster to the London-based company Aurigas Aldebaron in 2001, while the ICE brand name was licensed to a US-based company named Mjolnir LLC. In 2016, the licensing went to Guild Companion Publications, with whom Aurigas Aldebaron merged. From 2017, the merger changed name to Iron Crown Enterprises, effectually returning to the original well-known publisher name. During all these ownership changes and publisher names, Rolemaster remained popular and the original books was eventually sold out and went out of print. This led to both several reprints, by the new owners and publishers, and three variants of the original Rolemaster game systems. In 1995, the boxed set Rolemaster: The Basics was issued as a simplified version of the Rolemaster Standard System. The box contains rulebooks with all rules necessary for playing this simplified variant of the game. In 2007, the second edition rules system was revitalized and issued under the name Rolemaster Classic, or RMC for short. The revitalization was published by Guild Companion Publications and included new versions of all the old core rulebooks of Arms Law, Spell Law, Character Law, and Creatures and Treasures, but also an updated Rolemaster Companion and a new Combat Companion from 2008. Also in 2007, Rolemaster Express, or RMX for short, was issued by Guild Companion Publications. It is a simplified version of the Rolemaster Classic system, with all necessary rules combined in one single book. Basic game mechanics Rolemaster uses two ten-sided dice Rolemaster uses a percentile dice system and employs both classes (called \\"Professions\\" in Rolemaster) and levels to describe character capabilities and advancement. Task resolution is done by rolling percentile dice, applying relevant modifiers, and looking the result up on the appropriate chart to determine the result. There are various charts to increase the realism of the results, but most of these are optional, and many rolls can be made on a relatively small number of tables. =Combat= For combat each character has an Offensive Bonus (OB), which takes into account one's natural physical adeptness, weapon skill, and other factors, and a Defensive Bonus (DB), which takes into account natural agility, the use of shields and \\"Adrenal Defense\\", the ability of martial artists to avoid blows seemingly without effort. In addition various modifiers for position, wounds, and other factors are present. An attacking combatant rolls percentile dice, adds his or her OB to the total, adds modifiers, and subtracts the defender's DB. The total is then applied to a table for the attacker's weapon. The attack total is cross- indexed with the type of armor (if any) worn by the defender and the result will be a number of concussion hits dealt, which are then subtracted from the defender's running total. If sufficient hits are dealt, the defender may go unconscious, but death seldom results purely from concussion hit damage. In addition to concussion hits, however, a critical hit can be dealt by the result on the weapon table. These are described by type (slash, crush, puncture, etc.) and by severity (generally A through E, with E being the most severe). Critical Hits (or simply \\"crits\\"), can inflict additional concussion hits, bleeding (subtracted from concussion hits at the start of each new round), broken bones, loss of limbs or extremities, internal organ damage and outright death. If a crit is inflicted, a second roll is made on the appropriate critical table. Thus, unlike, for example, Dungeons & Dragons, Rolemaster describes wounds not only in the number of points of damage dealt (which are then subtracted from an abstract pool of 'Hit Points'), but with specific details of the injury inflicted. Death occurs, for both player characters and Gamemaster-controlled adversaries, primarily through this critical damage, and not through loss of hit points. In addition, specific injuries carry with them injury penalties, which inhibit further actions on the part of the wounded part, and loss of concussion hits (which represent overall health), can bring about similar penalties. Almost all die rolls in Rolemaster are 'open-ended', meaning that if a result is high enough (or low enough), one rolls again and add (or subtract) the new roll to the original result - and this can happen multiple times, so in theory, there is no upper limit to how well (or poorly) one can roll. This means that a halfling does have a chance, albeit slight, to put down a troll with one well-placed (and lucky) dagger strike. However, the fact that one's opponents also fight using these same rules can make Rolemaster a very deadly game for both PCs and NPCs; a lucky shot may let an inexperienced fighter slay a war-hardened veteran. Fans of the system maintain that this adds a great deal of realism not present in many other fantasy games, and reflects the true deadliness of a well-placed strike from a weapon, even a small one such as a dagger. Death from natural weapons (such as a fist or an animal's teeth and claws) can happen but is very rare against armored combatants. Unarmored characters may very well suffer serious wounds when mauled by animals, but again this allows for more credible confrontations than in other fantasy games, where the threat posed by an \\"unfantastic\\" beast such as a wolf, grizzly bear, or tiger is considered minimal. Because Rolemaster's approach to combat favors a warrior that is properly armed and armored, a character that is poorly equipped (as is typically the case with newly generated characters) is decidedly vulnerable. Such characters can have a tough time prevailing against even fairly mundane opponents. This can prove frustrating for new players, and has given rise to hyperbolic tales of housecats cutting down promising young heroes in their prime. Rolemaster is sometimes derisively called 'Chartmaster' or 'Rulemonster' for depending upon numerous tables and charts for character generation and resolving game actions, and for its perceived vast array of rules covering every possible situation. Supporters of the game argue that many of these rules and charts are entirely optional. =Character creation and development= Rolemaster is a skill-based system in which very few absolute restrictions on skill selection are employed. All character abilities (fighting, stealth, spell use, etc.) are ultimately handled through the skill system. A character's profession represents not a rigid set of abilities available to the character, but rather a set of natural proficiencies in numerous areas. These proficiencies are reflected in the cost to purchase the skills themselves. Rolemaster characters have ten attributes, called \\"stats\\", which represent their natural abilities in such areas as physical strength, memory, self-discipline, agility. Both random and points-based methods for determining stat totals exist, but the final result will be a number on a percentile scale (1-100), which is then used to determine the character's skill bonus at actions which employ that stat. A self-governing system is in place also such that each skill closer to 100 is more costly than the last. Moving a skill from 50 to 51 is almost trivial; from 98 to 99 nigh impossible. In character creation, and as characters advance in levels, Development Points are assigned, and can be used to purchase skills. In RMSS and RFRP, they can also be spent on Training Packages, which represent a specific bundle of skills, equipment and contacts gained through training. These are optional, and can be ignored if the player prefers to design his or her character entirely from the ground up. Skills are purchased in Ranks; the more ranks a character has in a skill, the more able he is at actions covered by that skill. The number of ranks is multiplied by a set number dependent on the total number of ranks the character has, then added to the bonus for the relevant stats. The final number is the character's skill bonus, which is the number actually added to the dice when actions are attempted.

For the Rolemaster Standard System, Rolemaster Annual 1996 and Rolemaster Annual 1997 included new additional rules for that game system, including new professions, races, spelllists, and errata. For the Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing system, Guild Companion Publications (GCP) issued Rolemaster Quarterly from April 2006 to August 2007. The magazine was dedicated to presenting optional rules and play material, and a total of seven magazines were published. Several Electronic Roleplaying Assistants (ERAs) have been issued for use with the RMC, RMSS and RMFRP systems since 2005. They are computer applications, developed for use with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, helping players and game masters running the game digitally, including character creation and management. Reception In the August 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue #88), Arlen Walker asked if the hefty $48 price tag for the second edition boxed set was worth the money, and provided a long and in-depth examination of the box's contents. Walker had quibbles over the combat system, which seemed to generalize rather than individualize weapons; and he felt the book on animal encounters had very little information about the actual animals. Walker concluded, \\"Is the Rolemaster system worth the $48, then? The answer is a resounding 'maybe.' If you want a freer, more open game than you are currently playing, I‚Äôd say it is probably worth it. Even with the inconsistencies noted it still allows more freedom of choice than almost any other game. Although the physical size of the game is rather imposing, the actual mechanics run rather smoothly and simply.\\" Walker also reviewed the separately published books Character Law, Campaign Law, Spell Law, Claw Law and Arms Law. * Character Law Although Walker liked the ability to move randomly generated ability scores around to produce the most beneficial results for the character class sought, he disagreed with the system of rolling dice ten times in order to generate character abilities, and then raising two of those abilities up to 90, if they were not already 90 or better. Walker felt this created a monochrome cast of characters and non-player characters. Walker liked the different ways that characters could gain experience points, such as travel, having religious experiences such as visions, and for coming up with a brilliant idea ‚Äî although he thought this one would probably lead to arguments over which player had originally voiced the germ of the idea. But he didn't like the idea that characters get experience points for dying. * Spell Law Walker was impressed with the variety of spells detailed in Spell Law, numbering over two thousand. He found that the \\"spell-casting system is somewhat more complicated than in other games, but not unplayably so.\\" * Arms Law He had quibbles about Arms Law ‚Äî combat was very fast and lethal due to the high amount of damage inflicted by a single blow, and he believed that new players used to other role-playing systems should be made aware of this. Walker also questioned why a character could not parry with a two-handed weapon, although he realized it was probably \\"a concession to speed of play.\\" * Claw Law Walker criticized the lack of descriptions of the animals covered in Claw Law, saying, \\"The animal descriptions have little if anything to do with animals. Calling them descriptions, in fact, is probably overstating the case dramatically... We are told nothing else about the animal, including what it looks like, where it can be found, and how it will behave if found.\\" Walker went on to question why \\"Historical Weapons\\" were found in this book, which was supposed to be about damage from animals and monsters, rather than in Arms Law. He also criticized the lack of variety these weapons represented, since to calculate damage and other combat-related numbers for these exotic weapons, referees were simply referred to equivalent weapons in Arms Law. \\"For example, if you wish to have your character use a Katana, you use the same chart as if he were using a broadsword. The cover blurbs (for Arms Law) say, 'Because a mace is not an arrow or a scimitar...' yet this section says a broadsword is both a long sword and a sabre (as well as a Katana) and a dart is a dagger, because they use the same tables.\\" * Campaign Law Unlike the first four books, Walker had high praise for Campaign Law, saying, \\"Whether you‚Äôre looking for a new system to run or not, Campaign Law is definitely worth the $10 price of admission. The information and guidelines this book will give you on fleshing out and filling in a consistent campaign world are almost invaluable. All I can say is that if this book had been available when I first began running campaigns, it would have saved me at least a year of development time.\\" Eleven years later in the September 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue 221), Rick Swan reviewed the updated 144-page Arms Law book that had been released in conjunction with the revised Rolemaster Standard System edition. Swan still found the complexity of the Rolemaster system astounding, saying, \\"With its tidal wave of numbers, formulas, and tables, the Rolemaster game always struck me as the kind of fantasy RPG that calculus professors play on their day off.\\" Swan found Arms Law to be \\"mainly a book of tables ‚Äî more than 100 pages worth.\\" He gave the book an average rating of 4 out of 6, and recommended it only for the mathematically inclined: \\"If you read computer manuals for fun, if you get misty-eyed thinking about your high school algebra class, if you wonder why your friends complain about something as trivial as filling out tax forms, then Rolemaster ought to be right up your alley. Arms Law is as good a place as any to begin your investigation.\\" A year later, in the July 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 231), Swan reviewed the new supplement Arcane Companion that had been published in conjunction with the revision of the magic system in the Rolemaster Standard System edition. Swan reiterated that the Rolemaster system was a mathematician's delight: \\"Saturated with charts and numbers, it's for players who buy pocket calculators by the crate... If you're the kind of guy who needs his fingers to do arithmetic, this ain't your kind of game.\\" Despite this, Swan found Arcane Companion to be \\"not only comprehensible, but entertaining, thanks to the designers‚Äô efforts to infuse the facts and figures with vivid imagery.\\" Swan concluded that because this supplement was so solidly linked to the Rolemaster system, it could not be ported to another game system, but \\"experienced players should welcome this ambitious expansion with open arms. And if you‚Äôre among those who‚Äôve dismissed Rolemaster as not worth the effort, sneak a peek at Arcane Companion; it might tempt you to reconsider.\\" In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 best roleplaying systems, Rolemaster was ranked 15th. Arcane editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"Often used as an archetypal example of a complex roleplaying system, Rolemaster is a fairly numbers-heavy game that also relies on the use of a lot of tables. Most notable are its notorious 'critical hit' charts, which are subdivided by damage type and describe various horrific wounds in graphic detail. If you're looking for a highly detailed and fairly complex system, Rolemaster has a great deal to recommend it. The rules are fairly well organised and very flexible, easily adaptable to a wide variety of situations. On the other hand, if you're not one for tables and calculations, it's probably not going to ring your bell.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds #37 (Nov./Dec., 1984) *Fantasy Gamer #1 See also *Shadow World (role playing game) *High Adventure Role Playing (HARP) *Spacemaster *Middle-earth Role Playing *Lord of the Rings Adventure Game References External links *Iron Crown Enterprises Fantasy role-playing games Iron Crown Enterprises games ","title":"Rolemaster"},{"id":"54057","text":"The IS curve moves to the right, causing higher interest rates (i) and expansion in the \\"real\\" economy (real GDP, or Y) The IS‚ÄìLM model, or Hicks‚ÄìHansen model, is a two-dimensional macroeconomic tool that shows the relationship between interest rates and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market). The intersection of the \\"investment‚Äìsaving\\" (IS) and \\"liquidity preference‚Äìmoney supply\\" (LM) curves models \\"general equilibrium\\" where supposed simultaneous equilibria occur in both the goods and the asset markets. Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS‚ÄìLM model explains changes in national income when price level is fixed short-run; second, the IS‚ÄìLM model shows why an aggregate demand curve can shift. Hence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies. The model was developed by John Hicks in 1937, and later extended by Alvin Hansen, as a mathematical representation of Keynesian macroeconomic theory. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis. While it has been largely absent from macroeconomic research ever since, it is still a backbone conceptual introductory tool in many macroeconomics textbooks. By itself, the IS‚ÄìLM model is used to study the short run when prices are fixed or sticky and no inflation is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a path to explain the AD‚ÄìAS model. History The IS‚ÄìLM model was first introduced at a conference of the Econometric Society held in Oxford during September 1936. Roy Harrod, John R. Hicks, and James Meade all presented papers describing mathematical models attempting to summarize John Maynard Keynes' General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod's paper, invented the IS‚ÄìLM model (originally using the abbreviation \\"LL\\", not \\"LM\\"). He later presented it in \\"Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation\\". Although generally accepted as being imperfect, the model is seen as a useful pedagogical tool for imparting an understanding of the questions that macroeconomists today attempt to answer through more nuanced approaches. As such, it is included in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks, but omitted from most graduate texts due to the current dominance of real business cycle and new Keynesian theories. For a contemporary and alternative reinvention of the IS-LM approach that uses Keynesian Search Theory, see Roger Farmer's work on the IS-LM-NAC model, part of his broader research agenda which studies how beliefs independently influence macroeconomic outcomes. Formation The point where the IS and LM schedules intersect represents a short-run equilibrium in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and real GDP. =IS (investment‚Äìsaving) curve= IS curve represented by equilibrium in the money market and Keynesian cross diagram. The IS curve shows the causation from interest rates to planned investment to national income and output. For the investment‚Äìsaving curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income. The IS curve is drawn as downward-sloping with the interest rate r on the vertical axis and GDP (gross domestic product: Y) on the horizontal axis. The IS curve represents the locus where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals total output (real income, Y, or GDP). The IS curve also represents the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, with saving equal to consumer saving plus government saving (the budget surplus) plus foreign saving (the trade surplus). The level of real GDP (Y) is determined along this line for each interest rate. Every level of the real interest rate will generate a certain level of investment and spending: lower interest rates encourage higher investment and more spending. The multiplier effect of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, the IS curve shows the causation from interest rates to planned fixed investment to rising national income and output. The IS curve is defined by the equation :Y = C \\\\left({Y}-{T(Y)}\\\\right) + I \\\\left({r}\\\\right) + G + NX(Y), where Y represents income, C(Y-T(Y)) represents consumer spending increasing as a function of disposable income (income, Y, minus taxes, T(Y), which themselves depend positively on income), I(r) represents business investment decreasing as a function of the real interest rate, G represents government spending, and NX(Y) represents net exports (exports minus imports) decreasing as a function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income). =LM curve= The money market equilibrium diagram. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium. It shows where money demand equals money supply. For the LM curve, the independent variable is income and the dependent variable is the interest rate. In the money market equilibrium diagram, the liquidity preference function is the willingness to hold cash. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping (i.e. the willingness to hold cash increases as the interest rate decreases). Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded: * 1) Transactions demand for money: this includes both (a) the willingness to hold cash for everyday transactions and (b) a precautionary measure (money demand in case of emergencies). Transactions demand is positively related to real GDP. As GDP is considered exogenous to the liquidity preference function, changes in GDP shift the curve. * 2) Speculative demand for money: this is the willingness to hold cash instead of securities as an asset for investment purposes. Speculative demand is inversely related to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the opportunity cost of holding money rather than investing in securities increases. So, as interest rates rise, speculative demand for money falls. Money supply is determined by central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Money supply in effect is perfectly inelastic with respect to nominal interest rates. Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line ‚Äì money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation M/P=L(i,Y), where the supply of money is represented as the real amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the price level, and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate and the level of real income. An increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence increases the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped. Shifts One hypothesis is that a government's deficit spending (\\"fiscal policy\\") has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the IS curve to the right. This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from i1 to i2) and national income (from Y1 to Y2), as shown in the graph above. The equilibrium level of national income in the IS‚ÄìLM diagram is referred to as aggregate demand. Keynesians argue spending may actually \\"crowd in\\" (encourage) private fixed investment via the accelerator effect, which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that spending directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily more (or less) than the lost private investment might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve. A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, an rightward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the \\"Treasury view\\"). Rightward shifts of the IS curve also result from exogenous increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports. Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate. Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction. The IS‚ÄìLM model also allows for the role of monetary policy. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the LM curve downward or to the right, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income. Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction. Incorporation into larger models By itself, the IS‚ÄìLM model is used to study the short run when prices are fixed or sticky and no inflation is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a sub-model of larger models (especially the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model ‚Äì the AD‚ÄìAS model) which allow for a flexible price level. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS‚ÄìLM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level. Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS‚ÄìLM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS‚ÄìLM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand as measured by the horizontal location of the IS‚ÄìLM intersection; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped. Reinventing IS-LM: the IS-LM-NAC model In the IS-LM-NAC model, the long-run effect of monetary policy depends on the way people form beliefs. Roger Farmer and Konstantin Platanov study a case they call 'persistent adaptive beliefs' in which people believe, correctly, that shocks to asset values are permanent. The important innovation in this work is a model of the labor market in which there can be a continuum of long- run steady state equilibria.

It is sometimes called a floral tube, a term that is also used for corolla tube and calyx tube. It often contains the nectaries of the plant. It is present in most flowering species, although varies in structural dimensions and appearance. This differentiation between the hypanthium in particular species is useful for identification. Some geometric forms are obconic shapes as in toyon, whereas some are saucer-shaped as in Mitella caulescens. Its presence is diagnostic of many families, including the Rosaceae, Grossulariaceae, and Fabaceae. In some cases, it can be so deep, with such a narrow top, that the flower can appear to have an inferior ovary - the ovary is below the other attached floral parts. The hypanthium is known by different common names in differing species. In the eucalypts, it is referred to as the gum nut; in roses it is called the hip. Variations in plant species Ovary superior to hypanthium In Spiraea the hypanthium supports a nectar-producing \\"disk\\" which is ring-shaped and may have lobes as it does here. The stamens arise between the petals and the disk. Rosa Narcissus pseudonarcissus, showing from the upper bend to the tip of the flower: spathe, ovary, hypanthium, tepals, corona In myrtles the hypanthium can either surround the ovary loosely or tightly; in some cases it can be fused to the walls of the ovary. It can vary in length. The rims around the outside of the hypanthium contain the calyx lobes or free sepals, petals and either the stamen or multiple stamen that are attached at one or two points. The flowers of the family Rosaceae, or the rose family, always have some type of hypanthium or at least a floral cup from which the sepals, petals and stamens all arise, and which is lined with nectar-producing tissue known as nectaries. The nectar is a sugary substance that attracts birds and bees to the flower, who then take the pollen from the lining of the hypanthium and transfer it to the next flower they visit, usually a neighbouring plant. The stamens borne on the hypanthium are the pollen- producing reproductive organs of the flower. The hypanthium helps in many ways with the reproduction and cross pollination pathways of most plants. It provides weather protection and a medium to sustain the lost pollen, increasing the probability of fertility and cross-pollination. The retained pollen can then attach to pollinators such as birds, bees, moths, beetles, bats, butterflies and other animals. Wind can act as an instigator for fertilisation. The hypanthium is also an adaptive feature for structural support. It helps the stem fuse together with the flower, in turn strengthening the bond and overall stability and integrity.

Redfern, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1996, p. 69 for bullfighting, plays and summer concerts. Roman amphitheatres Pula Arena, Croatia Ancient Roman amphitheatres were major public venues, circular or oval in plan, with perimeter seating tiers. They were used for events such as gladiator combats, chariot races, venationes (animal hunts) and executions. About 230 Roman amphitheatres have been found across the area of the Roman Empire. Their typical shape, functions and name distinguish them from Roman theatres, which are more or less semicircular in shape; from the circuses (similar to hippodromes) whose much longer circuits were designed mainly for horse or chariot racing events; and from the smaller stadia, which were primarily designed for athletics and footraces.Bomgardner, 37. The earliest Roman amphitheatres date from the middle of the first century BCE, but most were built under Imperial rule, from the Augustan period (27 BCE‚Äì14 CE) onwards.Bomgardner, 59. Imperial amphitheatres were built throughout the Roman empire; the largest could accommodate 40,000‚Äì60,000 spectators. The most elaborate featured multi-storeyed, arcaded fa√ßades and were elaborately decorated with marble, stucco and statuary.Bomgardner, 62. After the end of gladiatorial games in the 5th century and of staged animal hunts in the 6th, most amphitheatres fell into disrepair. Their materials were mined or recycled. Some were razed, and others were converted into fortifications. A few continued as convenient open meeting places; in some of these, churches were sited.Bomgardner, 201‚Äì223.

The district, which is the oldest part of South London, developed due to its position at the southern end of the early versions of London Bridge, the only crossing point for many miles. London‚Äôs historic core, the City of London lay north of the Bridge. By the 12th century Southwark had been incorporated as an ancient borough, and this historic status is reflected in the alternative name of the area, or at least part of it, as Borough or The Borough. Local points of interest include Southwark Cathedral, The Shard, Tower Bridge and the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority. History =Toponymy= The name Suthriganaweorc or Suthringa geweorche is recorded for the area in the 10th-century Anglo-Saxon document known as the Burghal Hidage and means \\"fort of the men of Surrey\\" or \\"the defensive work of the men of Surrey\\". Southwark is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Sudweca. The name means \\"southern defensive work\\" and is formed from the Old English s≈´√æ (south) and weorc (work). The southern location is in reference to the City of London to the north, Southwark being at the southern end of London Bridge. In Old English, Surrey means \\"southern district (or the men of the southern district)\\",Concise Oxford Dictionary of Place Names, Eilert Erkwall, 4th edition so the change from \\"southern district work\\" to the latter \\"southern work\\" may be an evolution based on the elision of the single syllable ge element, meaning district. =Rome= London in 120 AD, showing the original high-tide waterline around Southwark, to the left (south) Museum of London, inscription on a stele that mentions 'Londoners' for the first time Southwark is sited on a once slightly marshy area south of the River Thames. Recent excavation has revealed prehistoric activity including evidence of early ploughing, burial mounds and ritual activity. Much of the district was, in pre-Roman years, a series of tidal islands in the Thames, formalised into ditches such as the so-called River Neckinger. It was at the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain, providing a crossing from Londinium, and for centuries had the only Thames bridge in the area, until a bridge was built upstream more than to the west. This formed the best place to bridge the Thames and the area became an important part of Londinium, owing its importance to its position as the endpoint of the Roman London Bridge. Two Roman roads, Stane Street and Watling Street, met at Southwark in what is now Borough High Street. Archaeological work at Tabard Street in 2004 discovered a plaque with the earliest reference to 'Londoners' from the Roman period on it. Londinium was abandoned at the end of the Roman occupation in the early 5th century and both the city and its bridge collapsed in decay. The settlement at Southwark, like the main settlement of London to the north of the bridge, had been more or less abandoned by the end of the fourth century.Citadel of the Saxons, Rory Naismith p 35, 2019 =Saxons and Vikings= Southwark appears to recover only during the time of King Alfred and his successors. Sometime about 886, the burh of Southwark was created and the Roman city area reoccupied. It was probably fortified to defend the bridge and hence the reemerging City of London to the north. This defensive role is highlighted by the use of the bridge in 1016 as a defence against King Sweyn and his son King Cnut by Ethelred the Unready and again, in 1066, against Duke William the Conqueror. He failed to force the bridge during the Norman conquest of England, but Southwark was devastated.Citadel of the Saxons, p185, Rory Naismaith, . In the book Naismith cites his source as Gesta Guillelmi, ed and translated by Davis and Chibnall, p146-7. He also refers Janet L Nelson 'The rites of the Conqueror' p117-32 and 210-21 cited from her book 'Politics and ritual in Early Medieval Europe' (1986), pp 373-401 and 375-6} Olaf, later St Olaf, helped the English retake London Bridge from his fellow Norsemen. =Medieval period= At Domesday, the area's assets were: Bishop Odo of Bayeux held the monastery (the site of modern Southwark Cathedral) and the tideway, which still exists as St Mary Overie dock; the King owned the church (probably St Olave's) and its tidal stream (St Olave's Dock); the dues of the waterway or mooring place were shared between King William I and Earl Godwin; the King also had the toll of the strand; and 'men of Southwark' had the right to 'a haw and its toll'. Southwark's value to the King was ¬£16. Much of Southwark was originally owned by the church ‚Äì the greatest reminder of monastic London is Southwark Cathedral, originally the priory of St Mary Overie. During the early Middle Ages, Southwark developed and was one of the four Surrey towns which returned Members of Parliament for the first commons assembly in 1295. An important market occupied the High Street from some time in the 13th century, which was controlled by the city's officers‚Äîit was later removed in order to improve traffic to the Bridge, under a separate Trust by Act of Parliament of 1756 as the Borough Market on the present site. The area was renowned for its inns, especially The Tabard, from which Geoffrey Chaucer's pilgrims set off on their journey in The Canterbury Tales. The continuing defensive importance of London Bridge was demonstrated by its important role in thwarting Jack Cade's Rebellion in 1450. =Post-medieval= Just west of the Bridge was the Liberty of the Clink manor, which was never controlled by the city, but was held under the Bishopric of Winchester's nominal authority. This area therefore became the entertainment district for London, with attractions such as bull and bear-baiting. It also hosted a concentration of brothels. In the 1580s, Reasonable Blackman worked as a silk weaver in Southwark, as one of the first people of African heritage to work as independent business owners in London in that era. In 1587, Southwark's first playhouse theatre, The Rose, opened. The Rose was set up by Philip Henslowe, and soon became a popular place of entertainment for all classes of Londoners. Both Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare, two of the finest writers of the Elizabethan age, worked at the Rose. In 1599 the Globe Theatre, in which Shakespeare was a shareholder, was erected on the Bankside in the Liberty of the Clink. It burned down in 1613, and was rebuilt in 1614, only to be closed by the Puritans in 1642 and subsequently pulled down not long thereafter. A modern replica called Shakespeare's Globe, has been built near the original site. The impresario in the later Elizabethan period for these entertainments was Shakespeare's colleague Edward Alleyn, who left many local charitable endowments, most notably Dulwich College. On 26 May 1676, ten years after the Great Fire of London, a great fire broke out, which continued for 17 hours before houses were blown up to create fire breaks. King Charles II and his brother, James, Duke of York, oversaw the effort. There was also a famous fair in Southwark which took place near the Church of St George the Martyr. William Hogarth depicted this fair in his engraving of Southwark Fair (1733). Southwark was also the location of several prisons, including those of the Crown or Prerogative Courts, the Marshalsea and King's Bench prisons, those of the local manors' courts, e.g., Borough Compter, The Clink and the Surrey county gaol originally housed at the White Lion Inn (also informally called the Borough Gaol) and eventually at Horsemonger Lane Gaol. One other local family is of note, the Harvards. John Harvard went to the local parish free school of St Saviour's and on to Cambridge University. He migrated to the Massachusetts Colony and left his library and the residue of his will to the new college there, named after him as its first benefactor. Harvard University maintains a link, having paid for a memorial chapel within Southwark Cathedral (his family's parish church), and where its UK-based alumni hold services. John Harvard's mother's house is in Stratford-upon-Avon. =Urbanisation= In 1836 the first railway in the London area was created, the London and Greenwich Railway, originally terminating at Spa Road and later extended west to London Bridge. In 1861, another great fire in Southwark destroyed a large number of buildings between Tooley Street and the Thames, including those around Hays Wharf (later replaced by Hays Galleria) and blocks to the west almost as far as St Olave's Church. The first deep-level underground tube line in London was the City and South London Railway, now the Bank branch of the Northern line, opened in 1890, running from King William Street south through Borough to Stockwell. Southwark, since 1999, is also now served by Southwark, Bermondsey and London Bridge stations on the Jubilee line. Administrative history The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark was formed by merging western parts of Southwark with Newington. Southwark is thought to have become a burh in 886. The area appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 within the hundred of Brixton as held by several Surrey manors.Open Domesday Online: Southwark, accessed July 2018. The ancient borough of Southwark, enfranchised in 1295, initially consisted of the pre-existing Surrey parishes of St George the Martyr, St Olave, St Margaret and St Mary. St Margaret and St Mary were abolished in 1541 and their former area combined to create Southwark St Saviour. Around 1555 Southwark St Thomas was split off from St Olave, and in 1733 Southwark St John Horsleydown was also split off. The parishes of Southwark, 1870 In 1855 the parishes came into the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The large St George the Martyr parish was governed by its own administrative vestry, but the smaller St John Horsleydown, St Olave and St Thomas parishes were grouped together to form the St Olave District. St Saviour was combined with Southwark Christchurch (the former liberty of Paris Garden) to form the St Saviour's District. In 1889 the area became part of the new County of London. St Olave and St Thomas were combined as a single parish in 1896. The ancient borough of Southwark, was traditionally known simply as The Borough‚Äîor Borough, to distinguish it from 'The City', and this name has persisted as an alternative name for the area. The medieval heart of Southwark was also, simultaneously, referred to as the ward of Bridge Without when administered by the city (from 1550 to 1900) and as an aldermanry until 1978. The local government arrangements were reorganised in 1900 with the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. It comprised the parishes of Southwark Christchurch, Southwark St Saviours, Southwark St George the Martyr and Newington. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark was based at Walworth Town Hall. The eastern parishes that had formed the St Olave District instead became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. In 1965 the two boroughs were combined with the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell to form the current London Borough of Southwark. =Relationship with the City of London= Southwark was outside of the control of the City of London and was a haven for criminals and free traders, who would sell goods and conduct trades outside the regulation of the city's Livery Companies. In 1327 the City obtained control from King Edward III of the manor next to the south side of London Bridge known as the Town of Southwark (called latterly the Guildable Manor‚Äîi.e., the place of taxes and tolls). The Livery Companies also ensured that they had jurisdiction over the area. From the Norman period manorial organisation obtained through major lay and ecclesiastic magnates. Southwark still has vestiges of this because of the connection with the City of London. In 1327 the city acquired from Edward III the original vill of Southwark and this was also described as \\"the borough\\". In 1536 Henry VIII acquired the Bermondsey Priory properties and in 1538 that of the Archbishop. In 1550 these were sold to the city. After many decades of petitioning, in 1550 Southwark was incorporated into the City of London as the ward of Bridge Without. However, the Alderman was appointed by the Court of Aldermen and no Common Councilmen were ever elected. This ward was constituted of the original Guildable Manor and the properties previously held by the church, under a charter of Edward VI, latterly called the King's Manor or Great Liberty. These manors are still constituted by the City under a Bailiff and Steward with their Courts Leet and View of Frankpledge Juries and Officers which still meet‚Äîtheir annual assembly being held in November under the present High Steward (the Recorder of London). The Ward and Aldermanry were effectively abolished in 1978, by merging it with the Ward of Bridge Within. These manorial courts were preserved under the Administration of Justice Act 1977. Therefore, between 1750 and 1978 Southwark had two persons (the Alderman and the Recorder) who were members of the city's Court of Aldermen and Common Council who were elected neither by the City freemen or by the Southwark electorate but appointed by the Court of Aldermen. =Contemporary governance and representation= The Borough and Bankside Community Council corresponds to the Southwark electoral wards of Cathedrals and Chaucer. They are part of the Bermondsey and Old Southwark Parliament constituency whose Member of Parliament is Neil Coyle. It is within the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency. Southwark is the location of City Hall, the administrative headquarters of the Greater London Authority and the meeting place of the London Assembly and Mayor of London. Since 2009, Southwark London Borough Council has its main offices at 160 Tooley Street, having moved administrative staff from the Camberwell Town Hall. Geography and attractions View from Tower Bridge towards Southwark: City Hall and the rest of More London development in the foreground, and the Shard London Bridge skyscraper (under construction at the time of the photo) in the background. In common with much of the south bank of the Thames, the Borough has seen extensive regeneration in the last decade. Declining wharfage trade, light industry and factories have given way to residential development, shops, restaurants, galleries, bars and most notably major office developments housing international headquarters of accountancy, legal and other professional services consultancies, most notably along London Bridge City and More London between Tooley Street and the riverside. The area is in easy walking distance of the City and the West End. As such it has become a major business centre with many national and international corporations, professional practices and publishers locating to the area. London's tallest skyscraper, the Shard, is next to London Bridge Station. To the north is the River Thames, London Bridge station and Southwark Cathedral. Borough Market is a well-developed visitor attraction and has grown in size. The adjacent units have been converted and form a gastronomic focus for London. Borough High Street runs roughly north to south from London Bridge towards Elephant and Castle. The Borough runs further to the south than realised; both St George's Cathedral and the Imperial War Museum are within the ancient boundaries, which border nearby Lambeth. Its entertainment district, in its heyday at the time of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre (which stood 1599‚Äì1642) has revived in the form of the Southbank which overspills imperceptibly into the ancient boundaries of Lambeth and commences at the post-1997 reinvention of the original theatre, Shakespeare's Globe, incorporating other smaller theatre spaces, an exhibition about Shakespeare's life and work and which neighbours Vinopolis and the London Dungeon. At its heart is the area known as Borough, which has an eclectic covered and semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the skyscraper The Shard. The Borough is generally an area of mixed development, with council estates, major office developments, social housing and high value residential gated communities side by side with each other. Another landmark is Southwark Cathedral, a priory then parish church, created a cathedral in 1905, noted for its Merbecke Choir. The area at an advanced stage of regeneration and has the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority. =Transport= The area has three main tube stations: Borough, Southwark nearby and one close to the river which is combined with a major railway station above, London Bridge.

A correct hypothesis is a logic proposition satisfying the following requirements.; here: Sect.2.1 : \\\\begin{array}{llll} \\\\text{Necessity:} & B & ot\\\\models & E^+ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Sufficiency:} & B \\\\land h & \\\\color{blue}{\\\\models} & E^+ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Weak consistency:} & B \\\\land h & ot\\\\models & \\\\textit{false} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Strong consistency:} & B \\\\land h \\\\land E^- & ot\\\\models & \\\\textit{false} \\\\end{array} \\"Necessity\\" does not impose a restriction on , but forbids any generation of a hypothesis as long as the positive facts are explainable without it. \\"Sufficiency\\" requires any generated hypothesis to explain all positive examples E^+. \\"Weak consistency\\" forbids generation of any hypothesis that contradicts the background knowledge . \\"Strong consistency\\" also forbids generation of any hypothesis that is inconsistent with the negative examples E^-, given the background knowledge ; it implies \\"Weak consistency\\"; if no negative examples are given, both requirements coincide. D≈æeroski ; here: Sect.5.2.4 requires only \\"Sufficiency\\" (called \\"Completeness\\" there) and \\"Strong consistency\\". Example Assumed family relations in section \\"Example\\" The following well-known example about learning definitions of family relations uses the abbreviations :, , , , , , , , and . It starts from the background knowledge (cf. picture) :\\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(h,t) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(g,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(n,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(h) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(m) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(n) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(e), the positive examples :\\\\textit{dau}(m,h) \\\\land \\\\textit{dau}(e,t), and the trivial proposition to denote the absence of negative examples. Plotkin's \\"relative least general generalization (rlgg)\\" approach to inductive logic programming shall be used to obtain a suggestion about how to formally define the daughter relation . This approach uses the following steps. * Relativize each positive example literal with the complete background knowledge: *:\\\\begin{align} \\\\textit{dau}(m,h) \\\\leftarrow \\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(h,t) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(g,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(n,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(h) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(m) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(n) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(e) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textit{dau}(e,t) \\\\leftarrow \\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(h,t) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(g,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(n,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(h) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(m) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(n) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(e) \\\\end{align}, * Convert into clause normal form: *:\\\\begin{align} \\\\textit{dau}(m,h) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(h,t) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(n,e) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(h) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(n) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(e) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textit{dau}(e,t) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(h,t) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(n,e) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(h) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(m) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(n) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(e) \\\\end{align}, * Anti-unify each compatible i.e. sharing the same predicate symbol and negated/unnegated status pair in general: -tuple when positive example literals are given of literals: \\\\textit{dau}(x_{me},x_{ht}) from \\\\textit{dau}(m,h) and \\\\textit{dau}(e,t), \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(x_{ht},x_{me}) from \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(h,m) and \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(t,e), \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(x_{me}) from \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(m) and \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(e), \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m) from \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m) and \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m), similar for all other background-knowledge literals \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(x_{gt},x_{me}) from \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(g,m) and \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(t,e), and many more negated literals * Delete all negated literals containing variables that don't occur in a positive literal: after deleting all negated literals containing other variables than x_{me},x_{ht}, only \\\\textit{dau}(x_{me},x_{ht}) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{par}(x_{ht},x_{me}) \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\textit{fem}(x_{me}) remains, together with all ground literals from the background knowledge * Convert clauses back to Horn form:  \\\\textit{dau}(x_{me},x_{ht}) \\\\leftarrow \\\\textit{par}(x_{ht},x_{me}) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(x_{me}) \\\\land (\\\\text{all background knowledge facts}) The resulting Horn clause is the hypothesis obtained by the rlgg approach. Ignoring the background knowledge facts, the clause informally reads \\"x_{me} is called a daughter of x_{ht} if x_{ht} is the parent of x_{me} and x_{me} is female\\", which is a commonly accepted definition. Concerning the above requirements, \\"Necessity\\" was satisfied because the predicate doesn't appear in the background knowledge, which hence cannot imply any property containing this predicate, such as the positive examples are. \\"Sufficiency\\" is satisfied by the computed hypothesis , since it, together with \\\\textit{par}(h,m) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(m) from the background knowledge, implies the first positive example \\\\textit{dau}(m,h), and similarly and \\\\textit{par}(t,e) \\\\land \\\\textit{fem}(e) from the background knowledge implies the second positive example \\\\textit{dau}(e,t). \\"Weak consistency\\" is satisfied by , since holds in the (finite) Herbrand structure described by the background knowledge; similar for \\"Strong consistency\\". The common definition of the grandmother relation, viz. \\\\textit{gra}(x,z) \\\\leftarrow \\\\textit{fem}(x) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(x,y) \\\\land \\\\textit{par}(y,z), cannot be learned using the above approach, since the variable occurs in the clause body only; the corresponding literals would have been deleted in the 4th step of the approach. To overcome this flaw, that step has to be modified such that it can be parametrized with different literal post-selection heuristics. Historically, the GOLEM implementation is based on the rlgg approach.  Inductive Logic Programming system  Inductive Logic Programming system is a program that takes as an input logic theories B, E^+, E^- and outputs a correct hypothesis wrt theories B, E^+, E^- An algorithm of an ILP system consists of two parts: hypothesis search and hypothesis selection. First a hypothesis is searched with an inductive logic programming procedure, then a subset of the found hypotheses (in most systems one hypothesis) is chosen by a selection algorithm. A selection algorithm scores each of the found hypotheses and returns the ones with the highest score. An example of score function include minimal compression length where a hypothesis with a lowest Kolmogorov complexity has the highest score and is returned. An ILP system is complete iff for any input logic theories B, E^+, E^- any correct hypothesis wrt to these input theories can be found with its hypothesis search procedure. = Hypothesis search = Modern ILP systems like Progol, Hail Ray, O., Broda, K., & Russo, A.

However, the operation of the anti-entailment since being highly non-deterministic is computationally more expensive. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis search can be conducted using the operation of the inverse subsumption (anti-subsumption) instead which is less non-deterministic than anti-entailment. Questions of completeness of a hypothesis search procedure of specific ILP system arise.

It is widely credited as the first attempt to describe such a device in order to produce useful work, that of driving millstones. Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that continues forever. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate the first or second law of thermodynamics.S√©bastien Point, Free energy: when the web is freewheeling, Skeptikal Inquirer, January February 2018 These laws of thermodynamics apply regardless of the size of the system. For example, the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual, but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy, such as solar wind, interstellar medium resistance, gravitational radiation and thermal radiation, so they will not keep moving forever. Thus, machines that extract energy from finite sources will not operate indefinitely, because they are driven by the energy stored in the source, which will eventually be exhausted. A common example is devices powered by ocean currents, whose energy is ultimately derived from the Sun, which itself will eventually burn out. Machines powered by more obscure sources have been proposed, but are subject to the same inescapable laws, and will eventually wind down. In 2017, new states of matter, time crystals, were discovered in which on a microscopic scale the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion, thus satisfying the literal definition of \\"perpetual motion\\". However, these do not constitute perpetual motion machines in the traditional sense or violate thermodynamic laws because they are in their quantum ground state, so no energy can be extracted from them; they exhibit motion without energy. History The history of perpetual motion machines dates back to the Middle Ages. For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but the development of modern theories of thermodynamics has shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents often use other terms, such as \\"over unity\\", to describe their inventions.  Basic principles  There is a scientific consensus that perpetual motion in an isolated system violates either the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics, or both. The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy. The second law can be phrased in several different ways, the most intuitive of which is that heat flows spontaneously from hotter to colder places; relevant here is that the law observes that in every macroscopic process, there is friction or something close to it; another statement is that no heat engine (an engine which produces work while moving heat from a high temperature to a low temperature) can be more efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same two temperatures. In other words: # In any isolated system, one cannot create new energy (law of conservation of energy). As a result, the thermal efficiency‚Äîthe produced work power divided by the input heating power‚Äîcannot be greater than one. # The output work power of heat engines is always smaller than the input heating power. The rest of the heat energy supplied is wasted as heat to the ambient surroundings. The thermal efficiency therefore has a maximum, given by the Carnot efficiency, which is always less than one. # The efficiency of real heat engines is even lower than the Carnot efficiency due to irreversibility arising from the speed of processes, including friction. Statements 2 and 3 apply to heat engines. Other types of engines which convert e.g. mechanical into electromagnetic energy, cannot operate with 100% efficiency, because it is impossible to design any system that is free of energy dissipation. Machines which comply with both laws of thermodynamics by accessing energy from unconventional sources are sometimes referred to as perpetual motion machines, although they do not meet the standard criteria for the name. By way of example, clocks and other low-power machines, such as Cox's timepiece, have been designed to run on the differences in barometric pressure or temperature between night and day. These machines have a source of energy, albeit one which is not readily apparent, so that they only seem to violate the laws of thermodynamics. Even machines which extract energy from long-lived sources - such as ocean currents - will run down when their energy sources inevitably do. They are not perpetual motion machines because they are consuming energy from an external source and are not isolated systems. = Classification = One classification of perpetual motion machines refers to the particular law of thermodynamics the machines purport to violate: * A perpetual motion machine of the first kind produces work without the input of energy. It thus violates the first law of thermodynamics: the law of conservation of energy. * A perpetual motion machine of the second kind is a machine which spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work. When the thermal energy is equivalent to the work done, this does not violate the law of conservation of energy. However, it does violate the more subtle second law of thermodynamics (see also entropy). The signature of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is that there is only one heat reservoir involved, which is being spontaneously cooled without involving a transfer of heat to a cooler reservoir. This conversion of heat into useful work, without any side effect, is impossible, according to the second law of thermodynamics. *A perpetual motion machine of the third kind is usually (but not always)An alternative definition is given, for example, by Schadewald, who defines a \\"perpetual motion machine of the third kind\\" as a machine that violates the third law of thermodynamics. See Schadewald, Robert J. (2008), Worlds of Their Own - A Brief History of Misguided Ideas: Creationism, Flat-Earthism, Energy Scams, and the Velikovsky Affair, Xlibris, . pp55‚Äì56 defined as one that completely eliminates friction and other dissipative forces, to maintain motion forever due to its mass inertia (Third in this case refers solely to the position in the above classification scheme, not the third law of thermodynamics). It is impossible to make such a machine, as dissipation can never be completely eliminated in a mechanical system, no matter how close a system gets to this ideal (see examples in the Low Friction section). = Impossibility = October 1920 issue of Popular Science magazine, on perpetual motion. Although scientists have established them to be impossible under the laws of physics, perpetual motion continues to capture the imagination of inventors. \\"Epistemic impossibility\\" describes things which absolutely cannot occur within our current formulation of the physical laws. This interpretation of the word \\"impossible\\" is what is intended in discussions of the impossibility of perpetual motion in a closed system. The conservation laws are particularly robust from a mathematical perspective. Noether's theorem, which was proven mathematically in 1915, states that any conservation law can be derived from a corresponding continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system. The symmetry which is equivalent to conservation of energy is the time invariance of physical laws. Therefore, if the laws of physics do not change with time, then the conservation of energy follows. For energy conservation to be violated to allow perpetual motion would require that the foundations of physics would change. Scientific investigations as to whether the laws of physics are invariant over time use telescopes to examine the universe in the distant past to discover, to the limits of our measurements, whether ancient stars were identical to stars today. Combining different measurements such as spectroscopy, direct measurement of the speed of light in the past and similar measurements demonstrates that physics has remained substantially the same, if not identical, for all of observable time spanning billions of years.\\"CE410: Are constants constant?\\", talkorigins The principles of thermodynamics are so well established, both theoretically and experimentally, that proposals for perpetual motion machines are universally met with disbelief on the part of physicists. Any proposed perpetual motion design offers a potentially instructive challenge to physicists: one is certain that it cannot work, so one must explain how it fails to work. The difficulty (and the value) of such an exercise depends on the subtlety of the proposal; the best ones tend to arise from physicists' own thought experiments and often shed light upon certain aspects of physics. So, for example, the thought experiment of a Brownian ratchet as a perpetual motion machine was first discussed by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900 but it was not until 1912 that Marian Smoluchowski gave an adequate explanation for why it cannot work. However, during that twelve-year period scientists did not believe that the machine was possible. They were merely unaware of the exact mechanism by which it would inevitably fail. In the mid 19th-century Henry Dircks investigated the history of perpetual motion experiments, writing a vitriolic attack on those who continued to attempt what he believed to be impossible: = Techniques = Some common ideas recur repeatedly in perpetual motion machine designs. Many ideas that continue to appear today were stated as early as 1670 by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester and an official of the Royal Society. He outlined three potential sources of power for a perpetual motion machine, \\" Extractions\\", \\"Magnetical Virtues\\" and \\"the Natural Affection of Gravity\\". The seemingly mysterious ability of magnets to influence motion at a distance without any apparent energy source has long appealed to inventors. One of the earliest examples of a magnetic motor was proposed by Wilkins and has been widely copied since: it consists of a ramp with a magnet at the top, which pulled a metal ball up the ramp. Near the magnet was a small hole that was supposed to allow the ball to drop under the ramp and return to the bottom, where a flap allowed it to return to the top again. The device simply could not work. Faced with this problem, more modern versions typically use a series of ramps and magnets, positioned so the ball is to be handed off from one magnet to another as it moves. The problem remains the same. Perpetuum Mobile of Villard de Honnecourt (about 1230). The \\"Overbalanced Wheel\\". Gravity also acts at a distance, without an apparent energy source, but to get energy out of a gravitational field (for instance, by dropping a heavy object, producing kinetic energy as it falls) one has to put energy in (for instance, by lifting the object up), and some energy is always dissipated in the process. A typical application of gravity in a perpetual motion machine is Bhaskara's wheel in the 12th century, whose key idea is itself a recurring theme, often called the overbalanced wheel: moving weights are attached to a wheel in such a way that they fall to a position further from the wheel's center for one half of the wheel's rotation, and closer to the center for the other half. Since weights further from the center apply a greater torque, it was thought that the wheel would rotate forever. However, since the side with weights further from the center has fewer weights than the other side, at that moment, the torque is balanced and perpetual movement is not achieved. The moving weights may be hammers on pivoted arms, or rolling balls, or mercury in tubes; the principle is the same. Perpetual motion wheels from a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci Another theoretical machine involves a frictionless environment for motion. This involves the use of diamagnetic or electromagnetic levitation to float an object. This is done in a vacuum to eliminate air friction and friction from an axle. The levitated object is then free to rotate around its center of gravity without interference. However, this machine has no practical purpose because the rotated object cannot do any work as work requires the levitated object to cause motion in other objects, bringing friction into the problem. Furthermore, a perfect vacuum is an unattainable goal since both the container and the object itself would slowly vaporize, thereby degrading the vacuum. To extract work from heat, thus producing a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, the most common approach (dating back at least to Maxwell's demon) is unidirectionality. Only molecules moving fast enough and in the right direction are allowed through the demon's trap door. In a Brownian ratchet, forces tending to turn the ratchet one way are able to do so while forces in the other direction are not. A diode in a heat bath allows through currents in one direction and not the other. These schemes typically fail in two ways: either maintaining the unidirectionality costs energy (requiring Maxwell's demon to perform more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused) or the unidirectionality is an illusion and occasional big violations make up for the frequent small non-violations (the Brownian ratchet will be subject to internal Brownian forces and therefore will sometimes turn the wrong way). The \\"Float Belt\\". The yellow blocks indicate floaters. It was thought that the floaters would rise through the liquid and turn the belt. However, pushing the floaters into the water at the bottom takes as much energy as the floating generates, and some energy is dissipated. Buoyancy is another frequently misunderstood phenomenon. Some proposed perpetual-motion machines miss the fact that to push a volume of air down in a fluid takes the same work as to raise a corresponding volume of fluid up against gravity. These types of machines may involve two chambers with pistons, and a mechanism to squeeze the air out of the top chamber into the bottom one, which then becomes buoyant and floats to the top. The squeezing mechanism in these designs would not be able to do enough work to move the air down, or would leave no excess work available to be extracted.  Patents  Proposals for such inoperable machines have become so common that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has made an official policy of refusing to grant patents for perpetual motion machines without a working model. The USPTO Manual of Patent Examining Practice states: And, further, that: The filing of a patent application is a clerical task, and the USPTO will not refuse filings for perpetual motion machines; the application will be filed and then most probably rejected by the patent examiner, after he has done a formal examination. Even if a patent is granted, it does not mean that the invention actually works, it just means that the examiner believes that it works, or was unable to figure out why it would not work. The USPTO maintains a collection of Perpetual Motion Gimmicks. The United Kingdom Patent Office has a specific practice on perpetual motion; Section 4.05 of the UKPO Manual of Patent Practice states: Examples of decisions by the UK Patent Office to refuse patent applications for perpetual motion machines include:See also, for more examples of refused patent applications at the United Kingdom Patent Office (UK-IPO), UK-IPO gets tougher on perpetual motion, IPKat, 12 June 2008.

Apparent perpetual motion machines  As \\"perpetual motion\\" can exist only in isolated systems, and true isolated systems do not exist, there are not any real \\"perpetual motion\\" devices. However, there are concepts and technical drafts that propose \\"perpetual motion\\", but on closer analysis it is revealed that they actually \\"consume\\" some sort of natural resource or latent energy, such as the phase changes of water or other fluids or small natural temperature gradients, or simply cannot sustain indefinite operation. In general, extracting work from these devices is impossible. = Resource consuming = The \\"Capillary Bowl\\" Some examples of such devices include: * The drinking bird toy functions using small ambient temperature gradients and evaporation. It runs until all water is evaporated. * A capillary action-based water pump functions using small ambient temperature gradients and vapour pressure differences. With the \\"Capillary Bowl\\", it was thought that the capillary action would keep the water flowing in the tube, but since the cohesion force that draws the liquid up the tube in the first place holds the droplet from releasing into the bowl, the flow is not perpetual. * A Crookes radiometer consists of a partial vacuum glass container with a lightweight propeller moved by (light-induced) temperature gradients. * Any device picking up minimal amounts of energy from the natural electromagnetic radiation around it, such as a solar powered motor. * Any device powered by changes in air pressure, such as some clocks (Cox's timepiece, Beverly Clock). The motion leeches energy from moving air which in turn gained its energy from being acted on. * A heat pump due to it having a COP above 1. * The Atmos clock uses changes in the vapor pressure of ethyl chloride with temperature to wind the clock spring. * A device powered by radioactive decay from an isotope with a relatively long half-life; such a device could plausibly operate for hundreds or thousands of years. * The Oxford Electric Bell and Karpen Pile driven by dry pile batteries. = Low friction = * In flywheel energy storage, \\"modern flywheels can have a zero-load rundown time measurable in years\\". * Once spun up, objects in the vacuum of space‚Äîstars, black holes, planets, moons, spin- stabilized satellites, etc.‚Äîdissipate energy very slowly, allowing them to spin for long periods. Tides on Earth are dissipating the gravitational energy of the Moon/Earth system at an average rate of about 3.75 terawatts. * In certain quantum-mechanical systems (such as superfluidity and superconductivity), very low friction movement is possible. However, the motion stops when the system reaches an equilibrium state (e.g. all the liquid helium arrives at the same level.) Similarly, seemingly entropy-reversing effects like superfluids climbing the walls of containers operate by ordinary capillary action. = Thought experiments = In some cases a thought (or gedanken) experiment appears to suggest that perpetual motion may be possible through accepted and understood physical processes. However, in all cases, a flaw has been found when all of the relevant physics is considered. Examples include: * Maxwell's demon: This was originally proposed to show that the Second Law of Thermodynamics applied in the statistical sense only, by postulating a \\"demon\\" that could select energetic molecules and extract their energy. Subsequent analysis (and experiment) have shown there is no way to physically implement such a system that does not result in an overall increase in entropy. * Brownian ratchet: In this thought experiment, one imagines a paddle wheel connected to a ratchet. Brownian motion would cause surrounding gas molecules to strike the paddles, but the ratchet would only allow it to turn in one direction. A more thorough analysis showed that when a physical ratchet was considered at this molecular scale, Brownian motion would also affect the ratchet and cause it to randomly fail resulting in no net gain. Thus, the device would not violate the laws of thermodynamics. * Vacuum energy and zero-point energy: In order to explain effects such as virtual particles and the Casimir effect, many formulations of quantum physics include a background energy which pervades empty space, known as vacuum or zero-point energy. The ability to harness zero-point energy for useful work is considered pseudoscience by the scientific community at large. Inventors have proposed various methods for extracting useful work from zero-point energy, but none have been found to be viable,Martin Gardner, \\"'Dr' Bearden's Vacuum Energy\\", Skeptical Inquirer, January/February 2007 no claims for extraction of zero- point energy have ever been validated by the scientific community, Alt URL and there is no evidence that zero-point energy can be used in violation of conservation of energy. *Ellipsoid paradox: This paradox considers a perfectly reflecting cavity with two black bodies at points A and B. The reflecting surface is composed of two elliptical sections E1 and E2 and a spherical section S, and the bodies at A and B are located at the joint foci of the two ellipses and B is at the center of S. This configuration is such that apparently black body at B heat up relative to A: the radiation originating from the blackbody at A will land on and be absorbed by the blackbody at B. Similarly, rays originating from point B that land on E1 and E2 will be reflected to A. However, a significant proportion of rays that start from B will land on S will be reflected back to B. This paradox is solved when the black bodies finite sizes are considered instead of punctual black bodies. Ellipsoid paradox surface and rays emitted by body A in the direction of body B. (a) When bodies A and B are point like, all rays from A must be incident on B. (b) When bodies A and B are extended, some rays from A will not be incident on B and may eventually return to A.

The number of copies of his books in print is estimated between 300 million and 500 million.Ludlum, Robert, Prometheus Deception, 2000. Preface by the publisher, Orion Publishing.\\"The Ludlum conspiracy\\" at Legacy.com. They have been published in 33 languages and 40 countries. Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd. Life and career =Early life and education= Ludlum was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (n√©e Wadsworth) and George Hartford Ludlum.Gina Macdonald, \\"The Life of Robert Ludlum\\", Robert Ludlum: A Critical Companion, Greenwood Press, 1997, p. 1. His maternal grandparents were English.\\"Ludlum\\" at Genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com. He was educated at The Rectory School then Cheshire Academy and Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he earned a B.A. in Drama in 1951. While at Wesleyan, Ludlum joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. After becoming an author later in life, Ludlum would set his mystery novel Matlock Paper at the fictitious Carlyle University in Connecticut, a thinly disguised Wesleyan. =Career= Prior to becoming an author, he had been a United States Marine, a theatrical actor and producer. In the 1950s, he produced shows at the Grant Lee theater in Fort Lee, New Jersey. From 1960 to 1970, he managed and produced shows at the Playhouse on the Mall at Bergen Mall in Paramus, New Jersey. His theatrical experience may have contributed to his understanding of the energy, escapism and action that the public wanted in a novel. He once remarked: \\"I equate suspense and good theater in a very similar way. I think it's all suspense and what-happens-next. From that point of view, yes, I guess, I am theatrical.\\" Many of Ludlum's novels have been made into films and mini-series, including The Osterman Weekend, The Holcroft Covenant, The Apocalypse Watch, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Covert One: The Hades Factor, a book co-written with Gayle Lynds, was originally conceived as a mini-series; the book evolved from a short treatment Ludlum wrote for NBC. The Bourne movies, starring Matt Damon in the title role, have been commercially and critically successful (The Bourne Ultimatum won three Academy Awards in 2008), although the story lines depart significantly from the source material. During the 1970s, Ludlum lived in Leonia, New Jersey, where he spent hours each day writing at his home. \\"He writes for six or seven hours in an office in his house in Leonia.\\" =Death= Ludlum died on March 12, 2001, at his home in Naples, Florida, while recovering from severe burns caused by a mysterious fire which occurred on February 10, 2001. Writing analysis and criticism Ludlum's novels typically feature one heroic man, or a small group of crusading individuals, in a struggle against powerful adversaries whose intentions and motivations are evil and who are capable of using political and economic mechanisms in frightening ways. The world in his writings is one where global corporations, shadowy military forces and government organizations all conspired to preserve (if it was evil) or undermine (if it was law-abiding) the status quo. Ludlum's novels were often inspired by conspiracy theories, both historical and contemporary. He wrote that The Matarese Circle was inspired by rumors about the Trilateral Commission, and it was published only a few years after the commission was founded. His depictions of terrorism in books such as The Holcroft Covenant and The Matarese Circle reflected the theory that terrorists, rather than being merely isolated bands of ideologically motivated extremists, are actually pawns of governments or private organizations who are using them to facilitate the establishment of authoritarian rule. Bibliography Filmography Many of Ludlum's novels have been made into films and mini-series, although the story lines might depart significantly from the source material. In general, a miniseries is more faithful to the original novel on which it is based.

Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence has shown that the traditional Spiraeoideae and Amygdaloideae form part of the same clade as the traditional Maloideae, and the correct name for this group is Amygdaloideae. Earlier circumscriptions of Maloideae are more- or-less equivalent to subtribe Malinae or to tribe Maleae. The group includes a number of plants bearing commercially important fruits, such as apples and pears, while others are cultivated as ornamentals. In its traditional circumscriptionG. K.

Taxonomy The subfamily was given the name Pomoideae Juss. in 1789, but this name is no longer accepted under the nomenclature codes because it is not based on a genus name. It has also been separated into its own family the Malaceae Small (formerly Pomaceae Lindl.). An earlier intermediate classification expanded Maloideae to include four genera with dry non-pome fruit. These are Kageneckia, Lindleya, and Vauquelinia, which have a haploid chromosome count of 15 or 17, and Gillenia, which is herbaceous and has a haploid chromosome count of 9. A traditional circumscription of Maloideae includes the following genera: * Amelanchier - serviceberry, juneberry * Aria (see Sorbus) * Aronia - chokeberry * Chaenomeles - Japanese quince * Chamaemeles * Chamaemespilus (see Sorbus chamaemespilus) * Cormus (see Sorbus) * Cotoneaster - cotoneaster * Crataegus - hawthorn * Cydonia - quince * Dichotomanthes * Docynia * Docyniopsis * Eriobotrya - loquat * Eriolobus * Hesperomeles * Heteromeles - toyon * Malacomeles * Malus - apple, crabapple * Mespilus - medlar * Osteomeles * Peraphyllum * Photinia * Pseudocydonia - Chinese quince * Pyracantha - firethorn * Pyrus - pear * Rhaphiolepis - hawthorn * Sorbus - rowan, whitebeam, service tree * Stranvaesia = Photinia pro parte * Torminalis (see Sorbus torminalis) Intergeneric hybrids:Stace, C.

It was formerly considered by some authors to be separate from Rosaceae, and the family names Prunaceae and Amygdalaceae have been used. Reanalysis from 2007 has shown that the previous definition of subfamily Spiraeoideae was paraphyletic. To solve this problem, a larger subfamily was defined that includes the former Amygdaloideae, Spiraeoideae, and Maloideae. This subfamily, however, is to be called Amygdaloideae rather than Spiraeoideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants as updated in 2011. Article 19.5, ex. 5 As traditionally defined, the Amygdaloideae includes such commercially important crops as plum, cherry, apricot, peach, and almond. The fruit of these plants are known as stone fruit (drupes), as each fruit contains a hard shell (the endocarp) called a stone or pit, which contains the single seed. The expanded definition of the Amygdaloideae adds to these commercially important crops such as apples and pears that have pome fruit, and also important ornamental plants such as Spiraea and Aruncus that have hard dry fruits. Taxonomic history The name Prunoideae is sometimes used, but is incorrect. The 1835 publication of that name by Gilbert Thomas Burnett (Burnett) is invalid because it lacks a description (or diagnosis or reference to an earlier description or diagnosis). Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (Horan.) published the name in 1847, but Amygdaloideae, published in 1832 by George Arnott Walker-Arnott, has priority and is therefore the correct name. The taxonomy of this group of plants within the Rosaceae has recently been unclear. In 2001 it was reported that Amygdaloideae sensu stricto consists of two distinct genetic groups or \\"clades\\", Prunus‚ÄìMaddenia and Exochorda‚ÄìOemleria‚ÄìPrinsepia. Further refinement Note that this publication pre-dates the 2011 International Botanical Congress which mandates that the combined subfamily referred to in the paper as Spiraeoideae must be called Amygdaloideae. shows that Exochorda‚ÄìOemleria‚ÄìPrinsepia is somewhat separate from Prunus‚ÄìMaddenia‚ÄìPygeum, and that the traditional subfamilies Maloideae and Spiraeoideae must be included in Amygdaloideae if a paraphyletic group is to be avoided. With this classification, the genus Prunus is considered to include Armeniaca, Cerasus, Amygdalus, Padus, Laurocerasus, Pygeum, and Maddenia. Robert Frost alluded to the merging of Amygdalaceae into Rosaceae in his poem The Rose Family, when he wrote \\"The rose is a rose and was always a rose / But the theory now goes that the apple's a rose, / and the pear is, and so's the plum, I suppose.\\" In the next line he wrote, \\"The dear [i.e., \\"the dear Lord\\", euphemized] only knows what will next prove a rose.\\" This referred to shifting botanical opinion which had recently reunited Amygdalaceae, Spiraeaceae, and Malaceae into Rosaceae (which matches de Jussieu's 1789 classification).
