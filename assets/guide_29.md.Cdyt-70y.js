He worked for the Scientific Commission for Marine Research in Heligoland, a German island in the North Sea, where he continued the work of Heinrich G√§tke (who died in 1897) in bird migration studies, setting up the bird observatory in 1910 to trap and band the migratory birds passing through the island. For six years Weigold carried out zoological research in China and Tibet and was the first Westerner to see a live giant panda in the wild, buying a cub (which did not survive for long) while part of the Stoetzner Expedition in 1916. He later became Director of Natural Sciences at the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hanover. He died in Bruckberg, Lower Bavaria.

The effect arises from changes in the gamete cells caused by intracellular parasites like Wolbachia, which infect a wide range of insect species. As the reproductive incompatibility is caused by bacteria that reside in the cytoplasm of the host cells, it is referred to as cytoplasmic incompatibility. In 1971, Janice Yen and A. Ralph Barr of UCLA demonstrated the etiologic relationship of Wolbachia infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility in Culex mosquitos when they found that eggs were killed when the sperm of Wolbachia-infected males fertilized infection- free eggs.  Symptoms  thumb|right|500px|Unidirectional CI: Mating of infected males and uninfected females results in CI. All other crosses are compatible. Bidirectional CI: Mating of males infected with Wolbachia strain I and females infected by Wolbachia strain II (and vice versa) results in CI. CI occurs when a Wolbachia infected male mates with a female that is infected by another Wolbachia strain (bidirectional CI) or is uninfected (unidirectional CI). Any other combination of un-/infected male/female crosses are compatible. An infected female is compatible with any infected or uninfected male of the same Wolbachia strain. On the other hand an uninfected female is only compatible with an uninfected male. In other words, if the male is infected by a CI- inducing strain of Wolbachia that is non-existent in its mate, it is an incompatible cross. Hosts can be cured from Wolbachia infection by antibiotic use. In diploid organisms CI leads to embryonic mortality. In contrast, CI in haplodiploid hosts may lead to haploid (and thus male) offspring. The closely related species of the wasp Nasonia show embryonic mortality as well as male development among incompatible crosses. In N. vitripennis, however, the vast majority of the CI embryos are converted into males.Tram, U, Fredrick, K, Werren, J, Sullivan, W (2006). \\"Paternal chromosome segregation during the first mitotic division determines Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype\\", J. Cell Sci. 119, 10.1242/jcs.03095. http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/119/17/3655  Cellular mechanism  There are two distinguished events that lead to the CI inducing manipulation. The first occurs inside the Wolbachia infected male during spermatogenesis and is called modification. Because Wolbachia are absent from mature sperm and appear to be excluded during the individualization process, the modification must occur before the conclusion of spermatogenesis. The second event, called rescue, takes place inside the fertilized egg where Wolbachia presence prevents CI from occurring. As long as the Wolbachia strains in egg and sperm cells correspond, harmful effects cannot be observed on a cellular level. A major consequence of CI is the delayed entry into mitosis of the male pronucleus. As a secondary consequence, stemming from this asynchrony, the paternal chromosomes do not properly condense and align on the metaphase plate during the first mitosis. As a consequence, only the maternal chromosome segregate normally, producing haploid embryos. The rescue of CI by infected eggs leads to the restoration of synchrony between the female and the male pronucleus. The exact mechanisms of how Wolbachia perform modification and rescue are unknown. In Drosophila, the earliest effects caused by CI can already be observed during the sperm chromatin remodeling of the paternal chromosomes. However, it was also observed that in other host species, the defects caused by CI only occur much later in development  Evolutionary implications  CI, as described by Werren, results in selection pressure on uninfected males, as infected females can mate both with uninfected males and infected males, but uninfected females cannot mate with infected males. As Wolbachia are only transmitted by females, this mechanism promotes the spread of Wolbachia and therefore keeps Wolbachia from dying out because of incomplete transmission. This has led to discoveries in control of disease transmission by using Wolbachia to control the reproduction of a population by introducing Wolbachia-infected males. This has been seen in the Aedes, mosquito, family, in the Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti species.  Population genetics  The infection of a population with CI-inducing Wolbachia can have different effects on the population's dynamics. At low prevalence of Wolbachia, the probability for an uninfected female to lose progeny because of mating with an infected male is fairly low. This loss of uninfected individuals is outweighed by the loss of infection due to the incomplete Wolbachia transmission. If the prevalence of CI-inducing Wolbachia is high enough, the probability for an uninfected female to mate with an infected male is high and it is thus preferable for a female to be infected. Therefore, there is an invasion threshold for the spread of Wolbachia in an uninfected population, which depends on the transmission rate of the infection and the portion of incompatible progeny which survive until they can reproduce (the strength of CI), as well as on the fitness cost of Wolbachia infection to the female. Below this threshold the invaders will die out, above this threshold the prevalence will reach a stable equilibrium. Typical thresholds in real populations are around 10% (See Fine and Stouthamer et al.). As described by Stouthamer, the invasion threshold may be crossed in two ways. *In small populations, a small number of infected individuals is sufficient to reach the invasion threshold *In bigger populations, the division of the population into small subpopulations that only exchange a low number of individuals in each generation can lead to an invasion of this subpopulation. Speciation It is speculated that CI can lead to \\"rapid speciation\\". When two populations of the same species are infected by two Wolbachia strains A and B, they might be bidirectionally incompatible and crosses between the two populations do not lead to viable offspring. Thus gene flow between these two populations is interrupted, leading to constant segregation in development and, finally, to speciation. The populations develop to a point where incompatibility would be maintained even in absence of Wolbachia.  Other pathogens  Wolbachia are not the only bacteria capable of inducing CI. For example, researchers have found that infection by bacteria of the genus Cardinium can also result in CI.

He made his debut in the NBL in 2006 as a development player with the Brisbane Bullets, going on to play for the Perth Wildcats and Gold Coast Blaze, before settling in Melbourne. In the NBL, Goulding is a two-time championship winner and a two-time All-NBL First Team honouree. He also won the league's scoring title in 2014 and claimed Grand Final MVP honours in 2018. Goulding is a regular with the Australian Boomers, but he also holds a British passport thanks to his father, which allowed him to play as a local in Spain and Italy between 2014 and 2016. Early life Goulding was born Launceston, Tasmania. He attended West Launceston Primary School and spent a lot of time around Australian rules football thanks to his father Steve. He started playing basketball in Launceston, and upon moving to Queensland with his family as an 8-year-old, he began to play it competitively. In Brisbane, he continued primary school at Gumdale State School and then attended secondary school at Brisbane State High School. He graduated from Brisbane State High in 2005. As a junior, he played for the Southern Districts Spartans. Professional career NBL and Europe Goulding began his professional career as a development player with the Brisbane Bullets during the 2006‚Äì07 NBL season. He made his NBL debut and lone appearance of the season on 23 December 2006 against the Townsville Crocodiles, recording one assist in 5¬Ω minutes. The Bullets went on to win the NBL championship in March 2007, earning Goulding his first title. He appeared in 15 games for the Bullets during the 2007‚Äì08 NBL season, but following the club's collapse, he moved west for the 2008‚Äì09 NBL season to play for the Perth Wildcats. For the 2009‚Äì10 NBL season, Goulding returned to Queensland to play for the Gold Coast Blaze. He spent three seasons with the Blaze before they too collapsed following the 2011‚Äì12 season. For the 2012‚Äì13 NBL season, Goulding joined the Melbourne Tigers. In December 2012, he was named MVP of the NBL All-Star Game for his 24 points. After a stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2013 NBA Summer League, Goulding continued on with the Tigers for the 2013‚Äì14 NBL season. On 9 March 2014, he scored a career-high 50 points in the Tigers' 92‚Äì82 win over the Sydney Kings. It was the NBL's first individual 50-point game in the 40-minute era. He was subsequently crowned the NBL scoring champion for the 2013‚Äì14 season with a league-best 23.0 points per game. After a stint with the Dallas Mavericks during the 2014 NBA Summer League, Goulding moved to Spain for the 2014‚Äì15 season to play for CAI Zaragoza. He averaged 8.6 points per game in 33 Liga ACB games, and 11.5 points per game in 16 EuroCup games. Goulding returned to Australia for the 2015‚Äì16 season and re- joined the Melbourne franchise, now known as Melbourne United. He helped United win the minor premiership after they finished the regular season in first place with an 18‚Äì10 record. However, they were defeated in the semi- finals by the New Zealand Breakers. Following the conclusion of the NBL season, Goulding moved to Italy to play out the season with Auxilium Torino. He averaged 4.2 points per game in 10 LBA games. Goulding returned to United for the 2016‚Äì17 NBL season, but he played 22 of a possible 28 games after separate left ankle sprains. United missed the finals in 2016‚Äì17 with a sixth- place finish and a 13‚Äì15 record, and following the season, he opted for surgery on his left ankle, which sidelined him for eight to ten weeks. The 2017‚Äì18 NBL season saw Goulding lead United back to the top of the table with a first-place finish and a 20‚Äì8 record. They went on to reach the NBL Grand Final series, where they defeated the Adelaide 36ers 3‚Äì2 in the best-of-five series. Goulding claimed his second NBL championship while winning the Grand Final MVP. Returning to United once again for the 2018‚Äì19 season, Goulding helped lead United back to the NBL Grand Final series, where they lost 3‚Äì1 to the Perth Wildcats. In December 2019, Goulding played his 300th NBL game. On 17 July 2020, Goulding re-signed with United on a three-year deal. Off- season State League stints Between 2006 and 2009, Goulding played with the Southern Districts Spartans in the QBL (2006) and SEABL (2007‚Äì09). In 2006, he was a member of the Spartans' championship-winning team. As a member of the Spartans for three seasons in the SEABL, Goulding won East Youth Player of the Year two consecutive seasons in 2008 and 2009 while also making the All-Star Five in his last year. In 2008, he averaged 24.5 points per game to finish second in the competition and had a season-high 43 points during the season. In 2009, averaged 20.8 points to finish fifth, second in free throw percentage (83%), ninth in three-point percentage (39%) and seventh in assists (three). Between 2010 and 2012, he played three seasons for the Northside Wizards in the QBL, earning All-League Team honours in 2010. In 2013, he had a three-game stint with the QBL's Gladstone Port City Power. National team career As a youth, Goulding represented Australia in under-18s, under-19s and under-20s, including playing at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Serbia. In 2014, he played for the Australian Boomers at the FIBA World Cup in Spain. He went on to play for the Boomers at the 2015 FIBA Oceania Championship and the 2016 Rio Olympics. In 2018, he won a gold medal with the Boomers at the Commonwealth Games, and in 2019, he competed at the FIBA World Cup in China. Personal Goulding is the son of Steve and Christine. He is married to wife Molly. His father played and coached at North Launceston Football Club, and was inducted into the AFL Tasmania Hall of Fame in 2008. Due to his father being English, Goulding holds a British passport.

His elder brother, Cornelis de Liefde, was also a naval commander. Johan was killed in the battle of Texel.  Naval career  De Liefde was born in Rotterdam, probably in 1619. On 16 June 1644, he became a captain with the Admiralty of the Maze based in Rotterdam. In the same year he sailed with the Dutch Mediterranean fleet combating the Barbary corsairs; his ship took a corsair. Shortly afterwards, De Liefde took a ship of the Dunkirkers.  First Anglo-Dutch War  During the First Anglo-Dutch War, De Liefde in 1652 again took service, first as captain of Jonas, a ship of the municipality fleet of the city, and subsequently as a commander of the admiralty vessel Dordrecht. In the battle of Dungeness, De Liefde functioned as temporary squadron subcommander, or commandeur, under Johan Evertsen, when Michiel de Ruyter replaced Witte de With during the latter's absence. De Liefde, still in the rank of captain, was also present at the relief of Gda≈Ñsk on the ship Hollandia in 1656. On 4 November 1657, while part of the fleet of Lieutenant Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam blockaded Lisbon, De Liefde captured a ship of the Portuguese sugar fleet returning from Brazil, gaining him much personal wealth. In 1658, he fought in the battle of the Sound against the Swedes, on the Dordrecht.  Second Anglo-Dutch War  At the onset of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, on 29 January 1665, De Liefde, having returned to service the Admiralty of the Maze, replaced Aert Jansse van Nes as acting rear admiral. On 15 June, he was officially appointed in this rank and function. Shortly afterwards, using Klein Hollandia as his flagship, he fought in the battle of Lowestoft as second-in-command of the second squadron, commanded by Johan Evertsen. On 24 February 1666, he became acting-vice admiral, again succeeding Van Nes. He distinguished himself fighting on the Ridderschap van Holland in the Four Days' Battle, especially on the fourth day. For his conduct, he received a golden chain from the States General. He was made a vice admiral on 5 September.  Third Anglo-Dutch War  He participated in all major battles of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and was mortally wounded in the last, the battle of Texel. De Liefde was given a grave memorial in the Great Church of Rotterdam.

Star was born in East Frisia, an area just outside the Dutch Republic that however in the 17th century had close religious and linguistic ties with it. He started his career in the Dutch Navy in 1658 when he took service with the Admiralty of Amsterdam in the rank of extraordinary captain. For three years he had convoy duty in The Channel, protecting Dutch merchantmen from Portuguese privateers during the Dutch- Portuguese War. In 1661 and 1664 he commanded the supply ship Groene Kameel, supporting the Dutch Mediterranean Fleet. This fleet, under command of Vice- Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, towards the end of 1664 was ordered to execute a punitive expedition against English possessions in West-Africa, after the British had captured Dutch trading posts there. After defeating the English, De Ruyter crossed the Atlantic to raid English colonies in the Americas. Upon his return to the Republic in the summer of 1665, it transpired that the Second Anglo-Dutch War had formally broken out. Star was promoted to full captain. In 1666 Star commanded the Gouden Leeuw of sixty cannon, a ship of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, the Dutch East Indies Company, during the Four Days Battle and the St. James's Day Battle. In the latter fight the Vice-Admiral of the Admiralty of Friesland, Rudolf Coenders, was killed. The States of Groningen had the right to choose a successor; on 13 December 1666 on commendation of De Ruyter they appointed Star. As the commander of the Frisian Fleet, Lieutenant-Admiral Tjerk Hiddes de Vries, had been killed also, Star functioned as acting lieutenant-admiral until the appointment of Lieutenant-Admiral Hans Willem van Aylva on 16 March 1667. Star in 1667 participated in the Raid on the Medway, in the later phases of the campaign commanding a squadron blockading Harwich, using as flagship the Groningen of seventy cannon. In 1672, during the Franco-Dutch War, Baron van Aylva became an Infantry General and would never return to sea. Star thus again functioned as acting commander of the Frisian Fleet during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, fighting in 1672 during the Battle of Solebay and in 1673 during the Battles of Schooneveld and the Battle of the Texel, still on the Groningen. In 1678 he commanded part of the auxiliary fleet supporting Spain against France. Star's last campaign was during the War of the Grand Alliance when he in 1691 commanded a squadron in the Anglo-Dutch fleet operating in the Irish Sea. That year he retired, still in the rank of vice-admiral. Star around 1652 married with Reynouw Gaickinga and had three children, a daughter and two sons. After the death of his first wife he remarried with Cornelia Pars, born in Appingedam. At his retirement he settled in his estate, or buitenplaats, Bolhuis at Wirdum in Groningen, where he deceased in 1705 or 1707.

Biography  Romulus was the son of Anthemius (Western Roman Emperor in 467-472) and of Marcia Euphemia. His brothers were Anthemiolus, Marcian and Procopius Anthemius, his sister was Alypia. He was a member of the House of Theodosius, as his maternal grandfather, the Eastern Emperor Marcian, had married Pulcheria, granddaughter of Theodosius I. In 479, Romulus and his brother Marcian and Procopius rebelled against the new Eastern Emperor, Zeno. They asked for the help of Theodoric Strabo, then gathered in Constantinople troops composed by both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius, and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of Illus, an Isaurian general supporter of Zeno. The emperor almost fell in the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were hit also by the citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus succeeded in moving inside Constantinople an Isaurian unit whose quarters were in the nearby Chalcedonia and in corrupting Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. On the following morning Romulus and his brothers, understanding that his situation was desperate and that the reinforcements of the Gothic general Theodoric Strabo would have not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but were arrested. They were sent to Caesarea in Cappadocia. With the help of some monks, they tried to escape, but Marcian failed, while Romulus and Procopius fled to RomeEvagrius.

In this sense \\"lascivious\\" is similar in meaning to \\"lewd\\", \\"indecent\\", \\"lecherous\\", \\"unchaste\\", \\"licentious\\" or \\"libidinous\\".  Legal usage  In American legal jargon, lascivious is a semi-technical term indicating immoral sexual actions and in certain cases, words or thoughts. It is often used in the legal description of criminal acts in which some sort of sexual activity is prohibited. The legal definition of the term varies greatly across jurisdictions, and has evolved significantly over time, reflective of current moral values as they relate to sexuality. For example, in 1896, lascivious cohabitation referred to the now-archaic crime of living with a member of the opposite sex and having premarital sex with him or her.See e.g. Swearinger v. U.S., . In 2015, the laws of three states of the United States (Florida, Michigan and Mississippi) still considered \\"lascivious cohabitation\\" as a crime.Florida moves to repeal 1868 law banning 'sinful' cohabitation In 2016, Governor Rick Scott of Florida signed into law SB 0498 which no longer makes \\"lascivious cohabitation\\" a crime. In the 2000s, the term is often used as one of several adjectives to describe pornography, solicitation for prostitution, and indecent acts, such as the exposure of one's genitalia in public (e.g. Indecent exposure). In American law mailing lascivious matter is prohibited thus: > Every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, > thing, device, or substance ... [i]s declared to be nonmailable matter and > shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by > any letter carrier., interpreted in Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day , > 482-484. \\"Lewd and lascivious\\" behavior has varying definitions across jurisdictions. Indecent exposure, for example, generally refers to the exposure of one's \\"private parts\\", which, as noted in a 1992 court case, depending on the jurisdiction, may or may not include one's buttocks, female breasts, or even pubic hair. At that time, 22 states prohibited only indecent exposure of genitalia; \\"only three States (Indiana, Iowa, and New Mexico), would treat as indecent the intentional exposure of the genital area or pubic hair, and these jurisdictions do so by means of legislation which is explicit in its terms. It thus appears that the term 'indecent exposure' lacks a 'commonly understood meaning', when considered with respect to parts of the body other than the genitalia.\\" Lechery Lechery is a behavioral pattern that includes: * Inordinate indulgence in sexual activity * Unrestrained and promiscuous sexuality * Immoderate indulgence of sexual desire * Lewd and lustful behavior Lechery is not the same as lust. Lust is an interior psychological state, the thinking about sex, the desire for it. Lechery is an outward behavior, a physical manifestation or behavior pattern of an interior condition of lust. Lust does not necessarily result in the action of lechery.Pope John Paul II, Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust. L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11.

As senior vice president and deputy chief counsel for consumer protection and payments at the American Bankers Association's (ABA) Center for Regulatory Compliance, she focuses on consumer protection laws and payment system issues. She analyzes and instructs on various regulatory and legislative proposals and final laws related to consumer financial services including credit and debit cards, privacy, deposit accounts, payments systems, and payment system fraud prevention. She informs Congress and government agencies on these subjects. She has testified before Congress. She is a former President of the American College of Consumer Financial Services Lawyers and former Chair of the Subcommittee on Electronic Fund Transfers of the American Bar Association's Consumer Financial Services Committee. She is also on the faculty at Practising Law Institute. Feddis' has contributed articles discussing regulatory and legislative developments in consumer banking matters to ABA Banking Journal and ABA Bank Compliance.Feddis bio from Speaker Biographies, National Conference of State Legislators, 2009 conference. She received her law degree from Catholic University. Media Interviews Feddis appeared on PBS' NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in March 2011 to discuss the Fed's proposed rule regarding interchange. She said, \\"Interchange is basically the merchants' contribution to creating this very valuable, available-24/7, reliable system. And that's how it started. It really was a merchant phenomenon. The merchants, or the businesses, were getting tired of the losses from when their checks were returned. So they basically agreed to pay the fee and shift those losses and the risk of those losses back to the bank. And that's what it amounts to. So, the fee covers the cost of providing this 24/7-available system. And it's reliable. It's quick. It's secure. It not only helps maintain it, but it helps improve it. That means innovation. And one of the great concerns here is that, if they don't have the money, you won't see any more innovation.\\" ::See: PBS' NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, \\"Banks, Retailers Clash Over Move to Cap Debit Card 'Swipe Fees',\\" March 8, 2011 Feddis predicted on various national news stations, including PBS' NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, and on ABC News that the Credit CARD Act would mean that credit card rates would increase generally, small businesses and consumers would find it harder to obtain credit, and limits would be lower. Recent data show that since the credit card restrictions ultimately adopted in the CARD Act were proposed in 2008, credit card interest rates have increased and credit card credit availability has declined. In contrast, during the same period, interest rates on other types of consumer credit declined, and non-revolving, non-mortgage debt as a percent of disposable income increased, suggesting that the economy alone cannot explained the increased credit cards interest rates and reduced availability. In an interview on PBS' News Hour with Jim Lehrer she said, ‚ÄúThe bills and the rules restrict the ability of card companies to adjust to changing environments, changing risks. Over time, the market changes. Over time, people change. And if [the credit card companies] can't adjust to that risk -- and risk equals cost -- other people have to absorb it. In other words, people who manage their credit well end up having to pay for people who don't repay their loans.‚Äù ::See: PBS' NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, \\"Senate Looks at Restraining Credit Card Companies,\\" May 14, 2009 On ABC News she said, ‚ÄúRiskier borrowers pay more for loans just like riskier drivers pay more for car insurance. And the inability to price for risk means that the cost is spread out over everybody.‚Äù ::See: ABC News, ‚ÄúCredit Card Fee Limits,‚Äù May 20, 2010 Subsequently, in another interview on PBS' News Hour with Jim Lehrer when asked whether the Credit CARD Act could mean credit cards would be more difficult for some to obtain, Ms. Feddis responded, ‚ÄúCongress understood when they passed this law that one of the effects would be that many people, many small businesses wouldn't be able to get credit cards as easily, accounts would be closed, limits would be lowered. They also understood that, across- the-board, interest rates would go up a bit for everybody.‚Äù In response to the observation that this was already happening, she said, ‚ÄúWe're seeing that in the advertised rates, the new accounts, but [Congress] also understood that people who manage their credit well will to some degree be subsidizing or paying for those who don't. But they made the decision that this was an acceptable compromise -- a tradeoff, if you will -- for the consumer protections. A 2011 study by Argus Information & Advisory Services found that, based on cardholder data of the 9 largest credit card issuers, credit card interest rates increased and credit availability decreased since credit card restrictions ultimately adopted in the CARD Act were proposed in 2008. She also noted the positive aspects of the CARD Act, ‚ÄúThe predominant effect of this new law is that consumers will no longer be surprised by an interest rate increase. For the most part, they will receive a 45-day advanced notice and, more importantly, the option to pay off the existing balance over time at the original rate.\\" ::See: The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, \\"Tougher Credit Card Rules Offer New Consumer Guards,\\" Aug. 20, 2009 As a banking industry representative, Feddis suggested in an interview with USA Today that the credit industry's treatment of students gives students a beneficial crash course in financial management, noting that unexpected fees may present ‚Äúan opportunity to learn to manage a bank account.‚Äù ::See: Nessa Feddis appears on AARP's Inside E Street A 2007 Washington Post article -- on banks' debit card overdraft fees -- quoted her testimony before a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee stating that paying overdrafts ‚Äúhelps to avoid embarrassment, inconvenience, merchant fees and other adverse consequences of having a check bounce or a transaction denied.‚Äù The article notes that she added: \\"Careful tracking by the customer of transactions is an important responsibility. It is even more critical today than ever before, as there are many new and convenient ways to pay for the goods and services we buy.\\" The article also pointed out that she testified that customers should keep track of their money, ‚Äúbecause they are in a better position to know their actual balance. Only they know about the most recent automatic payments they have authorized and debit card transactions they have approved.‚Äù The Washington Post columnist pointed out that debit card issuers could notify customers electronically, allowing them to avoid the overdraft fees. The article contended that \\"financial institutions don't want to change the status quo because they make good and easy money off their own customers' mistakes and irresponsibility.\\" Feddis responded that \\"current technology [2007] makes real-time notification [at the point of sale] of overdrafts cost-prohibitive.\\" Feddis has also pointed out that the majority of bank customers don't pay any banking fees‚Äîincluding overdrafts‚Äîin a 2009 MarketWatch article.

Relief carving of Darius the Great of Persia on his throne, holding a sceptre and lotus A sceptre (British English) or scepter (American English) is a staff or wand held in the hand by a ruling monarch as an item of royal or imperial insignia. Figuratively, it means royal or imperial authority or sovereignty. Antiquity Jupiter in the Hermitage, holding the sceptre and orb. The Was and other types of staves were signs of authority in Ancient Egypt. For this reason they are often described as \\"sceptres\\", even if they are full-length staffs. One of the earliest royal sceptres was discovered in the 2nd Dynasty tomb of Khasekhemwy in Abydos. Kings were also known to carry a staff, and Pharaoh Anedjib is shown on stone vessels carrying a so-called mks-staff. The staff with the longest history seems to be the heqa-sceptre (the \\"shepherd's crook\\"). The sceptre also assumed a central role in the Mesopotamian world, and was in most cases part of the royal insignia of sovereigns and gods. This is valid throughout the whole Mesopotamian history, as illustrated by both literary and administrative texts and iconography. The Mesopotamian sceptre was mostly called ƒùidru in Sumerian and ·∏´a·π≠·π≠um in Akkadian. The ancient Tamil work of Tirukkural dedicates one chapter each to the ethics of the sceptre. According to Valluvar, \\"it was not his spear but the sceptre which bound a king to his people.\\" Among the early Greeks, the sceptre (, skeptron, \\"staff, stick, baton\\") was a long staff, such as Agamemnon wielded (Iliad, i) or was used by respected elders (Iliad, xviii. 46; Herodotus 1. 196), and came to be used by judges, military leaders, priests, and others in authority. It is represented on painted vases as a long staff tipped with a metal ornament. When the sceptre is borne by Zeus or Hades, it is headed by a bird. It was this symbol of Zeus, the king of the gods and ruler of Olympus, that gave their inviolable status to the kerykes, the heralds, who were thus protected by the precursor of modern diplomatic immunity. When, in the Iliad, Agamemnon sends Odysseus to the leaders of the Achaeans, he lends him his sceptre. Among the Etruscans, sceptres of great magnificence were used by kings and upper orders of the priesthood. Many representations of such sceptres occur on the walls of the painted tombs of Etruria. The British Museum, the Vatican, and the Louvre possess Etruscan sceptres of gold, most elaborately and minutely ornamented. The Roman sceptre probably derived from the Etruscan. Under the Republic, an ivory sceptre (sceptrum eburneum) was a mark of consular rank. It was also used by victorious generals who received the title of imperator, and its use as a symbol of delegated authority to legates apparently was revived in the marshal's baton. In the First Persian Empire, the Biblical Book of Esther mentions the sceptre of the King of Persia. Esther 5:2 \\"When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.\\" Under the Roman Empire, the sceptrum Augusti was specially used by the emperors, and was often of ivory tipped with a golden eagle. It is frequently shown on medallions of the later empire, which have on the obverse a half-length figure of the emperor, holding in one hand the sceptrum Augusti, and in the other the orb surmounted by a small figure of Victory. In literature The codes of the right and the cruel sceptre are found in the ancient Tamil work of Tirukkural, dating back to the first century BCE. In Chapters 55 and 56, the text deals with the right and the cruel sceptre, respectively, furthering the thought on the ethical behaviour of the ruler discussed in many of the preceding and the following chapters.Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ verses 541‚Äì560 The ancient treatise says it was not the king's spear but the sceptre that bound him to his people‚Äîand to the extent that he guarded them, his own good rule would guard him. Christian era The Royal Sceptre of Boris III of Bulgaria An 1872 portrait of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, holding the very large Imperial Sceptre and invested with other items of the Brazilian Crown Jewels With the advent of Christianity, the sceptre was often tipped with a cross instead of with an eagle. However, during the Middle Ages, the finials on the top of the sceptre varied considerably. In England, from a very early period, two sceptres have been concurrently used, and from the time of Richard I, they have been distinguished as being tipped with a cross and a dove respectively. In France, the royal sceptre was tipped with a fleur de lys, and the other, known as the main de justice, had an open hand of benediction on the top. Sceptres with small shrines on the top are sometimes represented on royal seals, as on the great seal of Edward III, where the king, enthroned, bears such a sceptre, but it was an unusual form; and it is of interest to note that one of the sceptres of Scotland, preserved at Edinburgh, has such a shrine at the top, with little images of the Virgin Mary, Saint Andrew, and Saint James the Great in it. This sceptre was, it is believed, made in France around 1536 for James V. Great seals usually represent the sovereign enthroned, holding a sceptre (often the second in dignity) in the right hand, and the orb and cross in the left. Harold Godwinson appears thus in the Bayeux tapestry. The earliest English coronation form of the 9th century mentions a sceptre (sceptrum), and a staff (baculum). In the so-called coronation form of Ethelred II a sceptre (sceptrum), and a rod (virga) appear, as they do also in the case of a coronation order of the 12th century. In a contemporary account of Richard I‚Äôs coronation, the royal sceptre of gold with a gold cross (sceptrum), and the gold rod with a gold dove on the top (virga), enter the historical record for the first time. About 1450, Sporley, a monk of Westminster, compiled a list of the relics there. These included the articles used at the coronation of Saint Edward the Confessor, and left by him for the coronations of his successors. A golden sceptre, a wooden rod gilt, and an iron rod are named. These survived until the Commonwealth, and are minutely described in an inventory of the regalia drawn up in 1649, when everything was destroyed. For the coronation of Charles II of England, new sceptres with the Cross and the Dove were made, and though slightly altered, they are still in use today. Two sceptres for the queen consort, one with a cross, and the other with a dove, have been subsequently added. The flags of Moldova, and Montenegro have sceptres on them.

Early life Heureaux, affectionately known as Lil√≠s, was born in Puerto Plata. His father was Jos√© D‚ÄôAss√°s Heureaux Fortune, who was born in Haiti (the son of Frenchman and an African-born slave). While his mother Josefa Leibert was born on Saint Thomas. Both of his parents were dark-skinned mulattoes. Due to his cultural background, he was able to speak French and English in addition to Spanish fluently. Following the annexation of the Dominican Republic by Spain in 1861 he joined the rebellion to restore independence, becoming the principal lieutenant of Gen. Gregorio Luper√≥n. In the period following this restoration of independence, when revolutions were an annual occurrence, Heureaux emerged as one of the principal leaders of the Partido Azul. In 1876, he orchestrated an uprising that seized Puerto Plata and led to the election of Ulises Espaillat. When the nation‚Äôs leading caudillo Buenaventura B√°ez, returned to power for his fifth term and fell after less than a year, he helped overthrow the two subsequent regimes. Rise to Power When Luper√≥n became President in 1879, he chose to remain in his hometown of Puerto Plata where he had established himself as a prosperous tobacco merchant, delegating authority in Santo Domingo to Heureaux. A Catholic priest named Fernando Meri√±o became President in September 1880, Heureaux served as his Interior Minister and his behind-the-scenes influence on the rest of the cabinet apparently exceeded that of the president. Although Meri√±o briefly suspended constitutional procedures in response to unrest fomented by some remaining supporters of Buenaventura B√°ez, he abided by the two-year term established under Luper√≥n, handing the reins of government over to Heureaux on September 1, 1882. The administrations of Luper√≥n and Meri√±o succeeded in bringing relative economic stability to the republic, and in Heureaux's first two-year term he faced only one major uprising. By 1884, however, no single potential successor, among the various local caciques who constituted the republic's ruling group, enjoyed widespread support. Luper√≥n, still the leader of the ruling Azul Party, backed General Segundo Imbert, while Heureaux supported the candidacy of General Francisco Gregorio Billini. Heureaux assured Luper√≥n that he would support Imbert should he win the election, but he had ballot boxes in critical precincts stuffed in order to assure Billini's election. After being inaugurated on September 1, 1884, Billini resisted Heureaux's efforts to manipulate him and Heureaux responded by spreading rumors to the effect that Billini had decreed a political amnesty so that he could conspire with ex-president Ces√°reo Guillermo against Luper√≥n's leadership of the Azules. This precipitated a governmental crisis that forced in Billini's resignation on May 16, 1885. He was succeeded by Vice President Alejandro Woss y Gil, and Heureaux assumed an expanded role under the new government, with a number of his adherents included in the cabinet and the general himself assuming command of the national army to stem a rebellion led by Guillermo, who committed suicide when faced with capture. This further endeared Heureaux to Luper√≥n, a longtime enemy of Guillermo. Luper√≥n accordingly supported Heureaux in the 1886 presidential elections. The blatancy of the electoral fraud committed by Heureaux led the supporters of his opponent, Casimiro de Moya, to attempt an armed rebellion in the Cibao Valley. Benefiting from Luper√≥n's support in this struggle, he brutally suppressed this uprising, putting an end to the cycle of civil strife that had plagued the republic. Having again achieved power, Heureaux maintained his grip on it for the rest of his life. In 1888, he exiled Gregorio Luper√≥n, and the following year forced Congress to pass constitutional amendments abolishing the barrier against Presidential re-election and eliminating direct elections. To expand his power base, he incorporated members of both of the rival political factions, the Rojos and Azules, into his government. He also developed an extensive network of secret police and informants to avert rebellions, assassinating or forcing into exile the politicians who he could not co-opt. Heureaux enriched himself and his followers through extensive private investments in the emerging export economy, in which ‚Äúthe separation between the president‚Äôs private means and state finances was vague, fluid and almost non-existent.‚Äù H.

Dobal, Habla Lilis (Un Documento Secreto), 1986 During the last two decades of the 19th century, sugar surpassed tobacco as the country's main export, as a result of an influx of Cuban sugar planters following the Ten Years' War. Lil√≠s granted them large tracts of land in the southeastern coastal plain, where they built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. His dictatorship undertook many ambitious projects to modernize the country, including the electrification of Santo Domingo, the construction of a bridge over the Ozama River, and the initiation of inland rail service on a single-track line linking Santiago to Puerto Plata.Teresita Martinez-Vergne, Nation & Citizen in the Dominican Republic Pg. 28 Political demise and assassination 200px In order to enrich himself and his supporters, strengthen the bribe system, pay for the army, help set up sugar mills and finance infrastructural development, Lil√≠s borrowed heavily from European and American banks, even as sugar prices underwent a steep decline. In 1888, he took out a loan of three-quarters of a million pounds sterling from the Amsterdam banking house Westendorp.Eric Paul Roorda, The Dictator Next Door, Pg. 34 The Westendorp Company went bankrupt in 1892, after its agent revealed fraud in the Customs Service, where Heureaux arranged preferential tariff treatment for some of his domestic creditors. A consortium of New York businessmen calling themselves the San Domingo Improvement Co. bought out Westendorp, taking over the claims of its European bondholders, in exchange for two loans, one of $1.2 million and the other of ¬£2 million, to fund the countries external debt, to be secured with a lien over the nations customs fees.Ian Bell, The Dominican Republic, Pg. 59 As the mounting public debt made it impossible to maintain his political machine, Heureaux increasingly relied on secret loans from the San Domingo Improvement Co., sugar planters and local merchants. In 1897, with the country on the brink of bankruptcy, Lil√≠s was reduced to printing five million dollars worth of unsecured paper money, known as papaletas de Lil√≠s, ruining many of the countries merchants.Frank Moya Pons, The Dominican Republic: A National History, Pg. 271, 275 This helped trigger a new revolt among the Cibae√±o tobacco planters and merchants, leading to his assassination in Moca in July 1899. By the time of his death, the national debt exceeded $35 million, fifteen times the annual budget. During his time in office, the country's economy came largely under the control of the United States. Upon his death, it was revealed that he had taken many secret loans from foreign banks for personal enrichment. The government declared bankruptcy, the economy crumbled and the American military intervened.

Ceramic heaters are usually portable and typically used for heating a room or small office, and are of similar utility to metal-element fan heaters.  Heating principle  PTC ceramic material is semi-conductive and when voltage is applied to it, the power decreases quickly as it reaches a certain temperature according to the particular composition of the ceramic. The ceramic elements are in contact with aluminium fins, thereby heating the fins up. A fan blowing across the fins heats the air.  Differences from other electric heaters  Electric heating elements made of resistance wire also have a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity, but do not increase their resistance enough to be self-regulating; they are typically used with the wires red-hot. The ceramic, on the other hand, increases its resistance sharply at the Curie temperatures of the crystalline components, typically 120 degrees Celsius, and remains below 200 degrees Celsius, providing a significant safety advantage.

In a sexual context, groping or fondling is touching another person in an unwelcome sexual way. The term generally has a negative connotation in many societies, and the activity may be considered sexual assaultThe Age, 12 June 2019, 'Disgusting': man sentenced for groping female runner on Sydney's Bay Run or otherwise unacceptable. Touching a consenting person's body during sexual activity, massage, or medical examination is not usually considered groping, though the term is sometimes used to include clumsy, selfish, or inappropriate sexual touching. Areas of the body most frequently groped include the buttocks, breasts, vulva and thighs on a woman, and the penis, testicles and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but pressing any part of their body against another person can be considered groping. The practice of women being subjected to a pat down by officers, such as customs or security officers at airports, is controversial, though most women reluctantly accept being touched in this manner as a fact of modern life. Such behaviour by public officials requires a clear legal authorization. There was an incident in Australia in August 2019 when the host at a charity event offered his cheek to a female guest presenter for a peck, before turning his head and kissing her on the lips. The presenter publicly said ‚Äúthat kind of behaviour is intolerable and the time for women being subject to it or having to tolerate it is long gone.\\" The host apologised for his behaviour. Toucherism, considered a paraphilia, is a practice of a person touching another non-consenting person with their hands, typically in crowds, for their own sexual pleasure. Groping may be featured in pornographic films. Cultural incidents The incidence of groping varies around the world, and some countries have acquired a reputation for it. Italy used to have a reputation for men pinching women's bottoms, and the term groping could perhaps be applied, but it was not a common term at that time (mid-20th century, for example). Japan has a reputation for men groping women on trains and buses to the extent that the authorities have implemented anti-groping campaigns, which has received considerable media attention and been the subject of serious study in recent years. In parts of South Asia, including India,The Express Tribune, July 8, 2013: Eve teasing: The power game, by Tehniya S Afridi. NepalSmriti Lakhey, \\"Eve Teasing\\" , Wave # 55, July 2000. and Bangladesh, \\"Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka\\" , Daily Star, 11 October 2014. public sexual harassment or molestation (often known as \\"street harassment\\") of women by men is widely referred to as Eve teasing. Combatting groping  In many countries, non-consensual sexual touching of any part of another person's body is considered to be sexual assault and is illegal, but in almost all countries it is considered unacceptable behaviour. In practice, women are the predominant targets for groping. To combat groping, street harassment, and Eve teasing of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated women only spaces. For example, sex-segregated buses, women-only passenger cars, and compartments on trains have been introduced in Mexico, Japan, the Philippines, the UAE and other countries to reduce such sexual harassment. Some places in Germany, Korea, and China have women's parking spaces, often for related safety issues.Will High-Heel-Friendly Streets Keep Seoul's Women Happy?, Time, 2009 Many more countries, including Canada, the United States, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom also grant parking privileges to pregnant women, for safety or access reasons. Japan A sign on a station platform in Osaka, Japan, showing the boarding point for a ladies-only car. In Japan, a man who gropes women in public is called chikan (Áó¥Êº¢); and the term also describes the act itself. Crowded trains are a favorite location for groping and a 2001 survey conducted in two Tokyo high schools revealed that more than 2/3rds of female students had been groped while traveling on them. As part of the effort to combat the problem, some railway companies designate women-only passenger cars during rush hours.\\"Japan Tries Women Only Train Cars to Stop Groping: Tokyo Subway Experiment Attempts to Slow Epidemic of Subway Fondling\\" An ABC News article. While the term is not defined in the Japanese legal system, vernacular usage of the word describes acts that violate several laws. Although crowded trains are the most frequent targets, another common setting is bicycle parking areas, where people bending over unlocking locks are targeted. Chikan is often featured in Japanese pornography. This issue affects men in a different way. Since Japan has a very high conviction rate (99% by some sources), innocent men may have difficulty proving their innocence in court. The film I Just Didn't Do It by Japanese film director Masayuki Suo, based on a true story, focuses on a male office worker acquitted of groping after a five-year legal battle. The criminal courts have traditionally been lenient in cases of groping and have only recently made efforts to combat the social problem with tougher sentences.Fukada, Takahiro, \\"In anonymous packed train lurk gropers\\", The Japan Times, August 18, 2009, p. 3. United States Groping is illegal in the United States when there is no consent. The charge can vary from state to state but generally is considered to be sexual battery, sexual groping, or unlawful touching.

Biography Alexios Axouch was the son of John Axouch, the megas domestikos of the Byzantine army, boyhood friend and \\"right-hand man\\" of Emperor John II Komnenos (r. 1118‚Äì43)... Alexios himself married Maria Komnene, the daughter of John II's eldest son and co-emperor Alexios, who died in 1142.. An experienced soldier, Alexios was awarded the rank of protostrator and participated in several military campaigns during the middle reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì80). He was sent to Southern Italy in 1157, in an effort to retrieve the Byzantine position there following the defeat of megas doux Alexios Komnenos.. Despite having at the same time to manage the delicate relations, fraught with mutual suspicion, with the Holy Roman Empire, which dominated northern Italy, Axouch was apparently very successful in his mission, leading to the conclusion of an honourable peace with King William I of Sicily in 1158 that allowed the Byzantine army to extricate itself from the Italian adventure.. This allowed Manuel to focus his attention in the East, where his policies in Cilicia against the Armenian lord Thoros had failed spectacularly.. In 1165, Alexios himself was sent to Cilicia as commander-in- chief (strategos autokrator) and governor (doux) during the captivity of Constantine Kalamanos.. He possibly also participated in the war with Hungary in 1166 alongside the future B√©la III of Hungary. In circa 1167/70, however, he fell out of favour with Manuel after being charged with conspiring against him and having previously been criticized for a peculiar act of l√®se majest√©: he had decorated one of his palaces in Constantinople with magnificent pictures of the campaigns and victories of Kilij Arslan II (r. 1156‚Äì92), the Seljuk Sultan of Iconium, and not, as was customary, with the exploits of Manuel himself.. Among other things, Alexios was accused of \\"dabbling in sorcery\\" and conspiring with a Latin \\"wizard\\" to drug the Empress Maria of Antioch to prevent her from giving birth to an heir. The historian John Kinnamos maintained that the charges of conspiracy were genuine, but Niketas Choniates believed that Axouch had been set up by the insecure Manuel.. In particular, Choniates reports that Manuel suspected both Axouch and his cousin, the future Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182‚Äì85), because of the AIMA prophecy, that stated that his successor's name would begin with an \\"A\\".. Whatever the truth, Alexios was found guilty and confined to a monastery for the rest of his days, despite his wife's repeated efforts to secure his release by Manuel. Maria reportedly died from her sorrow over her husband's fate, while Alexios himself also dying a few years after his tonsure. Alexios Axouch had two sons, one of whom, John Komnenos \\"the Fat\\", led an abortive revolt against Emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195‚Äì1203) in July 1201, and was killed during it.

It is suitable as a meditation seat.  Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§¨‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß, Baddha meaning \\"bound\\", ‡§ï‡•ã‡§£, Ko·πáa meaning \\"angle\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, ƒÄsana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The name Baddha Konasana is relatively recent, but the pose is medieval, as the meditation seat Bhadrasana (from ‡§≠‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ Bhadra, \\"throne\\") is described in the 15th century Ha·π≠ha Yoga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ 1.53-54. cobbler in Rajasthan, working in Ardha Baddha Konasana  Description  From sitting position with both the legs outstretched forward, hands by the sides, palms resting on the ground, fingers together pointing forward, the legs are hinged at the knees so the soles of the feet meet. The legs are grasped at the ankles and folded more until the heels reach the perineum. The knees move down to the ground, and with practice reach there; the body is erect and the gaze in front. The asana is held before coming back to the starting position. The thighs are stretched with care. When used for meditation, the hands are placed in Anjali mudra (prayer position) in front of the chest. It is a strong groin- and hip-opener and one of the few asanas that can be practiced comfortably soon after eating, except for the forward-bending variation with the head on the floor. It is claimed in Light on Yoga, citing Grantly Dick Reed's Childbirth Without Fear, that the pose is beneficial to pregnant women, as regular practice reduces pain during delivery. If there is a groin or knee injury, the knees must be supported on folded blankets.  Variations  A common variant is Supta Baddha Konasana, Cobbler's Pose in Lying Position, from ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§, supta, meaning \\"supine\\" or \\"reclining\\". In pregnancy, the pose can be practised reclining as \\"Wall Butterfly\\", with the buttocks and feet against a wall, feet together, the knees falling to the sides. The hands can be used to press the knees. Tarasana, Star Pose, has the body leaning forwards over the clasped feet. With the thighs supported on folded blankets, 10-pound sandbags may be placed on the inner thigh (near the groin) to assist the stretch.

After buying a South Bend, Indiana foundry with partner Harvey Little in 1855 he began experimenting with improved farm plow designs. Driven by the sales of his popular Oliver Chilled Plow, for which he registered 45 patents during his lifetime, the company grew to become one of the largest in Indiana and one of the world's largest producers of farm plows and horse drawn equipment during the late 19th century. Early life James Oliver was born August 28, 1823 in Liddesdale, Scotland the youngest of the nine children of Mary Irving and George Oliver. His family was Presbyterian and James was taught to read and write in a local church. His father was a shepherd but found it difficult to earn an income to support his family. An outbreak of cholera in 1832 killed most of family flock, and George injured his leg the following year making it difficult for him to walk. The family's oldest sons immigrated to the United States in the following years and prepared a home for the rest of the family to join them in 1835. There the family worked on a farm near Alloway, New York that had been purchased by the sons.Howard, p. 399 Oliver took a job working on nearby farms performing manual labor and becoming acquainted with field plowing. One of Oliver's sisters married to a pioneer who moved to what would become LaGrange County, Indiana. In 1836 James and some of his siblings traveling to live with them on their homestead. The family home was near Mishawaka, Indiana where a large bog provided an abundance of iron. A number of foundries and iron works were being built in the area and Oliver took a number of jobs working on construction projects. He briefly attended George Merrifield School where furthered his basic education. He took a job at South Bend Blast Furnace Company in 1839 where he first learned how to cast iron. Oliver married to Susan Catherine on May 30, 1844, the daughter of a fellow laborer. The two bought a log cabin near Mishawaka and lived there for eight months before selling to purchase a new home nearer to town. They purchased a third home in 1852 on a lot with an orchard. Business In 1855 Oliver moved again to South Bend, Indiana where he entered into a partnership with two businessmen to operate a foundry. His investment gave him a 25% ownership of the foundry. The company was named the South Bend Iron Works, and Oliver oversaw its operations. The business made a fair income and in 1856 Harvey Little and Oliver bought out the other shares. Oliver began experimenting with improved field plow. Farm plows of the time were pulled by a draft animal as the farmer walked behind. There were many common problems with the plows: muddy ground could cause soil to become stuck on the upper edges of plow requiring the farmer to stop and clean the plow before continuing. When large stones were hit a certain speed, they could cause the plows to break or dent them enough to make them unusable. Oliver's designs sought to resolve both of these issues. He created a molded top edge for the plows allowing it to more easily shed mud away and preventing it from lodging in harness. He also developed a method of casting the plows in a sand mold which rapidly cooled the outer surface of the metal, causing it to be more significantly hardened, while allowing the center to cool slowly, preventing the plow from becoming brittle. The resulting plow was significantly stronger, retained its cutting edge much longer, and required less cleaning during plowing. The mansion of James Oliver in South Bend, Indiana Oliver received a number of patents on his designs and began selling the new plows in 1857. He only sold fifty during that year, but began to market them and demonstrate them at public events. In 1858 he created a model called the \\"Indiana Plow\\". By 1860 he had perfected the design, Model No. 40, and sales quickly grew. In August of that year Little and Oliver sold shares of the company to T. M. Bissell. On December 24 of the same year a fire broke out in the foundry completely destroying the building. The company quickly rebuilt, buoyed by their growing sales. Oliver began working as the companies traveling salesman working out distribution agreements. In 1863 Little left the company which was renamed Oliver and Bissell. Bissell oversaw production, while Oliver concentrated on development. By 1864 the company had grown to employ twenty-five workers and a new investor, George Milburn, was brought in to fund expansion. Oliver received a new patent in 1868 for large plow that required a team of draft animals to pull. The new plow was significantly superior to all others on the market, leading a massive surge in sales. The same year Clement Studebaker, an owner of the Studebaker company made an investment in the business to help it reincorporate and expand. The company's product grew to dominate its competition and produced as many as 300,000 plows a year; by 1878 the company was exclusively producing plows. A number of specialized models were created for different types of soil. Sales spread internationally, and company adopted the slogan \\"Plowmaker of the World\\". As popularity grew, so did attempts to steal Oliver's designs. He launched several suits to have imitators and patent violators' businesses shut down. The company began to have competition from John Deere and International Harvester because of Oliver's longtime resistance to producing riding plows, instead focusing only on walk-behind plows. The company remained a leader in farm implements into the twentieth century. Over the years, Oliver was able to purchase all the stock in the business that had been sold to other investors and became the sole owner. The business was a major contributor to growth of South Bend, Indiana and the surrounding area. Death and legacy During his lifetime Oliver registered 45 patents on improved plow designs. He and his company were very successful and the company was worth millions of dollars. Oliver died on March 2, 1908 in his South Bend mansion. After a brief ceremony, he was buried in the Riverview Cemetery. He left the company to his family; his son Joseph D. Oliver had been a leading manager of the company for several years. He took the company public in 1912. The company went on to develop mechanized farm equipment and remained a national farm equipment competitor until 1933 when it went through a series of mergers. Today the company is part of the AGCO Allis conglomerate.

History The present museum was established in 1985.Information from museum spokesperson The museum received the Nautiek Award, for services to diving history, in 2001; the first time the award had been given to a UK establishment. In 2015, the museum was reopened following a refurbishment, part-funded by a ¬£15,000 grant from Arts Council England. The building's small doorway opens up into a large hall of displays. In 1881, the Ancient Order of Foresters bought the building, and inscribed \\"Foresters' Hall\\" over the door. Exhibits The museum has collections and displays on themes of the natural world, local oyster trade, early diving and the actor, Peter Cushing, who lived locally, as well as displays on the 1953 floods, shipwrecks and maritime archaeology. The collections are held under the following headings: social history, science and technology, maritime, land transport, fine art, decorative and applied art, archives and archaeology. The natural world display shows life on the shoreline, including plants, fossils, sealife and birds. The museum's largest object is Whitstable's first horse- drawn fire pump, which was manned by twenty-six volunteers. In 1867, the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society had donated it to the town. The diving display shows standard diving dress with Siebe Gorman helmet and the traditional red bonnet to protect the head against the helmet (see image below). The museum also contains relics from the East Indiaman Hindostan, which wrecked at Margate in January 1803. In 2010, the BBC chose the pudding pan pots from Whitstable Museum as objects illustrating the history of Kent as part of the A History of the World in 100 Objects project. The museum provides object identification services, and holds specialist publications on its collections. Facilities are available by advance booking for study of objects from the collections.

The family settled in Hougham, Kent and Dover, Kent soon thereafter. He attended Dover College and later Guy's Hospital in London, where he received training as a physician and took up a post as a country doctor in mining villages near Coxhoe, County Durham.  Polar exploration  In 1894, Koettlitz joined the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth expedition to Franz Josef Land as physician and geologist. On returning to Dover, brought back a polar bear, which is still in the Dover Museum. Koettlitz Island (Ketlitsa Ostrova) ‚Äì a low-lying island in the British Channel in the Franz Josef Land archipelago ‚Äì is named after him. In 1901, Koettlitz volunteered for Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition to Antarctica, as physician and biologist. Many of his samples are held in the archives of the Natural History Museum, London. His assistant on this trip was E.A. Wilson, later surgeon on Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition. On a trip he led across McMurdo Sound, Koettlitz discovered two glacial features later named after him: the Koettlitz Glacier and the Koettlitz N√©v√©.

Following independence, he was elected to the First Mexican Congress as the representative for Chiapas and served on its committee for the colonization of unoccupied territory. Two years later, he made brigadier general and served as Minister of War under President Guadalupe Victoria, although he resigned within nine months over differences with the administration. He served with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna in repelling the Spanish reconquest of Mexico in 1829.DePalo, William A., Jr. The Mexican National Army, 1822-1852. College Station TX: Texas A&M; University Press 1997. He then served as State Inspector at Veracruz, part of a Mexican mission to England, and director of the Mexican School of Artillery until 1827. The same year, he went to Tamaulipas and Texas. Commandant After returning to Mexico, General Ter√°n served as second in command to Santa Anna during his defense of Tampico against the Spanish invasion of 1829. He participated in the Capitulation of Pueblo Viejo. Their success made them both national heroes. Considered a strong candidate for president, he lost his chance when Santa Anna and Zavala's coup d'etat briefly gave the position to Vicente Guerrero. The next year, another coup elevated Anastasio Bustamante, who named Mier y Ter√°n as his commandant general for the northeastern provinces, giving Ter√°n military and civil authority over the provinces of Coahuila y Tejas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas. Headquartered at the recently renamed city of Matamoros, he arrived in Galveston Bay in November 1831, to review the port of Anahuac and install the Serb George Fisher as its new customs agent. Texian scofflaws had been smuggling and evading taxes, so he granted Fisher authority over the mouth of the Brazos River, as well. The general instructed John Bradburn to enforce title fees and remove an unauthorized ayuntamiento installed at Liberty. These administrative changes led directly to the Anahuac Disturbances, an uprising that was a precursor to the 1836 Texas Revolution. Following a Federalist victory near Matamoros on July 3, 1832, there was pressure on Mier y Ter√°n to become a candidate for the presidency. He was considered a moderate conservative, which placed him in between contending factions of liberals and conservatives. He was one the creole elites who felt that they had failed in the post-independence period to forge a nation. As commander in Texas, he saw the northern region slipping away to the Anglo- Americans, and he became increasingly worried about another Spanish attempt to reconquer Mexico. He wrote, \\"I believe that the Spaniards can only cause us temporary damages; the serious and permanent ones are reserved for our own hands, and those of the North American neighbors.\\"quoted in Green, Stanley C. The Mexican Republic: The First Decade, 1823-1832. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, p. 223. He also wrote Lucas Alam√°n the day before he ended his life, asking how Mexico could hold Texas if they could not stop killing each other.Green, The Mexican Republic, p. 223. In despair, he committed a highly symbolic suicide by throwing himself on his sword in Padilla, Tamaulipas. It was the same location where Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide had been executed in 1824, following his return from exile by the men of General Felipe de la Garza Cisneros. Mier y Ter√°n's remains were buried with Iturbide's as were his wishes.Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power, p. 138. In 1838, when the emperor's bones were re-interred in Mexico City. Family General Ter√°n was the youngest of the three sons of Manuel de Mier y Ter√°n and his wife Mar√≠a Ignacia de Teruel y Llanos. Legacy The city of General Ter√°n in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, is named in his honor. Ciudad Mier, Tamaulipas, however, was named after Francisco Mier y Torre, the governor of Nuevo Le√≥n from 1710 to 1714. He was also the namesake of Fort Ter√°n on the Neches River in modern Tyler County, Texas.

It was written by executive producer and head writer Steven Moffat and broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 10 April 2010. In the episode, the Eleventh Doctor‚Äîa time travelling alien played by Matt Smith‚Äîand his new companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) arrive in the distant future aboard the Starship UK, a ship constructed to transport the population and major cultural artefacts of the United Kingdom (except Scotland, who \\"wanted their own ship\\") away from Earth to escape the deadly solar flares that made Earth uninhabitable. However, they discover that the government of the ship secretly tortures a Star Whale that guides the ship, the abandonment of which is believed will destroy the ship and kill everyone on board. The episode, which featured the first time Amy was away from her home world, was designed to show how important she was to the Doctor and his need for a companion. As part of the second production block of the series, the episode's production took place in Autumn 2009. \\"The Beast Below\\" was seen by 8.42 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD, the fifth most-watched programme in the week it was broadcast. It was met with a generally positive reception from critics; many praised the chemistry between Smith and Gillan, but some thought that there were too many imaginative concepts that did not make a satisfying conclusion, or that the message of the episode was not as strong as it should have been. Plot Synopsis The Eleventh Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, a colony ship in the future the population of the United Kingdom evacuated on to escape deadly solar flares. Amy is taken by the monk-like Winders to one of many voting booths set up on the ship when she investigates a hole containing a tentacled creature. She is shown a video about the truth of Starship UK, and then asked if she wants to protest the truth or forget it, the latter causing her short-term memory to be wiped. Amy chooses to forget, and creates a video to herself to prevent the Doctor from learning the truth, before the mind wipe. The Doctor is curious as what \\"protest\\" will cause and activates it, sending him and Amy into the maw of a giant creature below the ship. The Doctor induces the creature to vomit, allowing them to escape back to the ship. The Doctor and Amy meet Queen Elizabeth X, known as Liz 10, the ruler of the ship. A Winder with a Smiler face on as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. The Winders eventually capture the group, and they are taken to the Tower of London. The Doctor discovers that Starship UK rides atop a giant Star Whale, controlled by sending painful electrical impulses to its brain via a control panel in the Tower. Liz 10 finds a message from her younger self telling her that she ordered this, and is given the option either to forget and keep the Star Whale piloting the ship, or to abdicate and cause the ship‚Äôs destruction. The Doctor decides to make the Whale brain-dead, allowing it to continuing travelling. As the Doctor starts the process, Amy recalls hearing the Winders' leader Hawthorne stating the Whale would not eat the children. She forces Liz 10 to hit the abdicate control; to everyone's surprise, the Whale continues travelling, at a faster speed. Amy posits that like the Doctor, the Whale had come to Earth willingly to help save the remaining children, and is helping Starship UK. After the Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, they receive a call from Winston Churchill at the Cabinet War Rooms, where the shadow of a Dalek appears. Continuity It is noted that the Earth was abandoned in the 29th century due to solar flares; this was a central plot point of the classic serials The Ark in Space and The Sontaran Experiment. Liz 10 mentions the Doctor's previous encounters with British monarchs, including Victoria (\\"Tooth and Claw\\"), Elizabeth I (seen in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" and referenced in \\"The End of Time\\") and Elizabeth II (Silver Nemesis). Liz 10 herself is seen again in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" confronting an intruder in the Royal Collection in the 52nd century. The workman's tent investigated by Amy is in front of a shop called \\"Magpie Electricals\\"; a shop that first appears in \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\". The episode also continues the story arc of the crack pattern, where it appears at the end of the episode on the side of the Starship UK. Production The episode was intended to show the importance of the Doctor's companion Amy Pond, played by Karen Gillan (pictured) Executive producer and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy into the role of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him. \\"The Beast Below\\" was in the second production block of the series. The read-through for the episode took place 20 August 2009. Scenes set in Liz 10's Buckingham Palace were filmed at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot on a night shoot on 22 September 2009. The interior of the orangery was used as the Palace. The room in the Tower of London where the climax takes place was filmed at Neath Abbey. The industrial streets of Starship UK were filmed in a disused factory in Mamhilad, with the art department designing it in accordance to Moffat's specific description in the script. Gillan put in some of her own wonder at the set into Amy's actions when she admires the street for the first time. The set for the whale's tongue was challenging for both the art department and the actors. With guidance from the stunt co-ordinator, Smith and Gillan were required to slide down a short slide before dropping six feet. Gillan stated that this was the \\"most bizarre\\" moment of filming for her. For the opening scene in which the Doctor holds Amy's ankle while she is suspended in space, Gillan was hoisted on wires above the TARDIS prop in front of a greenscreen while a wind machine created the effects of being in space. Both Sophie Okonedo and Terence Hardiman, who played Liz 10 and government head Hawthorne respectively, have had experience in Doctor Who related roles. Okonedo previously portrayed Alison Cheney, a companion of the alternate Ninth Doctor known as the Shalka Doctor in the online flash-animated serial Scream of the Shalka. Hardiman later voiced King Sitric in the Big Finish audio play The Book of Kells. Broadcast and reception \\"The Beast Below\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 10 April 2010. Unofficial overnight viewing figures stated that 6.4 million viewers watched on BBC One with an additional 330,000 watching a simulcast on BBC HD. This meant that the show was the most watched show of the day. When time-shifted figures were added, the viewing figures on BBC One were 7.93 million while BBC HD's ratings rose to 494,000, making the final consolidated figures for the episode 8.42 million. It was the fifth most- watched programme on BBC One for the week ending 11 April 2010 and the 11th for the week across all UK channels. The episode received an Appreciation Index of 86, considered \\"excellent\\". \\"The Beast Below\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray with the episodes \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" and \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" and special features on 7 June 2010. It was then re-released as part of the complete series five DVD on 8 November 2010. Critical reception The episode received generally positive reviews by television critics. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, awarded the episode five stars, praising Matt Smith's \\"mercurial\\" Doctor, Sophie Okonedo's acting, and the concept of the episode. However, he worried that Moffat \\"may not be as interested in the Time Lord as the rest of his fans\\", referring to a scene in which the Doctor dismisses the death of his people as a \\"bad day\\". Keith Watson in Metro praised the developing relationship between the Doctor and Amy. Sam Wollaston in The Guardian noted the parallels between the future UK and modern Britain, and also confessed to \\"being in love with Amy Pond\\". SFX Magazine Russell Lewin gave \\"The Beast Below\\" four out of five stars, calling it \\"immensely satisfying\\". He particularly praised the two lead performances and Amy's characterisation as companion, as well as the writing and dialogue. Dan Martin, also of The Guardian, praised the story for testing the characters' relationships rather than being just a visit to the Starship UK to make it better, though he commented that the \\"anti-vivisection message\\" seemed to be lost along the way. He praised the way the Doctor was portrayed in terms of his more inhumane instincts in contrast to the Tenth Doctor and rated the episode as \\"four out of five\\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern said that the episode \\"neither moved [him] to wave a Save the Starwhale banner nor reach for the nearest harpoon\\" and made him feel \\"out of the loop\\" as it seemed more directed at children than adults. However, he praised the acting of Smith, Gillan, and Sophie Okonedo, as well as the creation of the robotic Smilers. IGN's Matt Wales had a more mixed opinion about the episode, rating it a \\"good\\" 7 out of 10. He considered it imaginative with \\"more brilliant ideas...than most other shows can muster in an entire season\\", but he thought the episode \\"never quite brought its cacophony of ideas together to form a satisfying whole\\", and the conclusion \\"failed to resonate effectively against the hodgepodge of insane ideas and action\\". Because of the large number of ideas, Wales also pointed out that the characterisation was \\"scant\\", especially on Liz 10 and the Smilers. However, he praised Smith's and Gillan's chemistry and Moffat's \\"crackling dialogue\\". In February 2013, Moffat cited \\"The Beast Below\\" as his least-favourite among the episodes he wrote, describing it as \\"a bit of a mess\\".

The episode, written by new head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Adam Smith, saw a complete change in cast and production crew. In the episode, the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) crashes his time and space machine, the TARDIS, into the small English village of Leadworth, where he meets a young Scottish girl named Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood). The Doctor is forced to leave, but promises Amelia he will return in five minutes. However, he arrives twelve years late and is confronted by the grown-up Amelia, now known as Amy (Karen Gillan), who does not trust him. He attempts to gain her trust to help return the shape-shifting alien Prisoner Zero to the galactic police, the Atraxi, before they destroy the Earth. The episode is the first starring appearance of Smith as the Doctor and Gillan as his new companion. It also introduced Arthur Darvill as Amy's boyfriend Rory Williams, who would later become a main cast member. The show's tradition is for the Doctor to rest after he regenerates, but Moffat decided to have him save the world instead. The episode sets up the main story arc of the series by introducing the cracks in the universe. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was seen by 10.08 million viewers in the UK, the highest rated premiere since \\"Rose\\". It also attracted popularity on the online BBC iPlayer and on BBC America in the United States. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who welcomed Smith and Gillan into the series. Plot The Episode Starts Seconds after The End Of Time - Part 2, with The newly regenerated Eleventh Doctor crash-landing his TARDIS in the English village of Leadworth. The Doctor leaves the TARDIS to self-repair while the girl Amelia Pond helps him recover. She shows him a crack in her bedroom wall that he recognises as a tear in space-time, leading to an Atraxi prison. The Atraxi alert him to the escape of Prisoner Zero. Before he can respond, he must take the TARDIS for a short trip to help its repairs, and promises Amelia he will be back in five minutes. She packs a suitcase and waits for him. The Doctor returns, unaware twelve years have passed. He is accosted by an older Amelia, now going by Amy, who has been ridiculed by the townsfolk for her fascination with her \\"raggedy Doctor\\". The Doctor sees a door hidden by a perception filter in Amy's home, and finds Prisoner Zero inside. They flee before it attacks. The Atraxi arrive in Earth's orbit and, speaking through all communication devices, demand they turn over Zero or they will destroy the Earth. Searching for Zero, who is able to take the form of any unconscious being that it has telepathically linked to, they run across Amy's boyfriend Rory, who helps spot Zero posing as one of the coma patients in his care. The Doctor directs Amy and Rory to the hospital, while he gate-crashes an online meeting of experts discussing the Atraxi warning to give them instructions. Amy and Rory corner Zero at the hospital, and the Doctor arrives as the experts execute his plan, broadcasting \\"zero\\" to the Atraxi along with the photos of the coma patients from Rory's phone, revealing Zero's identity. Zero shows it has one more form, knocking out Amy and taking the form of Amelia. The Doctor speaks to Amy's subconscious to force Zero to take its native form, allowing the Atraxi to recapture it. Zero warns the Doctor as it is taken away \\"silence will fall\\". As the Atraxi leave Earth, the Doctor declares that he is Earth's protector and sternly cautions them not to threaten the planet again. The Doctor returns to the fully repaired TARDIS and leaves without saying goodbye. He rematerialises two years later, and while Amy is still bitter over his original disappearance, she agrees to his offer to travel with him. As the TARDIS dematerialises, the viewer is shown Amy's bedroom, where her wedding dress lies. Production Background and casting alt=A man with short brown hair appears to be talking. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" marked several production changes. Steven Moffat succeeded Russell T Davies as executive producer and head writer. Piers Wenger and Beth Willis replaced Julie Gardner as executive producer. A new logo was incorporated into a new title sequence with a new variation of the theme tune, composed by Murray Gold. By the end of \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", the Doctor has a new sonic screwdriver and the TARDIS sported a new interior and exterior, similar to the one used from 1963 to 1966. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of \\"The Eleventh Hour\\"; the Time Rotor on the console had to be rebuilt due to the explosive special effects that were used in \\"The End of Time\\". \\"The End of Time\\" saw the end of David Tennant's tenure of the Doctor and his regeneration into Matt Smith. Moffat was originally looking to cast a middle-aged actor, but he and Wenger went with the 26-year-old Smith in what they considered an easy decision. Karen Gillan was cast as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond; she had previously appeared in the fourth series episode \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" and was suggested to Moffat by casting director Andy Pryor. Gillan auditioned for the role in both her natural Scottish and English accents. Only after Gillan was cast was Amy made Scottish. The young Amy, known as Amelia, was played by Karen Gillan's real-life cousin Caitlin Blackwood. Though Gillan recommended Blackwood, the young actor first had to undergo rigorous auditions, lacking any formal acting experience. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was also the debut of Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams, who became a regular in the sixth series. Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was \\"just how funny\\" he was. EastEnders star Nina Wadia was chosen for the part of the doctor at the Leadworth Hospital. Wadia speculated that she was cast because she had worked with Adam Smith before. Patrick Moore appears as himself in the video conference with a brief speaking part, though not all his lines survived the final cut. The man above Moore is the brother of Adam Smith. Marcello Magni, who played a man Prisoner Zero impersonates that barks like his dog, had already worked as a canine impersonator. Academy Award-winning actor Olivia Colman and The Umbrella Academy star Tom Hopper make pre-stardom appearances in small roles (as one of Prisoner Zero‚Äôs forms, and Jeff, respectively). Arthur Cox, who played Mr. Henderson previously played Cully in The Dominators in 1968. Writing The title of the episode is a play on words, referring both to the introduction of the eleventh Doctor and to the fact that he was nearly too late, the connotation of the phrase. In the DVD commentary, Moffat said it was originally titled The Doctor Returns, and that it was the most difficult script he had ever written, as he had to introduce a new Doctor, a new companion, convince the audience that it was both a new and an old show, and deliver a fast-paced story. While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought it would be fun to make him save the world instead. He described it as a comedy of a man whose day keeps getting worse and worse. Believing that London and companions from London had become a clich√© and the audience had become bored with it, Moffat set the episode in the fictional village of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, debated whether to locate the episode in a village in Scotland. He ultimately decided on England, in keeping with the notion of Amelia as an unconventional girl. Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he gradually gets used to his new body and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he \\"finally clicks into place\\" after picking out his new outfit.\\" The rooftop scene was not in the original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed this was the kind of relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she is a very different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor. Moffat was inspired by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a child might think that something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design ‚Äî a giant eyeball on a star ‚Äî was easy for children to draw, as he used to draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who \\"domestically-scaled menace\\" principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because he figured no one would care. The opening sequence, in which the Doctor barely hangs onto the crashing TARDIS as it flies over London, was later added to the script to bridge from the conclusion of \\"The End of Time\\" to the TARDIS's crash into Amy's garden. Moffat thought it would be funny if they showed him hanging out of the TARDIS and nearly crashing into London, which would start an episode set in a small town in a big way. Moffat also referenced the scene from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner, where Tigger claims to like everything, but then proceeds to reject all food offered to him until he finally finds that he likes extract of malt. Moffat's variant had the newly regenerated Doctor reject a variety of foods, with the exception of fish fingers with custard, offered to him by the young Amy. Moffat felt that appealing to children was important to the show's success. The scene where the Doctor creates the virus using Jeff's laptop was originally set in a classroom where the Doctor used the students' computers; this was changed for production reasons. In the episode, the Doctor snaps his fingers to open the TARDIS, a trick his previous incarnation learned from River Song in \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\". He also repeats the lines \\"wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey\\" and \\"some cowboys in here\\" from the Moffat-written episodes \\"Blink\\" and \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\". Filming and effects alt=A woman with red hair wearing a policewoman's costume looks alarmed. In front of her, a dark-haired man in a tattered shirt and tie looks to the left. The read-through for the episode took place in September 2009. Though it is the first episode of the series, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was not the first to be shot. It was filmed in the third production block, after the completion of episodes 2-5. As Smith was aware of how his Doctor would act in the following episodes, he used this one to establish the character. The plan was to retain traces of Smith's predecessor, but the executive producers wanted Smith to be \\"stranger\\". The episode was directed by Adam Smith, who was attracted to the \\"brilliant script\\" and working with Matt Smith after seeing him on stage. Smith was asked to direct \\"the same but make it a bit different ‚Äì the producers didn't want it to be radically different, but they did want it to be different\\". The goal was to make it more \\"cinematic\\" and magical, and Smith took inspiration from E.T. and Tim Burton's work. Amelia's house was designed to appear \\"spooky but ordinary\\" and reminiscent of a castle. Most scenes based in Leadworth were filmed in Llandaff village in Cardiff on 29 September, 5‚Äì7 October, and 20 November 2009. Photographs were taken on 5 October for the stop-frame animation sequence representing the Doctor's thought process. As the stills were taken by members of the crew and not computers the result was not perfect, which Adam Smith thought provided an \\"organic\\" feel. Plagued by torrential rain, the crew returned on 20 November to shoot the final Leadworth scenes. The production crew heavily dressed the area, adding flowers, street signs and souvenirs specific to Leadworth. The Doctor hanging out of the TARDIS was filmed with Smith in front of a greenscreen, while the aerial footage of London was achieved with a helicopter. Smith stated that the scene was hard to visualise as it relied heavily on computer-generated images. Nearly every scene in the sequence is a visual effects shot, including a 3-D TARDIS flying over London and a CG Doctor hanging out of the TARDIS in the aerial shots. Moffat realised that the Millennium Dome was visible in the final footage, and so the scene could not be set in 1996 before it had been built. Instead of a reshoot, Moffat explained that the TARDIS could be just about to go back in time and materialise in Amelia's garden. In post-production, 30 tracks of sound effects, music composed by Murray Gold specifically for the sequence, and Smith's \\"grunting and groaning\\" were added. The primarily music-led sequence was produced by Nikki Wilson, who receives a \\"special thanks\\" credit. While Amelia waits for the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house where something, presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is actually Smith in footage intended for the finale, \\"The Big Bang\\", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms that he is the man she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based the style of the confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an electrical wire that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The \\"fish fingers and custard\\" scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were actually a breaded coconut-flavoured food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them. Broadcast and reception \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 3 April 2010. Overnight figures reported that 8 million watched the episode on BBC One and the simulcast on BBC HD. Final consolidated figures rose to 9.59 million on BBC One and 494,000 on BBC HD, making the final rating for the episode 10.08 million viewers, the most-watched premiere since \\"Rose\\" and the eighth highest rated episode since Doctor Who 2005 return. The episode was second for the entire week on BBC One and number four for the week across all channels. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e March 29-April 4, 2010\\" The episode earned an Appreciation Index of 86, considered \\"excellent\\". The episode was also popular on BBC's online iPlayer. Within one week of broadcast, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" received 1.27 million hits on BBC's online iPlayer service, the record for most requests in a week. It went on to become the most requested episode of 2010 with 2.241 million views; Doctor Who was named the most watched programme of the year on the service. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was first broadcast in the US on BBC America on 17 April 2010 and in Canada on the same date on Space. It set a record for BBC America, with an average of 1.2 million viewers and 0.9 million in the adults aged 25‚Äì54 demographic. The episode aired in Australia on 18 April on ABC1. It could also be viewed on ABC's website iView two days prior to the television air date, on 16 April. The show was broadcast two weeks after airing in Britain, as the BBC required a fortnight to edit down the Doctor Who Confidential: Cut Down. There was no room for the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential due to the hour-long running time, but ABC holds the rights and has made it available on iView. The episode aired in New Zealand on 2 May on Prime. Critical reception \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" received positive reviews from critics. Benji Wilson, for The Daily Telegraph, wrote \\"It was ridiculous but it felt right: mad, alien, brand-new but very old. A+ to the casting director. A+ to Smith\\". He also said that Gillan \\"110 per cent nailed it\\". Though he compared Prisoner Zero's low-budget CGI makeup to a \\"draught excluder\\", he said that Moffat \\"turned a weakness into a strength\\" by having Prisoner Zero take the form of humans. Daniel Martin of The Guardian called \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" \\"an absolute triumph\\" and the fact that \\"the story wisely doesn't waste too much time with an unstable regeneration\\". Though he praised Smith, he commented he was \\"still not feeling\\" the \\"Geronimo!\\" catchphrase. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern believed it was \\"obvious\\" that Smith's Doctor would be \\"up there with the greatest\\" and also praised Gillan, though he was unsure of the rescored theme tune. He also praised Moffat's script for \\"[offering] funny lines...directorial flourishes and a host of blink-and-miss star turns\\". Zap2it's Sam McPherson gave the episode an A+, saying that it was \\"definitely\\" his favourite and praised the debut of Smith, Gillan and the redesigned TARDIS. Paul Kerton, also of the site, praised Adam Smith for \\"[handling] the episode beautifully\\", the depth in Amy's character, and Matt Smith's take on the role. However, he thought the downside to the episode were the \\"slightly poor effects\\" and \\"somewhat lightweight story\\", and while he called the new title sequence \\"absolutely beautiful\\", he was unsure of the new variation of the theme tune. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" five out of five stars, thinking that Moffat captured \\"the way children perceive the Doctor\\" and praising the debuts of Smith and Gillan. The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps gave the episode an A-, explaining that he liked Smith \\"a lot\\" but was not sure if the Eleventh Doctor was separate enough from the Tenth yet. He called Gillan \\"instantly winning\\" and that the story was \\"no exception\\" from Moffat's typical \\"exceptionally strong narratives, keen sense of character, and efficient plotting\\". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that the episode \\"works\\" as an introduction, though it could be \\"almost too jokey at times\\". Though she felt the series was in good hands with Smith and Gillan, she derided the Atraxi for being \\"alarmingly static and ultimately uninteresting\\" and the story's \\"little substance\\". IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising it for easily fitting into the show's continuity, especially with Smith's portrayal of the Doctor. However, he thought the \\"calamity plot\\" was the \\"weakest link in an otherwise superb opening episode\\" and the \\"whole bunch of disparate elements ... never [gelled] into a satisfying whole\\". Though he said it was not perfect with \\"a saggy midsection and slightly naff CGI effects\\", he thought it was still \\"wondrous in so many ways\\". New York Times reviewer Mike Hale wrote that the episode worked like \\"a well-oiled piece of machinery\\", but it came across as \\"routine\\" with \\"none of the over-the-top exuberance\\" of Davies' run. While he noted that Gillan \\"looks promising\\", he felt that Smith was too much like Tennant and would \\"[need] to start shaping his own take on the role\\". Den of Geek selected the episode as Doctor Who highlight in their \\"Best TV Episodes of 2010\\" article. In 2011, after the airing of the next series, Digital Spy called the episode \\"still Smith and Moffat's finest hour\\". Digital Spy also named \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" the seventh best episode of the entire programme in 2013. The episode attracted some criticism from viewers who complained that Amy's character and occupation as a kissogram was \\"too sexy\\" for a family programme. Gillan defended her character, claiming that girls Amy's age often wore short skirts and it showed the character had confidence, while executive producer Piers Wenger said, \\"The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn't promiscuous\\". Home media \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray with the following episodes \\"The Beast Below\\" and \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" on 7 June 2010. It was then re-released as part of the complete series five DVD on 8 November 2010. In print Pearson Education published a novelisation of this episode by Trevor Baxendale for school literacy programs in May 2011.

Written by Mark Gatiss and directed by Andrew Gunn, it was first broadcast on BBC One on 17 April 2010. In the episode, the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) arrive in London during the Blitz, where Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) has employed \\"Ironsides\\", a scientific creation from Professor Bracewell (Bill Paterson) to be used as weapons in the war effort. However, the Doctor recognises the Ironsides as his archenemies the Daleks, who plan to destroy Earth by activating a device located inside Bracewell, an android. Wishing to incorporate the popular Daleks into the series, showrunner Steven Moffat instructed Gatiss to write an episode about Churchill and the Daleks. The episode introduces a new \\"Paradigm\\" of Daleks, which were designed by Gatiss to be bigger and more colourful than the previous variant. \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" was seen by 8.2 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD, placing second for the night it aired. Critical reception was mixed; both McNeice and Paterson's performances were praised, but some felt that the episode was too rushed and would have worked better if it was spread over two episodes. Plot Synopsis The camouflaged Ironsides in World War II era Britain, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. The Eleventh Doctor and Amy take the TARDIS to the Cabinet War Rooms during the Second World War. As the Doctor arrived late, Winston Churchill turned to the scientific advances of Professor Edwin Bracewell, including robotic devices called \\"Ironsides\\", which are recognised immediately by the Doctor as his arch-enemies, the Daleks, but act as Bracewell's inventions. The Doctor attacks the devices, shouting \\"I am the Doctor and you are the Daleks!\\" Unbeknown to the Doctor and the humans, a Dalek ship is in orbit near the Moon; upon hearing the Doctor's \\"testimony\\", which has just been transmitted by the Ironsides, the Dalek aboard uses it to activate a \\"Progenitor device\\" and alerts its comrades on Earth. The Daleks reveal their intent and expose Bracewell as an android before returning to their ship. The Doctor follows in the TARDIS, leaving Amy behind for her protection. The Doctor threatens to destroy the ship, including himself, before the Progenitor completes, as part of the Daleks' plot to restore their race, but the Daleks fire an energy beam at London that lights up the entire city minutes before an air raid by the Luftwaffe, leaving the Doctor's allies vulnerable and creating a stalemate. When the Progenitor completes, five brand new Daleks in larger, redesigned casings emerge from the Progenitor Chamber. They disintegrate the older \\"impure\\" models, who die willingly. At the same time, Amy convinces Churchill and Bracewell to use the technological know-how they have obtained from the Daleks to modify three Spitfires so that they can fly in space. The pilots attack and destroy the dish on the underside of the Dalek ship that was firing the energy beam. Before the last Spitfire pilot can destroy the ship, the Daleks trigger the power source inside Bracewell that contains an unstable wormhole that will consume Earth if released. The Doctor, torn over defeating the Daleks or saving Earth, orders the Spitfire to stop its attack and returns to Earth. With the Doctor's help, Amy is able to convince Bracewell that he is more human than machine, deactivating the device. The Daleks, having played on the Doctor's compassion for Earth, announce their victory and retreat into hyperspace. The Doctor and Amy remove all the advanced technology borrowed from the Daleks despite Churchill wanting to use it for the war, and convince Bracewell that he need not be deactivated because he helped save the world. Continuity Several allusions are made to previous Dalek adventures. In The Power of the Daleks (1966), a resuscitated Dalek declared \\"I am your servant!\\", similar to the line \\"I am your soldier\\" as used in this episode. The Doctor also expresses a desire to see \\"the final end\\" of the Daleks a direct quotation from The Evil of the Daleks (1967), when his second incarnation expresses the hope that the Daleks have finally been destroyed for good. The Doctor refers to the events of the previous Dalek invasion of Earth (in \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\") when talking to Amy about the Daleks, becoming concerned when Amy does not remember these events. At the end of the episode, a crack is shown in the wall behind where the TARDIS had been parked. The crack, having first appeared in Amy's bedroom when she was a little girl, has been a recurring theme; in \\"Flesh and Stone\\" the Doctor discovers it has the power to erase things from existence, the reason Amy cannot remember the Daleks. Production For research, Gatiss visited the Cabinet War Rooms, which were replicated for a set in the episode. Showrunner Steven Moffat wished to bring back the Daleks, as they were popular among children and had become \\"one of the regulars\\". He stated in March 2010 that he and the production team had considered redesigning the Daleks. Mark Gatiss, the writer of the episode, was instructed by Moffat to write an episode about \\"Churchill versus the Daleks\\". Gatiss was not sure what to do with the premise at first, but then became excited about doing a war movie, of which he was fond, and his own Dalek story. For research, he visited the real Cabinet War Rooms and read diaries and first- hand accounts of the war. Gatiss's inspiration was the 1966 serial The Power of the Daleks, though he had never seen it due to it being lost, which depicted them as more sly and silent, an aspect he called \\"very scary, more than when they're just barking orders\\". When Gatiss wrote the first draft of the episode Matt Smith had not been cast as the Doctor. Gatiss wrote this early draft for a generic Doctor, though Moffat commented it sounded like Jon Pertwee and Gatiss agreed. Once Smith had been cast, Gatiss watched Party Animals, a television series Smith had previously starred in, as well as anything else Smith was in that he could find. Gatiss used these to \\"download [his] speech patterns\\" and examine his energy and phrasing. Gatiss noted that the Daleks belonged in World War II, as their mission to destroy everything that was not a Dalek was a very Nazi concept. In fact, Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks who had grown up during World War II, consciously based the Daleks on the Nazis. Smith also drew a parallel between Churchill and the Doctor, as both of them were very intelligent and also had known each other for a long time. A scene cut from the final episode explained how the two had known each other for a while. Gatiss included one of Churchill's favourite expressions \\"Keep buggering on\\" (abbreviated KBO) into the script, which he was \\"delighted\\" to do. Ian McNeice, who portrayed Churchill, previously played the villain Zeus in the Eighth Doctor Big Finish audio play Immortal Beloved in 2007. Gatiss wrote in the script for the Daleks' redesign to be \\"big buggers...bigger than we've seen them before\\". The eyestalk was designed to be level with Smith's eyeline. Moffat and Gatiss wanted the new Daleks to be very colourful, similar to the Daleks of films from the 60s. Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green \\"just doesn't seem to work somehow\\". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate \\"Spitfires in space\\". A replica of a World War II Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire, while the rest of the scene was computer-generated. The sequence contained the line \\"Broadsword to Danny Boy\\", a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare. Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself, doing one version clean and another with his hand over his mouth. In an interview in April 2010, Gatiss described how the cameo came about: Broadcast and reception \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One 17 April 2010. Initial overnight figures showed that the episode was watched by 6.2 million viewers on BBC One and 231,000 watching a simulcast on BBC HD, making it the second most watched programme of the day. Final consolidated ratings for BBC One were 7.92 million and 381,000 for BBC HD, therefore making the total 8.2 million viewers. This made the programme the fourth most watched on BBC One for the week ending 18 April and the eleventh most watched across all UK TV Channels for the same week. It was second for Saturday 17 April, behind Britain's Got Talent, which achieved 11.87 million viewers. It received an Appreciation Index of 84, a little down on the previous two episodes. Critical reception \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" received mixed reviews. It received a positive review from Daniel Martin of The Guardian. Martin called it \\"the best [Mark] Gatiss has written for the show\\", and praised the writer's investigation of \\"the idea of [the Daleks] as 'man-made' war machines\\" for not being \\"as heavy-handed as you might have expected\\". He also was positive towards the acting of McNeice and Paterson, the developing storyline between the Doctor and Amy, and positively compared the Daleks' menace to the first series. Patrick Mulkern of the Radio Times hailed the episode as \\"a victory for all\\", and praised Gatiss for the character of Professor Bracewell, commenting favourably on how the writer \\"turns him into an emotive robot like Star Trek's Data, and gives Bill Paterson material worthy of his status.\\" Jordan Farley of SFX magazine gave \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" three and a half out of five stars, praising the redesigned Daleks for being \\"equally intimidating\\" and the episode \\"rollicking good fun\\", though \\"a little undercooked\\". However, he thought that the second half was \\"a little rushed\\" and wondered if the episode would have been more successful if it were a two-parter. He also was disappointed with a \\"lack of quotable dialogue\\" and less of the Doctor's \\"playful banter and wacky mannerisms\\". Matt Wales of IGN, however, was less positive, and rated the episode 5 out of 10. He called it \\"a flimsy (if much-needed) excuse to reboot the series' long-time villains rather than an attempt to provide any real narrative meat\\" but praised the World War II period sets. Brian J. Robb of Total Sci-Fi Online praised McNeice's Churchill, but thought some of his dialogue was over-the-top due to the script which he believed had traces of \\"having been tampered with\\" by Moffat. Like Farley, he commented that the episode's pacing was off and would have been more successful as a two-parter. Robb was also critical of Smith's performances, negatively comparing the scenes when he was angry to Sylvester McCoy, as well as the new Dalek design. He gave the episode a final score of 7 out of 10. Home media On 7 June 2010, \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray along with the previous episodes \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" and \\"The Beast Below\\". It was then re-released as part of the complete series five DVD on 8 November 2010. This episode was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 75, alongside \\"The Time of Angels\\" on 16 November 2011.

At this stage, the robot is equipped for search operations only, defined as the tele-operated detection of victims, using specific sensors, whose information is transmitted to the remote operator. The robot equipment (sensors) may be adapted to the specific needs. At the moment it includes 3 conventional cameras, one thermal camera, several explosive and toxic gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, inclinometers, artificial lights, microphone and speakers. The robot dimensions are length: 75 cm, width: 37 cm, height: 17,5 cm and weight: 27 kg. The RAPOSA robot was developed by a consortium led by the company IDMind, together with ISR/IST, the Lisbon firefighters brigade, and the University of South California. It was financed by AdI and POSI. The robot is semi-autonomous, i.e., it is tele-operated via a wireless link from a remote console using a conventional GUI and a gamepad, but can simultaneously display the capacity to carry out short tasks autonomously. The robot can execute commands sent by a team of SAR experts, located in a safe place. During task execution, the robot is able to process the information from different sensors to the remote command station, so as to provide the human team with relevant information on its surrounding environment (terrain conditions, temperature, dangerous gases, water or heat sources, either from human victims or not). The robot has small dimensions and weight. It is tolerant to impact, dust and humidity and its all terrain capable, namely it can climb stairs. Moreover, it can be lifted by a cable, to facilitate deployment from a height (e.g., into a pipeline). Research is currently being carried out with the aim of endowing RAPOSA with a higher degree of autonomy, meaning that certain operations requiring manual operation can be done autonomously by the robot. These include: autonomous stair climbing, autonomous docking, and preventive stop after hole detection. Moreover, human‚Äìrobot interaction issues are also being tackled by improving the operator interface, namely exploring augmented reality techniques.

In the 1442 imperial examination under the rule of L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n gained the title Doctorate (Ti·∫øn sƒ©) and thus became an official in the royal court of three successive emperors L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng (1434‚Äì1442), L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng (1442‚Äì1459) and L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng (1460‚Äì1497), during the latter's reign, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n was appointed Director of the National Bureau for Historical Record (Vi·ªán Qu·ªëc s·ª≠) in 1473. According to some sources, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n lived up to the age of 99, therefore he was likely born around 1400 and died during the late period of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng's reign. Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n was born and grew up during a turbulent period of Vietnam with the collapse of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, the Fourth Chinese domination by the Ming Dynasty, the Lam S∆°n uprising, the coronation of L√™ L·ª£i and several struggles in the royal family of the L√™ Dynasty. Besides, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n also witnessed the gradual predomination of the Confucianism over the Buddhism in the royal court, especially during the reign of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng, it was the context in which Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n wrote his ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞.  Works  ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞. Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n's major work is the historical record ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, a 15-volume (quy·ªÉn) book that he compiled in revising ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω of L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω t·ª•c bi√™n of Phan Phu Ti√™n. During the reign of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng, the emperor had commissioned his historians to write an official chronicle for the dynasty in the Quang Thu·∫≠n period (1460‚Äì1469), this work was later lost but after Th√°nh T√¥ng's order, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, a member of the board of compilation, wrote his own version in 1479 which was finally resulted in the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞. The fact that Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n decided to write his own national history despite the existence of the official records might be explained by Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n's intention of expressing his opinions in the book just as L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u did with his ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω instead of satisfying with only an objective narration of the official records. Some reasoned that Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n compiled the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ because he felt the need to promote Cofucian ideology in the L√™ Dynasty. Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n's style of compilation showed an important influence from Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian. Different than his Vietnamese predecessors, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n did not limit his references in official documents related to history but he also extracted information from Vi·ªát ƒëi·ªán u linh t·∫≠p (Compilation of the potent spirits in the Realm of Vi·ªát) and Lƒ©nh Nam ch√≠nh qu√°i (Extraordinary stories of Lƒ©nh Nam) which were collections of folk legend and myth but considered by the historian having some credibility about history. Another innovation of Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n is his division of history of Vietnam into two principal periods, he placed all events that happened before the establishment of the ƒêinh Dynasty in Peripheral Records (Ngo·∫°i k·ª∑) while the independent time from the ƒêinh Dynasty (10th century) to the creation of the L√™ Dynasty in 1482 was narrated in Basic Records (B·∫£n k·ª∑). In addition, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n also compiled another three records for the reigns of L√™ Th√°i T·ªï, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng and L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng (1428‚Äì1459) in a separate volume named Tam tri·ªÅu b·∫£n k·ª∑ (Records of the Three Reigns). From his extensive 72 comments in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n appeared to be a Neo-Confucian scholar. He often quoted from Confucian literature in criticizing an event or a decision of the previous dynasties that, according to Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, did not follow the Confucian codes for an appropriate ruling institution. According to O. W. Wolters, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n respected the Confucian perspective to the extent that the highest praise he could lavish on a Vietnamese ruler was that his achievements could not be bettered by even the most famous Chinese emperors in antiquity. However, the criticism and often harsh remarks of Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n towards previous dynasties, especially the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, could be understood as the historian's concern for the current dynasty, because the L√™ Dynasty would fall into collapse unless it could avoid the mistakes that were committed by its predecessors like the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty. Besides, the historian paid attention in defining the identity of the nation; a typical example of this intention was the existence of the H·ªìng B√†ng Dynasty in Peripheral Records, Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n's introduction of this dynasty was challenged by several historians for the lack of information and the real motive of the historian in writing about H√πng kings. Some remarked that Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n made the H·ªìng B√†ng Dynasty the first dynasty of Vietnam only because he wanted to emphasize the identity and the independence of Vietnam from China.  Legacy  Today, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ is the oldest official historical record of a Vietnamese dynasty that remains in its original form while Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n is always considered one of the most important figures of the historiography of Vietnam. He is venerated in his native village where people, during the reign of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c, erected a stele to praise the achievements of the historian. Several streets, schools and other places in Vietnam are named in honour of Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n.

The relationship between science and the Catholic Church is a widely debated subject. Historically, the Catholic Church has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation and funding of schools, universities, and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences. Historians of science such as Pierre Duhem credit medieval Catholic mathematicians and philosophers such as John Buridan, Nicole Oresme, and Roger Bacon as the founders of modern science.Wallace, William A. (1984). Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science. N.J.: Princeton University Press. Duhem found \\"the mechanics and physics, of which modern times are justifiably proud, to proceed by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools.\\" Yet, the conflict thesis and other critiques emphasize the historical or contemporary conflict between the Catholic Church and science, citing, in particular, the trial of Galileo as evidence. For its part, the Catholic Church teaches that science and the Christian faith are complementary, as can be seen from the Catechism of the Catholic Church which states in regards to faith and science: > Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy > between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and > infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot > deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth. ... Consequently, > methodical research in all branches of knowledge provided it is carried out > in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never > conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of > faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of > the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God despite > himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they > are. Catholic scientists, both religious and lay, have led scientific discovery in many fields. From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Church remains the single largest private provider of medical care and research facilities in the world. Following the Fall of Rome, monasteries and convents remained bastions of scholarship in Western Europe and clergymen were the leading scholars of the age ‚Äì studying nature, mathematics, and the motion of the stars (largely for religious purposes). During the Middle Ages, the Church founded Europe's first universities, producing scholars like Robert Grosseteste, Albert the Great, Roger Bacon, and Thomas Aquinas, who helped establish the scientific method. During this period, the Church was also a great patron of engineering for the construction of elaborate cathedrals. Since the Renaissance, Catholic scientists have been credited as fathers of a diverse range of scientific fields: Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) pioneered heliocentrism, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) prefigured the theory of evolution with Lamarckism, Friar Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) pioneered genetics, and Fr Georges Lema√Ætre (1894-1966) proposed the Big Bang cosmological model.http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_lemaitre.html The Jesuits have been particularly active, notably in astronomy. Church patronage of sciences continues through institutions like the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (a successor to the Accademia dei Lincei of 1603) and Vatican Observatory (a successor to the Gregorian Observatory of 1580). Conflict between science and the Church This view of the Church as a patron of sciences is contested by some, who speak either of a historically varied relationship which has shifted, from active and even singular support to bitter clashes (with accusations of heresy) ‚Äì or of an enduring intellectual conflict between religion and science. Enlightenment philosophers such as Voltaire were famously dismissive of the achievements of the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, the \\"conflict thesis\\" emerged to propose an intrinsic conflict or conflicts between the Church and science. The original historical usage of the term asserted that the Church has been in perpetual opposition to science. Later uses of the term denote the Church's epistemological opposition to science. The thesis interprets the relationship between the Church and science as inevitably leading to public hostility when religion aggressively challenges new scientific ideas as in the Galileo Affair. An alternative criticism is that the Church opposed particular scientific discoveries that it felt challenged its authority and power ‚Äì particularly through the Reformation and on through the Enlightenment. This thesis shifts the emphasis away from the perception of the fundamental incompatibility of religion per se and science-in-general to a critique of the structural reasons for the resistance of the Church as a political organization. The Church itself rejects the notion of innate conflict. The Vatican Council (1869/70) declared that \\"Faith and reason are of mutual help to each other.\\"Vatican Council (Sess. III, de fide, c. 4) The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1912 proffers that \\"The conflicts between science and the Church are not real\\", and states that belief in such conflicts are predicated on false assumptions.\\"Science\\"; Catholic Encyclopedia Pope John Paul II summarised the Catholic view of the relationship between faith and reason in the encyclical Fides et Ratio, saying that \\"faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth ‚Äì in a word, to know himself ‚Äì so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves.\\"Fides et Ratio ; Pope John Paul II The present Papal astronomer Brother Guy Consolmagno describes science as an \\"act of worship\\" and as \\"a way of getting intimate with the Creator.\\" The Pope's astronomer on space, the Bible and alien life\\"; The Sydney Morning Herald; 16 October 2014 Some leading Catholic scientists Scientific fields with important foundational contributions from Catholic scientists include: physics (Galileo) despite his trial and conviction in 1633 for publishing a treatise on his observation that the earth revolves around the sun, which banned his writings and made him spend the remainder of his life under house arrest, acoustics (Mersenne), mineralogy (Agricola), modern chemistry (Lavoisier), modern anatomy (Vesalius), stratigraphy (Steno), bacteriology (Kircher and Pasteur), genetics (Mendel), analytical geometry (Descartes), heliocentric cosmology (Copernicus), atomic theory (Boscovich), and the Big Bang Theory on the origins of the universe (Lema√Ætre). Jesuits devised modern lunar nomenclature and stellar classification and some 35 craters of the moon are named after Jesuits, among whose great scientific polymaths were Francesco Grimaldi and Giambattista Riccioli. The Jesuits also introduced Western science to India and China and translated local texts to be sent to Europe for study. Missionaries contributed significantly to the fields of anthropology, zoology, and botany during Europe's Age of Discovery. Definitions of science Differing analyses of the Catholic relationship to science may arise from definitional variance. While secular philosophers consider \\"science\\" in the restricted sense of natural science, in the past theologians tended to view science in a very broad sense as given by Aristotle's definition that science is the sure and evident knowledge obtained from demonstrations. In this sense, science comprises the entire curriculum of university studies, and the Church has claimed authority in matters of doctrine and teaching of science. With the gradual secularisation of the West, the influence of the Church over scientific research has gradually faded.Darnton, Robert. 1979. The Business of Enlightenment: a Publishing History of the Encyclop√©die, 1775-1800. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. History Early Middle Ages Skellig Michael, Ireland. Following the Fall of Rome monastic settlements systematically maintained knowledge of classical languages and learning. After the Fall of Rome, while an increasingly Hellenized Roman Empire and Christian religion endured as the Byzantine Empire in the East, the study of nature endured in monastic communities in the West. On the fringes of western Europe, where the Roman tradition had not made a strong imprint, monks engaged in the study of Latin as a foreign language, and actively investigated the traditions of Roman learning. Ireland's most learned monks even retained knowledge of Greek. Irish missionaries like Colombanus later founded monasteries in continental Europe, which went on to create libraries and become centers of scholarship. The leading scholars of the Early Middle Ages were clergymen, for whom the study of nature was but a small part of their scholarly interest. They lived in an atmosphere which provided opportunity and motives for the study of aspects of nature. Some of this study was carried out for explicitly religious reasons. The need for monks to determine the proper time to pray led them to study the motion of the stars;Stephen C. McCluskey, \\"Gregory of Tours, Monastic Timekeeping, and Early Christian Attitudes to Astronomy\\", Isis, 81(1990):9‚Äì22; reprinted in M. H. Shank, ed., The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 2000). the need to compute the date of Easter led them to study and teach rudimentary mathematics and the motions of the Sun and Moon.Stephen C. McCluskey, Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1998), pp. 149‚Äì57. Modern readers may find it disconcerting that sometimes the same works discuss both the technical details of natural phenomena and their symbolic significance.Faith Wallis, \\"'Number Mystique' in Early Medieval Computus Texts\\", pp. 179‚Äì99 in T. Koetsier and L. Bergmans, eds. Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study (Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2005). In astronomical observation, Bede of Jarrow described two comets over England, and wrote that the \\"fiery torches\\" of AD 729 struck terror in all who saw them ‚Äì for comets were heralds of bad news. Among these clerical scholars was Bishop Isidore of Seville who wrote a comprehensive encyclopedia of natural knowledge, the monk Bede of Jarrow who wrote treatises on The Reckoning of Time and The Nature of Things, Alcuin of York, abbot of the Abbey of Marmoutier, who advised Charlemagne on scientific matters, and Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz and one of the most prominent teachers of the Carolingian Age, who, Like Bede, wrote treatises on computus and On the Nature of Things. Abbot √Ülfric of Eynsham, who is known mostly for his Old English homilies, wrote a book on the astronomical time reckoning in Old English based on the writings of Bede. Abbo of Fleury wrote astronomical discussions of timekeeping and of the celestial spheres for his students, teaching for a while in England where he influenced the work of Byrhtferth of Ramsey, who wrote a Manual in Old English to discuss timekeeping and the natural and mystical significance of numbers. Later Middle Ages Pythagoras on one of the archivolts at Chartres Cathedral. From Medieval Europe's Cathedral Schools grew many of Europe's modern universities. Foundation of universities In the early Middle Ages, Cathedral schools developed as centers of education, evolving into the medieval universities which were the springboard of many of Western Europe's later achievements.Kenneth Clark; Civilisation, BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969 During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. Among the great early Catholic universities were Bologna University (1088); Paris University (c 1150); Oxford University (1167); Salerno University (1173); University of Vicenza (1204); Cambridge University (1209); Salamanca University (1218-1219); Padua University (1222); Naples University (1224); and Vercelli University (1228). Using church Latin as a lingua franca, the medieval universities across Western Europe produced a great variety of scholars and natural philosophers, including Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. By the mid-15th century, prior to the Reformation, Catholic Europe had some 50 universities. Condemnations of 1210-1277 The Condemnations of 1210-1277 were enacted at the medieval University of Paris to restrict certain teachings as being heretical. These included a number of medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing up a list of condemnations is unclear. Approximately sixteen lists of censured theses were issued by the University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put together into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Mathematics, engineering and architecture According to art historian Kenneth Clark, \\"to medieval man, geometry was a divine activity. God was the great geometer, and this concept inspired the architect.\\"Kenneth Clark; Civilisation; BBC 1969 Monumental cathedrals such as that of Chartres appear to evidence a complex understanding of mathematics. The Church has invested greatly in engineering and architecture and founded a number of architectural genres ‚Äì including Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic, High Renaissance, and Baroque.  Roman Inquisition  In the Middle Ages of the Roman Church, Pope Paul III (1468-1549) initiated the Congregation of the Roman Inquisition in 1542, which is also known as the Holy Office. A large expansion of Protestantism began to spread all throughout Italy, which triggered Pope Paul III to act against it. He would be the first to create proactive reforms for the sake of Roman Catholicism. Evidently the reforms would be strict rulings against foreign ideologies that would fall outside of their religious beliefs. The Inquisition would soon be under the control of Pope Sixtus V in 1588.  View of Outsiders  The Roman society was not very fond of outside beliefs. They would keep their borders up to religious foreigners as they felt other practices would influence and change their sacred Catholicism religion. They were also against witchcraft as such practices were seen in 1484 where Pope Innocent stated it was an act of going against the church. Any ideologies that was outside of their norm beliefs was seen as a threat and needed to be corrected even if it was through torture.  Inquisition Tactics and Practices  Pope Sixtus V put forth 15 congregations. The inquisition would imprison anyone who was seen as a threat towards the Catholic Church or placed onto house arrest. They kept a tight security and denied any other religious foreigners from coming inside their regions. Papal policies were implemented to stop foreigners from showing their practices to the public. The Index of Forbidden Books was used to prevent people from doing magic and other forms alike. The book was a guide for people to not read specific books that involved the supernatural. To stay away from this would allow for one to not be \\"infected\\". Punishment was acceptable and torture tactics were used in order for one to confess their sins.  The Fall of the Inquisition  In the 18th century, witchcraft and other groups became less of a threat to the Catholic Church. The focus moved to conversos as the population grew. Conversos mainly impacted the Spanish Inquisition. Furthermore, by the 19th century, the Roman Inquisition was very minimal, however, some ideologies were still seen in 1965.  Scientific Revolution and the Church  The Scientific Revolution began in 1543 with Nicholas Copernicus and his Heliocentric theory and is defined as the beginning of a dramatic shift in thought and belief towards scientific theory. The Scientific Revolution began in Western Europe, where the Catholic Church had the strongest holding. It is believed that the Scientific Revolution began in Western Europe because of the freedom to pursue other ideas provided by most European Universities and which go against Church authorities. Western Europe was also a central 'melting pot' for foreign knowledge and cultural beliefs including ancient Chinese math, Islamic philosophy, and Arabic astrology. Posed by author Peter Dear, the revolution can be thought of in two parts: the Scientific Renaissance and the revolution. The renaissance is considered the actual rebirth of the ideas, where mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, and physics were all being rediscovered in a sense. Following this rediscovery, people began to question the ideas of the church (which could be considered antique). Dear also references the fact that when historians study the relationship between scientists and the Church, they are not taking the standpoint that either view is true, instead they look at it the reasons they believed their side and then \\"Find out; truth or falsity are determined by arguments and it is the arguments that can be studied historically.\\" Marquis de Condorcet, a Period of Enlightenment philosopher and mathematician. Throughout the 16th and 17th century, the Church continued to feel threatened by the emerging ideas by the scientists, most prominently Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. In response, the church deemed them heretics and attacked some of the most defiant ones including burning Bruno at the stake and denouncing Galileo's statement and placing him under house arrest until his death in 1642. The Scientific Revolution and its challenging of the Church's ideas were followed by the Period of Enlightenment where people not only question the Church's ideas but also began to question their authority. The central theme of this period is that human society \\"could be changed and improved by human action guided by reason\\" as stated by Marquis de Condorcet. These periods of changing thought eventually led to the prominent holdings of liberty, progress, tolerance, and scientific theories within the Church. Development of Modern Science Vitruvian Man, c. 1490, by Leonardo da Vinci. Geology Georgius Agricola (1494-1555), is considered the founder of geology and \\"Father of Mineralogy\\". He made important contributions which paved the way for systematic study of the earth. A German Catholic who retained his faith through the Reformation, he also wrote on patristics (early church history). In 1546, he wrote De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum which was the first book written on physical geology, and De Natura Fossilium (On the Nature of Fossils) which described fossils and minerals. Nicolas Steno (1638-1686) is a Catholic convert who served as a bishop after making a series of important anatomical and geological innovations. His studies of the formation of rock layers and fossils was of vital significance to the development of modern geology and continue to be used today. He established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy. Originally a Lutheran, he did anatomical work in the Netherlands but moved to Catholic Italy and, in 1667, converted. Denied office in the Protestant north, he continued his medical and geological studies, but in 1675 became a priest and soon after was appointed a bishop, writing 16 major theological works.  Astronomy  tomb of Pope Gregory XIII celebrating the introduction of the Gregorian Calendar. The Catholic Church's longstanding interest and investment in astronomy prior to the scientific revolution fueled developments in related fields and set the Church up to become a nexus of astronomical study through the scientific revolution and into the early modern period in spite of the flagrant conflicts between Copernican and church doctrine. The Church's interest in astronomy stemmed from issues surrounding the determination of the date for Easter, which was originally tied to the Hebrew lunisolar calendar. In the 4th century, due to perceived problems with the Hebrew calendar‚Äôs leap month system, the Council of Nicaea prescribed that Easter would fall on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox. Thus, it became necessary that the Church have the capacity to predict the date of Easter with enough accuracy and forewarning to allow both for sufficient time to prepare for the feast as well as ensure the universal celebration of the holy day across all of the Church's dominion ‚Äì a daunting logistical feat. This necessity fueled constant innovation and refinement of astronomical practice as the solar and lunar years diverge over centuries. The Church's dedication to ever-increasingly accurate astronomy led to developments in ancillary disciplines. In the 12th century, the church helped re-popularize and disseminate ancient Greek ideas and mathematical techniques across Europe by sponsoring the translation of newly available Arabic-language version of Greek texts into Latin. This was done in large part to aid in astronomical study. In the late 16th century, the Church encouraged the inclusion of pinhole cameras into the construction of churches. Pinhole cameras are among the best tools for measuring the time between solstices. The transformation of churches into solar observatories encouraged innovations in engineering, architecture, and construction, and fueled the careers of astronomers like Cassini. By the 16th century, the date of the vernal equinox on the Julian calendar had receded from March 25 to March 11. The Council of Trent in 1562 authorized the pope to deal with calendar reform. The resulting Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar used throughout the world today.Introduction to Calendars. United States Naval Observatory. Retrieved 15 January 2009.Calendars by L. E. Doggett. Section 2.The international standard for the representation of dates and times ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar. Section 3.2.1. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582.See Wikisource English translation of the (Latin) 1582 papal bull 'Inter gravissimas' instituting Gregorian calendar reform. When the Church sent Jesuit missionaries to spread the gospel in China in the 16th and 17th centuries, they were accepted into and valued by the Chinese Imperial court because of their astronomical and mathematical expertise. This channel of communication for dialog between China and Europe allowed not only for the propagation of European sciences into China but also the flow of Chinese technologies and ideas back to Europe. The introduction of Chinese ideas into European popular consciousness through this Jesuit channel is credited by modern historians with adding fuel to the scientific revolution and enlightenment. In many cases, Jesuits were specifically dispatched to China with a list of topics on which to collect information. In 1789, the Vatican Observatory opened. It was moved to Castel Gandolfo in the 1930s and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope began observing in Arizona, USA, in 1995. =Copernicus= Nicolaus Copernicus, the Catholic canon and astronomer who put the Sun at the center of the Solar System, upsetting both scientific and religious accepted theory. Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance astronomer and Catholic canon who was the first person to formulate a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology which displaced the Earth from the center of the universe. In 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in Rome outlining Copernicus' theory. Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory. On 1 November 1536, Nikolaus von Sch√∂nberg, Archbishop of Capua and since the previous year a cardinal, wrote to Copernicus from Rome: By then Copernicus' work was nearing its definitive form, and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over Europe. Despite urgings from many quarters, Copernicus delayed publication of his book, perhaps from fear of criticism ‚Äì a fear delicately expressed in the subsequent dedication of his masterpiece to Pope Paul III. Scholars disagree on whether Copernicus' concern was limited to possible astronomical and philosophical objections, or whether he was also concerned about religious objections.Koyr√© (1973, pp. 27, 90) and Rosen (1995, pp. 64,184) take the view that Copernicus was indeed concerned about possible objections from theologians, while Lindberg and Numbers (1986) argue against it. Koestler (1963) also denies it. Indirect evidence that Copernicus was concerned about objections from theologians comes from a letter written to him by Andreas Osiander in 1541, in which Osiander advises Copernicus to adopt a proposal by which he says \\"you will be able to appease the Peripatetics and theologians whose opposition you fear\\". (Koyr√©, 1973, pp. 35, 90) At original publication, Copernicus' epoch-making book caused only mild controversy, and provoked no fierce sermons about contradicting Holy Scripture. It was only three years later, in 1546, that a Dominican, Giovanni Maria Tolosani, denounced the theory in an appendix to a work defending the absolute truth of Scripture.Rosen (1995, pp.151‚Äì59) He also noted that the Master of the Sacred Palace (i.e., the Catholic Church's chief censor), Bartolomeo Spina, a friend and fellow Dominican, had planned to condemn De revolutionibus but had been prevented from doing so by his illness and death.Rosen (1995, p.158) =Galileo Galilei= Tomb and monument to Galileo Galilei in the Church of Santa Croce in Florence. Galileo Galilei was a Catholic scientist of the Reformation period whose support for Copernican heliocentrism was suppressed by the Inquisition.Stephen Hawking; A Brief History of Time, 1996; p. 194-195 He is considered one of the inventors of modern science. Along with fellow Catholic scientist Copernicus, Galileo was among those who overturned the notion of geocentrism.Stephen Hawking; A Brief History of Time, 1996; p. 194-195 Protestant and atheist critics of Catholicism's relationship to science have placed great emphasis on the Galileo affair. Galileo was ordered not to support Copernican theory in 1616, but in 1632, after receiving permission from a new Pope (Urban VIII) to address the subject indirectly through a dialogue, he fell foul of the Pontiff by placing the pope's views in the mouth of an \\"imbecile\\" character in his book and was brought before the Inquisition. The Inquisition found him guilty of defending Copernican theory as a probability, \\"vehemently suspect of heresy,\\" demanded him to recant his views and placed him under house arrest for the remainder of his life. Federico Cesi created the Accademia dei Lincei in 1603 as an Italian science academy, of which Galileo became a member.Barraci, Ada. http://www.lincei.it/modules.php?name=Content&pa;=showpage&pid;=21 Galileo's championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime, when a large majority of philosophers and astronomers still subscribed to the geocentric view. Galileo gained wide support for his theories outside the universities by writing in Italian, rather than academic Latin. In response, the Aristotelian professors of the universities formed a united effort to convince the Church to ban Copernicanism. Initially a beneficiary of Church patronage of astronomy, Galileo rose to prominence with the publication of Sidereus Nuncius, which included astronomical observations made possible by the 1608 invention of the telescope. He was feted in Rome, honoured by the Jesuits of the Roman College, and received by Pope Paul V and Church dignitaries. Galileo began to dismiss geocentrism and emerging alternative theories like that of Tycho Brahe. Proponents of these alternatives began to work against Galileo and claim a contradiction between the Bible and his theories. Galileo rejected the accusation ‚Äì quoting Cardinal Baronius: \\"The Holy Ghost intended to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.\\" He invited the Church to follow established practice and reinterpret Scripture in light of the new scientific discoveries. The leading Jesuit Theologian Cardinal Robert Bellarmine agreed this would be an appropriate response to a true demonstration that the sun was at the center of the universe, but cautioned that the existing materials upon which Galileo relied did not yet constitute an established truth. Galileo's career coincided with the reaction of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation, in which the Catholic Church struggled for authority in Europe, following the emergence of the Protestant Churches and nations of Northern Europe.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 ; pp.205-207 Pope Paul III created the Roman and Universal Inquisition to stop the spread of \\"heretical depravity\\" throughout the Christian world. From 1571, the institution had jurisdiction over books and created the Index of Prohibited Books.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 ; pp.209-211 Rome established the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in 1622. Science historian Jacob Bronowski wrote that \\"Catholics and Protestants were embattled in what we should now call a Cold War. ...The Church was a great temporal power, and in that bitter time it was fighting a political crusade in which all means were justified by the end.\\" In this climate, Cardinal Bellarmine, himself a distinguished scholar, instigated inquiries against Galileo as early as 1613. After 1610, when Galileo began publicly supporting the heliocentric view which placed the Sun at the center of the universe, he met with bitter opposition from some philosophers and clerics, and two of the latter eventually denounced him to the Roman Inquisition early in 1615. Galileo defended his theories through the long-established Catholic understanding of Scripture, that the Bible was not intended to expound scientific theory and where it conflicted with common sense, should be read as allegory. Although he was cleared of any offense at that time, the Catholic Church declared heliocentrism as \\"false and contrary to Scripture\\" in February 1616,Sharratt (1994, pp.127‚Äì131), McMullin (2005a). and Galileo was warned to abandon his support for it, which he promised to do. In March 1616, the Church's Congregation of the Index issued a decree suspending De revolutionibus until it could be \\"corrected\\", because the supposedly Pythagorean doctrineIn fact, in the Pythagorean cosmological system the Sun was not motionless. that the Earth moves and the Sun does not was \\"false and altogether opposed to Holy Scripture.\\"Decree of the General Congregation of the Index, March 5, 1616, translated from the Latin by Finocchiaro (1989, pp.148-149). An on-line copy of Finocchiaro's translation has been made available by Gagn√© (2005). The same decree also prohibited any work that defended the mobility of the Earth or the immobility of the Sun, or that attempted to reconcile these assertions with Scripture. On the orders of Pope Paul V, Cardinal Bellarmine gave Galileo notice the decree was about to be issued, and warned him he could not \\"hold or defend\\" Copernican beliefs.Fantoli (2005, pp.118‚Äì19); Finocchiaro (1989, pp.148, 153). On-line copies of Finocchiaro's translations of the relevant documents, Inquisition Minutes of 25 February, 1616 and Cardinal Bellarmine's certificate of 26 May, 1616, have been made available by Gagn√© (2005). This notice of the decree would not have prevented Galileo from discussing heliocentrism solely as a mathematical hypothesis, but a stronger (Finocchiaro, 1989, p.147-148) not to teach it \\"in any way whatever, either orally or in writing\\", allegedly issued to him by the Commissary of the Holy Office, Father Michelangelo Segizzi, would certainly have done so (Fantoli, 2005, pp.119‚Äì20, 137). There has been much controversy over whether the copy of this injunction in the Vatican archives is authentic; if so, whether it was ever issued; and if so, whether it was legally valid (Fantoli, 2005, pp.120‚Äì43). The corrections to De revolutionibus, which omitted or altered nine sentences, were issued four years later, in 1620.Catholic Encyclopedia. Cristiano Banti's 1857 painting Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition In 1623, Galileo's friend Maffeo Barberini was elected as Pope Urban VIII. Urban VIII was an intellectual and patron of the arts and architecture, who had written poetry as a young man in praise of Galileo's astronomical writings. Galileo met with the new Pope, hoping to persuade him to lift the 1616 ban.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 ; pp.207-208 Instead he received permission to write a book on Aristotelian and Copernican theories, provided he did not take sides. The book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was passed by the censors and was well-received across Europe, but ultimately offended Urban VIII, whose own arguments were put into the mouth of the buffoon-like Simplicio in the dialogue. The Preparatory Commission for the trial of Galileo noted that the Pope's stated belief that it would be extravagant boldness to limit the power and wisdom of God to an individual's particular conjecture was put \\"into the mouth of a fool\\" in Galileo's text.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 ; pp.212 Galileo was summoned to Rome to be tried by the Inquisition in 1633. According to Bronowski, Galileo's accusers relied on a forged document purporting to have, in 1616, forbidden Galileo from in \\"any way whatsoever\\" teaching theories of Copernicus, and thus could find him guilty of dishonestly tricking the censors and therefore ban his book without addressing the issues of substance relating to Copernicus found within it.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 ; p214 Galileo was found \\"vehemently suspect of heresy\\" for \\"following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture.\\"From the Inquisition's sentence of June 22, 1633 (de Santillana, 1976, pp.306-10; Finocchiaro 1989, pp. 287-91) Galileo was forced to recant, and spend the rest of his life under house arrest. Galileo remained a practicing Catholic and during his house arrest wrote his most influential work Two New Sciences ‚Äì a book that was smuggled to the Protestant part of Holland to be published. The Catholic Church's 1758 Index of Prohibited Books omitted the general prohibition of works defending heliocentrism,Heilbron (2005, p. 307); Coyne (2005, p. 347). but retained the specific prohibitions of the original uncensored versions of De revolutionibus and Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 Index.McMullin (2005, p. 6); Coyne (2005, pp. 346-47). The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned Dialogue) in Florence.Heilbron (2005, p.299). In 1741 Pope Benedict XIV authorized the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific worksTwo of his non-scientific works, the letters to Castelli and the Grand Duchess Christina, were explicitly not allowed to be included (Coyne 2005, p.347). which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue.Heilbron (2005, p.303‚Äì04); Coyne (2005, p.347). The uncensored version of the Dialogue remained on the Index of prohibited books, however (Heilbron 2005, p.279). In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained.Heilbron (2005, p.307); Coyne (2005, p.347) The practical effect of the ban in its later years seems to have been that clergy could publish discussions of heliocentric physics with a formal disclaimer assuring its hypothetical character and their obedience to the Church decrees against the motion of the earth: see for example the commented edition (1742) of Newton's 'Principia' by Fathers Le Seur and Jacquier, which contains such a disclaimer ('Declaratio') before the third book (Propositions 25 onwards) dealing with the lunar theory. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the Church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.McMullin (2005, p.6); Coyne (2005, p.346). The Church's opposition had effectively ended in 1820 when a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, was permitted to publish a work that treated heliocentrism as a physical fact rather than a mathematical fiction. The 1835 edition of the Index was the first to be issued after that year. Pope Urban VIII refused Galileo a stately burial upon his death, though later his bones were interned under a monument at the Church of Santa Croce in Florence. In 1980, Pope John Paul II ordered a re-examination of the evidence against Galileo and formally acquitted him in 1992. =Modern view on Galileo= In 1939 Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the \\"most audacious heroes of research ... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments.\\"Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences 1939-1986, Vatican City, p.34 His close advisor of 40 years Professor Robert Leiber wrote: \\"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo.\\"Robert Leiber, Pius XII Stimmen der Zeit, November 1958 in Pius XII. Sagt, Frankfurt 1959, p.411 On 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the Sapienza University of Rome,An earlier version had been delivered on 16 December 1989, in Rieti, and a later version in Madrid on 24 February 1990 (Ratzinger, 1994, p.81). According to Feyerabend himself, Ratzinger had also mentioned him \\"in support of\\" his views in a speech in Parma around the same time (Feyerabend, 1995, p.178). Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called \\"a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology, goes today.\\"Ratzinger (1994, p.98). Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThe Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.‚Äù The Cardinal did not indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say: \\"It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views.\\" On 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled, and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of Galileo Galilei; this was the result of a study conducted by the Pontifical Council for Culture.. In March 2008 the Vatican proposed to complete its rehabilitation of Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. =Modern astronomers= Brother Guy Consolmagno SJ, Vatican astronomer and Carl Sagan Medalist. Brother Guy Consolmagno, a Jesuit, became the first religious brother to be awarded the American Astronomical Society's Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science in 2014.Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science The judges noted his six books, and nominated his 'Turn Left At Orion' as having had an \\"enormous impact on the amateur astronomy community, engendering public support for astronomy.\\" They described Consolmagno as \\"the voice of the juxtaposition of planetary science and astronomy with Christian belief, a rational spokesperson who can convey exceptionally well how religion and science can co-exist for believers.\\"2014 Prize Recipients; American Astronomical Society Consolmagno describes science as an \\"act of worship, ... a way of getting close to creation, to really getting intimate with creation, and it's a way of getting intimate with the creator.\\"\\"The Pope's astronomer on space, the Bible and alien life\\"; The Sydney Morning Herald; 16 October 2014 Gessner Conrad Gessner's zoological work, Historiae animalium, which appeared in 4 volumes and was published between 1551 and 1588. Under Pope Paul IV, it was added to the Roman Catholic Church's list of prohibited books as Gessner was a Protestant. He still maintained friendships with Catholics regardless of the religious animosities between Catholics and Protestants at that time. Gaining support for his work, Catholic booksellers in Venice protested the ban on Gessner's books but it was later on allowed for selling once it was revised and \\"freed\\" from doctrines contrary to the Catholic faith. Evolution The Jesuit educated French Catholic Jean-Baptiste Lamarck developed the first theory of evolution. Pope John Paul II told the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1996 that since Pius XII's encyclical, \\"... new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis.\\"John Paul II, Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution In the years since the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, the position of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though local church figures took on more prominent sides. In 1961, seven years after Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, Christian Henry Morris and John C. Witcomb published The Genesis Flood, which argued that there is scientific support for the bible creation story. In October 1996, Pope John Paul II outlined the Catholic view of evolution to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, saying that the Church holds that evolution is \\"more than a hypothesis,\\" it is a well-accepted theory of science and that the human body evolved according to natural processes, while the human soul is the creation of God.National Center for Science Education; Creationists and the Pope's Statement by Eugenie C. Scott; 21 December 2003 This updated an earlier pronouncement by Pope Pius XII in the 1950 encyclical Humani generis that accepted evolution as a possibility (as opposed to a probability) and a legitimate field of study to investigate the origins of the human body ‚Äì though it was stressed that \\"the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God.\\" In contrast with Protestant literalist objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have had little to do with maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Catholic scientists contributed to the development of evolutionary theory. Among the foremost Catholic contributors to the development of the modern understanding of evolution was the Jesuit-educated Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and the Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel (1822-1884). Lamarck developed Lamarckism, the first coherent theory of evolution, proposing in Philosophie Zoologique (1809) and other works his theory of the transmutation of species and drawing a genealogical tree to show the genetic connection of organisms.Biography of Lamarck at University of California Museum of Paleontology Mendel discovered the basis of genetics following long study of the inherited characteristics of pea plants, although his paper Experiments on Plant Hybridization, published in 1866, was famously overlooked until the start of the next century.Biography of Mendel at the Mendel Museum ; The work of Catholic scientists like the Danish Bishop Nicolas Steno helped establish the science of geology, leading to modern scientific measurements of the age of the earth. The Church accepts modern geological theories on such matters and the authenticity of the fossil record. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life. The Church's stance is that the temporal appearance of life has been guided by God. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance of evolution. , the Church's official position is a fairly non-specific example of theistic evolution. This states that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both monogenism and the spiritual component of human origins. No infallible declarations by the Pope or an Ecumenical Council have ever been made. There have been several organizations composed of Catholic laity and clergy that have advocated positions both supporting and opposing evolution. For example: * The Kolbe Center for the Study of Creation operates out of Mt. Jackson, Virginia, and is a Catholic lay apostolate promoting creationism.Kolbe Center for the Study of Creation: Defending Genesis from a Traditional Catholic Perspective official website. * The Faith Movement was founded by Catholic Fr. Edward Holloway in Surrey, England. His book a new synthesis \\"argues from Evolution as a fact, that the whole process would be impossible without the existence of the Supreme Mind we call God.\\"Theistic Evolution and the Mystery of FAITH (cont'd), Anthony Nevard, Theotokos Catholic Books website; Creation/Evolution Section. * Daylight Origins Society was founded in 1971 by John G. Campbell (d.1983) as the \\"Counter Evolution Group\\". Its goal is \\"to inform Catholics and others of the scientific evidence supporting Special Creation as opposed to Evolution, and that the true discoveries of Science are in conformity with Catholic doctrines.\\" It publishes the \\"Daylight\\" newsletter.Daylight Origins Society: Creation Science for Catholics official homepage. As in other countries, Catholic schools in the United States teach evolution as part of their science curriculum. They teach the fact that evolution occurs and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is the scientific theory that explains how evolution occurs. This is the same evolution curriculum that secular schools teach. Bishop DiLorenzo of Richmond, chair of the Committee on Science and Human Values, said in a December 2004 letter sent to all U.S. bishops: \\"Catholic schools should continue teaching evolution as a scientific theory backed by convincing evidence. At the same time, Catholic parents whose children are in public schools should ensure that their children are also receiving appropriate catechesis at home and in the parish on God as Creator. Students should be able to leave their biology classes, and their courses in religious instruction, with an integrated understanding of the means God chose to make us who we are.\\"Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias, Jeff Severns Guntzel, National Catholic Reporter, March 25, 2005 Genetics Gregor Mendel, Augustinian Friar and scientist, who developed theories on genetics for the first time. Gregor Mendel was an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar who began experimenting with peas around 1856. Observing the processes of pollination at his monastery in what is now the Czech Republic, Mendel studied and developed theories about the field of science now called genetics. Mendel published his results in 1866 in the Journal of the Brno Natural History Society. The paper was not widely read nor understood, and soon after its publication Mendel was elected abbot of his monastery. He continued experimenting with bees but his work went unrecognized until various scientists resurrected his theories around 1900, after his death.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 Mendel had joined the Brno Augustinian Monastery in 1843, but also trained as a scientist at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute and the University of Vienna. The Brno Monastery was a center of scholarship, with an extensive library and a tradition of scientific research.Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan; 2004; p.474 Where Charles Darwin's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations explained how new species could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by Wilhelm Olbers Focke which extensively referenced Mendel). Bill Bryson wrote that \\"without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of the life sciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single, common source; Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen.\\"Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan; 2004; p.474-476 Biologist J. B. S. Haldane and others brought together the principles of Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian principles of evolution to form the field of genetics known as Modern evolutionary synthesis.Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan; 2004; p.300 \\"Big Bang\\" Theory for early development of the universe The Big Bang model, or theory, is now the prevailing cosmological theory of the early development of the universe and was first proposed by Belgian priest Georges Lema√Ætre, astronomer and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven, with a Ph.D. from MIT. Lema√Ætre was a pioneer in applying Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity to cosmology. Bill Bryson wrote that the idea was decades ahead of its time and that Lema√Ætre was the first to bring together Einstein's theory of relativity with Edwin Hubble's cosmological observations, combining them in his own \\"fire-works theory\\". Lema√Ætre theorized in the 1920s that the universe began as a geometrical point which he called a \\"primeval atom\\", which exploded out and has been moving apart ever since. The idea became established theory only decades later with the discovery of cosmic background radiation by American scientists.Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan, 2004, p. 29 & 173 Sponsorship of scientific research Saint Albert Magnus was a pioneer of biological field research. In ancient times, the Church supported medical research as an aid to Christian charity. The Church supported the development of modern science and scientific research by founding Europe's first universities in the Middle Ages. Historian Lawrence M. Principe writes that \\"it is clear from the historical record that the Catholic church has been probably the largest single and longest-term patron of science in history, that many contributors to the Scientific Revolution were themselves Catholic, and that several Catholic institutions and perspectives were key influences upon the rise of modern science.\\"Galileo Goes to Jail: And Other Myths about Science and Religion. Ed. Ronald L. Numbers. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2009. (p. 102) The field of astronomy is a prime example of the Church's commitment to science. J.L. Heilbronn in his book The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories writes that \\"the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial aid and support to the study of astronomy for over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment, than any other, and, probably, all other, institutions.\\"Heilbron, J.L. The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999. (p. 3) Scientific support continues through the present day. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences was founded in 1936 by Pope Pius XI to promote the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences and the study of related epistemological problems. The academy holds a membership roster of the most respected names of contemporary science, many of them Nobel laureates. Also worth noting is the Vatican Observatory, an astronomical research and educational institution supported by the Holy See. In his 1996 encyclical Fides et Ratio, Pope John Paul II wrote that \\"faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.\\"Pope John Paul II. Fides Et Ratio. Boston: Pauline and Media, 1998. (Introductory matter) Pope Benedict XVI re-emphasized the importance of reason in his famous 2006 address at Regensburg.The text of the address can be found here: Faith, Reason and the University Memories and Reflections But the emphasis on reason is not a recent development in the Church's history. In the first few centuries of the Church, the Church Fathers appropriated the best of Greek philosophy in defense of the faith. This appropriation culminated in the 13th- century writings of Thomas Aquinas, whose synthesis of faith and reason has influenced Catholic thought for eight centuries. Because of this synthesis, many historians of science trace the foundations of modern science to the 13th century. These writers include Edward Grant,cf. Grant, Edward. The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. James Hannam,cf. Hannam, James. The Genesis of Science: How the Christian Middle Ages Launched the Scientific Revolution. Washington, DC: Regnery Pub., 2011. and Pierre Duhem.Duhem wrote a famous 10-volume work on science in the Middle Ages. He put particular emphasis on the Condemnations of Paris in 1277 as the origin of modern science.  The Catholic Church as a Strategic and Careful Patron of Science  The relationship between the Catholic church and science has been largely supportive in spite of the myth of conflict stemming from discomfort with divergence from a Biblical geocentric model of cosmology to a heliocentric one. The church and its Jesuit missionaries not only studied subjects such as astronomy, physics and math, they exchanged information with others such as the Chinese across the world. In 1616, the Qualifiers of the Holy Office formally disavowed heliocentric theory. However, when they needed assistance with a problematic Ecclesiastical calendar, they solicited the assistance of astronomers who inadvertently proved the validity of it. Two developments made the confirmation possible: the more accurate measurements of the sun and the moon, and the astronomical community's understanding of how to use language that was vague enough to avoid direct conflict with church doctrine. Words in Biblical scripture left some room for interpretation and when there were conflicts between the physical and the scriptural, both the church and the scientists engaged in exercises of hermeneutical accommodation. = Example of Church Sponsorship of Astronomical Research-Ecclesiastical Calendaring = One of the primary reasons that the church was so supportive of astronomical research was that the church needed astronomers to assist in resolving issues with the calendar‚Äîspecifically in establishing a date for Easter. In 325 A.D., the Catholic theologians comprising the Council of Nicaea, set the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the first full moon of the vernal equinox where the vernal equinox was the point of equal daylight and darkness.√ñberg, Karin I. (2009). Complex processes in simple ices - Laboratory and observational studies of gas-grain interactions during star formation (Ph.D.). Leiden University. The challenge in using astronomical observations for a religious celebration spanning great distances across the globe was that date was inconsistent and subject to errors in accuracy of observations. Beyond the challenge of Easter was the fact that the calendar was used for business that included payment schedules, etc. thus creating economic consequences every time days were removed for realignment purposes. By the sixth century, there was papal pressure to create a system for designating the date of Easter that was both accurate and consistent across the world. The church recognized that there had been a drift and that the date of Easter no longer seemed to align with heaven which created an urgent need to understand the movement of the sun and earth so that the calendar conflicts could be resolved. After reviewing the data from Aristotle to Ptolemy, they recognized that the problem centered on the period between successive Spring equinoxes. In 1514, Pope Leo X commissioned Dutch astronomer Paul of Middleburg to identify a resolution. Paul favored resetting the date of the vernal equinox to March 10 rather than eliminating days to correct the drift but the changes were not made. Copernicus, a contemporary of Paul, attributed the failure to inaccuracies in measurements of the sun and moon and he focused his attention on collecting more accurate data. Accurate data about the vernal equinox required a large, dark space like a cathedral to measure a meridian line. A hole was cut into the roof of a cathedral and using a rod or line in the floor, they measured the time it took for a noon time image of the sun to return to the same place. The accuracy depended on the quality of the laboratory set up for observation, including the location of the hole, the level of the floors and line placement. Cosimo I D‚ÄôMedici a patron of the arts and supporter of the church, enlisted Egnatio Danti, a Dominican artist, for help with the calendar. Danti found the perfect location for his meridian in the Basilica di San Petronio in Bologna. Structural issues led to inaccuracy of Danti‚Äôs meridian. Decades later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, redid the meridian in the same basilica. His work resolved the apparent conflicts between Ptolemy‚Äôs solar theory and Kepler‚Äôs ‚Äúbisection of eccentricity‚Äù using the diameter of the sun‚Äôs image as an inverse substitute for the sun‚Äôs distance from the earth. His precise work ended up proving the validity of Copernican theory condemned by the church. After Galileo, scientists consciously identified ways to stay in alignment with the church as much as possible. Avoiding Conflict in Sponsorship of Scientific Research-Hermeneutical Accommodation Astronomers from Ptolemy to Cassini recognized potential conflicts between their observations and cosmology and it was often a challenge to cultivate a position in which science and scripture could both be true. Ptolemy saw the conflict between his model and the movement of planets. By interpreting the word orbit in both a geometric sense and in a way that could apply to the sun or the earth, Catholic scientists like Cassini could create enough distance from Galileo's theory to operate without condemnation from the church. Galileo himself felt that conflict between scripture and science could be resolved through hermeneutical accommodation. He believed that there could essentially be harmony between science or nature and scripture if one understood how to interpret scripture. Galileo was of the opinion that since God is responsible for every aspect of our world, including the sensory experiences that are an integral part of scientific observation, then if what we see differs from scripture, we should conclude that the observations are correct. Galileo references Cardinal Baronius who believed that the Bible is not meant to explain heaven or God's creation as much as it is meant to guide people's actions. With that being said, Andreas Osiander was a Lutheran theologian that used Copernicus's book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium to further emphasize Copernicus's astronomical system that was already being theorized. While Osiander would be coming from a Lutheran stance and Copernicus's system was in alignment with the Catholic canon. He found that Copernicus's system also coincided with Lutheran ideologies. The part that Osiander played in counteracting the critique was by writing the forward or rather preface of Copernicus's book to refrain it from getting questioned, within the preface he essentially alluded to the fact that Copernicus's system may be mathematically accurate and therefore would be true, but states that it is all a theory. By Osiander writing the forward and making this statement he was \\"saving the phenomenon\\" and was able to keep Copernicus's work from getting questioned to an extent .\\"Saving the phenomenon\\" was when scientists found reason to interpret or decode a theory in a more technical way and could further be contested with other theories. The part in which the forward played further developed and helped bring to light the separation of both science and cosmology. Making that distinction furthered helped expand upon theories that would rub the Church in the wrong way, but avoided that because by focusing on the mathematical aspects and not making quick conclusions about how planets moved kept a boundary intact between the two and helped refrain a conflict from occurring. Illumination from the Liber Scivias showing the physician and Doctor of the Church Hildegard of Bingen receiving a vision and dictating to her scribe and secretary. The Church has, since ancient times, been heavily involved in the study and provision of medicine. Early Christians were noted for tending the sick and infirm, and priests were often also physicians. Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals after the end of the persecution of the early church. Notable contributors to the medical sciences of those early centuries include Tertullian (born A.D. 160), Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius, and the learned St. Isidore of Seville (d. 636). St. Benedict of Nursia (480) emphasised medicine as an aid to the provision of hospitality. During the Middle Ages, famous physicians and medical researchers included the Abbot of Monte Cassino Bertharius, the Abbot of Reichenau Walafrid Strabo, the Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, and the Bishop Marbodius of Rennes. Monasteries of this era were diligent in the study of medicine. So too, convents: Hildegard of Bingen, a doctor of the church, is among the most distinguished of Medieval Catholic women scientists. Beyond theological works, Hildegard wrote Physica, a text on the natural sciences, as well as Causae et Curae. Hildegard of Bingen was well known for her healing powers that involved practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 155. Charlemagne decreed that each monastery and cathedral chapter establish a school and in these schools, medicine was commonly taught. At one such school Pope Sylvester II taught medicine. Clergy were active at the School of Salerno, the oldest medical school in Western Europe. Among the important churchmen to teach there were Alpuhans, later (1058‚Äì85) Archbishop of Salerno, and the influential Constantine of Carthage, a monk who produced superior translations of Hippocrates and investigated Arab literature. In Catholic Spain amidst the early Reconquista, Archbishop Raimund founded an institution for translations, which employed some Jewish translators to communicate the works of Arabian medicine. Influenced by the rediscovery of Aristotelean thought, churchmen like the Dominican Albert Magnus and the Franciscan Roger Bacon made significant advances in the observation of nature. St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, was established by the Sisters of Charity and is among many leading medical research centers established by the Catholic Church around the world. Through the devastating Bubonic Plague, the Franciscans were notable for tending the sick. The apparent impotence of medical knowledge against the disease prompted critical examination. Medical scientists came to divide among anti-Galenists, anti-Arabists, and positive Hippocratics. In Renaissance Italy, the Popes were often patrons of the study of anatomy, and Catholic artists such as Michelangelo advanced knowledge of the field through such studies as sketching cadavers to improve his portraits of the crucifixion. The Jesuit order, created during the Reformation, contributed a number of distinguished medical scientists. In the field of bacteriology, Athanasius Kircher (1671) first proposed that living organisms enter and exist in the blood. In the development of ophthalmology, Christoph Scheiner made important advances about refraction of light and the retinal image. In modern times, the Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of health care in the world. Catholic religious have been responsible for founding and running networks of hospitals across the world where medical research continues to advance. Pontifical Academy of Sciences The Pontifical Academy of Sciences was founded in 1936 by Pope Pius XI. It draws on many of the world's leading scientists, including many Nobel Laureates, to act as advisors to the Popes on scientific issues. The Academy has an international membership which includes British physicist Stephen Hawking, the astronomer royal Martin Rees, and Nobel laureates such as U.S. physicist Charles Hard Townes. Under the protection of the reigning Pope, the Academy aims to promote the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences and the study of related epistemological problems. The Academy has its origins in the Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (\\"Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes\\"), founded in 1847 and intended as a more closely supervised successor to the Accademia dei Lincei (\\"Academy of Lynxes\\") established in Rome in 1603 by the learned Roman Prince Federico Cesi (1585‚Äì1630) who was a young botanist and naturalist, and which claimed Galileo Galilei as a member. Vatican Observatory The Vatican Observatory (Specola Vaticana) is an astronomical research and educational institution supported by the Holy See. Originally based in Rome, it now has headquarters and laboratory at the summer residence of the Pope in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, and an observatory at the Mount Graham International Observatory in the United States. The Director of the Observatory is Fr. Jos√© Gabriel Funes, SJ. Many distinguished scholars have worked at the Observatory. In 2008, the Templeton Prize was awarded to cosmologist Fr. Micha≈Ç Heller, a Vatican Observatory Adjunct Scholar. In 2010, the George Van Biesbroeck Prize was awarded to former observatory director Fr. George Coyne, SJ. The current director of the Vatican Onservatory, Brother Guy Consolmagno, was awarded the American Astronomical Society's Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science in 2014.Vatican Observatory. Jesuits Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607. The Society of Jesus (Jesuit Order) was founded by the Spaniard Saint Ignatius Loyola in 1540. Jesuits were leaders of the Counter-Reformation, who have contributed a great many distinguished scientists and institutions of learning, right up to the present. The role of some of its members like Robert Bellarmine, in the Counter-Reformation period and in defense of Papal teaching, show the constraints under which they operated. However, recent scholarship in the history of science has focused on the substantial contributions of Jesuit scientists over the centuries. Historian Jonathan Wright discussed the breadth of Jesuit involvement in the sciences in his history of the order: > [The Jesuits] contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, > pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to > scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics, and electricity. They > observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter‚Äôs > surface, the Andromeda nebula, and Saturn‚Äôs rings. They theorized about the > circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical > possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave- > like nature of light. Star maps of the southern hemisphere, symbolic logic, > flood-control measures on the Po and Adige rivers, introducing plus and > minus signs into Italian mathematics ‚Äì all were typical Jesuit achievements, > and scientists as influential as Fermat, Huygens, Leibniz, and Newton were > not alone in counting Jesuits among their most prized correspondents.  Jesuits in China  The Jesuits made significant contributions to scientific knowledge in China. Under the Qing Dynasty, the Jesuits' knowledge of observational astronomy and spherical trigonometry was welcomed by the imperial court. The Manchus who conquered the Ming Dynasty also welcomed the Jesuit scientists and employed their help due to their expert knowledge of mathematical astronomy, which aided the ruling class in predicting celestial events, thus, displaying that this dynasty retained the Mandate of Heaven. In addition to reinforcing the Mandate of Heaven, the Jesuits separated two fields of science that were thought by the Chinese to be the same, cosmology and cosmography. By doing so, they were able to avoid being restricted by the Book of Changes. The Jesuits' astronomical measurements were also more accurate than their Chinese counterparts. This factor, combined with the fact that the Jesuits also sympathized with the need of the Qing Dynasty to replace the old Ming calendar with a better one of their own enabled the Jesuits to make a significant impact on the Chinese Imperial Court. The Jesuits themselves each fulfilled different roles at the imperial court. Father Matteo Ricci served on a jury charged with filling high ranking positions in the imperial court, Father Johann Schall was made president of the mathematics court of the Qing dynasty and contributed significantly to the reformation of China's calendar, Father Ferdinand Verbiest contributed to China's understanding of its geography and helped them define their border with Russia.  Matteo Ricci  Matteo Ricci was one of the most influential Jesuits that was sent to China. Matteo had been educated in math and science at the Collegio Romano with Christopher Clavius and also in Portugal at the University of Coimbra. Matteo went to China in 1581, where he resided in the city of Macau. He would then move to Beijing in 1601, where he hoped that the Ming would employ him and his order to correct their calendar. Ricci would also spread Euclidian Geometry to China by helping translate his works while using books prepared by Christopher Clavius. Ricci hoped to do this by earning the favor of the court and educated literati elites. In this, Ricci was successful. He was able to convert other Chinese scholars to Catholicism who would then subsequently help him spread both Christianity and more accurate astrological measurements. In one case, Ricci, along with Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizhao, both of whom he had converted, would translate both Euclid and Ptolemy's works into Chinese in 1607. These three would also go on to translate works from both Nicolaus Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. By doing this, they were able to introduce, however slightly new ideas into the Chinese astronomical system. Although the Ming court never took his work seriously while he was still alive, one of Ricci's converts, Xu Guangqi would later be called upon as a high-ranking member of the Ministry of Rites and he would go on to reform the Chinese astronomical system.  Johann Adam Schall von Bell  Johann Adam Schall von Bell was another influential Jesuit priest that was sent to China. During Schall's stay in China, the Ming dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Schall, along with many other Jesuits quickly adapted to the regime change and offered his services to the new Qing Emperor. The new Emperor accepted Schall's offer, and this could bring in a new age of Jesuit acceptance in China that contrasted with the Ming dynasty's indifference to Matteo Ricci's efforts. The acceptance of Jesuit help would go on to have drastic consequences, as the former Chinese and Muslim members of the Astrocaldendrical Bureau who were replaced by the Jesuits would join the anti-Jesuit faction in the court and seek to purge their influence. In the meantime, however, Schall and assistants would continue their work and in 1645, they unveiled their first work. They called it a \\"temporal model calendar\\". it heavily borrowed from Mathematical Astronomy According to the New Western Methods, which was a series of Western writings that were translated into Chinese by Xu Guanqi and past Jesuits. Schall, recognizing the importance of elaborate state rituals in China, offered the calendar to the Emperor in a complex ceremony involving music, parades, and signs of submission like kneeling and kowtowing. After this overwhelming success, however, Schall's legitimacy was quickly put into question by Yang Guangxian, who accused Schall of attempting to undermine the Qing dynasty by fomenting civil unrest. Schall and the Jesuits were also accused of secretly harboring illegal foreigners in their churches spread around China and were also accused of claiming that the Qing rulers relied upon their Western ideas for political legitimacy. Schall was imprisoned and died while in captivity in 1666 at the age of seventy-five. He was posthumously pardoned by Kangxi Emperor upon his ascension to the throne.  Ferdinand Verbiest  Ferdinand Verbiest was a Belgian Jesuit who was called upon by the Kangxi Emperor after his ascension to compete in a contest with Muslim astronomers. The contest involved predicting the length of a shadow that would pass over the imperial gnomon, which was a sundial in the Forbidden City. Verbiest won the contest and was subsequently placed at the head of the Astrocalendrical Bureau. As head of the Burea, Verbiest also shared his position with a Manchu, and this tradition would continue until the 1840s. Verbiest claimed that the studying of celestial patterns was of great practical importance to the dynasty and that whether the astronomer in question was Muslim, Jesuit or Chinese didn't matter. He argued that ensuring the observations were impartial and that applying Tycho's ideas to the observations to verify said observations were the two most important factors. Verbiest also claimed that Western ways of measuring data were the most accurate and dismissed the older findings of Chinese astronomers. While these claims did little to convince the Chinese that their old measurements were inaccurate, Verbiest's pushing of spherical trigonometry would go on to have the greatest impact on Chinese astronomy, as they saw it as being connected to when the Mongols brought Islamic astronomy to China during their conquest.  Christopher Clavius  Christopher Clavius was one of the most prolific members of the order. During his life, he made contributions to algebra, geometry, astronomy, and cartography. Most notable of his accomplishments was his work on the reform of the Gregorian Calendar. Having taught in the Collegio Romano for 40 years, he had a direct impact on the spread of scientific knowledge within the Jesuit order and, from there, an impact on the scientific knowledge of the places his students would visit in their missionary journeys. For example, the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci translated Clavius' books into Chinese and shared the knowledge they contained with the people of China during his missionary work there. With the help of Clavius' books, Matteo and his fellow Jesuits were able to spread the West's knowledge of astronomy to China which, in turn, led to China's refinement of its calendar system.\\"Clavius, Christoph.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. . Encyclopedia.com. 24 Jul. 2018<http://www.encyclopedia.com>.  Athanasius Kircher  Athanasius Kircher was a Jesuit priest who authored around 44 major works and is regarded by some scholars as the founder of Egyptology due to his study of Egyptian hieroglyphs. He is believed by many scholars to be the last \\"renaissance man\\" in light of his being a polymath and scholar of a wide range of disciplines including music, astronomy, medicine, geography, and more. Despite providing a wealth of knowledge in his books, Kircher did not contribute much in the way of scientific breakthroughs, but he is credited with the invention of the aeolian harp which was a popular instrument the 19th century One of many notable contributions Athanasius made to the world was his book, China Illustrata in which he gives a detailed record of his observations of Chinese culture and geography‚Äîincluding numerous detailed illustrations plants, statues, temples, and mountains in the vast landscapes of China. Kircher wrote this book based entirely on his study of documents sent back to Rome from his fellow Jesuits in China which led to Kircher being recognized as an expert in China despite having never been there himself.  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit priest who took an interest in geology from a young age. After some time as a professor at the Catholic Institute of Paris, Chardin went on an expedition to China where he performed academic work concerning paleontology and geology. During his travels in China, he played a role in the discovery of the Peking Man's skull. After his research team discovered it, Chardin took part in the examination of the skull and discovered the geological time during which the Peking Man lived. During his time in China, Pierre was able to continue his research of fossils and expanded the scope of geological knowledge in Asia with the help of his fellow Jesuit, Pierre Leroy, who co-founded the Institute of Geobiology with him in Peking.  Pietro Angelo Secchi  Pietro Angelo Secchi became a Jesuit priest in 1833. He became a professor of astronomy at the Roman College and eventually founded an observatory where he would further his research in stellar spectroscopy, meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism. His observations and theories laid the foundation for the Harvard classification system of stars as he was the first to survey the spectra of stars and attempt to classify them by their spectral type.  Jesuit Observatories  Perhaps one of the greatest contributions made by the Jesuits to science is the large network of observatories they founded across the world. Between 1824 and 1957, 75 observatories were founded by the Jesuits. Though their main focus was astronomy, other fields the observatories were involved in include meteorology, geomagnetism, seismology, and geophysiology. In some countries in Asia and Africa, these observatories were the first scientific institutions they had ever had. The contribution of the Jesuits to the development of seismology and seismic prospecting has been so substantial that seismology has been called \\"The Jesuit Science\\". Frederick Odenbach, SJ, is considered by many to have been the \\"pioneer of American seismologists.\\" In 1936, Fr. J.B. Macelwane, SJ, wrote the first seismology textbook in America, Introduction to Theoretical Seismology. In the 21st Century, Jesuits remain prominent in the sciences through institutions like the Vatican Observatory and Georgetown University. Stephen Hawking was a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which gathers leading world scientists to advise the Popes on scientific issues. Current Church doctrine In his 1893 encyclical, Pope Leo XIII wrote that \\"no real disagreement can exist between the theologian and the scientist provided each keeps within his own limits. ...If nevertheless there is a disagreement ... it should be remembered that the sacred writers, or more truly ‚Äòthe Spirit of God who spoke through them, did not wish to teach men such truths (as the inner structure of visible objects) which do not help anyone to salvation‚Äô; and that, for this reason, rather than trying to provide a scientific exposition of nature, they sometimes describe and treat these matters either in a somewhat figurative language or as the common manner of speech those times required, and indeed still requires nowadays in everyday life, even amongst most learned people.\\"(Leo XIII, Providentissimus Deus 18) The Catechism of the Catholic Church asserts: \\"Methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God despite himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 159 Providentissimus Deus Providentissimus Deus, \\"On the Study of Holy Scripture\\", was an encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII on 18 November 1893. In it, he reviewed the history of Bible study from the time of the Church Fathers to the present, spoke against what he considered to be the errors of the Rationalists and \\"higher critics\\", and outlined principles of scripture study and guidelines for how scripture was to be taught in seminaries. He also addressed the issues of apparent contradictions between the Bible and physical science, or between one part of scripture and another, and how such apparent contradictions can be resolved. Providentissimus Deus responded to two challenges to biblical authority, both of which rose during the 19th century. The physical sciences, especially the theory of evolution and geology's theory of a very old earth, challenged the traditional Biblical account of creation taking place 6,000 years ago. Pope Leo XIII wrote that true science cannot contradict scripture when it is properly explained, that errors the Church Fathers made do not demonstrate error in Scripture, and that what seems to be proved by science can turn out to be wrong. The historical-critical method of analyzing scripture questioned the reliability of the Bible. Leo acknowledged the possibility of errors introduced by scribes but forbade the interpretation that only some of the scripture is inerrant, while other elements are fallible. Leo condemned the use that certain scholars made of new evidence, clearly referring to Alfred Firmin Loisy and Maurice d'Hulst, although not by name. At first, both conservatives and liberals found elements in the encyclical to which to appeal. Over the next decade, however, Modernism spread and Providentissimus Deus was increasingly interpreted in a conservative sense.\\"Provdentissimus Deus\\". Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 This encyclical was part of an ongoing conflict between Modernists and conservatives. In 1902, Pope Leo XIII instituted the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which was to adapt Roman Catholic Biblical studies to modern scholarship and to protect Scripture against attacks.\\"Biblical Commission\\". Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 The Oath against Modernism was finally rescinded after Vatican II. Humani generis Humani generis is a papal encyclical that Pope Pius XII promulgated on 12 August 1950 \\"concerning some false opinions threatening to undermine the foundations of Catholic Doctrine.\\" Theological opinions and doctrines are known as Nouvelle Th√©ologie or neo-modernism and their consequences on the Church were its primary subject. Evolution and its impact on theology constitute only two out of 44 parts. Yet the position which Pius XII defined in 1950, delinking the creation of body and soul, was confirmed by Pope John Paul II, who highlighted additional facts supporting the theory of evolution half a century later. Fides et Ratio Fides et ratio is a Papal Encyclical that Pope John Paul II Promulgated on the 14th of September 1998, \\"On the Relationship between Faith and Reason\\". In the encyclical, Pope John Paul II addressed the relationship between faith and reason, the first to do so since Pope Leo XIII in 1879, with his encyclical Aeterni Patris. Pope John Paul II described the relationship between faith and reason as 'two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth'.http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_fides-et-ratio.html 'This is why I make this strong and insistent appeal‚Äînot, I trust, untimely‚Äîthat faith and philosophy recover the profound unity which allows them to stand in harmony with their nature without compromising their mutual autonomy. The parrhesia of faith must be matched by the boldness of reason.' In his 1998 encyclical, Pope John Paul II gave an example to the faithful of how to defend faith, without shunning reason. Following and supporting the long tradition of Christian Theology and Philosophy. The Catholic Church has always purported a thesis of harmony between Science and Religion, despite the growing trend of conflict being purported between the two. Through Fides et ratio Pope John Paul II reinforced the Church's stance upon the relationship between Science and The Catholic Church. 'The Church remains profoundly convinced that faith and reason ‚Äúmutually support each other‚Äù; each influences the other, as they offer to each other a purifying critique and a stimulus to pursue the search for deeper understanding.' 'Similarly, fundamental theology should demonstrate the profound compatibility that exists between faith and its need to find expression by way of human reason fully free to give its assent. Faith will thus be able ‚Äúto show fully the path to reason in a sincere search for the truth. Although faith, a gift of God, is not based on reason, it can certainly not dispense with it. At the same time, it becomes apparent that reason needs to be reinforced by faith, to discover horizons it cannot reach on its own‚Äù.' Ethics and science The Catholic Church teaches that scientific research and conduct need to be informed by and put to the aid of Christian ethics. During recent pontificates, issues such as the implications of genetics and anthropological climate change have been important areas of focus. The Vatican draws on leading scientists to examine scientific literature in search of \\"moral and philosophical problems, either caused by science or which can be helped by science.\\" Church and science as complementary The Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin argued in an influential book The Phenomenon of Man (1959) that science and religion were two vital sides of the same phenomenon: a quest for perfect knowledge.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011 Pope John Paul II in his 1998 encyclical Fides et Ratio wrote that \\"faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.\\" Conflict thesis and \\"drastic revision\\" The scientists John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White were the most influential exponents of the conflict thesis between the Catholic Church and science. In the early 1870s, Draper was invited to write a History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874), a book replying to contemporary papal edicts such as the doctrine of infallibility, and mostly criticizing the anti-intellectualism of Roman Catholicism,Alexander, D (2001), Rebuilding the Matrix, Lion Publishing, (pg. 217) yet he assessed that Islam and Protestantism had little conflict with science. Draper's preface summarises the conflict thesis: \\"The history of Science is not a mere record of isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.\\"John William Draper, History of the Conflict Religion, D. Appleton and Co. (1881) In 1896, White published A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, the culmination of thirty years of research and publication on the subject. In the introduction, White emphasized he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting Ezra Cornell in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation. More recently, Thomas E. Woods, Jr., asserts that, despite the widely held conception of the Catholic Church as being anti-science, this conventional wisdom has been the subject of \\"drastic revision\\" by historians of science over the last 50 years. Woods asserts that the mainstream view now is that the \\"Church [has] played a positive role in the development of science ... even if this new consensus has not yet managed to trickle down to the general public.\\" Science historian Ronald L. Numbers corroborates this view, writing that ‚ÄúHistorians of science have known for years that White‚Äôs and Draper‚Äôs accounts are more propaganda than history. ‚Ä¶Yet the message has rarely escaped the ivory tower.\\"Numbers, Ronald L. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù in Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion.

Ferdinand Foch, or \\"Marshal Foch\\", was supreme commander of Allied forces from April 1918 onwards. The chair was endowed by an arms trader, Basil Zaharoff, in Foch's honour; he also endowed a post in English Literature at the University of Paris in honour of the British Field Marshal Earl Haig. Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a right of veto over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this. The compromise reached was that Paris should have a representative on the appointing committee (although this provision was later removed). In advance of the first election, St√©phen Pichon (the French Foreign Minister) unsuccessfully attempted to influence the decision. The first professor, Gustave Rudler, was appointed in 1920. , the chair is held by Catriona Seth. The position is held in conjunction with a Fellowship of All Souls College. History The position of Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature in the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages at the University of Oxford was founded in 1918 shortly after the end of the First World War. It honours the French general Ferdinand Foch, known as \\"Marshal Foch\\", who from April 1918 was supreme commander of the Allied forces. Basil Zaharoff, a Greek-born French arms trader and financier, gave ¬£25,000 ( in ) to the university to establish the chair and to support French studies in other ways, such as the award of scholarships to students for travel, e.g. the Zaharoff Travelling Scholarship. Oxford marked Zaharoff's generosity by conferring upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law (DCL) in October 1920. News of the donation was announced in The Times on 21 November 1918, shortly after Foch was one of the signatories of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November that ended hostilities. The Times said that the name of the professorship was \\"most felicitously chosen\\", commemorating the \\"recent great events\\" and preparing for the \\"intellectual entente of the coming years.\\" It also noted that French language and literature, for the first time, would be \\"enthroned in Oxford side by side with Greek and with Latin\\" ‚Äì professorships in both subjects having existed at Oxford for many years before Zaharoff's donation. Zaharoff also founded the Earl Haig Chair of English Literature at the University of Paris, in honour of Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, Field Marshal and commander of the British forces on the Western Front from 1915 until the end of the Great War. The necessary changes to the university's statutes were made at a meeting of Congregation (Oxford's governing body) on 18 February 1919. During the debate, Sir Herbert Warren, the President of Magdalen College, Oxford, stated that the Professor was to be paid ¬£500 annually (), \\"making it a first- rate chair.\\" Zaharoff initially stipulated that Oxford's choice of Marshal Foch Professor should be approved by the University of Paris. This provision was unacceptable to Oxford University's authorities, who regarded it as ceding control over the appointment. As a compromise, it was agreed that Paris should be represented on the committee selecting the professor. According to the historian Elizabeth Greenslade, \\"the French regarded the appointment to the new chair as an opportunity to improve Franco-British inter-university relations.\\" St√©phen Pichon (the French Minister of Foreign Affairs) had a preferred candidate in mind. He asked the French Ambassador in London to reach an agreement with Gustave Lanson, the representative of the University of Paris, that Lanson would support Pichon's choice during the selection process. No agreement was reached. In the end, neither Pichon's choice, nor the candidate supported by both Lanson and Zaharoff, were appointed, as Oxford wanted candidates with British teaching experience. The first professor, Gustave Rudler (formerly of the University of London), took up the position in 1920; he was one of eight French applicants for the post, and also defeated five British candidates. The anonymous London correspondent of The Manchester Guardian wrote in 1919 that London University \\"sustains an immense loss\\" through Rudler's appointment and \\"can ill afford to lose him\\", since he had \\"raised the study of French literature to an entirely new plane\\". The post is associated with a non-stipendiary Fellowship of All Souls College. Changes to the university's internal rules since 1920 have abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as the Marshal Foch Professorship. The University Council is now empowered to make appropriate arrangements for appointments and conditions of service, and the college to which any professorship is allocated (All Souls in this instance) has two representatives on the board of electors.

It safeguards the interests of 27.000 members and is one of the most important German professional associations and unions for executives, academics and employees with managerial responsibility. It was founded in 1919 as the Union of Employed Chemists and Engineers ‚ÄúBudaci‚Äù. The VAA champions the material, legal and social interests of its members. It gives them advice on different aspects of working life and tries to provide better labour conditions by negotiating collective agreements. The association offers special legal services for retirees and older employees, who participate in part-time work schemes.  Structure  The VAA represents executive staff, managers, academics, professionals and young professionals. Members of the VAA belong to different occupational groups. Over 70% of the VAA members have an academic background ‚Äì they usually come from the field of natural or applied sciences. Thus many of them work as scientists, engineers or managers. But there are also a significant number of economists, agronomists and lawyers working in responsible positions for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), larger companies and corporations in the chemical industry. The VAA is divided into eight state groups, the structure of which is related to the regional concentration of chemical companies or corporations. The state groups do not comply with the administrative territory of the sixteen German states. Each state group consists of a certain number of so-called factory groups, which are made up by VAA members directly on-site in the respective companies. As a rule of thumb: the bigger the company the greater the number of people organised in a factory group. Hence there are strong factory groups in companies like BASF, Bayer, Clariant, Evonik, Henkel, Merck, Roche Diagnostics, Sanofi Aventis or Wacker. In case there is no factory group in a company (e.g. in some SMEs), people enter the VAA as single members.  Politics  As a politically independent professional association, the VAA cooperates with its German social partners, the Federal Association of Employers in Chemistry BAVC and the Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union IG BCE. One of the main tasks of the VAA is collective bargaining. Therefore it holds regular talks with the BAVC. The setting-up of a collective agreement for academics and non-tariff employees (i.e. those professionals, who are not covered by the collective agreement between IG BCE and BAVC) can be considered as one of the association's main achievements. Furthermore, the VAA has managed to sign a special collective agreement on annual remuneration for employees in their second professional year. The VAA also promotes the interests of its members on the political level. It is a member of the German Managers‚Äô Confederation ULA, an interest group for executives which has close links and ties to political players and organisations in both Berlin and Brussels. The VAA is also a member of the European Federation of Managers in the Chemical and Allied Industries FECCIA and the European Confederation of Executives and Managerial Staff CEC.

Unlike them, it was part of the former city of East York. The neighbourhood is named for the Governor's Bridge that crosses the Moore Park Ravine from Douglas Crescent to Astley Avenue and connects the area to Rosedale. The bridge was built in 1923 and restored in 2000. Governor's Bridge's boundaries are the Canadian Pacific Railroad to the north, Bayview Avenue to the south and east, and Mud Creek as part of the Moore Park Ravine to its intersection with Pottery Road to the west. It contains all residential properties on the streets currently known as Governor‚Äôs Road, Nesbitt Drive, Douglas Crescent, True Davidson Drive and Hampton Park Crescent, as of May 1, 2009.http://www.governorsbridge.net/gbra-by-laws/ The neighbourhood is divided into two sections by a smaller set of railway tracks. Western section The Governor's Bridge is located in the neighbourhood's western section. It is a very small neighbourhood with only a couple of hundred homes. The area was originally purchased and subdivided in 1911 by two prominent Toronto lawyers: William Douglas and Wallace Nesbitt. Each has a street in the neighbourhood named after him. Construction had to wait until the construction of Governor's Bridge in 1923 connected the area to the rest of the city.Governor's Bridge - Toronto Neighbourhood Guide The bridge was named in honour of the Lieutenant- Governor of Ontario whose home Chorley Park was located just south of the bridge. The west part of the neighbourhood was quickly built up during the Roaring Twenties boom period, and most of the houses date from this era. Many of them are ornamented with Spanish-style accents. This style was also very popular in California at the time, and was thus often featured and glamourized in films of the period. In its early history the area was thus sometimes nicknamed \\"Little Hollywood.\\" It has remained an elite enclave that in recent years has seen many of the smaller bungalows replaced by much larger new homes. Eastern section and the \\"Bayview Ghost\\" Houses in the newer eastern section of Governor's Bridge. The eastern part of the neighbourhood, across the rail line, has a very different history. After the Second World War Bayview Avenue was extended south from Moore Avenue through the Don Valley. This opened the possibility of developing the land just east of Governor's Bridge, which could be reached along Bayview. In 1959 Harry Frimerman, a Toronto land developer obtained permission from East York to construct a set of apartment buildings on the site. This caused immediate outrage from the residents of Governor's Bridge and beyond who had been promised the area would remain as park land. Within days the city reversed itself, but legally the development permit could not be revoked. The developers began construction of the Hampton Park Apartments. Unable to block the construction itself, the city refused to extend water and sewer service to the site. In 1960 the developers halted construction of the partially completed apartments when the city refused right-of-way to the site. A hollow seven story shell of a building remained on the site for over twenty years. The position atop the ravine and next to the Don Valley Parkway made it into a prominent landmark and it was nicknamed the Bayview Ghost.http://www.toronto.ca/archives/current_bayview_ghost.htm East York rezoned the area for single family homes and the \\"Ghost\\" was finally demolished in November 1981 at the developer's expense. A new bridge was built linking Governor's Bridge to the other side of the tracks, and in the late 1990s the Conservatory Group began work on a new subdivision named the Governor's Bridge Estates. The development consists of 60 homes in a neo- eclectic style. This development also ran into difficulties as people proved unwilling to buy homes overlooking an expressway at Rosedale prices.\\"Pricey subdivision half-vacant.\\" Jonathan Spicer. Town Crier.

MouseHunt was developed by HitGrab, Inc. under the direction of Bryan Freeman and Joel Auge, and was released to a select group of beta testers in early 2007. On 7 March 2008, MouseHunt was officially released to the general public. Just nine months later, MouseHunt earned a $250,000 grant from Facebook's seed fund fbFund.\\"Over $1 Million Awarded to fbFund Recipients\\" 10 December 2008\\"Mouse Game Wins Coveted Grant from Social Web Giant\\" Facebook PRWeb 5 November 2008 In 2011, it was shortlisted by Facebook as a top game with 50,000 to 100,000 users. It was one of the first games on Facebook to introduce a tradeable digital good (SUPER|brie+). MouseHunt released mobile apps for iOS on 17 October 2012 and Android on 7 December 2012. Story MouseHunt is set in the fantasy kingdom of Gnawnia. The player is a hunter, commissioned by the King of Gnawnia to catch mice in a variety of environments using virtual traps, bases, and cheeses. Additional lore is unlocked by catching mice that drop Torn Pages, which describe the adventures and observations of Plankrun, the game's mythical first-ever hunter. Gameplay MouseHunt is a passive game, intended to be played while surfing the Web. The player, called a hunter, arms a trap (using cheese as bait) and can then sound the \\"Hunter's Horn\\" once every 15 minutes. If a player is playing the game for the first time, there is a special mission and the player can sound the \\"Hunter's Horn\\" once every 30 seconds. Every time the hunter's horn is sounded, they are taken on a hunt and have a possibility of catching a mouse. For each mouse the player catches, they get a unique reward, which is a certain number of points and gold, dependent on the breed of mouse captured. Automatic \\"Trap Checks\\" conducted every hour allow for a total of five opportunities to catch mice every hour. To ease out server load, Trap checks for different users are timed at either the :00, :15, :30 or :45 during the hour. However, one has to log in to sound the Hunter's Horn at least once per 24 hours for the automatic 'Trap Checks' to continue. For most areas that were released later on in the game (typically those released after 2011), most have a special Heads-Up-Display (HUD) below the normal HUD which guides the hunter along the specific mission for that area, or to help the hunter along with the special game mechanics for the area. Some areas have special game mechanics, like time-limited areas, or limited hunt areas, where hunters can only hunt in there for a specific amount of time or specific number of hunts before getting 'thrown out' to another area. Some areas also have game mechanics which alter the mice that can be caught in that area. However, these special mechanics still allow the game to be largely passive in nature, requiring just that little bit more work than just sounding the horn. Social aspects of gameplay Friend networks are used in the game, as players who are in- network friends (e.g., Facebook friends) can sound the horn for each other if hunting in the same area, but this effect is disabled during a tournament. Friends can also send in-game gifts to each other. Some items from a hunter's inventory (gold, some cheeses and crafting items, gift baskets, and trap skins) can be given up to 15 friends. Additionally, hunters may send daily free gifts, which vary somewhat from day to day, and during certain events can buy virtual in-game gifts for friends, using either virtual gold or through donations. Friends can form teams; a new team can have at most five members including the captain, but three additional member slots can be unlocked. To unlock each extra slot, teams must complete a task. Slot 1: Complete 10 tournaments, slot 2: Obtain 10 Participant badges and slot 3: Obtain 10 Competitor badges.http://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Hunting_Team MouseHunt Wiki: Hunting Team Tournaments were initially released on 13 May 2009, but were discontinued on 8 June 2010. After more than a year, this feature was finally re-released on 28 December 2011. Tournaments involve hunting for certain specific mice, each of which has a certain point value within the tournament, for a certain pre-determined time period. In-game prizes are awarded to hunters based on the finishing score of their team. Ranks Hunters start the game with the rank of Novice. Additional ranks are unlocked as the hunter progresses through the game, in the following order: Recruit, Apprentice, Initiate, Journeyman/Journeywoman, Master, Grandmaster, Legendary, Hero, Knight, Lord/Lady, Baron/Baroness, Count/Countess, Duke/Duchess, Grand Duke/Grand Duchess, Archduke/Archduchess, Viceroy, Elder, Sage, and Fabled. Increases in rank are dependent on the quality (number of points a mouse is worth) and quantity of mice caught. As a hunter attains higher ranks, it becomes increasingly difficult to rank up further as each hunt will grant less percentage progress towards the next rank. As of July 2020, it is not yet possible to exceed the Fabled rank. For each new rank, the shield next to a hunter's name will have its appearance updated. The hunter gains features such as more crafting slots or a greater number of cheese imbued per potion. Most importantly, the hunter will gain access to a greater number of hunting locations throughout the kingdom, which in turn gives the hunter access to more powerful traps, bases, charms, and mice. Locations When players start out, they can only access the Meadow as their hunting location, but more locations are unlocked as they progress in rank. Certain locations, however, also require map pieces (purchasable from either the Cartographer, or dropped as loot by mice), the crafting of certain items and other forms of loot such as keys to be accessed. There are a total of 53 locations in the game, grouped into twelve regions. In the game, there is 1 area, called the Toxic Spill that can only be accessed when a Toxic Spill has occurred (which is determined by the developers), and 2 sets of 2 areas in which only one of the two is open at any given time. In addition, a place- holder location for banned players (they cannot sound the horn or access the game), who have violated the game's Terms of Service, called the King's Stockade was added in April 2009. When traveling to other locations, hunters used to be charged a certain amount of gold contingent on the distance of the destination from the hunters' origin. In previous versions of the game, travel to the Town of Gnawnia was free. This has been replaced by a separate travel tab that transports players to the Meadow for free. Travel also used to be free when using the MouseHunt App on Android and iOS for players who had joined the game (not downloaded the app) before 14 April 2014. With the update of the Adventure Book, travel costs were removed for all hunters.http://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Timeline Timeline on MHWiki Besides this conventional mode of travel, there are certain locations where timers and counters are implemented, whereby hunters will be automatically transported to another location once the timer runs out or they have maxed their counter. There are also other locations where you have to catch a certain breed of mouse in order to travel there. Traps A trap setup consists of a weapon, a base, a piece of cheese and, if desired by the Hunter, a Charm. Traps are either bought or crafted. For traps that can be bought, they can be found at certain stores, called Trapsmiths, and they can sometimes be refunded for 18% of the purchase price. Some traps are also bought from Trapsmiths that cost some crafting items, or require the hunter to have certain items or completed certain tasks before purchasing. Traps that are crafted as well as previous Limited Edition traps (see section on Ronza's Traveling Shoppe) are non-refundable. Traps also have power types depending on the weapon, and it would influence the effectiveness of the trap against certain types of mice. The current power types for the traps in the game are Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Trap components have a certain point or rank requirement, preventing players with lesser points from being able to buy or craft the trap component even if they have sufficient gold to buy it or crafting items to craft it. For example, if the points requirement of a certain trap is 16 million points, and the player has 2 million points, they would be unable to buy or craft the item, despite having sufficient gold and crafting items. This is to prevent players from \\"buying their way\\" through the game. Base A base adds a little bit of power to your trap. It also might increase additional things like power, luck, attraction bonus, but it will not change the weapon's power type. Bases can be bought from Trapsmiths but the most powerful bases are crafted and won from tournaments. Charms Charms were introduced to the game on 12 January 2011. Available to hunters with rank Journeyman and above, hunters buy a charm conduit in the Mountain Charm Shoppe to be able to arm charms. Charms are consumable items that modify certain trap attributes. Apart from boosts to the trap statistics (e.g., increase in power, luck, cheese effect and attraction), many charms also have special effects when used in certain locations, when paired with specific weapons and/or bases, or against specific mice or mouse groups. They can also alter the power type of traps. Charms are consumable, like bait, however, each charm has a different consumption property (e.g., after every hunt, or every mouse encounter, or after catching a specific mouse), but the majority of charms are consumed upon encountering a mouse. Charms are purchased from a charm shoppe or are crafted. Most crafted charms can be bought on the Marketplace. Charms that are bought from a shoppe can be refunded for 30% of the purchase price. Some charms bought from shoppes require specific items to be traded in along with gold as well. Some specific charms could be armed along with a specific trap or used in a specific location in order to grant more bonus to your trap setup. Cheese There is a very large cheese variety on offer, which can be bought or crafted. At present there are 5 (not including SUPER|brie+) standard cheeses that can be bought with gold at the various Cheese Shoppes in the game, namely Cheddar, Marble, Swiss, Brie, and Gouda. In the rift areas, there are 3 standard cheeses, Marble String, Swiss String and Brie String. The vast majority of cheeses are crafted. Many crafted cheese have specific effects on mice population. Certain cheese can be made by imbuing potions into a certain type of cheese. Some cheeses can also be made by crafting through the use of crafting ingredients found in General Stores and/or from loot dropped by mice. Certain cheese also provide bonuses to the trap setup, like a power bonus to the trap. This was announced during a Feedback Friday Session which provided teasers to a revamp of an existing area, set to be released sometime in November. There are also event cheeses that are used during events run in the game (See Events section). Crafting Crafting is an important element into the game, especially when people ascend ranks. A wide variety of things can be crafted, such as traps, bases and cheese. Crafting is only available to players who are Apprentice (the third rank) and above. As a person goes up in rank, they will get more \\"crafting slots\\", meaning that they can combine more items at a time. Players initially have 2 slots, increasing to a (current) maximum of 12 slots for Duke/Duchess. Within the crafting section, there is also the Hunter's Hammer, which is essentially a tool to \\"smash\\" certain items, such as cheese or trap components, which usually are used to craft another items, generally other kinds of cheese or upgraded traps. In the present version of MouseHunt, a \\"Recipe Book\\" was added that allows player to craft multiple quantities of a weapon, base, cheese or any crafting item at once. Recipes are unlocked upon a successful crafting of the item, or upon completing a set task. The last slot in crafting used to be a red slot in Version 2.0. Using the red slot meant that there was a risk of the crafting failing and resulting in a loss of the components being used to craft the item. This was removed in Version 3.0. Loot Some mice may drop loot, which includes map pieces, potions and crafting items, cheese, collectibles etc. The percentage of loot drops varies depending on the breed of mice as well as other factors such as trap luck. These can usually be used in the game to accelerate in forms of progress, and is sometimes even necessary for it. Some loots may only be dropped if a certain type of cheese, charm or trap is used. Potions Potions are used to imbue a certain type of cheese into another type of cheese. For example, imbuing brie cheese with a Radioactive Blue Cheese potion would convert the brie cheese into Radioactive Blue cheese. The number of cheese that can be imbued per potion increases based on the rank of the player. During the Lunar New Year events, potions can be used to imbue a certain type of charm into another type of charm. The Developers have mentioned that in the future, potions may be used to upgrade other trap components. Catching Mice Mice are divided into different \\"Groups\\" - there are 31 as of the MouseHunt v3.0 update: Indigenous Mice, Gauntlet Gladiators, Forest Guild, The Shadow Clan, Digby Dirt Dwellers, Followers of Furoma, The Forgotten Mice, Aquatic Order, The Elub Tribe, The Nerg Tribe, The Derr Tribe, The Dreaded Horde, Draconic Brood, Balack's Banished, Seasonal Soldiers, Wizard's Pieces, Zurreal's Breed, The Marching Flame, Muridae Market Mice, Icewing's Invasion, Living Garden Mice, Lost City Mice, Sand Dunes Mice, Wild Bunch, Train Robbers, The Polluted, Rift Walkers, Deep Sea Dwellers, Fungal Fiends, Citizens of Zokor or Event Mice. Members of the group share common weaknesses with the exception of the \\"Gauntlet Gladiators\\" group. There are ten power types in the game: Physical, Shadow, Tactical, Forgotten, Arcane, Hydro, Draconic, Law, Rift and Parental. Using the right kind of cheese gives the hunter a higher chance of attracting the mice they want and using the right power type of trap would increase the chances of catching the mice. Breeds of Mice From its birth in March 2008 until now, MouseHunt has 726 breeds (as of 20 July 2017) of mice excluding the Event Mice. Some of them, when caught will drop loot, which depending on the type of loot may be essential to players' progress through the game. Along with this, there are 127 special Event Mice, some of which are released for a short period during occasional events. These mice might drop cheese, crafting items, collectibles and cash prizes (one hunter won $1000 CAD for being the first to catch a mouse known as the Master Burglar mouse, which is no longer a rare mouse). You are also able to catch the Leprechaun mouse, worth $25‚Äì500 (which currently has over 1000 catches). Prize mice, when caught, (other than Mobster and Leprechaun) typically drop King's Credits, which can be traded at the King's Arms for many in-game hunting items. King's Credits are also given in Loyalty Chests (something like Daily Bonuses), and sometimes dropped by mice as well. The mice in this game are loosely based on real life. For example, the White, Grey and Brown mouse can be found in the Meadow and other places suitable for starters, its normal habitat. And as a further example, some of the mice which belong to the group \\"Followers of Furoma\\" practice martial arts. Different groups have distinct differences as well as trap requirements to trap them. There are also rift mice, which are essentially 'rift', enlarged and more powerful versions of their predecessors. The Marketplace The Marketplace is meant to be an auction house for hunters to buy items that other hunters are selling. The Marketplace began with only being able to buy or sell the Key to the Town of Digby, Burroughs Laboratory Map Piece, and SUPER|brie+. In V2.0 the Marketplace was moved to its own discussion board. The only thing to purchase was SUPER|brie+. Hunters would negotiate and then trade, but the system was not very popular with players. 21 June 2010, v3.0, it reopened under the shops tab. Hunters could anonymously sell SUPER|brie+, Moon, and Maki cheeses. In an update hunters were allowed to sell Zugzwang's Left Sock. Another update and hunters were allowed to sell Ninja Ambush skin, Grungy Deathbot skin, Fluffy Deathbot Skin, and Wishing Well Basket. In the latest update hunters can sell any crafted charm and the orbs used to make them, also included is the Tiki Base Blueprints that Ronza sold during January 2011. On 23 July 2014, the Marketplace underwent a revamp, allowing hunters to sell trap parts and loot obtained from areas restricted to Baron/Baroness and higher ranked players. The new area also gave players an option to put up an offer to buy, which essentially meant sellers could choose to fulfil buy offers by buyers straight away, instead of having to put up a sell offer for buyers to pick. There is a 10% tariff paid by the buyer on the total sale value, possibly to prevent people from buying low and selling high straightaway (flipping). The Adventure Book Released on 29 July 2015, the Adventure Book was released. It contains various objectives/quests, called \\"Adventures\\", a hunter can embark on that focus on catching a powerful mouse, unlocking a new area, or unlocking new traps in specific areas. Completion of adventures give rewards of gold, points and rank progression. Some offer King's Credits. These adventures are optional, but typically to progress in the game, these adventures would be completed anyway. The Devs said it was meant to guide hunters along and let them know what they have yet to complete for that rank. However, the developers stressed that it was not the be-all and end-all of the game, and there were many other things that hunters could aim to achieve, like gaining crowns (crowns are awarded to hunters for catching a breed of mice 10, 100 and 500 times) for all mice, or getting the most powerful trap. Tournaments Players are able to join teams with other hunters. Teams can allow for open registration, meaning that anyone can join, or they can be closed which means that in order to join a player needs to receive an invite from the team captain. Teams allow for socialization, but the main benefit is the ability to compete in tournaments. In a tournament, teammates aim to catch mice on the tournament catch list. Each mouse is worth a certain number of tournament points. At the end of the tournament, teams are awarded prizes based on how well they competed. There are First, Second, and Third place which have a higher reward and respective trophies. There are also prizes for top 10%, top 25%, and top 50%. Placing in a tournament will earn the players \\"Tournament Tokens\\". Tournament tokens can be exchanged at the Tournament Hall in the Valour region for various prizes, including powerful bases and charms. Ronza's Traveling Shoppe Ronza is a traveling merchant who visits the Kingdom of Gnawnia, selling various wares such as cheese, Limited Edition (LE) traps and crafting materials. Occasionally, players can visit Ronza's shop, a special location in which limited edition items can be purchased. Ronza is a fictional character. The game does not provide excessive information. Her visits generally accompany special events and releases. Length of visits, available items, and location vary greatly. However, recently Ronza's arrivals have become slightly more predictable, coming in intervals of 1 year 2 months since 2012, coming in January 2012, March 2013, May 2014 and most recently July 2015. Larry Larry Larry's job is to roam the land to seek out and train those who seem worthy to become a fabled MouseHunter. He guides new hunters throughout the tutorial and gives them everything they need to start their journey. He also teaches them how to use the Hunter's Horn. If you click on Hunting Tips by Larry it takes you to a hunter profile of rank Knight. If you click on his picture again it takes you to Larry Hastings Facebook page. Events Events in MouseHunt are special occasions when special event mice are released into the game. Some events have become annual celebrations, others are unique, but a fun time is had by all. October to April/May is typically referred to in game as events season, as most annual events are during that period. Annual events include Halloween in October, the Great Winter Hunt in December, the Lunar New Year and Valentines event in Jan/Feb, MouseHunt's Birthday in March and the Spring Egg Hunt in April/May. Typically during events, loot normally used in other permanent areas can usually be acquired with the special event currency (e.g., Ice Coins for Great Winter Hunt), or by completing special missions. An event trap/base is also available for most events. Developers MouseHunt was developed by HitGrab Inc., a company based in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. MouseHunt was officially launched on 7 March 2008 after receiving praise from a group of 100 beta testers. MouseHunt version 1.0 was upgraded to version 2.0 on 6 October 2008, boasting significantly improved coding and design. MouseHunt version 3.0 (Longtail) was launched on 8 June 2010, reworking several aspects of the game's mechanics and interface. Donations Players can donate to the developers of MouseHunt by buying credits in the game, which give them a certain type of cheese, called SUPER|brie+. This cheese is superior to all other types of cheese in most situations, giving the player an added advantage to catching mice. The application offers a greater variety of payment methods including Facebook credits, PayPal, Cherry Credits, Boku and PaymentWall. The following methods also used to exist, but are not available at this time: Paymo, Rixty, SocialGold, Offerwall and Offerpal Media. Upon donation, they would receive a Lucky Golden Shield, denoted by the Golden Shield on their camp page next to their Hunter's title, which increases their trap set-up's luck by 7. Depending on the amount they donated, the Lucky Golden Shield will last for 30 days, 2 months or 4 months. Hunting Kits/Baskets can be purchased, which typically include SUPER|brie+ and some other vital crafting ingredients in some areas to give hunters a headstart. The Lucky Golden Shield is also given to these donors. References External links * MouseHunt Official Site * MouseHunt Wiki * HitGrab, Inc.

Features The PEN E-PL1 was the lowest-cost Micro Four Third camera available at launch, with a US dollar MSRP of $500. In terms of market, DPReview considered the E-PL1 more aimed at the point-and-shoot (compact camera) market, rather than the DSLR market (like the E-P1 & E-P2) ‚Äì more of a large-sensor compact than a small format DSLR. In DPReview's opinion the E-PL1 was easy to use in automatic mode, but due to the small number of dedicated dials and buttons, it could be more awkward to use in manual modes compared to a DSLR. A slightly updated E-PL1s was introduced in November 2010.

Exhibits The Senate Chamber A view of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute's replica Senate ChamberThis exhibit houses the only full-scale reproduction of the United States Senate Chamber. Visitors are encouraged to explore the space with the help of exhibit interpreters and participate in the Institute‚Äôs signature daily programs, such as Today‚Äôs Vote and Great Senate Debates. * Today‚Äôs Vote „Éº During Today‚Äôs Vote, visitors have the chance to cast their vote on a rotating bill inspired by real legislation and related to the simultaneously changing Issue of the Day. * Great Senate Debates „Éº Blending live performance with historic film footage and archival images, this twenty- minute family program looks at the context and importance of crucial turning points in Senate history and reflects on their impact on our lives today. Digital exhibits The exhibit halls feature technology-driven projected displays that immerse visitors in the history of the Senate through exhibits such as What is the Senate?, Traditions of the Senate, and People of the Senate. In addition, the halls include interactive exhibits, such as How a Bill Becomes a Law, where visitors work together to negotiate and select ice cream sundae toppings, vote on bills, override vetoes, and practice the skills needed to guide legislation through Congress. Senator‚Äôs Office This exhibit features a full-scale replica of Senator Kennedy‚Äôs Washington, D.C. office, where visitors, equipped with provided tablets, are able to explore the stories behind pieces of the collection. Public programs and special events The Institute offers a series of public programs and special events hosted in Boston and Washington, D.C. on local and national issues. These programs are open to the public. Getting to the Point The Getting to the Point series convenes individuals with diverse perspectives to discuss current issues and the challenges our government is facing. Getting to the Point takes on various formats from town halls to keynote lectures and panel discussions, and showcases speakers from all walks of life. Since opening, the Institute has hosted a variety of speakers ranging from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to Congressman John Lewis, to Red Sox Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez. Across the Aisle This series brings together government leaders with disparate ideologies, from different political parties who are collaborating on a common cause. In moderated discussions, Across the Aisle highlights the type of civil discourse, negotiation, collaboration, and leadership that leads to solutions for pressing problems. The series features members of Congress, governors, mayors, and other elected officials and both national and local issues. Oral History Project The Edward M. Kennedy Oral History Project, created in partnership with the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, was released in September 2015. The project is a compilation of interviews from current and former members of the Senate, House, administration officials, foreign leaders, Senate staff, issue advocates, journalists, family, and friends documenting Senator Kennedy‚Äôs service. The Institute hosts a speaker series that draws on this resource to highlight current and future national issues before the U.S. Senate. Educational programs Senate Immersion Module (SIM) The Senate Immersion Module (SIM) is a program for middle and high school students that uses negotiation and debate skills to teach about the legislative process. Using high-touch tablets provided by the Institute, groups of students work together to create a bill on a historic issue or a current policy. Future Senator In the Future Senators program, visitors age 5‚Äì11 years old are introduced to an issue relevant to kids: whether the U.S. government should require a longer school day. The program features a segment from PBS‚Äôs Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman, includes ‚Äúexperts‚Äù for kids to interview, provides time for a debate about what participants learned, and concludes with a voice vote in the full-scale Senate Chamber. Layout, location, and design Layout The Institute‚Äôs facility is a 68,000 square foot (6,317 m2) building designed by Rafael Vi√±oly, targeting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) specifications for sustainable building.. Unfortunately, due to value engineering decisions, the building failed to achieve LEED certification as well as suffers from significant HVAC issues due to low visitorship and incorrectly sized equipment. The centerpiece of the Institute is a full-scale recreation of the Senate Chamber. The halls lining the Chamber are known as the Chamber Surround, and feature the majority of the Institute‚Äôs exhibits. The Institute also features a replica of Senator Kennedy‚Äôs Washington, D.C. office, a Special Exhibits gallery, an Orientation Theater, and three technologically equipped classrooms for educational programs and breakout sessions. The Institute also includes a caf√©, a gift shop, and a coat check. Location The Institute is located on Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The Institute is on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Boston, adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and next door to the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. The Institute can be reached from nearby Interstate 93 or by taking the Red Line or the Commuter Rail to JFK/UMass station and boarding the free shuttle bus (#1) that drops off in front of the Institute. Design and technology The Institute‚Äôs concept, design, and production are the result of a collaboration between Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his wife Vicki Reggie Kennedy, and Ed Schlossberg of ESI Design. During the production process, Control Group was brought on for software development, Richard Lewis Media Group for media elements, Electrosonic for projection technology, and Gigantic Mechanic for game mechanics. History Construction, dedication, and opening A groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 8, 2011. The Institute was dedicated by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2015, with Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama in attendance. The Institute opened to the public on March 31, 2015. Cost and operations The cost of the museum was $78 million in 2011, with $38 million in federal funding and a $60 million endowment that helps to pay for the $10‚Äì12 million annual operating budget of the Institute. As of 2017, admission tickets cost $16 for adults with a $2 discount for Massachusetts residents. In 2017, The Boston Globe reported that ticket sales have been well below the expectations of 100,000 visitors per year, at around 15,000. The Institute is continually revising its business plans in an effort to increase sales, including through more bookings with tour companies and better marketing, but with no notable success to date. Budget cuts, coupled with hefty staff attrition, are used to reduce the operational budget and reduce dependence on endowment principal, the primary funding mechanism to date.. The Institute has not submitted a required Form 990 since 2017 when they reported a net income of -$7,452,014. In 2016 a net income of -$12,516,051 was reported, and in 2015 a net income of -$6,568,948, and finally in 2014, their last positive income of $963,614, a year before launch. Leadership It was announced on November 4, 2019, \\"with mixed emotions\\" that the Institute‚Äôs president, Mary K. Grant, Ph.D., who only assumed leadership in 2018 would be leaving within the month. During her brief tenure, the Institute lost 3/5 of its senior leadership team. Since Grant's departure, the Institute is on their second interim Executive Director and has now lost 4/5 of the senior leadership team with the departure of their short-lived COO. The Institute was previously led by Dr. Jean F. MacCormack from 2014 to 2017, Andrew Tarsy from 2012 to 2014, and Peter Meade from 2009 to 2012. Kennedy Cape House In 2012, the Kennedy family donated the main house of the historic Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port to the Institute, reportedly fulfilling a promise made by Ted Kennedy to his mother, Rose, to donate the house for charitable use. In the process, a sizable tax break was achieved. The Institute released a statement claiming that it hopes to use the house to host educational seminars and other forums, and that it eventually plans to open it to visitation by the public if an agreement between surviving family members and the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation can be reached. A $4 million grant was promised but was written off after over 4 years of debates.

Biography  Leontia was the daughter of Emperor Leo I and his wife Verina; she was younger sister of Ariadne, but, unlike her, she could claim to be porphyrogenita, \\"born in the purple\\", because she was born during the first year of reign of her father (457). Leo, who ascended the throne for military merits and had no family ties with the Roman aristocracy, used the marriage of his daughters to strengthen his position: as Ariadne had been married to the Isaurian general Zeno, the marriage of Leontia was designed to bind him to the other component of the army, the Germanic one represented by the Alan magister militum Aspar. It happened, however, that at the announcement of the marriage between the son of Aspar, Julius Patricius, and Leontia popular riots broke out (470): for the clergy and people of Constantinople it was in fact not acceptable for an Arian as Patricius to have the possibility of becoming emperor. The riots stopped only when Aspar and Leo promised to the bishops that Patricius would convert to Orthodoxy before becoming emperor, and that only after the conversion he would have married Leontia. In 471 Julius Patricius disappears from the chronicles: his father Aspar and his brother Ardabur were murdered in this year by order of Leo. Leontia was then married to Marcian, the son of the Western Emperor Anthemius: the marriage linked the two royal houses of the West and the East. It happened, however, that in 472 Anthemius died, succeeded by Olybrius, and that at the death of Leo, in 474, Zeno ascended to the throne of the East. Ousted from both thrones, Marcianus and Leontia plotted a revolt against Zeno, in 479, which was based on Leontia's right of precedence over her sister as porphyrogenita; the revolt was however quelled.

Such systems are intrinsically out of thermal equilibrium. Unlike thermal systems relaxing towards equilibrium and systems with boundary conditions imposing steady currents, active matter systems break time reversal symmetry because energy is being continually dissipated by the individual constituents. Most examples of active matter are biological in origin and span all the scales of the living, from bacteria and self-organising bio-polymers such as microtubules and actin (both of which are part of the cytoskeleton of living cells), to schools of fish and flocks of birds. However, a great deal of current experimental work is devoted to synthetic systems such as artificial self-propelled particles. Active matter is a relatively new material classification in soft matter: the most extensively studied model, the Vicsek model, dates from 1995. Research in active matter combines analytical techniques, numerical simulations and experiments. Notable analytical approaches include hydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and non- equilibrium statistical physics. Numerical studies mainly involve self- propelled-particles models, making use of agent-based models such as molecular dynamics algorithms as well as computational studies of hydrodynamic equations of active fluids. Experiments on biological systems extend over a wide range of scales, including animal groups (e.g., bird flocks, mammalian herds, fish schools and insect swarms), bacterial colonies, cellular tissues (e.g. epithelial tissue layers, cancer growth and embryogenesis), cytoskeleton components (e.g., in vitro motility assays, actin-myosin networks and molecular-motor driven filaments). Experiments on synthetic systems include self-propelled colloids (e.g., phoretically propelled particles), driven granular matter (e.g. vibrated monolayers), swarming robots and Quinke rotators.

He has been called a prophet. Cain resided in California and ministered monthly at a local church in Santa Maria, California until his death. Life Paul Cain was born on June 16, 1929, in Garland, Texas. His mother Anna had been seriously ill with cancer, tuberculosis, and other difficulties, and was not expected to live.Michael G. Maudlin, ‚ÄúSeers in the Heartland: Hot on the Trail of the Kansas City Prophets, ‚Äù Christianity Today. Retrieved 27 July 2013 Her case was so severe that she was the subject of special medical attention. To the astonishment of doctors both Cain and his mother survived the birth; his mother was subsequently healed. Cain attributes this to an angelic visitation his mother had at that time, and to the fervent prayers of his family. It was during this visitation that Cain was given the name \\"Paul\\" and his mother became sure of his calling to preach. Early ministry Cain drew crowds of 30,000 in Switzerland and Germany with his meetings.Giberti, R Scott, Paul Cain--A Prophet in the Hall of Kings: Between Iraq and a Hard Place, First Stone. 2011. . Cain's ministry at this time used a very large tent, like most other ministers' of the time, such as Billy Graham, Oral Roberts and Jack Coe. Cain, however, eventually became disgusted with what he saw as the corruption of a once-pure movement into a circus of hype and greed. In the late 1950s, he claimed that he was \\"challenged by the Lord\\" concerning such excesses of various leaders in that movement, and suddenly disappeared from public view. Later ministry He began to travel around the world, proclaiming the gospel and calling the church back to purity and holiness. He served as a consultant to Central Intelligence Agency‚ÄîParanormal Division, a consultant to the FBI and was a Presidential Consultant and Special Envoy for three presidents. He ministered to many national and international leaders. During the Clinton Administration, Cain went to Iraq to meet with Saddam Hussein. He also met with spiritual leaders, including key church and denominational leaders. Public apology In April 2004, Rick Joyner, Jack Deere, and Mike Bickle, three ministers who had long- held, close ministerial relationships with Cain, met with Cain to confront him about a homosexual relationship and several incidents of public drunkenness. He denied these accusations which led to Joyner, Deere and Bickle releasing a statement in October stating that he was unwilling to participate in the restoration process. However, in February 2005, Cain stepped down from ministry and issued a letter of confession, posted on his website and excerpted in Charisma Magazine.Grady, J. Lee (March 2005), \\"Prophetic Minister Paul Cain Issues Public Apology for Immoral Lifestyle,\\" Charisma Magazine, Retrieved on 2008-01-28 . \\"I have struggled in two particular areas, homosexuality and alcoholism,\\" Cain admitted, \\"for an extended period of time.\\" In response to this confession, David Andrade of Reclaiming The Valley International Ministries formed a restoration team.

His rehabilitation was questioned by Rick Joyner, Jack Deere, and Mike Bickle. They stated that they lacked confidence in his rehabilitation, did not consider him restored, and therefore his return to ministry was premature.Deere, Jack (January 2007) By September 2007 Andrade was able to claim that Cain was restored and able to minister again freely.Paul Cain: Restoration Team Letter References External links *Paul Cain Ministries (Official website) Category:1929 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Garland, Texas Category:American Pentecostal pastors Category:Religious leaders from Texas Category:Pentecostals from Texas ","title":"Paul Cain (minister)"},{"id":"26053784","text":"Metro Chinese Weekly, is a Chinese language newspaper based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, published every Friday serving the Greater Philadelphia area including Northern Delaware and Southern New Jersey.

Tsao's goal was to have a publication that was well respected and did not have a poor format, nor low editorial quality found commonly in other ethnic newspapers such as ones that are dominated with advertisement space throughout the paper. Growth Since its inception, the Metro Chinese Weekly has grown each year. Originating with 24 pages at its Bala Cynwyd location, it has grown to over 80 pages and moved to its current larger location in Chinatown. With the increased business for the Chinese oriented newspaper, the Metro Viet News was soon established. Sections Sections within the Metro Chinese Weekly include Community News & Events, Small Businesses, Real Estate, Classifieds, Automotive, Foods & Dining, and Services such as Immigration & Law, Finance, Health. There are also smaller sections such as Chicken Soup for the Soul which entails short stories providing insight and experience.

It is an ornate wooden church built late in the 19th century. It was built shortly after the congregation was established using the \\"open plan\\" interior favored by revivalists of the area as more conducive to worship. A rear wing was built on the church in the 1960s. Besides that modification, it has remained mostly intact since then. In 2004 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The church is situated on the northern corner of Orchard and Mountain streets. The land here begins to slope toward the Catskill peaks west of the village. The church's lot is elevated slightly above street level, giving it a good view of Pakatakan Mountain, the west end of Dry Brook Ridge, and other scenery east of the village. The neighborhood is otherwise residential. A slate walk and stairs lead up to the church from Orchard Street. There is a parking lot on the west side of the church next to Mountain Street. The building itself is a frame structure on a rusticated stone foundation with full basement. Its clapboard-sided walls rise to a steeply pitched gabled metal roof with overhanging eaves. The gable fields have fish-scale shingle siding; the roof's cornice is decorated with scroll-sawn vergeboards in a trefoil pattern and supporting brackets. On the southeast corner is an engaged square two-stage bell tower. It, too, is sided in clapboard with wide wooden cornerboards above paneled pilasters and a wide wooden frieze. On its first stage, two double paneled doors, the main entrance, are topped with a lancet arched transom with tracery on the south and a single lancet window on the east. A circular window with tracery tops both. The upper stage has the belfry, with lancet arched balustrades and paneled corner piers topped with pinnacles above the eaves. The wood-shingled pyramidal roof is topped with a crocket. The south (front) facade has a single tripartite lancet arch stained glass window. A cross-gable gives both side elevations projecting bays with narrow lancet arched windows. Each has a religious motif, such as a Bible, cross, or dove in stained glass at the top. Near the front on the west side is a second double-doored entrance reached by a set of stone steps and, at ground level, a single door providing access to the basement at the corner. The rear addition, a one-story frame block with gabled roof constructed perpendicular to the main block, obscures most of the original north elevation but a circular window depicting Jesus remains. Both entrances lead into small vestibules, where another set of double wooden paneled doors opens into the auditorium, a single open space with curved pews divided into three sets of rows by side aisles, and straight pews at the rear. The walls are sided in beadboard to the chair rail and plaster above. The ceiling follows the gable from the plate but is flat. A platform at the west end is raised off the floor and faced in beadboard as well. A wooden rail with velvet curtain sets off the edges. It has a lectern in the center and space for a choir at the east. Its furniture, apparently original, includes carved Eastlake chairs and a communion table, in addition to a piano and organ. To the west is the community room, a large open space with kitchen and bathrooms partitioned off at the end. History The congregation was organized in 1891 in response to an expressed need in Margaretville for a Presbyterian church, especially with farmers from nearby New Kingston who had worshipped at the church there moving to the village upon retirement. Members met at first in the local Baptist church; a committee was formed to find a church site the following year, 1892. The current parcel, on what was then known as Doolittle Avenue, was selected. Two years later, in 1894, the church was completed and opened. Architecturally, it is similar to other contemporary Presbyterian churches in Delaware County, such as New Kingston and West Kortright, both also listed on the National Register. All are of frame construction, with corner bell towers and an eclectic assortment of features from various Victorian architectural styles. The architect of the Margaretville church is not known, but the design is very similar to one in a popular pattern book of Benjamin Price designs sponsored by the American Methodist Church, lacking only a Sunday school from the original. The tower is an exact replica of the one at St. Mark's Baptist Church in Highland Falls, on the Hudson River. The interior followed the auditorium plan advocated by contemporary Revivalists as ideal for worship. They emphasized the importance of individual conversion in the Christian experience and wanted a space, similar to those found at camp meetings of the era, in which every member of the congregation could make individual face contact with the preacher. The curved pews, radiating aisles and corner entrances maximized interior space, echoing the tents of the camp meeting. The platform brought the preacher down from his high pulpit to closer contact with the worshippers, and gave him space to move around and keep the audience focused. Music, texture and color were also used for the same purpose, and these are seen in the beaded walls and stained glass windows. Since its construction, there have been few changes to the church. The most significant has been the addition of the rear wing in 1964 for Sunday school. It required an entrance cut in the rear of the building, and about was cut off the platform to make room. Lights and carpeting have also been installed.

Originally a grass airstrip, the runway was converted to tarmac in 1952 and used to test aircraft built at Weybridge by Vickers. Flying ceased in 1973 because the runway was too short for large aircraft and was too close to Heathrow. All the structures on the site were removed, except for the runway, and the land was sold back to its principal former owner in 1980 for agricultural use. Wartime promises The land on which this airstrip was built was requisitioned in 1942 during WW2. Land was contributed mainly by the Ockham Park Estate, which at the time owned most of the Village of Ockham, Surrey. Land was taken mainly from Hyde, Stratford and Corsair farms - with land contributed by other tenants. The farm tenants vacated their houses to comply with the government's requirements. It has been generally believed and accepted that HM Government gave an undertaking to restore the land to its pre-war condition when it was returned to its original owners. As the land was not registered at HM Land Registry until 1981, the wartime transfers of the land and any accompanying conditions are not recorded at HM Land Registry.https://eservices.landregistry.gov.uk; title number SY524010 However the matter was referred to in a debate in Parliament at the time the land was sold back to Lord Lytton (the inheritor of the Ockham Park Estate) in 1980 and recorded in Hansard.HL Deb 02 December 1980 vol 415 cc360-82 360 Lord Nugent is recorded in Hansard as saying: \\"The history of the airfield is that it was originally requisitioned in wartime in 1943 for wartime purposes and from that time there has been a clear undertaking that when it was no longer required for these purposes it would be returned for its pre-war agricultural use. Over the intervening years this undertaking has been re-stated from time to time by various Government departments who have been responsible for authorising this special occupancy. The local authorities, the Surrey County Council and the Guildford Borough Council, insisted that when the property was sold back to its pre-war owner, Lord Lytton, all the buildings and hard standings, including the runway, must be removed to ensure a return to its agricultural use before the war and to preserve the general policy of conserving the green belt. More recently, after a good deal of discussion, these conditions were confirmed and a letter was sent by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on 15th November 1977 to the effect that Wisley Airfield would not be sold until both the buildings and the runway had been removed. Further letters were written in 1978 confirming this and, finally, there was a letter from the junior Minister of the Department of the Environment Mr. Ken Marks, on 6th March last year (1979) to the Dorking Member of Parliament, Sir George Sinclair, making the same confirmation. It was thus a great surprise to everybody when the axe fell on 13th July last year with a letter from the PSA stating that the sale would be made with the runway still in situ. This decision by the PSA makes the site available for future use as a commercial airport, in direct breach of all the undertakings over the previous 36 years and in direct breach of the major conservation considerations for the green belt. My noble friend Lord Onslow will deal in more detail with the particular villainies of the breach.\\" The full record of the debate in the House of Lords is recorded in Hansard. The Minutes of Ockham Parish Council confirm that this was the general understanding at the time. Location filming The site is attractive as a film location. As high ground it has superb uninterrupted views south towards the North Downs. These views form a beautiful cinematic backdrop for film makers and have the advantage of being available close to London. These vistas of unspoilt countryside helped re- create the landscape of northern France for filming of the Steven Spielberg film War Horse, which took place in October 2010. Award-winning British film director John Boorman reconstructed a wartime suburban London street on part of the disused runway as the main film set for his autobiographical 1987 film Hope and Glory. Future plans In March 2010, the then-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, John Denham, gave permission to Wharf Land Investments to build a large composting facility on the former airfield but so far this has not been constructed. The new plant would be capable of processing 30,000 tonnes of waste per year and take up . A new road linking from the A3 Ockham roundabout would also be created to enable access. The Government approved the proposal after Surrey County Council did not record a decision within the required time. Local residents and nearby visitor attractions including RHS Garden, Wisley had raised concerns over the daily level of traffic that would visit the plant. In 2014 plans were unveiled for a proposed new town on the green belt land of Wisley Airfield in which between 2,000 and 2,250 new homes would be built. The plans were rejected by Guildford Borough Council and a subsequent Appeal to the Planning Inspectorate also dismissed in June 2018. In March 2020, Taylor Wimpey purchased the site for development and as of August 2020, community consultation events are ongoing. A Q&A; document was formalised in July 2020 where the public asked questions of the developers and responses were formally recorded. Local residents are almost unanimously opposed to development of the site.

The name \\"Patricius\\", of ostentatious Roman origin, suggests that the father had plans for him, up to the imperial throne. Patricius was appointed consul in 459 by the Eastern court. In 470, in an episode of the struggle for power between Aspar and the Isaurian general Zeno, Aspar persuaded the Emperor to appoint Patricius as Caesar and give him in marriage his daughter Leontia. However, the clergy and people of Constantinople believed an Arian was not eligible to become an Emperor, and on hearing of the appointment riots broke out in the city hippodrome, led by the head of the Sleepless Monks, Marcellus. Aspar and Leo had to promise to the bishops that Patricius would convert to Chalcedonian Orthodoxy before becoming Emperor, and that he would marry Leontia only after his conversion. No coins of Patricius as Caesar were issued, and his only act in office was a trip to Alexandria, where he was welcomed with all the honours attributed to a Caesar.Brian Croke, \\"Dynasty and Ethnicity: Emperor Leo and the Eclipse of Aspar\\", Chiron 35 (2005), 193. In 471 an imperial conspiracy caused the death of Aspar and of his eldest son Ardabur: it is possible that Patricius also was killed on this occasion, although some sources report that he recovered from his wounds; in any case, after this episode, Patricius disappears from the sources. The marriage with Leontia was annulled, and later she married Marcian.

The character made his first appearance during the fourteenth series episode \\"Free Fall\\", which was broadcast on 11 December 1999. Patrick is a specialist registrar in the Holby City Hospital emergency department, who attempts to advance his career and attain a consultancy post, whilst having relationships throughout his tenure with SHO Holly Miles, PC Rachel James and Holly's replacement, SHO Lara Stone. He dies from a head injury following a car crash in the sixteenth series episode \\"Past, Present, Future\\" ‚Äì making his final appearance on 16 March 2002. Characterisation and development Kelsey admitted that he was not confident with the medical jargon that he had to say, likening it to learning Russian. He said \\"I haven't a clue what I'm talking about, but there's an adviser who makes sure we don't point at a patient's nose when we're talking about their feet. I'll have to start writing my lines on the patients' plaster casts.\\" Patrick has been described as \\"Casualty bad boy\\" by Marion McMullen of the Coventry Telegraph, who deemed him \\"arrogant, brusque and bad-tempered\\". Kelsey has disclosed that viewers of the show sometimes assume that he shares his character's temperament, but that he does not receive any hostility for it, surmising: \\"It must mean I'm somehow putting across the fact that there really is a nice bloke behind the brick wall that Patrick puts up.\\" Kelsey feels that the only trait of Patrick's which he shares is his \\"dry sense of humour\\". He has assessed that Patrick is \\"very good\\" at his job, but that his bedside manner becomes worse as the series develops. He has stated, however, that: \\"Away from the eyes of his colleagues he is perfectly capable of showing real humanity and care.\\" Kelsey believes that Patrick softened in the show's fifteenth series, but that he reverted to form \\"with a vengeance\\" in series sixteen. He believes that Patrick would be spoiled for the show's viewers if it was ever explained why he behaves the way he does, and prefers playing Patrick as the \\"bad guy\\". Writers created a fictional backstory for Patrick and Senior House Officer Holly Miles (Sandra Huggett), which is revealed when they meet again. The characters had \\"a fling\\" while they were at college together, and Kelsey said that they still fancy each other, so there is a lot of tension. He also expected there would be kissing scenes between them in the future. Discussing Patrick's relationship with PC Rachel James, Kelsey assessed: \\"Spiller and Rachel just fancy each other - it's all about sex.\\" SHO Lara Stone was introduced as a love-interest for Patrick, with producer Mervyn Watson explaining: \\"I felt it would be good to bring Patrick Spiller into contact with a very worthy adversary, a woman who was his equivalent.\\" Christine Stephen-Daly, who plays Lara, has commented that Patrick is Lara's type, but that they clash often as they are so similar, asserting that they are both: \\"arrogant, like getting their own way and enjoy being in control.\\" Stephen- Daly feels that Lara is more \\"caring\\" than Patrick, whose bedside manner \\"leaves a lot to be desired.\\" In an interview with Inside Soap, Kelsey revealed he took Patrick's coffin plaque, which is hung in his bathroom underneath the coffin plaque of his Emmerdale character, Dave Glover. He added he had \\"got a nice set now!\\" Storylines Patrick arrives at Holby City Hospital as the emergency department's new senior registrar. He discovers he is working alongside SHO Holly Miles (Sandra Huggett), who he previously dated. In an attempt to get to know Holly again, he asks her out for a drink on her birthday, but she turns him down. Patrick has an arrogant attitude, which leads to staff nurse Lisa Duffin (Cathy Shipton) reprimanding him, and sees him invited to work a shift with the paramedics after dismissing their importance. When Patrick and Holly become stranded in the snow after Christmas lunch, Patrick reveals that he hates Christmas as his mother died on Christmas Day. He and hospital porter Spencer (Ben Keaton) are held hostage when they become involved in a family feud, but manage to escape unharmed. Patrick grows increasingly concerned for Holly when someone begins stalking her. He offers to give her a lift home after a shift, only to discover his tires have been slashed. Holly is escorted home instead by anaesthetist Tom Harvey (Kieron Forsyth), who is revealed to be her stalker. Holly is later kidnapped by Tom, and Patrick helps to find her. Holly leaves following her ordeal, and Patrick begins dating married policewoman Rachel James (Amy Robbins). He shows an interest in the department's new SHO Lara Stone, who invites him to a Halloween party, but stands him up upon learning that he is already in a relationship. Patrick is turned down for a consultancy post due to his lack of people skills. Rachel dies after being mugged whilst on patrol. Her husband discovers her infidelity and attacks Patrick, attempting to drown him. Lara finds Patrick unconscious and resuscitates him, leaving her boyfriend to stay by Patrick's bedside as he recovers. When Patrick discovers he has been successful in his application for a consultancy in London, he takes Lara on a date to celebrate. Lara is annoyed when Patrick asks her to join him in London. He later proposes to her, but she turns him down. Patrick is involved in a motorway accident, saving six school children from a minibus before being rescued. He and Lara have dinner at a restaurant afterwards, and Patrick decides to turn the position in London down and remain in Holby with Lara. He proposes once more, and this time Lara accepts. Still in shock from the accident, Patrick feels dizzy and collapses. He dies from an intercranial bleed caused by the crash. Lara does not attend his funeral, but later breaks into the crematorium to say goodbye to him. Reception Charlie Catchpole of the Daily Mirror was keen to see a television doctor who did not like people and cited Patrick as an example. Catchpole wrote, \\"he's selfish, cruel, bad- tempered, thick-skinned, homophobic and misogynistic. Just wait till we discover what his bad points are.\\" A reporter for Daily Record noted that Patrick had a \\"lack of charm\\", which got him in trouble.

It grows to a size of wide. Ecology J. singaporensis lives in streams running through undisturbed forest, where it hides under rocks at the stream's edge, or inside aggregations of leaves and detritus. It is mostly nocturnal, feeding on detritus and oligochaete worms which live in the muddy stream bed. Distribution J. singaporensis only lives in Singapore, and has only ever been recorded from two locations. One of these was inside Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, but that population is believed to have been extirpated, as recent surveys have failed to find any examples there. The second population is outside the nature reserve at Bukit Batok, partly on private land, and partly on military land. Acidification of the first stream may have caused the first population to die out, while a lowering of the water table in the second stream threatens the second population. J. singaporensis is one of three freshwater crabs that are endemic to Singapore. The others are Irmengardia johnsoni, and the critically endangered Parathelphusa reticulata. Phylogeny The relatives of J. sinaporensis in the genus Johora are found across the Straits of Johor on the adjacent Malay Peninsula and some offshore islands, making J. singaporensis the southernmost species in the genus. It probably forms the sister group to a clade comprising J. tiomanensis, J. counsilmani, J. murphyi, J. johorensis, J. gapensis and J. intermedia, from which it separated about 5 million years ago, at a time when the eustatic changes in global sea level may have opened up a land bridge to Singapore. Status Johora singaporensis is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Critically Endangered under criteria B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii), which refer to the small size of the remaining populations and the ongoing deterioration of the habitat. The species' restriction to a single small island is likely to have increased the threat of extinction. In 2012, it was included among the world's 100 most threatened species, in a report by the IUCN Species Survival Commission and the Zoological Society of London.

AHECs are nonprofit organizations strategically located within designated regions where health care and health care education needs are not adequately met. An AHEC works within its region to make health care education (including residency and student rotations) locally available, on the premise that health care workers are likely to remain in an area where they train.Gessert and Smith 1981, p. 116 An AHEC also works to support practicing professionals with continuing education programs and other support resources and to attract youth (particularly those from minority and medically underserved populations) to health care professions. An AHEC partners with community organizations and academic institutions to fulfill its mission. According to the National AHEC Organization, in 2015 more than 300 AHEC program offices and centers comprised the national AHEC network. AHECs are distributed across 48 states and the District of Columbia.Blossom 2009 In each state, the central program office(s) associated with a university health science center administrates the program and coordinates the efforts of the state‚Äôs regional AHECs. \\"Organization and staffing of AHECs varies greatly and is dependent on the supporting academic health center and availability of financial resources,\\"Seibert, p. 346 as well as the particular needs of the local area. \\"Each regional center has an office staffed by a center director and a variable number of support staff that may include an education coordinator, librarian, and 1 or more educators or program coordinators.\\"Seibert, p. 346 Some AHECs also operate family medicine residency programs, employing medical personnel and support staff.  Purpose  The National AHEC Organization, the professional association of AHECs, reports that most regional AHECs work in the following program areas:Retrieved Feb 5, 2010 from # Health Careers Recruitment and Preparation: AHECs attempt to expand the health care workforce, including maximizing diversity and facilitating distribution, especially in underserved communities. To achieve this goal, AHECs offer health career camps, science enrichment programs, healthy lifestyle programs, health careers curricula and programs for elementary, middle school, and high school students. These programs introduce students to a wide assortment of health career possibilities, guide them in goal setting and educational planning, and offer science courses to strengthen critical thinking skills. Working with K-12 schools, colleges and community partners, AHECs target both economically disadvantaged students and those from underrepresented minority groups in school programs and summer institutes. # Health Professions Training: AHECs provide community placements, service learning opportunities and clinical experiences for medical, dental, physician assistant, nursing, pharmacy and allied health students and residents in rural and urban underserved communities. AHEC placements (rotations) give them the opportunity to experience health care in settings that differ from typical health science centers. Through interaction with patients in hospitals, community health centers, county health departments, free health care clinics, and local practitioner‚Äôs offices, students and residents can observe the economic and cultural barriers to care and the needs of underserved and ethnically diverse populations in a primary care environment. # Health Professionals Support: AHECs provide accredited continuing education offerings and professional support for health care professionals, especially those practicing in underserved areas. These programs are designed to enhance clinical skills and help maintain professional certifications. Programs also focus on recruitment, placement, and retention activities to address health care workforce needs. # Health and Community Development: AHECs evaluate the health needs of their regions and provide responses to those needs. AHECs develop community health education and health provider training programs in areas with diverse and underserved populations.  History  thumb The AHEC concept and mission originated in a 1970 Carnegie Commission report, Higher Education and the Nation‚Äôs Health: Policies for Medical and Dental Education. The report was concerned with ‚Äúthe serious shortage of professional health manpower, the need for expanding and restructuring the education of professional health personnel, and the vital importance of adapting the education of health manpower to the changes needed for an effective system of delivery of health care in the United States.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. v Among its many recommendations for remedying the problems it detailed, the Carnegie Commission urged a cooperative relationship between communities and health science centers, geographic dispersion of health training centers, shortened training periods for physicians, and creation of ‚Äú126 area health education centers (AHECs) to serve localities without a health science center.‚Äù The Commission also charged universities ‚Äúto cooperate with other agencies in helping to develop more effective health care delivery systems in their communities and surrounding areas.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. 91 These and other recommendations were designed to ‚Äúput essential health services within one hour of driving time for over 95 percent of all Americans and within this same amount of time for all health care personnel.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p 6-9 This landmark report proposed a new model for health care education, noting that ‚ÄúThe United States today faces only one serious manpower shortage, and that is in health care personnel. This shortage can become even more acute as health insurance expands, leading to even more unmet needs and greater cost inflation, unless corrective action is taken now. It takes a long lead time to get more doctors and dentists.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. 2 Map of suggested AHECs in 1970 Carnegie Commission Report. (Source, United States Congress. Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare Appropriations for 1979, p. 465.) |frame The medical education model proposed by the Carnegie Commission in 1970 represented a significant divergence from the Flexner model stimulated by the Flexner Report of 1910 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.Flexner 1910 Based on research by Abraham Flexner during visits to 147 medical schools in the U.S. and eight in Canada, the Carnegie report recommended increasing the quality of medical care by physicians by increasing admittance and graduation standards, extending training periods, and eliminating medical schools that did not meet standards. Proprietary two-year institutions that resembled trade schools for physicians came under particular criticism. In the period following the Flexner Report, the number of medical school graduates and medical schools declined, with the number of medical schools stabilizing at 76 by 1929.Reynolds 2008, p.1004 Conversely, the population was steadily increasing, with a rise of 35 million between 1925 and 1950.Reynolds 2008, p. 1004 Declaring a crisis in meeting the health care needs of the population, the Carnegie Commission report of 1970 called for policies that would increase the health care workforce to fill the growing gaps in health care.Carnegie 1970, p. 4-5 The new model of 1970 called for increased production of health care professionals, an increase in the number of training centers, geographic dispersion of training centers, expanded use and increased production of trained supportive professionals (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and allied health professions to supplement physicians and dentists, and increased diversity of persons trained. ‚ÄúTo serve all the people everywhere,‚Äù the new model called for the following changes:Carnegie 1970, p. 6 # Expanding \\"the number of places for training doctors during this next decade [1970-1980] by 50 percent, and of dentists by 20 percent. Many of these new places should be filled by women and members of minority groups.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. 6 # Expanding the roles and increasing the supply of supportive personnel, noting that ‚ÄúAllied health personnel can be trained more quickly and less expensively than doctors and dentists, and their availability will make possible the better use of the time and skill of doctors and dentists.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. 6 #Increasing the number and dispersion of allied health training centers to include ‚Äúcomprehensive colleges and community colleges.‚ÄùCarnegie 1970, p. 6 593x593px ‚ÄúThe responsibility for administering federal support of AHECs in conformity with the Carnegie model, that is, through contracts with university health centers, was assigned by June to the BHME in DHEW [Bureau of Health Manpower in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, National Institutes of Health] by the Office of Management and Budget‚Ä¶on June 12, 1972 the BHME released a letter of announcement of a program for the support of AHECs, which was sent to all who had requested information regarding the ‚ÄòHealth Manpower Initiative Awards‚Äô of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act o 197l‚Ä¶They were told that the government would refuse to consider any response postmarked later than June 25, 1972‚Ä¶The announcement‚Ä¶stated that contracts would be awarded no later than September 30, 1972.Odegaard 1979 pp. 14-15 ‚Äú(In any consideration of the history of the first 11 AHECs, the short time span between the announcement of the federal program on June 12 and the award of contracts on September 30 should be kept firmly in mind.)‚Äù Odegaard 1979 pp. 15 \\"The national AHEC office not only had to work fast; it was also understaffed from its inception, with only three professional employees to supervise relations with 11 projects widely scattered over the nation.\\" Odegaard 1979 p. 21 The House Appropriations hearing report stated: ‚Äú.certain staffing patterns were noted in BHM which indicate that there may be staffing imbalances among divisions‚Ä¶.the Division of Medicine was administering about four times the amount of funds administered by the Division of Dentistry, but with 24 percent less staff‚Ä¶In sharper contrast, the AHEC staff was administering funds totaling about 44 percent of the funds administered by the Division of Dentistry, but with only 3 percent of the size of the Division of Dentistry staff.‚Äù United States Cong. 1978. p. 422 In a footnote to his report, Odegaard cited sources of information on the AHEC program.

It covers a large area of heathland and woodland encompassing much of the eastern side of the New Forest, but contains no towns, villages, churches, or schools. Overview The parish of Denny Lodge extends from Matley Heath in the north, to King's Copse Inclosure in the south.Donn Small, John Chapman, (1987), Explore the New Forest: an official guide, page 94. Forestry Commission It is bounded by, but does not include, the towns and villages of Ashurst, Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Beaulieu, Fawley and Hythe. The parish is bisected by the South Western Main Line railway from Ashurst to Brockenhurst, and by the B3056 road from Lyndhurst to Beaulieu. The isolated Beaulieu Road railway station is at the centre of the parish, where road and rail cross. The parish is mostly heathland and bogland, intermixed with 20th-century forest inclosures. All of the woodlands are administered by the Forestry Commission as Crown woodland. Many of the forest inclosures on the eastern border of the parish were planted in the 1960s in an attempt to screen the area from the industrial landscape alongside Southampton Water. The parish has no church, no school, no public hall, but does contain four pubs. The parish forms part of the New Forest district of the county of Hampshire. The parish has a population of 315 people living in 140 households. History That people have lived in the area since ancient times is evidenced by the ninety Bronze Age barrows which can be found in the parish. The name of the parish \\"Denny\\" is recorded as Dunie in 1300, Dinne in 1347, and Dynney Walke in 1589.Old Hampshire Gazetteer - Denny Lodge Parish The origin of the name is not known. The lodge, after which the parish is named, is situated near the centre of the parish, and was originally the Groom Keeper's Lodge belonging to the Crown estate, and which later became a Head Forester's residence. Also found near the centre of the parish is a dyked enclosure known as Bishops Dyke, or The Bishop of Winchester's Purlieu.Bishops Dyke, Pastscape The earthwork comprises a bank, around 1 metre high and 4 metres wide, between ditches. The precise purpose of the enclosure is not known - it may have been used as a park for grazing, but the current quality of the grazing is poor. The local legend states that King John and the bishop of Winchester were once riding together in the New Forest when the king laughingly told the bishop that he might have \\"as much land as he could crawl round.\\"Victoria County History of Hampshire: Fawley The bishop, who was rather fat, had a contraption made to help support him, and so managed to \\"crawl\\" round a large area. This became the Bishop's Purlieu. Within the parish there are sites of two medieval hunting lodges, both called Church Place. The first site, close to the B3056 road to Lyndhurst, is indicated by earthwork banks and an external ditch enclosing a raised platform.Church Place, Pastscape The second site is in Churchplace Inclosure near Ashurst on a sandy knoll, and is a square earthwork comprising a broad bank with an outer ditch.Church Place, Pastscape Also near Ashurst are the earthwork remains of a 16th-century saltpetre house.Monument No. 226132, Pastscape It was probably in use for the manufacture of saltpetre when monopolies for its manufacture in England were granted to Germans. It now consists of banks and hollows of various sizes enclosed in a rectangular area about 100 metres by 50 metres. In 1847 the Southampton and Dorchester Railway was built through the New Forest, and Beaulieu Road railway station was opened in what is now the middle of the parish.R.V.J. Butt, (1995). The Directory of Railway Stations, page 30. Yeovil: Patrick Stephens Ltd. The village of Beaulieu is some 3.5 miles (5.5 km) to the south of the station, and as a result, the station remains very rural. The civil parish of Denny Lodge was created in 1868 from extra-parochial parts of the New Forest.Relationships / unit history of DENNY LODGE, www.visionofbritain.org.uk It was enlarged in 1934 with the addition of 862 acres from Brockenhurst parish, and 4722 acres from Colbury parish which was abolished in that year.Relationships / unit history of COLBURY, www.visionofbritain.org.uk References External links *Denny Lodge parish council web site Category:Civil parishes in Hampshire Category:New Forest ","title":"Denny Lodge"},{"id":"26054284","text":"The 3rd Kentucky Infantry Regiment was a volunteer infantry regiment that served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It was part of the First Kentucky Brigade through August 1862. Service The 3rd Kentucky Infantry was organized in July 1861, at Camp Boone in Montgomery, Tennessee, under the command of Colonel Lloyd Tilghman. At the Battle of Shiloh, the regiment was brigaded with the 4th Alabama Infantry, 31st Alabama Infantry, 4th Kentucky Infantry, 6th Kentucky Infantry, and 9th Kentucky Infantry. In a charge on the Union Army lines, 174 men from the 3rd Kentucky Infantry were killed. All regimental officers were either killed or wounded. The regiment remained at Port Hudson, Louisiana, until August 20, 1862, when it was ordered to Jackson, Mississippi. Major General John C. Breckinridge was ordered to take the 4th Kentucky Infantry, 6th Kentucky Infantry, and 9th Kentucky Infantry with him and report to General Braxton Bragg. The 3rd Kentucky Infantry, 7th Kentucky Infantry, and 8th Kentucky Infantry became part of the Army of Tennessee and returned to Port Hudson. The 3rd Kentucky Infantry were en route to Bragg at Tullahoma, Tennessee, when they were ordered to reinforce Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton in the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi. By 1864, the regiment's strength was severely depleted. The 3rd Kentucky Infantry was ordered to report to General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Horses were unavailable, so the men followed Forrest on foot. The Kentucky troops that accompanied Forrest were divided into four brigades. The 3rd Kentucky Infantry was in the third brigade with the 7th Kentucky Infantry, and 8th Kentucky Infantry, commanded by Colonel A. P. Thompson. On March 15, 1864 Forrest moved north toward Paducah, Kentucky. Three miles from Paducah they encountered Union pickets and pushed them back to their camp on the outskirts of town. Under fire from a nearby fort, the Kentuckians moved through the streets of Paducah. The fort was discovered to be impenetrable, and a retreat was ordered. Thompson was killed by cannon fire while leading his troops. Forrest soon returned to Mississippi where the regiment was engaged at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads. At some point in the campaign to Kentucky, the regiment was mounted, becoming the 3rd Kentucky Mounted Infantry. The regiment participated in the Battle of Franklin and surrendered on May 6, 1865, at Columbus, Mississippi. Commanders * Colonel Lloyd Tilghman - promoted to brigadier general * Colonel Albert P.

Description It consists of adjusting the Black‚ÄìScholes theoretical value (BSTV) by the cost of a portfolio which hedges three main risks associated to the volatility of the option: the Vega \\\\mathcal{V}, the Vanna and the Volga. The Vanna is the sensitivity of the Vega with respect to a change in the spot FX rate: \\\\textrm{Vanna} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{V}}{\\\\partial S}. Similarly, the Volga is the sensitivity of the Vega with respect to a change of the implied volatility \\\\sigma: \\\\textrm{Volga}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{V}}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma}. If we consider a smile volatility term structure \\\\sigma(K) with ATM strike K_0, ATM volatility \\\\sigma_0,25-Delta call/put volatilities \\\\sigma(K_{c/p}), and where K_{c/p} are the 25-Delta call/put strikes (obtained by solving the equations \\\\Delta_{ call}(K_c,\\\\sigma(K_c))=1/4 and \\\\Delta_{ put}(K_p,\\\\sigma(K_p))=-1/4 where \\\\Delta_{call/put}(K,\\\\sigma) denotes the Black‚ÄìScholes Delta sensitivity) then the hedging portfolio will be composed of the at-the-money (ATM), risk- reversal (RR) and butterfly (BF) strategies: \\\\begin{align} \\\\textrm{ATM}(K_0) &= \\\\frac12 \\\\left(\\\\textrm{Call}(K_0,\\\\sigma_0) + \\\\textrm{Put}(K_0,\\\\sigma_0)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textrm{RR}(K_c,K_p) &= \\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma(K_c))-\\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma(K_p)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textrm{BF}(K_c,K_p) &= \\\\frac12 \\\\left(\\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma(K_c)) + \\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma(K_p))\\\\right)- \\\\textrm{ATM}(K_0) \\\\end{align} with \\\\textrm{Call}(K,\\\\sigma) the Black‚ÄìScholes price of a call option (similarly for the put). The simplest formulation of the Vanna‚ÄìVolga method suggests that the Vanna‚ÄìVolga price X^{VV} of an exotic instrument X is given by X^{\\\\rm VV} = X ^{BS} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{X}_{vanna}}{\\\\textrm{RR}_{vanna}}}_{w_{RR}} {RR}_{cost} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{X}_{volga}}{\\\\textrm{BF}_{volga}}}_{w_{ BF}} {BF}_{cost} where by X^{ BS} denotes the Black‚ÄìScholes price of the exotic and the Greeks are calculated with ATM volatility and \\\\begin{align} RR_{cost} &=\\\\left[ \\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma(K_c))-\\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma(K_p)) \\\\right] - \\\\left[ \\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma_0)-\\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma_0) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ BF_{cost} &= \\\\frac12 \\\\left[ \\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma(K_c))+\\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma(K_p)) \\\\right] - \\\\frac12 \\\\left[ \\\\textrm{Call}(K_c,\\\\sigma_0)+\\\\textrm{Put}(K_p,\\\\sigma_0) \\\\right] \\\\end{align} These quantities represent a smile cost, namely the difference between the price computed with/without including the smile effect. The rationale behind the above formulation of the Vanna-Volga price is that one can extract the smile cost of an exotic option by measuring the smile cost of a portfolio designed to hedge its Vanna and Volga risks. The reason why one chooses the strategies BF and RR to do this is because they are liquid FX instruments and they carry mainly Volga, and respectively Vanna risks. The weighting factors w_{RR} and w_{BF} represent respectively the amount of RR needed to replicate the option's Vanna, and the amount of BF needed to replicate the option's Volga. The above approach ignores the small (but non-zero) fraction of Volga carried by the RR and the small fraction of Vanna carried by the BF. It further neglects the cost of hedging the Vega risk. This has led to a more general formulation of the Vanna-Volga method in which one considers that within the Black‚ÄìScholes assumptions the exotic option's Vega, Vanna and Volga can be replicated by the weighted sum of three instruments: X_i = w_{ ATM}\\\\, { ATM_i} + w_{ RR}\\\\, {RR_i} + w_{BF}\\\\, {BF_i} \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, i\\\\text{=vega, vanna, volga} where the weightings are obtained by solving the system: \\\\vec{x} = \\\\mathbb{A} \\\\vec{w} with \\\\mathbb{A} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} ATM_{vega} & RR_{vega} & BF_{vega} \\\\\\\\\\\\ ATM_{vanna} & RR_{vanna} & BF_{vanna} \\\\\\\\\\\\ ATM_{volga} & RR_{volga} & BF_{volga} \\\\end{pmatrix} , \\\\vec{w}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} w_{ATM} \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_{RR} \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_{BF} \\\\end{pmatrix} , \\\\vec{x}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} X_{vega} \\\\\\\\\\\\ X_{vanna} \\\\\\\\\\\\ X_{volga} \\\\end{pmatrix} Given this replication, the Vanna‚ÄìVolga method adjusts the BS price of an exotic option by the smile cost of the above weighted sum (note that the ATM smile cost is zero by construction): \\\\begin{align} X^{\\\\rm VV} &= X^{BS} + w_{RR} ({RR}^{mkt}-{RR}^{BS}) + w_{BF} ({BF}^{mkt}-{BF}^{BS}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= X ^{BS} + \\\\vec{x}^T(\\\\mathbb{A}^T)^{-1}\\\\vec{I} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = X ^{BS} + X_{vega} \\\\, \\\\Omega_{vega}+ X_{vanna} \\\\, \\\\Omega_{vanna} + X_{volga} \\\\, \\\\Omega_{volga} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\vec{I} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ {RR}^{mkt} - {RR}^{BS}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {BF}^{mkt} - {BF}^{BS} \\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\Omega_{vega} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Omega_{vanna} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Omega_{volga} \\\\end{pmatrix} = (\\\\mathbb{A}^T)^{-1}\\\\vec{I} The quantities \\\\Omega_i can be interpreted as the market prices attached to a unit amount of Vega, Vanna and Volga, respectively. The resulting correction, however, typically turns out to be too large. Market practitioners thus modify X^{VV} to \\\\begin{align} X^{\\\\rm VV} &= X ^{BS} + p_{vanna} X_{vanna} \\\\Omega_{vanna} + p_{volga} X_{volga} \\\\Omega_{volga} \\\\end{align} The Vega contribution turns out to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the Vanna and Volga terms in all practical situations, hence one neglects it. The terms p_{vanna} and p_{ volga} are put in by-hand and represent factors that ensure the correct behaviour of the price of an exotic option near a barrier: as the knock-out barrier level B of an option is gradually moved toward the spot level S_0, the BSTV price of a knock-out option must be a monotonically decreasing function, converging to zero exactly at B=S_0. Since the Vanna- Volga method is a simple rule-of-thumb and not a rigorous model, there is no guarantee that this will be a priori the case. The attenuation factors are of a different from for the Vanna or the Volga of an instrument. This is because for barrier values close to the spot they behave differently: the Vanna becomes large while, on the contrary, the Volga becomes small. Hence the attenuation factors take the form: \\\\begin{align} p_{\\\\rm vanna} &= a \\\\, \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{\\\\rm volga} &= b + c \\\\gamma \\\\end{align} where \\\\gamma\\\\in[0,1] represents some measure of the barrier(s) vicinity to the spot with the features \\\\begin{align} \\\\gamma=0 \\\\ \\\\ &{for}\\\\ \\\\ S_0\\\\to B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma=1 \\\\ \\\\ &{for}\\\\ \\\\ |S_0-B|\\\\gg 0 \\\\end{align} The coefficients a,b,c are found through calibration of the model to ensure that it reproduces the vanilla smile. Good candidates for \\\\gamma that ensure the appropriate behaviour close to the barriers are the survival probability and the expected first exit time. Both of these quantities offer the desirable property that they vanish close to a barrier. Survival probability The survival probability p_{surv}\\\\in[0,1] refers to the probability that the spot does not touch one or more barrier levels \\\\\\\\{B_i\\\\\\\\}. For example, for a single barrier option we have p_{surv} = \\\\mathbb{E}[ 1_{S_t where \\\\mathrm{NT}(B) is the value of a no-touch option and \\\\mathrm{DF}(t_{\\\\textrm{tod}},t_{\\\\textrm{mat}}) the discount factor between today and maturity. Similarly, for options with two barriers the survival probability is given through the undiscounted value of a double-no-touch option. First-exit time The first exit time (FET) is the minimum between: (i) the time in the future when the spot is expected to exit a barrier zone before maturity, and (ii) maturity, if the spot has not hit any of the barrier levels up to maturity. That is, if we denote the FET by u(S_t,t) then u(S_t,t)=min\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi,T\\\\\\\\} where \\\\phi=\\\\textrm{inf}\\\\\\\\{\\\\ell\\\\in [0,T)\\\\\\\\} such that S_{t+\\\\ell} > H or S_{t+\\\\ell} where L,H are the 'low' vs 'high' barrier levels and S_t the spot of today. The first-exit time is the solution of the following PDE \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(S,t) }{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac12\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u(S,t) }{\\\\partial S^2} + \\\\mu S \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(S,t) }{\\\\partial S} =0 This equation is solved backwards in time starting from the terminal condition u(S,T) = T where T is the time to maturity and boundary conditions u(L,t')=u(H,t')=t'. In case of a single barrier option we use the same PDE with either H\\\\gg S_0 or L\\\\ll S_0. The parameter \\\\mu represents the risk-neutral drift of the underlying stochastic process.

Wilders was accused of criminally insulting religious and ethnic groups and inciting hatred and discrimination. He was found not guilty in June 2011. The leader of the Party for Freedom, Wilders has been the source of great controversy in the Netherlands and abroad for his criticism of Islam and what he describes as the Islamization of the Netherlands. At his trial, he faced five counts of criminal offenses. The first charge was of criminally insulting Muslims because of their religion. The remaining four charges pertained to incitement of hatred and discrimination of Muslims, Moroccans, and other non-Western immigrants because of their race or ethnicity. These charges stemmed from articles Wilders had written between 2006 and 2008, as well as his short film Fitna. These statements included a call for a ban on the Quran, warnings against an \\"Islamic invasion,\\" and a \\"tsunami of Islamization.\\" He also labeled Islam a fascist religion, described Dutch-Moroccan youths as violent, and compared the Quran with Hitler's Mein Kampf. He has also referred to Mohammed as \\"the devil.\\" The judges in the first trial were removed due to perceived bias against Wilders, so a retrial began in February 2011. The Dutch Public Prosecution Service, after initially refusing to prosecute Wilders because it did not consider his statements illegal, was ordered by a court of appeal to prosecute him nonetheless. During the process, they argued that Wilders should be acquitted on all counts. On 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted of all charges, with Judge Marcel van Oosten noting that his statements, although \\"gross and denigrating,\\" had not given rise to hatred against Muslims, and as such were \\"acceptable within the context of public debate.\\" Van Oosten also said, however, that Wilders's statements were on the edge of legal acceptability. Background According to Article 71 of the Dutch Constitution, as an MP, Wilders has immunity with regard to anything he says in or writes to parliament.Constitution of the Kingdom of The Netherlands Article 71 (English translation; \\"States General\\" = Dutch parliament): \\"Article 71 Members of the States General, Ministers, State Secretaries and other persons taking part in deliberations may not be prosecuted or otherwise held liable in law for anything they say during the sittings of the States General or of its committees or for anything they submit to them in writing.\\" However, this protection does not extend to opinions expressed outside of parliament, allowing for prosecution based on his criticism of Islam. The possibility that Wilders could be prosecuted became clear between 2007 and 2010, when protests against alleged insults and incitement to hatred resulted in his criminal prosecution by the district attorney in Amsterdam. On 3 February 2010, the Amsterdam court ruled itself to be competent on the charges against Wilders. Some of his public comments, as well as some of the content of Wilders' film Fitna, have been protested by agencies such as the Dutch anti-discrimination group Nederland Bekent Kleur (). On 15 August 2007, a representative of the public prosecution service in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports filed against Wilders were being considered. Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 were dropped, with the public prosecution stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: \\"That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate.\\" Prosecution Decision to try The plaintiffs (Nederlands Bekent Kleur, organisations of Turkish, Moroccan and Antillean people in the Netherlands, and an organization of mosques) appealed against the prosecution's decision to not pursue the case and on 21 January 2009, a three- judge court of appeal ordered the public prosecutor to try Wilders. Their statement said that \\"[i]n a democratic system, hate speech is considered so serious that it is in the general interest to... draw a clear line\\" and that \\"the court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders\\". If convicted, he could have been sentenced for up to 16 months of jail time or a fine of ‚Ç¨9866.67. His lawyer Bram Moszkowicz tried to have the appeal overturned at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, but the Supreme Court's Procurator General decided he would not hear the case. On 4 December 2009, Wilders was ordered to appear before the court on 20 January 2010 to defend himself against the charges of group insult of Muslims, fomenting hate and discrimination against Muslims because of their religion, and fomenting hate and discrimination against non-Western foreigners or Moroccans because of their race. On 11 January 2010, the Dutch public prosecution service brought additional charges against him, charging him with hatred against Moroccans and non-Western immigrants. On 13 January 2010, the Amsterdam court rejected, after a closed pretrial hearing, submissions by Wilders that one of the charges against him should be dropped or reduced. He argued that he had only criticized Islam and not its adherents, and that the charge of insulting Muslims as a group should not stand. His lawyer Moszkowicz petitioned judges to drop the charge of insulting Muslims as a group, which he said would have little chance of winning a conviction. He cited a 2009 Dutch Supreme Court ruling that found insulting a religion is not the same as insulting followers of that religion, and not punishable under the current hate speech laws. The judge said that the indictment only put into practice an earlier court ruling that he should stand trial and that the defense had not put forward any new evidence to overturn the ruling. Charges In total, Wilders was charged with the following five counts: #Group insult #Inciting hatred against Muslims because of their religion #Inciting discrimination against Muslims because of their religion #Inciting hatred against non-western immigrants and Moroccans because of their race #Inciting discrimination against non-western immigrants and Moroccans because of their race The first charge is based on article 137c of the Dutch criminal code, and the rest are based on article 137d, both concerning hate speech. First trial Court proceedings began on 20 January 2010, with Wilders accused of discrimination on the basis of religion and spreading hate. On the eve of his trial, Wilders told journalists he expected to be acquitted, saying, \\"I have done nothing wrong.\\" After receiving the summons, he commented that he considered the prosecution as \\"a political trial.\\" He also announced his intention to call various experts to act as witnesses. On the first day of the trial, Wilders gave a speech invoking Thomas Jefferson, among others. When the trial resumed on 3 February, the judges decided who would be allowed to testify as witnesses. Wilders's desired witness list consisted of various experts on both the law and Islam, including university professors, radical imams, and Mohammed Bouyeri, the man who murdered filmmaker Theo van Gogh. Other individuals on the list included Afshin Ellian, a Dutch-Iranian professor at Leiden University; Hans Jansen, a Dutch scholar of Islam; Wafa Sultan, a Syrian American physician; Raphael Israeli, a Moroccan-Israeli professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Andrew G. Bostom, an American professor at Alpert Medical School of Brown University; Robert Spencer, an American author and blogger; and Ayatollahs Ahmad Jannati and Mohammad Yazdii, members of the Iranian Guardian Council. The court rejected 15 of Wilders's 18 desired witnesses, ruling that Bouyeri and other Muslim extremists would not be allowed to testify in the case. The court accepted only the three Islam experts whom Wilders had called, rejecting the lawyers and Islamic extremists. The court also rejected the plea by Wilders's lawyer to transfer the case to the Supreme Court due to Wilders status as an MP. The court overruled this objection against its jurisdiction. \\"Parliamentary immunity does not extend to what a public representative says or writes outside of parliamentary gatherings.\\" said Jan Moors, one of the judges at the Amsterdam court. Wilders consequently argued that he was being denied his right to a fair trial. During the trial it became clear that the prosecutors were arguing for Wilders to be acquitted on all five counts. On 22 October 2010, when the trial was nearing its conclusion, Wilders's attorney Moszkowicz asked for the judges to be substituted because of a perceived bias against his client. Moszkowicz had unsuccessfully asked for substitution before. The second request was made because Tom Schalken, one of the judges in the court of appeal case that ordered the prosecution of Wilders on 21 January 2009 had allegedly tried to convince a witness in the main trial, Hans Jansen, that the trial was justified. Moszkowicz wanted to hear this witness immediately regarding the alleged conflict of interest, but the court decided it would not hear the witness. The substitution chamber decided that this decision had an appearance of bias and awarded the substitution, thereby ordering a retrial.Geert Wilders hate speech trial collapses in Netherlands, by Ian Traynor, Europe editor, guardian.co.uk, 22 October 2010 In the meantime, the alleged victims argued to the court of appeal that the prosecutors, by arguing for acquittal, had not fulfilled the court's order that Wilders had to be prosecuted, and that they should be replaced in the retrial. On 4 February 2011, the court of appeal decided against this complaint. Second trial On 7 February 2011, the retrial started. In the period between the trials, police investigated the claims that appellate judge Tom Schalken had tried to influence witness Hans Jansen. The new trial began with hearing the witnesses Schalken, Jansen, and Bertus Hendriks; the latter had hosted the dinner party at which Schalken spoke to Jansen. Moszkowicz argued that the trial against Geert Wilders could not continue because the witness had been influenced. During the hearing of Hendriks, Moszkowicz claimed that Hendriks had committed perjury; when the judges did not agree, Moszkowicz tried unsuccessfully to have them substituted as well. On 23 May 2011, the judges decided that although Schalken should not have talked to Jansen, the witness had not been influenced, and the case could continue. As in the first trial, the public prosecution argued that Wilders should be acquitted on all counts. On 1 June the hearings concluded, with Geert Wilders asking the judges to find him not guilty. On 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted by the court of all charges, because his statements were, as presiding judge Marcel van Oosten put it, \\"acceptable within the context of public debate.\\" Because both the public prosecutor and the defense requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed, although some thought the plaintiffs might try to take the case before the European Court of Human Rights. Reactions Described by Haaretz as \\"a high-profile affair,\\" the trial attracted international attention. The prosecution was condemned by editorials in The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, The Washington Times, The American Spectator, Forbes, The Dallas Morning News, City Journal, Montreal Gazette, The Jerusalem Post, Canada.com, and The Australian. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized it in front of the Mayor of Amsterdam and the Dutch Ambassador to the United States. The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy called the case \\"alarming.\\" The Dutch center-left Labour party welcomed the court's 2009 decision to prosecute Wilders, as did the Socialist Party. The Muslims and Government Consultative Body said that \\"We are positive that this will contribute to a more respectful tone to the public debate.\\" Abdelmajid Khairoun, Dutch Muslim Council chairman, expressed support, stating that \\"Muslim youngsters who make anti- Semitic remarks are prosecuted but Wilders' anti-Islamic remarks go unpunished\\". The American Middle East Forum set up a legal defense fund for Wilders. The Dutch writer and historian Ian Buruma, writing in an op-ed published in the New York Times, argued that \\"for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich.\\" A February 2009 survey by Angus Reid Global Monitor found that Dutch public opinion was deeply split on the prosecution, with 50% supporting Wilders and 43% opposed. However, public support for the Party for Freedom vastly increased since Wilders's legal troubles began, virtually tying with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy as the third most popular national party. According to Radio Netherlands, \\"Dutch politicians themselves seem to be keeping quiet on the issue; they are probably worried that media attention will only serve to make the controversial politician more popular.\\" Robert Spencer, creator of Jihad Watch and author of articles and books relating to Islam and Islamic terrorism, wrote on National Review Online that \\"The Geert Wilders trial ought to be an international media event; seldom has any court case anywhere had such enormous implications for the future of the free world.\\" Free speech Wilders believed that his freedom of speech and traditional European freedoms were the primary subject of the trial. In February 2010, in an interview with Israel National Radio, Wilders said he was \\"fighting for one thing: the preservation of our culture, which is based on Christianity, Judaism and humanism ‚Äì and not on Islam... While Islamization of our society grows, the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem, namely, the impending loss of our freedom. I am fighting not against Moslems, but against the influx of a totalitarian ideology called Islam.\\" He has cited Gregorius Nekschot, a similar case of Islam related free-speech restrictions, on his website. After being cleared of all charges, Wilders commented that the victory was not only an acquittal for himself, but a victory for freedom of expression in the Netherlands. Commentators believed that the plaintiffs may attempt to bring their case before the European Court of Human Rights. Gerard Spong, a lawyer instrumental in getting the case heard, expressed his disappointment with the verdict, seeing the judge's ruling based on \\"public context\\" as vague. Theo de Roos, professor of law at the Tilburg University, saw the case as a precedent for ethnic incitement in Dutch law, prohibiting only actual threats.

They were formed in 2005 by Ben Dickey and Drew Mills. The current band consists of Dickey (vocals, guitar, piano) and Mills (vocals, guitar), Clay Simmons (bass guitar), Patrick Marsceill (drums), Sam Murphy (guitar), and Tracy Stanton (saxophone, percussion, keyboard).  Biography  Blood Feathers started as a live performance outlet for songwriters Ben Dickey and Drew Mills to showcase new material they had written. Having met through the Philadelphia music scene in the 1990s, by 2005, both Dickey and Mills' bands (Amen Booze Rooster and Aspera, respectively) had broken up. Dickey and Mills started performing new material, folk and soul covers together at local open mic nights under the moniker Dickey Mills. Eventually having an album's worth of material, the two went into studio with local Philadelphia friends, Mickey Walker and Quentin Stoltzfus (both of the band Mazarin). With the assistance of Philadelphia producer Brian McTear, the group recorded what would become Blood Feathers debut, Curse and Praise. Walker and Stoltzfus performed as the band's rhythm section on the recording and would eventually play in a revolving cast of musicians that comprised the early Blood Feathers live show. Curse & Praise was released on August 8, 2006 on the Philadelphia-based label, Box Theory Records. Magnet Magazine wrote of the album, \\"Drew Mill's quavering voice -- with its pinch of Donovan, gram of Marc Bolan and healthy dose of Lawrence -- immediately conjures psychedelic fields and starry skies.\\". Despite gaining favorable editorial reviews, the album failed to elevate the band into the national spotlight. In 2007, after failing to garner national support for their debut, Dickey and Mills planned to take time off from their home town of Philadelphia and relocate to Prescott, Arizona. > The guitarist-songwriters decided to regroup, seeking a bigger piece of the > sky in Prescott, Arizona, where they planned to hone their songwriting > alliance while working at a restaurant owned by their manager, Newt Lynn. > Mills never made it due to personal reasons, but Dickey says he spent a > beneficial 18 Southwestern months working in the kitchen by day and as a > guitarist in a Bob Wills cover band called The Prescott Playboys by night. > \\"I was 30 years younger than everybody else in the band,\\" Dickey, 32, says > with a measure of pride. \\"The guy I replaced played in Patsy Cline's band. > It was great for me as a musician.\\" Dickey wasn't about to give up on Blood > Feathers, however.

Upon Dickey's return from Arizona, Blood Feathers established a full band line up, consisting of Mills and Dickey with the addition of Patrick Marsceill on the drums (formerly of The A-Sides), Tracy Stanton(formerly of Bardo Pond) on the saxophone, percussion, and keyboards, and Sam Murphy on the guitar (an old Arkansas friend of Dickey's who also plays in the Philadelphia band Pink Skull). On December 8, 2009, Blood Feathers second album, Goodness Gracious, was released digitally on Philebrity Label. Vinyl versions of this album are anticipated to be released in March 2010. Since the album has been available, it has gained national attention by consistent airplay on the nationally syndicated NPR program World Cafe. The first single off Goodness Gracious, \\"Don't Know You At All\\" was also featured on an Urban Outfitters musical compilation available from their website and on iTunes.

For example, a modern survey should list a distance of one-foot and six-inches as 1.50 feet. Historically lengths were also measured as chain (length) and rod (length). A rod is also known as a pole, both being 16.5 feet. A chain is most commonly 66 feet (4 poles) but can also be 33 feet (2 poles).

Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 176. Attidius found refuge in the court of Mithridates VI of Pontus, and the two men were friends for many years. The sole evidence for Attidius's life and career is a passage by the Greek historian Appian in his Mithridatic Wars.Appian, Mithridatic Wars 90. Around 67 BC, during the Third Mithridatic War, Attidius joined a conspiracy to assassinate Mithridates. The plot was discovered, and the Pontic king put him to death. In recognition of his rank, Mithridates forbade his torture.Gordon P. Kelly, A History of Exile in the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 188. The other conspirators suffered protracted torture, but the freedmen attached to Attidius were granted clemency by the king, because they were judged to have acted out of obligation to their patron.George Long, Decline of the Roman Republic (London, 1869), vol. 3, p. 100. Attidius or Atilius? The friend of Mithridates is the only senator known to have the nomen Attidius during the Republic, and since other names in Appian are problematic, his ·ºàœÑœÑŒØŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ has been read also as Attilius. It has been arguedKelly, History of Exile, p. 188. that \\"Attidius\\" could in fact be Marcus Atilius Bulbus, a corrupt juryman who, according to Cicero,Cicero, Pro Cluentio 97 and 103, In Verrem 39. accepted bribes in the trial of Statius Albius Oppianicus in 74 BC. Atilius Bulbus was himself put on trial sometime between 74 and 70 BC and charged under the Lex Cornelia de maiestate,Gruen, Last Generation, p. 525. a capital crime, for attempting to incite the legion commanded by Gaius Cosconius in Illyria.Cicero, 1 In Verrem 39, 2 In Verrem 2.79, Pro Cluentio 71. 72, 75, 97; Alexander, Trials, p. 80. Except during proscriptions and civil wars, the Romans of the Republic preferred the punishment of exile to execution for men of rank.\\"There are relatively few recorded instances of death sentences actually being carried out against Roman citizens during the Republican period,\\" notes Kelly, History of Exile, p. 1 online. It has been conjectured that the military efforts of Atilius in Illyria were on behalf of either Aemilius Lepidus, who along with Marcus Brutus (consul 77 BC) attempted to resist the senatorial oligarchy,Ronald Syme, \\"Rome and the Balkans, 80 BC‚ÄìAD 14,\\" in The Provincial at Rome (University of Exeter Press, 1999), p. 168 online. or Quintus Sertorius and his Hispanian government in exile. If Atilius is to be identified with Attidius, a Sertorian connection could explain how the exile ended up in the court of Mithridates,For further discussion of Sertorians at the Pontic court, see Marcus Marius (quaestor 76 BC). but this reconstruction of events is \\"highly speculative\\".As its author himself acknowledges; see Kelly, History of Exile, p. 188. Atilius Bulbus came from \\"one of the most famous houses of the plebeian nobility, now in decay and showing no more consuls.\\" Ronald Syme suggested that he might be a descendant of the M. Atilius Bulbus who was consul in 245 and 235 BC. Cato, the brother-in-law of Marcus Brutus, married an Atilia, indicating ties between the Bruti and Atilii that might point toward Bulbus's motives in Illyria.Syme, Rome and the Balkans, p. 168.

Margie was a box-office hit, ranking in the top 15 highest-grossing films of the year, and established Crain as an important Fox star. Although not a true movie musical (as it uses period recordings, with only one song being partially performed by a character in the film), it is sometimes classified with musicals due to the large number of 1920s-era popular songs incorporated as nostalgic background in the film. The film was the basis for the 1961 television sitcom Margie, featuring Cynthia Pepper. Plot In 1946, Margie (Jeanne Crain) is a housewife reminiscing about her high school days with her own teenage daughter, who has just discovered her mother's old photo album in the attic. In a flashback to the 1920s, Margie is a high-spirited girl living with her dominant but good-hearted Grandmother McSweeney (Esther Dale). Her mother has died and her father (Hobart Cavanaugh), the local mortician, lives apart from Margie and her grandmother, only visiting on Wednesday due to his busy work schedule, and sometimes not even staying long enough to see his daughter. The youngest girl in her class, Margie does very well at her schoolwork, but she is not socially adept and wears old-fashioned clothing, including bloomers that frequently fall down. By contrast, her pretty and fashionable neighbor Marybelle Tenor (Barbara Lawrence) wears short skirts and lipstick and dates the popular but dimwitted captain of the football team, Johnny Green (Conrad Janis). Margie secretly has a crush on Johnny, but he regards her as a \\"pain in the neck\\". When Margie meets the handsome new French teacher at her high school, Professor Ralph Fontayne (Glenn Langan), she becomes even more smitten with him, and he seems to take an interest in her as well. Meanwhile, Margie's bumbling classmate Roy Hornsdale (Alan Young) is in love with her, and constantly attempts to court her despite her disinterest in him. Margie participates in a school debate and is excited that both her father and Mr. Fontayne attend. Margie's father is impressed with her debating skills and proud of her. Afterwards, at the skating rink, Margie gets a chance to skate with Johnny but while they are skating, her bloomers fall down. Mr. Fontayne, who is looking on, saves her from public embarrassment by hiding them and tactfully returning them to her later. When the big senior dance approaches, Margie plans to attend with Roy, but at the last minute Roy catches a cold and is forced to cancel, leaving Margie without an escort. Margie is too embarrassed to go alone or tell Marybelle, who is going with Johnny, that she doesn't have a date, and instead gives Marybelle the impression that Mr. Fontayne is taking her to the dance. Margie's grandmother meanwhile secretly arranges for her father to cancel a business meeting and take his daughter to the dance, but tells Margie only that a man \\"much older than 15\\" called to take her to the dance and withholds the man's identity to surprise Margie. When Mr. Fontayne comes to the house with a corsage, Margie thinks he is her date and is thrilled that her fantasy came true, until she sees by the florist's card that the corsage was intended for Mr. Fontayne's actual date, the school librarian Miss Palmer (Lynn Bari). Mr. Fontayne only stopped by to drop off Margie's French composition and compliment her on her good work, although he privately confesses to her grandmother that he would rather be taking Margie to the dance instead of Miss Palmer. Margie is at first devastated, but when her actual surprise date ‚Äî her father ‚Äî arrives to escort her to the dance, she is happy again. At the dance, Mr. Fontayne dances with Margie and tells her he would rather dance with her than anyone else, and she even attracts the attention of Johnny. Returning to the 1940s, it turns out Margie married Mr. Fontayne, who is now the principal at the same high school.

Todd as Joyce, Margie's teenage daughter * Hattie McDaniel as Cynthia The film marked the screen debut of Alan Young, who later appeared as \\"Wilbur Post\\" on the 1960s television series Mr. Ed. Production In January 1945, 20th Century Fox paid $12,500 for a story written by Ruth McKenney and her husband Richard Bransten. For the screenplay adaption, F. Hugh Herbert used elements from the film Girls' Dormitory (1936). The male lead was initially offered to Cornel Wilde, but he refused it and was put on suspension by the studio. Next, Richard Jaeckel was announced as the male lead, but he was eventually replaced by Glenn Langan. Set decorations include the 1794 Thomas Lawrence painting, Pinkie, which can be seen in the home of Margie and her grandmother, located on the wall in the sitting room. The film was shot in Reno, Nevada. The exteriors of \\"Central High\\" are actually the University of Nevada, Reno. In some shots, the snow-covered Sierras can be seen. This film is considered an excellent example of the Technicolor film process. A number of popular songs from the 1920s are used in the film, including \\"Margie\\", \\"At Sundown\\", \\"My Time Is Your Time\\" (sung by Rudy Vall√©e), \\"A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You\\", \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\", \\"Three O'Clock in the Morning\\", \\"April Showers\\", \\"The Charleston\\", \\"Wonderful One\\", and \\"Ain't She Sweet\\".

Some of the pueblo people fled to Hopi territory in Arizona while others followed Spanish colonists as they retreated southward. The Spanish and their Pueblo allies eventually settled in El Paso del Norte (present day El Paso, TX) where they established the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and where the Ysleta Mission was founded.\\"Library of Congress, Historic American Building Survey record for Ysleta Mission\\" Retrieved 27 March 2010 The spelling of Ysleta with a \\"Y\\" and the term del Sur (south) was to differentiate the new settlement from the mother pueblo, Isleta. In 1682, the Tigua people built a permanent structure out of adobe and, in October of that year, the building was formally dedicated by Bishop Salpointe of Tucson and named La Misi√≥n de Corpus Christi de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur in honor of the Tigua's patron saint, Saint Anthony (San Antonio). Over the next two centuries the mission was relocated several times due to flooding of the Rio Grande. In 1829 one such flood washed away the structure. The flood also resulted in the river cutting a new course further south and the area where the church had been located was no longer considered a part of Mexico but of the Republic of Texas. In 1897 the structure was remodeled and the now familiar gables and bee-hive bell tower were added. A fire in 1907, caused by chemicals stored in the bell tower to repel bats, resulted in massive damage to the building. The church was rebuilt in 1908 and remains much the same today. The church prospered and in 1918 Our Lady of Mount Carmel School was established and remained open until 2005 when the church closed it. The Texas Historical Commission erected historical markers at the Ysleta Mission in the following years: 1936 ‚Äì First mission and pueblo in Texas,\\"Texas Historical Commission-First Mission and Pueblo in Texas\\" Retrieved 28 March 2010 1962 ‚Äì Site of first mission in Texas, and 1970 ‚Äì Oldest mission in Texas. On July 31, 1972, the Ysleta Mission was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The mission today In 1990 members of the community began efforts to restore and preserve the Ysleta and Socorro missions as well as the Presidio Chapel of San Elizario, Texas. That same year the City and County governments of El Paso formed the Office of Heritage Tourism and received technical support for the project from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the form of a grant. The newly created Office of Heritage Tourism established a board with representatives from various local governments, the Catholic Diocese, and private organizations who had been working separately on projects to restore the missions. Two Mexican architects with expertise in restoring adobe buildings were retained with the help of a grant from the National Park Service and they developed a comprehensive restoration plan which was the basis upon which Bishop Armando Ochoa began a much publicized fund raising effort to pay for the restorations. The two missions and chapel comprise The El Paso Mission Trail, which stretches approximately 9 miles along Socorro Rd. (FM 258) and is considered to be a part of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (The Royal Road to the Interior). The Tigua people continue to be closely associated with the church and remain loyal to their patron saint, Saint Anthony of Padua. The Tigua feast day of San Antonio is observed on June 13, with a morning mass followed by traditional dancing. Directly adjacent to the church, the Tiguas built a large gaming center called Speaking Rock Casino; however, after a few years the state government of Texas successfully challenged its legality and it was subsequently closed down. It was later reopened but no longer offered casino style gaming. The Tigua Tribal Government offices are located a short distance from the church as is the Tigua Cultural Center. The church is currently owned by the Catholic Diocese of El Paso and staffed by Conventual Franciscans. For nearly a century, the church has hosted the Ysleta Mission Festival on the second weekend of July . This three-day event is one of El Paso's largest and proceeds from the event help fund the maintenance and preservation of the Ysleta Mission. In the 1960s a newer church building was constructed to accommodate the growing number of parishioners. The old church is now primarily reserved for special occasions such as weddings, quincea√±eras, and baptisms.

The film is set in a dystopian Neo Paris in which people have embraced virtual reality completely. Plot In the year 2047 more than 75% of the population, known as the Connected, spend the majority of their lives living in online virtual games (called verses). The world is dominated by a few corporations and politicians are happy to keep the masses docile through online games. After 148 gamers are killed in a computer virus attack perpetrated by terrorist group Necromancers, shadow agent Nash (Mike Dopud) is hired by Synternis Corporation operative Dina (Jane Badler) to track and eliminate the attackers. Nash is a hybrid, spending half his time online and half in the real world. He is haunted by the death of his love Helena in a virus attack a few years back. Nash takes the help of a hacker Morel (Maximilien Poullein), Helena's brother, to hack security video from Interpol servers. Meanwhile Synternis covers up the attack to avoid any involvement of Interpol. Nash infiltrates a Necromancer cell by taking over the online avatar of one of their members. There he learns that the goal of Necromancers is to break people out of virtual reality by any means. Hacking attempts of Morel draw the attention of Interpol, which leads to Interpol intimidating him. Nash is ambushed at his flat by Camylle (Kaya Blocksage), leader of the Necromancers. She tells him that Synternis Corporation is responsible for the death of Helena, as they first developed the virus capable of killing players while online. Camylle asks Nash to help in her plan to free everyone by helping in inserting the virus through a server at Synternis headquarters. This virus will systematically shut down all the verses forcing people to confront the real world. Nash contemplates whether it is wise to force the unwilling populace into freedom. A furious mob of disconnected people lynches the necromancers. Dina severs all the ties between Synternis and Nash on account of his betrayal. She also claims that he was misled and the virus that killed Helena was indeed launched by Necromancers and that Helena was a mole of Synternis inside the Necromancers; he doesn't know which version to believe. To escape his painful memories Nash becomes one of the Connected using his fortune to add features and comforts to his online avatar. He reasons that since his brain can't distinguish between real and virtual, the online life is as good as real.

The L27 domain is a protein interaction module that exists in a large family of scaffold proteins, functioning as an organisation centre of large protein assemblies required for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. L27 domains form specific heterotetrameric complexes, in which each domain contains three alpha-helices. The L27_2 domain is a protein-protein interaction domain capable of organising scaffold proteins into supramolecular assemblies by formation of heteromeric L27_2 domain complexes. L27_2 domain-mediated protein assemblies have been shown to play essential roles in cellular processes including asymmetric cell division, establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and clustering of receptors and ion channels. Members of this family form specific heterotetrameric complexes, in which each domain contains three alpha-helices. The two N-terminal helices of each L27_2 domain pack together to form a tight, four- helix bundle in the heterodimer, whilst the third helix of each L27_2 domain forms another four-helix bundle that assembles the two units of the heterodimer into a tetramer. The L27_N domain is often found at the N-terminus of the L27 domain. It plays a role in the biogenesis of tight junctions and in the establishment of cell polarity in epithelial cells. Each L27_N domain consists of three alpha-helices, the first two of which form an antiparallel coiled-coil. Two L27 domains come together to form a four-helical bundle with the antiparallel coiled-coils formed by the first two helices. The third helix of each domain forms another coiled-coil packing at one end of the four-helix bundle, creating a large hydrophobic interface: the hydrophobic interactions are the major force that drives heterodimer formation.

Damascius described him as a brilliant poet, Malchus as an acute politician, but ugly, arrogant, unscrupulous and treacherous; Rhetorius, an Egyptian astrologer, called him a charlatan and a libertine. He has been compared to Claudian, as both these poets enjoyed eight years of political power at the side of usurpers. He is considered the last pagan poet.Nagy, pp. 499-500, 508. His life is known with unusual precision, as his horoscope calculated by Rhetorius in the early sixth century has been found.The horoscope is translated and commented in O. Neugebauer, H. B. Van Hoesen, Greek Horoscopes, Diane Publishing, 1987, , pp. 140-141.  Biography   Education  Pamprepius was born in Egypt, at Panopolis, near Thebes, on 29 September 440; the discovery of a horoscope, which has been identified with that of Pamprepius, let us know that he was born at 15:48.Nagy, p. 486. He was ugly, but he had considerable intellectual qualities. He devoted himself to literature, especially to poetry; probably he belonged to the school of Nonnus of Panopolis, a native of his own city. He became very famous as a poet in his country. At the age of 33 years, in 473, he moved to Greece, where he spent much time in Athens, marrying a rich woman and becoming a professor of grammar (philology). At the same time he studied philosophy under the neo-Platonic philosopher Proclus, who had, among his students, the Roman general Marcellinus, the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius, and the consuls Illustrius Pusaeus and Messius Phoebus Severus.O'Meara, Dominic, Platonopolis: Platonic Political Philosophy in Late Antiquity, Oxford University Press, 2003, , p. 21. In Athens he had found a patron in Theagenes, an important citizen of Athens, possibly a magistrate, who was also a supporter of Proclus'. In his honour Pamprepius composed a poem. However, Pamprepius later came into conflict with Theagenes, even suffering physical damages, which Theagenes investigated in a case held against Pamprepius. It is possible that the reason for this attack was linked to his ambition to become the most famous of all philosophers but Proclus. Because of his clash with Theagenes, he was obliged to leave Athens in haste.Edward Watts, City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria, University of California Press, 2008, , pp. 119-120; Nagy, p. 30..  Collaborator of Illus  From Athens he went to Constantinople, where he arrived in May 476 (at the age of 35 years 8 months). Here he introduced himself as a magician or an initiator and achieved fame thanks to his culture and his professional skills. An officer called Marsus introduced him to the powerful Illus, the magister militum of the emperor Zeno; all three of these men were Isaurians. Pamprepius earned Illus' favour reading out a speech on the soul; Illus used his own influence to have Pamprepius appointed professor, defraying the cost of his public salary with his personal funds, and sending him a number of students. Pamprepius' close relationship with and influence over Illus again inspired the envy of many. His reputation suffered from his practice of paganism and divination in the heavily Christian city of Constantinople. Among his enemies were emperor Zeno and the Dowager Empress Verina (wife of Zeno's father-in-law and predecessor). Once, while Illus was travelling to his native Isauria, Pamprepius was sentenced to exile by the Emperor on charges of attempting to use his divination skills in favour of Illus and against Zeno; he was therefore sent to Pergamum. Illus, who was well aware that his own friendship had led to the poet's exile, welcomed Pamprepius at his own home and, on his return to the capital, brought Pamprepius back with him. Illus had Pamprepius appointed senator, honorary consul,Rhetorius talks about the consulate, which was probably honorary, and the patriciate. John of Antioch (fragment 211.3) records the quaestorship and the patriciate (Robert A. Kaster, Guardians of Language: The Grammarian and Society in Late Antiquity, University of California Press, 1997, , p. 330). quaestor sacri palatii and, after some time, patricius, a most prestigious position. In 479 Marcian, son of the late Western Emperor Anthemius and brother of Zeno, revolted and laid siege to the Eastern Emperor in Constantinople. Initially, Illus lost heart, but Pamprepius declared that providence was on their side, and when Illus captured the rebels, Pamprepius gained a reputation for clairvoyance. Since then, Illus always kept Pamprepius close to him and consulted him frequently. The two spent the winter of 479/480 at Nicaea, as Pamprepius was unpopular in Constantinople.  Revolt against Zeno  In late 481 or early 482, Pamprepius went to Egypt, meeting representatives of the pagan community at Alexandria. He tried to persuade them to help him in a revolt against Zeno, showing them oracles and prophecies that foretold the imminent collapse of Christianity; however, he did not gain their support. He also took part in the disputes between the various Christian sects, supporting the patriarchal candidacy of the Nicene John Talaia against the Monophysite Peter Mongus, but again he was unsuccessful.Alois Grillmeier et al., Christ in Christian Tradition, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1975, , pp. 91-92. The power plays at court‚Äîinvolving Zeno, Verina, Illus and Ariadne, daughter of Verina and wife of Zeno‚Äîdegenerated into a riot, in which Illus was the target of two assassination attempts by Verina and Ariadne. In 484, as he had been appointed magister militum per Orientem, Illus decided to withdraw from the court and move with Pamprepius to Nicaea, where he assumed office and recuperated from a wound suffered in the second assassination attempt. While there, however, Illus started a rebellion against Zeno, elevating to the throne Leontius, a Syrian officer, and appointing Pamprepius as his magister officiorum. After some initial victories, Illus' troops were defeated by the army of Zeno and forced to take refuge in the fortress of Papurius, in Isauria. Illus discovered that Pamprepius wanted to betray his fellows to save himself, and in November 484 put him to death and had his head thrown over the battlements of the fortress.Nagy, p. 499. According to some modern scholars, Pamprepius did not want to betray his patron, but the failure of his political schemes was interpreted as deception by Illus' men.R. Asmus, \\"Pamprepios, ein byzantinischer Gelehrter und Staatsmann des 5. Jahrhunderts\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 22 (1913), 337-347; against this interpretation, R. Keydell, \\"Pamprepios\\", PWK 18,3 (1949) 409-15 (cited in Grillimer). Some scholars have suggested that Pamprepius' participation is a clue that the revolt of Illus was somehow an attempt to restore paganism, but this hypothesis has not been successful among scholars. However, it is known that the rebels sought the support of the pagan community of Alexandria: in fact, they were persecuted because they were suspected of being part of Illus' rebellion.The pagan community of Alexandria came under attack from Peter Mongus, Patriarch of Alexandria. Pagans such as Damascius stressed the fact that the pagan community in Alexandria had rejected the ideas of Pamprepius, perhaps to distance themselves from the suspicion of supporting the revolt of Illus and Pamprepius (Haas, Christopher,Alexandria in Late Antiquity,Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, , p. 326). A pagan convert to Christianity called Paralius wrote a letter to his former co-religionists, in which he remembers how they had prayed and sacrificed for the success of the revolt of Illus and Pamprepius against Zeno and how they had received many oracles foretelling the victory of the heathens, but how in the end Christianity had prevailed.Lee, A.D., Pagans and Christians in Late Antiquity: A Sourcebook, Routledge, 2000, , p. 134. Works Pamprepius composed two works, now lost: * ·º∏œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒπŒ∫Œ¨, Isaurica: an epic poem about Isauria, the region in Asia Minor that was the country of origin of both Illus and Zeno.

Schulz (1912 - 28 January 2006) was a German chemical engineer and professor at Columbia University known for his many works in disparate fields like nuclear physics, rocketry and waste-to-energy processes. He developed the process for separating uranium isotopes. Early life Wilhelm Schulz was born in 1912 in Berlin and moved to New York with his family in 1924. He was valedictorian at Brooklyn Technical High School. Later, he received a Pulitzer scholarship to Columbia University and earned a B.S. in 1933 and a M.S. in 1934. Upon graduation, he went to work for Union Carbide and traveled in 1940 to Niagara Falls to help improve its methanol plant. While experimenting, he used a contaminated bottle of solution which exploded on contact. The caustic splattering blinded him. Work and research When Schulz learned that physicists at Columbia University had achieved fission of a uranium isotope, he worked and succeeded in devising a process for separating uranium isotopes using gas centrifuge, presenting his idea in a paper to university researchers. When the government settled on the gaseous diffusion process to enrich uranium, Schulz filed for a patent in 1942 which was granted in 1951. Returning to Union Carbide after receiving his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Columbia in 1942, Schulz wrote two papers on the possibility of using infrared radiation to generate molecular reactions. In 1948, Schulz approached Charles H. Townes at Columbia University and offered him a Union Carbide fellowship. Impressed by Schulz's inventiveness, Townes used his fellowship to hire Arthur L. Schawlow. Together, they later invented the laser and its cousin, the maser. Both received the Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 1960s, Schulz developed new ways to produce solid rocket fuel and then took a leave from Union Carbide to oversee the United States Department of Defense's rocket propulsion program. Finally retiring from Union Carbide in 1969, and with a grant from the National Science Foundation, Schulz returned to Columbia to study ways to convert waste to energy. He developed clean processes to produce electricity using solid waste, sewage sludge and even toxic materials like PCBs, and chemical weapons. In 1977, when the United States planned to build the first gas centrifuge plant, the United States Department of Energy awarded Schulz $100,000 as a royalty for his contribution. Personal life Helmut Schulz was married to Colette Prieur Schulz. They had five children and seven grandchildren.

His research focuses on planning conservation, comparing the costs and benefits of conservation and how conservation can be reconciled with other activities. Education and career Balmford studied for his undergraduate degree, and PhD at the University of Cambridge before becoming a research fellow at the university. He was then a research fellow at the Institute of Zoology before becoming a lecturer at Sheffield University. He returned to Cambridge in 1998 as a member of the zoology department. He is currently a fellow of Clare College and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011. Research In 1993, along with two other researchers, he investigated why the tails of birds are shaped as they are, aiming to test Charles Darwin's hypothesis that females have a preference for males with longer and more ornate tails using aerodynamic analysis. They reported that shallow forked shaped tails (such as those of the house martin) are aerodynamically optimal and that species with them had similar lengthed tails, indicating they could have developed through natural selection. In species with longer tails, males tend to have longer tails than females and which also create drag, since this is no advantage except for when courting, the authors suggested long tails may have evolved through sexual selection. In 1998, he published a paper in Nature describing how the biodiversity of rainforest in Uganda could be estimated by counting populations of birds and butterflies. In 1999, again in Nature, he reported that the cost of conserving all life on earth would be approximately $320bn a year compared to the $6bn spent then. According to his group's research, this was less than 25% of the cost of environmentally damaging subsidies that governments supported at that time. The Financial Times commented that removing agricultural subsidies was already known to be \\"fraught with difficulties\\" and that only $1bn had been channelled into conservation projects since an agreement in 1992. Balmford was quoted as saying that the strongest argument to protect nature is \\"moral, cultural and philosophical\\". In 2002, he led a research project that found children could name a greater proportion of Pok√©mon characters than common species of British wildlife; 8-year-olds could identify 80% of Pok√©mon characters but only 50% of species. Balmford suggested that conservationists could create a game similar to Pok√©mon to encourage children to learn about the environment, saying \\"People tend to care about what they know.\\" He also reported in Science that the benefits of conserving nature far outweigh the benefits of development, by a factor of 100 to 1, due to the loss of ecosystem services. It was estimated that humanity loses about $250bn per year due to habitat destruction. > One-third of the world's wild nature has been lost since I was a child and > first heard the word 'conservation'. That's what keeps me awake at night. > Andrew Balmford ‚Äì 2002 In 2003, he led a study which collected data on the maintenance costs of different conservation projects around the world. It was found that there was huge variation in the cost of conserving nature, ranging from $0.07 per acre to $1.37 million per acre depending on the project. Projects in the developing world were generally cheaper than those in the developed world, boding well for the protection of biodiversity hotspots in poorer countries such as Indonesia and Madagascar. Balmford stated that it is important that the value for money of a conservation project should be taken into account as well as the number of threatened species in the region.How to get a bigger bang for your eco buck New Scientist ‚Äì 25 January 2003 In 2004, he published as a lead researcher a paper in PNAS which estimated that to protect 30% of the world's oceans by making them protected areas would cost between $12bn and $14bn each year. He told the BBC that, \\"meeting this commitment to marine protection will require international effort on an unprecedented scale\\". In 2009, a paper that Balmford co-authored was published in Science that found that the benefits gained from deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest were quickly reversed. In recently deforested areas, the Human Development Index (HDI) was higher than other regions, but once deforestation was complete and replaced by other activities, for example farming, the HDI decreased to the same extent as that in areas that had not been deforested. Balmford described the current situation as \\"disastrous for local people, wildlife and the global climate\\" but hoped that REDD may allow changes to occur in the future. Another paper published in PLoS Biology found that between 1992 and 2006, the overall number of visitors to 280 protected areas in 20 countries had increased. Visitor numbers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America all grew significantly, while those in North America and Australasia did not change significantly. The results contrasted with an earlier study of visitor numbers to protected areas in Japan and the USA which found they had fallen consistently over a number of decades. Other work Balmford helped to establish the Cambridge Conservation Forum, a network of 1000 conservation professionals from a range of organisations, the Cambridge Conservation Initiative and the annual Student Conference on Conservation Science. He is Principal Investigator on the Valuing the Arc programme, which is focused on the conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. Awards In 2000, Balmford was awarded the Zoological Society of London Marsh Award for Conservation Biology. In 2003, he was included on a list of the top 50 visionaries building a better world by Scientific American for his work on economic development and its impact on the environment. In 2010 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Patricia Lake was chosen for this work on account of having rail connections at Jasper and being a suitably cold, remote area that already had military training involvement in the area as camouflage. There were also Mennonite and Doukhobor communities nearby, religious conscientious objectors, who could provide the labour needed. Pykrete construction material for the full-sized ship was to be a composite of ice and sawdust, maintained by refrigeration. The first experiments had used natural lake ice, in a Canadian winter. The model ship was to use plain ice, but partly natural and partly refrigerated. Construction proceeded through March 1943 by building a wooden cabin on the frozen lake, installing refrigeration equipment and a nest of 6 inch cold air ducts, and then increasing the height of the ice wall around the cabin. As weight increased, the bottom of the \\"hull\\" was sawn free from the lake ice and the model floated free. In June the refrigeration was switched off, but the model lasted the whole summer before melting and sinking. A diving expedition to the site in 1985 found the remains of the model on a steep slope just off-shore at a depth between . Although the refrigeration equipment was removed before sinking, the wooden walls of the hull, an \\"incredible jumble\\" of cold air ductwork and also a great quantity of the bitumen used as part of the insulation remained at the site. As of June 26, 2011 only the west wall of the structure remained intact; the rest has fallen to pieces and lies at depths of between in depth. An underwater plaque at the site notes its part in World War II history. The site continues to be visited by recreational divers.

Biography  In 1741, he was a lawyer in Bordeaux, and then advise the Grand Council president, comptroller of Roussillon (1749) and Lyon (1754) before being named lieutenant general of police of Paris (1757‚Äì1759). He agreed in 1759 to become controller general of finance on the grounds that France was at war and finance was easier in times of war because all expedients are then allowed. But he warned Louis XV that he would resign once peace returned, which he did in 1763. He created the Land Registry to enable a better distribution of taxes. But his reforms were met with hostility from the parliament of Paris. He then received, on 14 December 1763, a secretariat of State composed strangely detached from the overall control of Finance, whose duties included: the East India Company, manufactures of cotton and painted canvas, the stud and veterinary schools, agriculture and corporate agriculture, mining, inland waterways, canals, public carriages, cabs and couriers, taxi, small items, deposits and collections of charters, lotteries, the exchange of Principality of Dombes, and, like other secretaries of state, grants, pensions, patents and shipments depending on the department. This fairly extensive, included Guienne, Normandy, Champagne, the principality of Dombes, the Lyons, the Berry Islands France and Bourbon and all institutions of the East India Company. Faced with the encroachment of the general control of finances, Bertin abandoned in 1764 the East India Company and the manufacture of painted cotton cloth, and in 1775 the coaches and express to Turgot. He however managed to keep the mines, through the abandonment of navigation to the superintendent of finance in charge of bridges and causeways. There was attributed to great difficulty in 1773 issues related to the clearing of communal property. Bertin was one of the architects of the renovation of Agriculture, and the creator of the Veterinary School of Lyon. Fascinated by China, he allowed two young Chinese Catholics to spend several years of study in France, and then returning to China, and receiving a pension from King Louis XVI. Bertin supported the Jesuit mission to the Emperor of China (fathers Bourgeois and Amiot). Vergennes did not follow his recommendations, which is unfortunate, because China was the natural complement of trade with India, which the British understood very well in the crucial years between 1778 and 1785. Bertin emigrated in 1791. He was an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences (1761) and the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1772).

Models The mortar is of traditional design with a smoothbore barrel, round baseplate (350 mm diameter), bipod and sight unit and is generally available in three different ballistical barrel lengths, which is usually stated in the model's name: * 640 mm * 895 mm * 1000 mm Maximum rate of fire with all models is 30 bombs per minute, when loaded by two people alternately, or 12 bombs per minute, when loaded by only one person. Naturally, the maximum ranges differ depending on the ballistic barrel length and the maximal allowed charges. For all three ballistic barrel lengths a conversion kit is available to fire the mortar in a handheld mode (without bipod and sight) as a commando mortar. The conversion kit contains a small round basepiece, an alternate, slightly bigger rectangular basepiece for soft ground, a carrying belt, an aiming device to set the firing range and a handgrip with a trigger, which has a safety device, so that the commando mortar may be carried with a bomb inside the barrel. Commando versions are called M6C and are portable by one person. With these versions, the operation is restricted to a maximum operating gas pressure of 300 bar. This limits the mortars to using charge 3 as a maximum; however, it is recommended not to go above charge 2 due to precision (therefore the aiming device is for charge 0, charge 1 and charge 2 only). A modified version for Special Forces is also produced. This version is equipped with a recoil absorbing damping system between the bipod and the barrel. Special Forces versions are called M6H. Hirtenberger also produces mortar bombs for these mortars. Available Ammunition: * HE Mk2, high explosive bomb, filled with TNT * TP-TM Mk2, inert bomb for training purposes, impact signature with life fuze * SMK-WP Mk2, smoke Bomb, filled with White Phosphorus (fast smoke generation) * SMK-RP Mk2, smoke bomb, filled with Red Phosphorus (slow smoke generation) * ILL-VIS Mk2, visible spectrum illumination bomb, 350.000 candela for 35 seconds * ILL-IR Mk2, infrared spectrum illumination bomb, 35 seconds duration All ranges stated below are measured with Hirtenbergen 60 mm HE Mk2, but all types of 60 mm mortar bombs may be fired from the mortars.

This domain is found in a number of unrelated signaling and structural proteins and may be repeated up to four times in some proteins. Apart from binding preferentially to proteins that are proline-rich, with particular proline-motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, some WW domains bind to phosphoserine- phosphothreonine-containing motifs.  Structure and ligands  The WW domain is one of the smallest protein modules, composed of only 40 amino acids, which mediates specific protein-protein interactions with short proline-rich or proline-containing motifs. Named after the presence of two conserved tryptophans (W), which are spaced 20-22 amino acids apart within the sequence, the WW domain folds into a meandering triple-stranded beta sheet. The identification of the WW domain was facilitated by the analysis of two splice isoforms of YAP gene product, named YAP1-1 and YAP1-2, which differed by the presence of an extra 38 amino acids. These extra amino acids are encoded by a spliced-in exon and represent the second WW domain in YAP1-2 isoform. The first structure of the WW domain was determined in solution by NMR approach. It represented the WW domain of human YAP in complex with peptide ligand containing Proline-Proline-x‚ÄìTyrosine (PPxY where x = any amino acid) consensus motif. Recently, the YAP WW domain structure in complex with SMAD-derived, PPxY motif-containing peptide was further refined. Apart from the PPxY motif, certain WW domains recognize LPxY motif (where L is Leucine), and several WW domains bind to phospho-Serine-Proline (p-SP) or phospho- Threonine-Proline (p-TP) motifs in a phospho-dependent manner. Structures of these WW domain complexes confirmed molecular details of phosphorylation- regulated interactions. There are also WW domains that interact with polyprolines that are flanked by arginine residues or interrupted by leucine residues, but they do not contain aromatic amino acids.  Signaling function  The WW domain is known to mediate regulatory protein complexes in various signaling networks, including the Hippo signaling pathway. The importance of WW domain-mediated complexes in signaling was underscored by the characterization of genetic syndromes that are caused by loss-of-function point mutations in the WW domain or its cognate ligand. These syndromes are Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome of intellectual disability caused by missense mutation in a WW domain and Liddle syndrome of hypertension caused by point mutations within PPxY motif.  Examples  A large variety of proteins containing the WW domain are known. These include; dystrophin, a multidomain cytoskeletal protein; utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein; vertebrate YAP protein, substrate of LATS1 and LATS2 serine-theronine kinases of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway; Mus musculus (Mouse) NEDD4, involved in the embryonic development and differentiation of the central nervous system; Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) RSP5, similar to NEDD4 in its molecular organization; Rattus norvegicus (Rat) FE65, a transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in brain; Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) DB10 protein, amongst others. In 2004, the first comprehensive protein-peptide interaction map for a human modular domain was reported using individually expressed WW domains and genome predicted, PPxY-containing synthetic peptides. At present in the human proteome, 98 WW domains and more than 2000 PPxY-containing peptides, have been identified from sequence analysis of the genome.  Inhibitor  YAP is a WW domain-containing protein that functions as a potent oncogene. Its WW domains must be intact for YAP to act as a transcriptional co-activator that induces expression of proliferative genes. Recent study has shown that endohedral metallofullerenol, a compound that was originally developed as a contrasting agent for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), has antineoplastic properties. Via molecular dynamic simulations, the ability of this compound to outcompete proline-rich peptides and bind effectively to the WW domain of YAP was documented. Endotheral metallofullerenol may represent a lead compound for the development of therapies for cancer patients who harbor amplified or overexpressed YAP.  In the study of protein folding  Because of its small size and well-defined structure, the WW domain became a favorite subject of protein folding studies. Among these studies, the work of Rama Ranganathan and David E. Shaw are notable. Ranganathan‚Äôs team has shown that a simple statistical energy function, which identifies co-evolution between amino acid residues within the WW domain, is necessary and sufficient to specify sequence that folds into native structure. Using such an algorithm, he and his team synthesized libraries of artificial WW domains that functioned in a very similar manner to their natural counterparts, recognizing class-specific proline-rich ligand peptides, The Shaw laboratory developed a specialized machine that allowed elucidation of the atomic level behavior of the WW domain on a biologically relevant time scale. He and his team employed equilibrium simulations of a WW domain and identified seven unfolding and eight folding events that follow the same folding route. Being a relatively short, 30 to 35 amino acids long, WW domain is amenable to chemical synthesis. It is cooperatively folded and can host chemically introduced non-canonical amino acids. Based on these properties, WW domain has been shown to be a versatile platform for the chemical interrogation of intramolecular interactions and conformational propensities in folded proteins.

From 1908-10 he was a special lecturer on works management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1910 he returned to Columbia University as professor of industrial chemistry and chemical engineering. He directed the conversion of the basement of Havemeyer Hall into a comprehensive chemical engineering laboratory. He was head of the Chemical Engineering Department for six years until 1917. In 1916 he became general manager of the Curtis Bay Chemical Company, and in 1917 was its president. In November 1917 he also became president of the U.S. Industrial Chemical Company, successor to the Curtis Bay Chemical Company, and also vice president/director of the U.S. Industrial Alcohol Company. From 1911 to 1916 he was also editor of The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, one of the official journals of the American Chemical Society. He was chairman of the New York Section of the Society of Chemical Industry, vice president of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and president of the Chemists' Club. From 1918-20 he was Director Emeritus of the Research Corporation for Science Advancement.http://www.rescorp.org/about-rcsa/people/board-of-directors- history Between 1912 and 1921 he was granted twenty-two U.S. patents for items and processes ranging from removing nickel from hydrogenized fat to apparatus for producing ethylene. In 1923 he was awarded the Perkin Medal,http://www.awardsandhonors.com/award/perkin- medal.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/1923/01/14/archives/over-organization-a- flaw-in-industry-dr-milton-c-whitaker-chemist-a.html which he described as 'the greatest honor that can be conferred upon a chemist by his fellow workers'. In his acceptance speech he went on to say: 'I am deeply appreciative of the distinction which your committee has bestowed upon me, and doubly grateful to receive the beautiful symbol of the honor from you, sir, a Perkin Medalist yourself and by unanimous consent the beloved dean of our profession.' He was referring to Charles F. Chandler, a mentor of his during his time at Columbia University.

She was featured as a soloist on projects from Integrity, Vineyard Music, and Maranatha! Music. In addition she sang duets and background vocals with such artists as Dion DiMucci, Lenny LeBlanc, Amy Grant, Ricky Skaggs, Paul Overstreet, Twila Paris, Steve Green, Fernando Ortega, Keith Green, Buddy Greene, Jim Cole and many others. Kelly has also recorded nine solo projects, currently offered through her website. Willard was born in Winter Haven, Florida. She began playing the piano at the age of five and composing her own songs at the age of thirteen. She accompanied the church choir, playing and singing in nursing homes, and traveling with a part-time gospel group on weekends. At the age of sixteen Willard moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where she accompanied The Jake Hess Sound on piano. She later moved to Panorama City, California, where she joined the popular CCM group The Archers, and then on to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where she joined the group Seth. She credits her vocal development to Jonathan David Brown and Harlan Rogers. Willard married at 18, joined Harlan Rogers & Friends, and traveled the mid-west until 1977, when she moved to Southern California to be a part of the then current flow of 'Jesus Music' artists who were ministering and recording there. She played keyboards and sang background vocals on projects for artists including Bob Bennett and Roby Duke before Maranatha! Music approached her in 1978 to record her own solo project. After the birth of her children, she took periodic sabbaticals, homeschooling through the 1980s, 1990s, and later taking care of her mother, who was suffering with Alzheimer's. In 2004, both her parents died, her 29-year marriage came to an end, and her 18-year-old daughter Haylie committed suicide after a struggle with severe depression. Willard later referred to the period in an interview as \\"the worst year of my life.\\" Willard moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and became part of a church support community there. Her latest album, recorded in 2000, titled Paga, features then 18-year-old son Bryan on bass guitar, and 15-year-old Haylie in a duet on the song \\"Beautiful Jesus\\". Kelly explains, \\"The Old Testament priests who would take incense into The Holy of Holies and burn it unto The Lord. This is called Paga in Hebrew, and it means \\"to make intercession\\". When Jesus became our sacrifice ... He made the way for our prayers, praises, worship and intercession to become like that incense unto the Lord, a sweet-smelling savor ... Even with all that I have been through, nothing has changed my relationship with The Lord or the call that He placed on my life at a young age. If anything, I have gained more wisdom through the things (even mistakes) that I have suffered, and am more dependent on Him than ever before. I can testify of God's ultimate faithfulness to His children, and His unwavering commitment to conform us into the likeness of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. And, I plan to keep on singing about it until the very end.\\" Willard is currently living in Florence, Alabama, and is writing and recording a new \\"duo\\" project with long-time friend, Rene Stamps.

It is the largest single-celled organism known, at up to across. It was first described in 1882 by the oceanographer John Murray, after being discovered on an expedition in the ship Triton which dredged the deep ocean bed off the west coast of Scotland in an effort to find organisms new to science. It was the first xenophyophore to be described and at first its relationship with other organisms was a mystery, but it is now considered to be a member of the Foraminifera. The organism appears as an agglomeration of sediment a few centimetres across, a sandy ball that easily crumbles when removed from the seabed. It consists of a single cell which expands to form hundreds of hollow branched and interconnecting tubes; these secrete an organic cement to which particles of sediment and sand adhere, forming a crusty structure called the test. As the test grows, the cell withdraws from parts of it, which are then colonised by other organisms, such as nematodes. The single cell has no cell divisions but is multinucleate, having multiple nuclei. It is not known how the organism feeds or reproduces. It may be a filter feeder, drawing water through the tubes and sifting out the nutritious particles. Alternatively, much faecal matter accumulates in the tubes, and it has been suggested that it feeds on the bacteria that colonise the waste. This theory is supported by the fact that it has high concentrations of lipids within its cytosol, which suggests that it may feed on bacteria from the sediment that makes up the tubes.Laureillard, J., L. M√©janelle, and M. Sibuet. \\"Use of Lipids to Study the Trophic Ecology of Deep-sea Xenophyophores.\\" Marine Ecology Progress Series 270 (2004): 129-40. Print. In common with other xenophyophores, the organism has tiny crystals of barium sulphate, known as granellae, scattered throughout the cytosol. Syringammina fragilissima, the first xenophyophore known to science, was described by Henry Bowman Brady in 1883, from specimens dredged from the Faroe Channel. S. minuta, described by Pearcey in 1914, was not properly figured and the original specimen is unaccounted for. The species Syringammina limosa was described in 2018 from the Sea of Okhotsk at a depth of 3300 metres.

San Juan de Yapacan√≠, officially San Juan, is a town and municipality in Bolivia, located in the province of Ichilo in the district of Santa Cruz. It is located 124 km northwest of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra on Route 4 on the bank of the Yapacan√≠ River. The population is 9,191 inhabitants (Census 2012). The territorial extension is 1,620 km2 Along with the Colony Okinawa, it is one of the two Japanese colonies found in Bolivia. This town became a municipality in 2001 by Law No.2233 of the Republic of Bolivia, which was signed into law by Acting President Jorge Quiroga. Climate The climate is typical savannah to subtropical wet forest, where the annual average temperature of 24.1 ¬∞ C is recorded (average maximum of 29.1 ¬∞ C and average minimum of 19.4 ¬∞ C). The average rainfall is 1,881 mm. In the wet season, precipitation is in the form of intense rain and lightning storms, while in the dry season it is in the form of showers. History Immigration from Japan began in 1955 with 88 people and lasted until 1992. In total 1,685 immigrants arrived in 53 groups. At the beginning of colonization, they cultivated upland rice, maize, cassava, yams and legumes. In its early years, the colony was unable to ship most of the rice it produced, due to the unimproved road being impassable when wet. After reaching the main road to Montero, five to six more hours of travel were necessary to arrive at markets. Improvements to the road to the colony and the Montero-Yapacan√≠ highway created more opportunities for the colonists. Also, they established poultry farms, mainly with chickens, which in the mid-70's consisted of 30% of chicken farming in Bolivia. Electrification reached San Juan in 1979 and the colonists participate in various marketing cooperatives. From 1966 the first agricultural machineries are introduced that significantly increased agricultural production. In 1969 some varieties of soybeans were introduced that would become one of the typical crops of the colony before its cultivation spread to other parts of Bolivia. Currently, in San Juan they farm soy, laying hens and chickens, rain fed rice and citrus fruits. Also, lately, they have been harvesting macadamia nuts and irrigated rice. Since 1997, they started procedures to convert the municipality, which was dependent by the municipality of San Carlos, to a new independent and autonomous municipality headed by Mr. Jorge Torrez Cerezo and after many years of management, the creation of the Fourth Section of the province Ichilo was approved and Law No. 2233, dated July 26 200, was proclaimed by the Acting President Jorge Quiroga. And from 2005, the Autonomous Municipal Government of San Juan has been functioning, with its first Mayor being Mr. Katsumi Bani Abe, elected by the Citizens Association XXI Century San Juan.

Dating to the late 5th‚Äìearly 6th century, the church stands near the town of Perushtitsa in western Plovdiv Province, some southwest of the city of Plovdiv. The Red Church is a rare example of solid brick construction in a church from Late Antiquity in Bulgaria, and it was the red colour of the bricks that gave the church its name. History and architecture Probably built under Emperor Anastasius I (491‚Äì518), the Red Church originally measured . The northern wall, the best preserved, reaches around in height. The church features four semi-domes, a narthex and an outer narthex (exonarthex). The symmetry of the building is disrupted by a baptistery with a piscina attached to the northern wall of the narthex and a chapel located under the semi-dome of the church's south side. The piscina in the baptistery was faced with pink marble. The church was originally domed, but hardly any of the dome has been preserved. The floor of the church was covered with mosaics and the interior was decorated with frescoes. The early murals of the Red Church illustrate the gradual shift from complex mosaics to frescoes in the interior decoration of Christian churches which was taking place at the time. Some decoration is preserved in the National Historical Museum in Sofia. Though now lost, part of those early frescoes were the apocryphal scenes of the flight of Elizabeth and the murder of Zechariah, John the Baptist's parents. The Red Church is thought originally to have been a martyr's mausoleum (martyrium) which housed the remains of a popular saint. The church underwent reconstruction in the Early Middle Ages. In the 10th‚Äì11th century, several of the side passages were sealed off using bricks from the church itself, and the space in front of the apse was isolated by means of double fencing. The necropolis around the church has been dated to the Middle Ages as well, and it was in that period that the second layer of frescoes was added. The Red Church was first excavated in 1915 by Bulgarian archaeologists. The outbreak of World War I delayed any further research until 1921, when excavations were continued by the Bulgarian Archaeological Institute with the financial aid of American Byzantinist Thomas Whittemore. Due to structural damage, the church was stabilized with wood scaffolding in 1985. In 2013, the site was reopened after a renovation project made possible by substantial funding from the European Council. The wooden scaffolding was replaced with metal beams, structural enhancements made, and a visitor's centre constructed. Along with the Hagia Sophia Church in Sofia and the Old Bishopric in Nesebar, the Red Church stands as one of only three preserved brick churches from that period of the history of Bulgaria. Solid brickwork was generally rare and to be seen in buildings constructed from the 5th to the 12th century in Byzantium and Byzantine-influenced areas. Architecture historian Margarita Koeva considers the church one of the prime examples of the changes which ensued in the modern Bulgarian lands following the Edict of Milan of 313.

He released five albums over a period of almost 25 years. He was often musically associated with his nephew Magic Sam. Life and career James D. Harris was born in Earle, Arkansas, and relocated with his family to Chicago, Illinois, at the age of seven. He played in several Chicago blues ensembles in the late 1940s. He also worked as a mechanic and as a professional gambler (his nickname came from a dice players' expression, \\"shake 'em\\"). His debut recording was the single \\"Call Me if You Need Me\\", backed with \\"Roll Your Moneymaker\\", released by Artistic Records in 1958, featuring Magic Sam and Syl Johnson on guitar and produced by Willie Dixon. Harris was not paid for the session, but he won $700 shooting craps with label owner Eli Toscano.Rowe, M. (1981). Chicago Blues: The City and the Music. New York: Da Capo Press. p. 180. In 1960, Bluesville Records teamed Harris with the jazz musicians Jack McDuff and Bill Jennings for the album Good Times. His later recording of Mouth Harp Blues returned to a more traditional blues style. Harris toured and was part of the American Folk Blues Festival tour in 1962. Throughout the 1960s Harris and Sam appeared regularly in concert together around Chicago. Harris's patronage of younger musicians helped secure Luther Allison's recording debut. Harris moved on in the late 1960s, recording with Allison in Los Angeles on Further On up the Road. He also played with other harmonica players, such as William Clarke. Harris subsequently recorded for World Pacific. He also owned a nightclub and a record label, but ill health eventually led him to return to Arkansas, where he died, at the age of 68, on March 2, 1990.

Early life She is the daughter of two patrons of New York City's avant-garde, Frederick Eberstadt, a photographer and psychotherapist, and Isabel Eberstadt, a writer. Her paternal grandfather was Ferdinand Eberstadt, a Wall Street financier and adviser to presidents; her maternal grandfather was the poet Ogden Nash. One of her brothers, Nicholas Eberstadt, is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She went to the Brearley School in New York City. As a teenager, she worked at Andy Warhol's Factory and for Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her first published piece was a profile in Andy Warhol's \\"Interview\\" in 1979 of the travel writer Bruce Chatwin. At age eighteen, Eberstadt moved to the United Kingdom, where she was one of the first women to attend Magdalen College, Oxford, from which she graduated in 1982. Writing career In 1985, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. published the 25-year-old Eberstadt's first work of literary fiction, titled Low Tide. This told the story of Jezebel, daughter of an English art dealer and a mad Louisiana heiress, and her fatal love affair with two young brothers. It takes place in New York, Oxford and Mexico. Praise for her work landed her an interview with intellectual William F. Buckley on his television program, Firing Line, where she appeared with Bret Easton Ellis, who had published Less Than Zero the same year. Her next novel Isaac and His Devils came in 1991 and was again widely acclaimed, described by Library Journal as a \\"rich novel, full of promise for the author's future\\". Set in rural New Hampshire, the novel's hero is Isaac Hooker, a half-deaf, half-blind, hugely fat and ambitious boy-genius and his struggle to fulfill his parents' blighted dreams. Her third novel, published in 1997 and set in the late 1980s New York art world, When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth, recounted the rise and fall of the now young painter, Isaac Hooker. Eberstadt began writing essays and criticism for such publications as Commentary, The New Yorker, Vogue, The New York Times Magazine, and Vanity Fair. Her widely cited essay \\"The Palace and the City\\", about the Sicilian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and the politics of urban restoration in Palermo, was published in the December 23, 1991, issue of The New Yorker. Writer Daniel Mendelsohn cited Eberstadt's essay as his all-time favorite piece in The New Yorker. In more recent years, she has worked extensively for The New York Times Magazine, publishing profiles of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk, of Moroccan-based Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo, and the Portuguese novelist Jos√© Saramago, as well as of indie-rock group CocoRosie. Her work appeared in Architectural Digest. Following her pattern of a six-year interval between novels, Eberstadt published The Furies in 2003. Praised by Kirkus Reviews, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, and The New York Times Book Review, fellow writer Bret Easton Ellis called it \\"spellbinding\\", and The New York Observer said \\"The Furies veers pretty close to genius.\\" John Updike, reviewing Little Money Street in The New Yorker, described Eberstadt as \\"ambitious, resourceful novelist\\". Life in France In 1998, Eberstadt went to live on a vineyard in the French Pyrenees, outside the city of Perpignan. She became friends with a family of French gypsy musicians. Her first work of non-fiction, Little Money Street‚ÄîIn Search of Gypsies and Their Music in the South of France, which portrays that friendship, was released by Knopf in March 2006. Luc Sante called the book \\"passionate, intimate, at once exhilarating and despairing, a rich and profound work of high nonfiction literature. A portrait of the Gypsies of southwestern France, it is also about family, about consumerism, and about the ruthlessness of a world in which there is no more open world.\\" Eberstadt and her husband, Alastair Meddon Oswald Bruton, a journalist whom she married on June 5, 1993, live in France; they have two children. Eberstadt's sixth book, a novel called RAT, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in March 2010. RAT tells the story of a 15-year-old girl who set off on a journey from rural France to London, with her adopted brother in search of her birth father and a better life. Booklist called it \\"mythic, gritty and unforgettable\\". Cathleen Medwick in \\"The New York Times Book Review\\" praises Eberstadt's \\"shrewd and sensuous fifth novel.\\" Medwick hails Eberstadt's preoccupation with \\"the footloose life of the wilfully dispossessed\\" and writes that \\"in her novels, idealists and fast trackers wrestle with thorny problems of love and social identity.\\" * Works *Low tide, A.A.

The art museum pavilion forms the northeast portion of the Confederation Centre of the Arts complex, and includes seven exhibition rooms that equal of space. The art museum was opened in honour of the Fathers of Confederation, in October 1964, along with the rest of the Confederation Centre of the Arts. The art museum's permanent collection includes over 17,000 works, primarily from Canadian artists. Its exhibition spaces feature contemporary and historical exhibitions year-round, as well as special events, public lectures, and educational programming. History The Confederation Centre of the Arts was built from 1963 to 1964 in order to commemorate the Fathers of Confederation. The federal government provided C$2.8 million, while the provincial governments provided C$0.15 for each resident in their respective provinces. On 6 October 1964, the 100th anniversary of the Charlottetown Conference, the Confederation Centre of the Arts was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The Confederation Centre of the Arts included the Confederation Centre Art Gallery, and several venues for the performing arts. The centre formally belongs to the federal and provincial governments of Canada, although the Government of Prince Edward Island acts as its custodian. Following an investigation into several works in its permanent collection in the mid-2010s, the museum corrected the attribution to several works to its correct painter, Caroline Louisa Daly. A two-year investigation into the matter by the museum was launched in 2014 shortly after it was informed of the issue by a great-grandchild of Daly, who recognized her signature on one of the works. Following the correction, the museum organized an exhibition to exhibit works by Daly. Architecture The exterior entrance is one of two access points into the art museum The Confederation Centre Art Gallery building is located in the central business district of Charlottetown, and is situated west of Province House. The art museum forms a part of the larger Confederation Centre of the Arts building complex, which also contains a public library, restaurant, a 1,102 seat theatre for the performing arts, two studio theatres, and several event venues. Designed by Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, and Sise, the Brutalist style structure began construction in 1963, and was completed in 1964. Designed by Dimitri Dimakopoulos, the exterior of the structure features a reinforced concrete frame, faced with a continuous wall of smooth sandstone. On 30 June 2003, the entire structure was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. The building is made of four constituent pavilions which together form a single building; however their exteriors were designed to be visually distinct from one another, giving the appearance that the pavilions are separate buildings. Three of these pavilions are situated in a U-shape around a fourth \\"Memorial Hall\\" pavilion; with the Confederation Centre Art Gallery located in the northeast pavilion of the U-shaped building complex. The art gallery pavilion is three storeys, and has a low geometric massing that is used throughout the entire structure. It includes seven exhibition rooms, which comprise over , an art education facility named The Schurman Family Studio, a contemporary outdoor sculpture court, a conservation lab, a preparation workshop, administrative offices, and temporary and permanent collection storage rooms. There are two access points for the art museum pavilion, an entrance to the south that provides access from the inside the other pavilions of the Confederation Centre of the Arts, and an entrance to the north that provides access from the outside. Permanent collection Robert Harris, 1890. The work is one of a number of works in the museum's permanent collection. As of June 2017, the art museum's permanent collection includes over 17,000 works by Canadian artists. The permanent collection began in 1964, and has a mandate to develop exhibit Canadian visual arts, with and its collection reflect on Canadian identity and the origin and evolution of the country. Works in the collection were either directly purchased from the art museum, bequeathed to, or donated to the art museum. The collection includes digital media presentations, drawings, installation art, painting, photography, printmaking, sculptures. Most of the museum's holdings are works of contemporary art; although its collection does include works from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including works by Fanny Amelia Bayfield, Kathleen Daly, Cornelius Krieghoff, and George Pepper. The museum's collection includes specialized areas, like the Confederation Mural Collection, which includes works by Jean Paul Lemieux, and Jane Ash Poitras.

Early life Born Diana Hansen in Bellingham, Washington in 1947, she was the eldest of 6 children born to Audrey and Wally Hansen. Of her childhood there, she says \\"I was born into a community of depressed, Mormon Swedish farmers, who put away winter black on Memorial Day in favor of summer navy blue.\\"http://web.mac.com/dianahy/iWeb/Diana%20Hansen-Young/About%20Diana.html http://web.mac.com/dianahy/iWeb/Diana%20Hansen-Young/Diana,%20Continued.html In 1964, in high school, she wrote a musical that had a full production. She realized then that she wanted to write musical theatre, but it was a while before she returned to her calling. In 1966 she moved to Hawaii. Enamoured by the color and warmth of the islands, she made her home there, and was followed shortly by her parents and siblings. Political career In 1968, ran for the State Constitutional Convention. She won a seat by 93 votes. Her campaign platform was noted for being down-to-earth; her mother Audrey stood by the highway, waving, holding a sign that read \\"Mothers For Diana.\\" Diana followed up by standing by the highway with her two Great Danes, waving with a sign that read \\"Dogs For Diana.\\" She went on to run for the Hawaii State House of Representatives, and won a seat there. At age 20, she was the youngest official to ever hold the title. She lost two subsequent elections for U.S. House of Representatives (District 2), after which, she says, \\"I was unemployable.\\" Years later, she also lost a race for Mayor of Honolulu. https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=18776 Painting Taking scraps of canvas or matting from her parents' frame shop, she started painting scenes of Diamond Head with various combinations of waves, rocks, and palm trees, and sold them on the roadside to make a living after losing her race for U.S. House of Representatives. One day, she painted a painting of a Hawaiian woman in front of Diamond Head and the painting sold within 5 minutes. She continued painting Hawaiian women for the next 25 years, and her business grew from a roadside stand into a gallery. Her art could be found on mugs, calendars, cards, clothing, and perfume. She wrote and illustrated four art and prose coffee table books, and sold over three hundred thousand prints and 150,000 mugs (through Jack in the Box, JC Penney, Wal- Mart, and QVC). She also founded her own animation company and business that grew to include over 50 employees. Her art supported her family and their farm. In 1979, she married Gordon Young (later divorced), and her daughters, Heidi and Thekla, were born in 1980 and 1981, respectively. The family lived on a farm in Kahalu'u on the island of Oahu, and Diana expanded her publications to include 10 children's books about the farm, known as Mango Hill, and the fictional adventures of the animals there. They had many pets (horses, dogs, cats, chickens and peacocks) and the farm became known as a home for stray or unwanted animals. Roosters who had lost fights were left at the farm, and an orphaned mongoose was lowered over the fence in a cat carrier. Playwright During this time, despite her success as an artist, Diana had been writing plays, novels, short stories, and songs. However, she never submitted the manuscripts, focusing on the career that was providing for her family. But painting was not her calling, and in 1996, she developed severe arthritis in her right arm and hand, and could no longer hold a paint brush. She took this as a sign that painting was no longer right for her. That same year, in a waiting room, she opened a magazine to a page with an ad for the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program at New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. She applied, and despite not having a college degree, she was accepted. She closed her business, rented her farm, and moved with her daughters to New York City. Diana met Brian Feinstein in the graduate program, where they collaborated on many songs and short musicals, finally writing the musical Mimi Le Duck, starring Eartha Kitt, which opened at the New World Stages on November 6, 2006 and closed on December 3, 2006, after 58 performances. Diana has been a published member of Mystery Writers of America since 1979 and has written numerous short mystery stories, and is currently writing and living in Brooklyn with two cats, Jaws and Smudge.

Both generations of the CB900F are straight four- cylinder four-stroke roadsters. The first generation was produced from 1979 through 1983, and was available in the United States in 1981 and 1982. In 1983 it was replaced by the CB1100F. The second generation was available from 2002 through 2007. It is called the Hornet 900 in Europe and the 919 in North America, while the related CB600F is the Hornet 600 in Europe and the 599 in North America. In 2008 the second generation CB900 was replaced by the CB1000R. First generation Background In 1969 Honda introduced its flagship CB750 superbike, whose success led to Honda's domination of the motorcycle market. Honda had been successful in European endurance racing with their RCB-series RS1000, and had made advances in suspension technology from their experience in motocross, and the company chose to base a new DOHC roadster on their endurance racer. The CB900F's design was aimed at European markets, rather than the usual focus on the United States, where it was not available until 1981. In Europe, it was initially named Super Sport like the 750 (FZ and FA) later named after the Bol d'Or endurance race. In the market, the CB900F competed with larger capacity bikes like the Kawasaki Kz1000, Suzuki GS1000, and Yamaha XS1100. Design The CB900F's engine has a four- cylinder DOHC engine with a bore and stroke of . The engine drew on other designs, such as the CB1000C, CB1100F/CB1100R, and the inline-6 CBX1000. The CB900F has a five-speed gearbox and chain final drive, and it produces at 9,000 rpm The CB900F has two front disc brakes and one rear disk brake, all fitted with dual-piston calipers after 1983. The air-assisted fork was fitted with the Honda TRAC (torque reactive anti-dive control) anti-dive system in 1982 or 1983. The bike shares the same bodywork (tank, side covers, tailpiece) as the earlier CB750F Super Sport. There are similarities between the CB900F bodywork and that of the CB1100F and CBX. Performance In magazine tests, the CB900F typically clocked low to mid 12 seconds in the quarter mile (and a low 11.84 seconds in a Motorcyclist magazine test). The engine was tuned to produce mid range power rather than maximizing peak horsepower, thus giving good acceleration from 4,000 rpm to the 9,500 rpm redline. At there was some vibration, but the relaxed riding position was comfortable at most speeds, but at the maximum speed wind pressure could cause rider discomfort. The CB900F was succeeded in 1983 by the CB1100F, and in 1987 Honda introduced the CBR1000F water-cooled inline fours. Reception Honda's advertising proclaimed the bike to be \\"a thundering Super-Sports bike with devastating performance and an unwavering stamina\\". The bike's conventional twin down-tube steel frame is very strong. This, along with improved suspension made the CB900F \\"arguably the best Honda had built for the street,\\" and capable of challenging European motorcycles in performance and roadholding. For its time, the CB900F was called, \\"the ultimate statement of the old air-cooled technology Honda had done so much to create\\". In anticipation of the 2002 model, one reporter reminisced that the original \\"was a powerful machine, if a bit heavy. All gas tank and engine, stable on the highway, middle-of-the-road good looks and hound-dog reliable.\\" Rod Ker, however, writes that it had \\"two bad habits,\\" that \\"it dropped out of gear, and ‚Äî sometimes as a direct result ‚Äî broke con-rods. This was a great pity, because it was a good bike until it broke, blessed with a frame and suspension that showed the Japanese were catching up with the Europeans in chassis technology.\\" Second generation The second generation Honda CB900F is a standard motorcycle based on a sport bike engine but with a more upright seating position and revised engine and gearing, providing performance and comfort between a typical sport bike and a cruiser. It was called the Hornet in Europe and the 919 in North America because the trademark for the vehicle name Hornet in North America was held by Chrysler, acquired after buying AMC, maker of the AMC Hornet car. In some ways the concept dates to a 1994 design study created by American Honda's R&D; chief product evaluator Dirk Vandenberg in cooperation with Cycle World magazine, a streetfighter-like one-off custom based on the Honda CBR900RR, with the fairings removed, high, tubular handlebar, and tuning and gearing modified to boost low-end torque. Vandenberg saw a market in the \\"older sportbike crowd\\" who are seeking high performance without an awkward riding position or racetrack style bodywork. It was introduced in 2002 and its last model year was 2007, after which it was replaced by the CB1000R. After compliance with tightening emissions regulations became untenable, it was replaced by the more performance-specialized CB1000R. In 2006, Motorcyclist recommended used 919s as a good buy, saying of the new bike, \\"at $7999, it wasn't exactly cheap, and saddled with a coat of flat-black paint called Asphalt, it was less than visually electrifying,\\" however, in the used market it became a great value. In the US market, the 919, like the 599, was expensive, because, being intended for the European market, they were made in Italy, and so had to be imported to the US against unfavorable Euro exchange rates. The Daily Telegraph welcomed the new bike, saying, \\"the new CB900F Hornet leaves your knees in the breeze and your smile full of bugs as it reintroduces you to a feeling of undemanding, rewarding two-wheeled fun that has been missing from the market for a long time.\\" Comparing it to the Hornet 600, the bike was reminiscent of the standards of the 1970s, sometimes called Universal Japanese Motorcycles. Design The CB900F is powered by a de- tuned Honda CBR900RR engine, developed by Tadao Baba, one of Honda's Large Project Leaders. The motor is a transversely mounted, liquid-cooled, fuel- injected in-line four-stroke, four-cylinder DOHC engine that produces around . The engine has cast camshafts and pistons instead of the more expensive forged versions found on the CBR929 and later. For greater midrange torque, the CB900F's camshaft lift is lower, and compression is slightly lowered. Four fuel-injection throttle bodies take the place of the CBR900RR's carburetors. Redline is 9500 rpm. The bike has a cable-actuated clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a chain final drive. A steel, square-tube backbone frame supports the stressed member engine. In front, a cartridge fork (adjustable beginning in 2004) guides the wheel, while a single Showa shock, adjustable only for preload (and rebound damping beginning in 2004) connects with the aluminum swingarm and carries the weight in back. Its brakes are dual-disc in the front and single-disc in the rear. Instrumentation consists of an analog speedometer and tachometer and basic indicator lamps, incorporated under a tinted window, and a single tripmeter. While it normally was equipped with a centerstand, California models did not have room for one due to additional emissions control equipment. The rake is 25¬∞, trail is , wheelbase is , and seat height is . It has a tested dry weight (minus fuel only) of and a tested wet weight of . The chain drive is a 530 chain with stock gearing of 16 tooth front and 43 tooth rear sprockets. A carburetted version exists in the form of the CB600F, known as the Hornet 600 in Europe and the 599 in North America. Performance Quarter-mile performance for the second generation bike was 11.18 seconds at tested by Motorcyclist, while Cycle World measured 10.92 seconds at . Having the lowest weight in its class and a good power-to-weight ratio, it stands well in comparison to bikes with greater output like the Yamaha FZ1, and the wide, high handlebars ease quick turning and make cornering enjoyable. The suspension of the early versions was criticized, but after the upgrade to an adjustable fork, the complaints died down. Cycle World saw the 919 as a practical solution to the real-world problem of imperfect roads and traffic, rather than a mere compromise between a sportbike and a commuter or touring ride.

It premiered at the Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival. In the documentary, filmmaker Liz Canner takes a job editing erotic movies for a drug trial for a pharmaceutical company called Vivus. Her employer is developing what they hope will be the first Viagra drug for women that wins FDA approval to treat a new disease: female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Many women suffer from this, as males suffers erectile dysfunctions. However, women's issues with this sexual matter has been seen to be not as important as their partner. Over time women have become more involved in their sexual experiences and want to gain just as much from it as their partners by wanting to cure the issue of not being able to reach an orgasm. Liz gains permission to film the company's work in general for her own documentary. Initially, she plans to create a movie about science and pleasure but she soon begins to suspect that her employer, along with a cadre of other medical companies, might be trying to take advantage of women (and potentially endanger their health) in pursuit of billion dollar profits. The film continues from Vivus onto the more general question of whether there is a solid scientific foundation to medical industry claims about what constitutes \\"healthy\\" female sexuality and whether drugs and surgery are a suitable first-line approach to obtaining it. The film documents an emerging medical industry intent on convincing as large a market of women as possible that they have medical problems, and that those problems are best solved by expensive and dangerous medical treatments. Orgasm Inc. is presented as a look inside the medical industry and the marketing campaigns that are literally and figuratively reshaping the public's lives concerning health, illness, desire, and orgasm. Release Orgasm Inc. premiered at the Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival in 2009. It has shown in over 70 film festivals all over the world, including the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival, and the Independent Film Festival of Boston. The film has also been broadcast on national television in Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Brazil, Israel, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, United States and Japan. The film was picked up by First Run Features who released the movie in cinemas in the U.S. on February 11, 2011. Critical reception Since its release in 2009, Orgasm Inc. has received numerous awards, including the Best Feature award at the Vermont International Film Festival, the 2nd Best Feature award at the KOS International Health Film Festival, the Best Documentary Award at the Southeast New England (SENE) Film, Music, and Arts Festival, and the Best Feature Award at the Newburyport Documentary Film Festival. The New York Times named it a \\"Critic's Pick\\" and said that it was \\"as entertaining as it was revelatory\\". The Hot Docs Film Festival called it an \\"extraordinary behind-the-scenes access reveals a drug company's fevered race to develop the first FDA-approved Viagra for women ‚Äî and offers a humorous but sobering look inside the cash-fueled pharmaceutical industry\\". Newsweek said \\"[Orgasm Inc.] is a desperately needed antidote to all the hype generated by pharmaceutical companies pursuing their holy grail: a female Viagra.\\" The Times called it \\"an extraordinary, revelatory documentary about female desire and the pharmaceutical industry\\". In addition, articles about the movie and quotes from director Liz Canner have appeared internationally in hundreds of articles and blogs and dozens of TV shows and radio programs such as ABC News, Vogue, Newsweek, the Times of London, the Wall Street Journal, the BBC World Service, Public Radio, the LA Times, the Guardian, Cosmopolitan South Africa, Glamour Brazil, etc. This media attention has helped to raise serious questions about the pharmaceutical industries involvement with creating and marketing diseases. It has also protected millions of women from being misled into believing that they have FSD and they need to be treated with a drug (that could potentially harm them).

Raised by a Greek mother and German father in an Italian neighborhood, her inspirations growing up were American regional, southern, French and Mediterranean foods, a culinary m√©lange that ranged from chicken pot pie, smothered pork chops and beach plum jelly, to boeuf bourgignon and cheese souffl√©s, to skordalia and endless varieties of phyllo pastries. Schneider‚Äôs mother knew Dione Lucas, Julia Child's precursor, and was strongly influenced by her classic French technique which she passed on to her daughter. Another major influence in Schneider‚Äôs life has been a small town called Helvetia in the West Virginia Appalachians, that had been settled by Swiss immigrants in the 1860s. After Schneider visited a ramp (wild leek) festival http://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/The-Helvetia-Ramp-Supper in the town in the early seventies, she returned yearly to document and write about the compelling and unexpected culture that she found there, a mix of Swiss and Appalachian, that manifested in unique foodways, art, music, architecture and story-telling. Over the years, Helvetia became home and its people a second family. Schneider has lectured and published numerous articles about Helvetia, including entrees in The Encyclopedia of Appalachia. A lover of food, culture, photography, and design, Schneider has traveled extensively throughout the United States, Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Ireland, North Africa, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Guadeloupe. Career Schneider has worked as a journalist, editor, teacher, food stylist, lecturer, and small-space consultant. She began her career in food working in restaurants in the 1970s. As a captain at the Sign of the Dove, she was one of the first women to work in elite Manhattan restaurants that had long held a men-only hiring policy, a policy that changed with the loss of a suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. Preferring cooking to service, and with no professional culinary training, Schneider started working in New York City restaurant kitchens, including The Soho Charcuterie and Le Petit Robert, eventually becoming a chef. For several years, she ran her own catering business until she segued, into food styling and magazine writing. A brief stint as Associate Food Editor at a diet and health magazine was the catalyst for Schneider‚Äôs eventual focus on a new approach to healthy cooking; it embraced the traditional taboos of butter, cream, goosefat, and other rich fats, used in moderation, with innovative cooking techniques. She developed these ideas in her long-running Food & Wine Magazine column ‚ÄúWell-Being‚Äù and her ground- breaking tome ‚ÄúA New Way to Cook‚Äù.https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/cooking.html?pagewanted=1 This book also launched a central theme in Schneider‚Äôs work, that of improvising. She developed new ways of writing recipes to incorporate information and ideas that would encourage people to improvise on the basic theme. Her 2001 award- winning cookbook The Improvisational Cook http://www.nysun.com/food-drink/all- that-jazz/40894/ explored this concept more fully, with chapters on The Creative Mindset, Accidents and the Unexpected, Understanding Flavor, Learning What Goes with What, Making Flavors Come to Life: Salt and Other Absolutely Essential Seasonings and The Essential Pantry: Long-Keeping Ingredients as Opportunity. As a food stylist, Schneider worked with such notable photographers as Irving Penn, Hiro, Annie Leibovitz and Maria Robledo.http://www.judycasey.com/artists/show/6 She once wrangled 600 live snails for the photographer Irving Penn for a photograph that is in the Museum of Modern Art.

Its name is French for \\"City of Mary\\", a reference to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is the historic nucleus around which the original settlement of Montreal grew. The settlement became a centre for the fur trade and French expansion into North America until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which ended the French and Indian War and ceded the territory of New France to Britain. Given its importance, the site of the fort was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1924.  Place Royale  Extensive archaeological work in Montreal has revealed the 1,000-year history of human habitation in the area.\\"About Pointe- √†-Calli√®re\\", Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History website, accessed 14 March 2012 In his second expedition to North America in 1535, Jacques Cartier observed the indigenous village of Hochelaga in the vicinity of modern-day Montreal.Jacques Cartier. (1545). Relation originale de Jacques Cartier. Paris: Tross (1863 edition) Cartier's description suggests that the village of Hochelaga was linked to the occupation of the area by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, a group of Indigenous sedentary farmers who inhabited the St. Lawrence Valley between 1200 and 1600 CE. Gagn√©, Michel. \\"Hochelaga\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia, April 19, 2018 By Samuel de Champlain's arrival and in 1608, he found no trace of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians and settlements visited by Cartier some 75 years earlier. Historians and other scholars have developed several theories about their disappearance: devastating wars with the Iroquois tribes to the south, the impact of epidemics of Old World diseases, or their migration westward toward the shores of the Great Lakes. Harold Innis surmised that the northern hunting Indians around Tadoussac traded furs for European weapons and used these to push the farming Indians south.Innis, Harold Adams \\"The Fur Trade in Canada\\", 1956 edition, Chapter 1. By the time Champlain arrived, the Algonquins and Mohawks were both using the Saint-Lawrence Valley for hunting grounds, as well as a route for war parties and raiding. Neither nation had any permanent settlements upriver above Tadoussac.Trigger, Bruce G., (1976) \\"The Disappearance of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians\\", The Children of Aataentsic: a History of the Huron People to 1660. Montreal: McGill-Queen's Press. Samuel de Champlain built a temporary fort in 1611. He established a fur-trading post where present-day Pointe-√†-Calli√®re stands as part of a project to create a French colonial empire. He and his crew spent a few weeks clearing a site that he named Place Royale, dug two gardens and planted seed that grew well, confirming the fertility of the soil. In 1613, Samuel de Champlain returned to Place Royale and Sault-au-R√©collet. In 1641, some fifty French settlers, both men and women - recruited in France by J√©r√¥me Le Royer de la Dauversi√®re, of Anjou, on behalf of the Soci√©t√© de Notre-Dame de Montr√©al - set sail for New France. They hoped to convert the natives and create a model Catholic community. After a long crossing and a number of stops, the small group, led by Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, of Champagne, arrived in Quebec with approximately 40 men, three arriving with their wives; Jean Gorry with Isabeau Panie, Antoine Damien with Marie Joly, and Nicolas God√© with Francoise Gadois and their four children; Francois (age 21), Francoise (age 15), Nicolas (age 13), and Mathurine (age 5). The God√©s are often referred to as the \\"First Family of Montreal\\". There was also an unmarried woman, Catherine Lezeau. Winter was spent on the land of Pierre de Puiseaux near Sillery.  Ville-Marie  Between 1642 and 1676, this was the location of annual fur-trading meets, as Amerindians brought their pelts to trade for various goods with the French. When the settlement was being laid out by the Sulpicians in the late 1600s, they reserved a small plot of land along the river's shore for use as a public market, and it was known as the Place du March√©.Alfaro, Devin. \\"Old Montreal‚Äôs forgotten public square\\", Spacing, (Montreal), January 3, 2011 In May 1642, the group left Quebec to go to the Island of Montreal in spite of the efforts by the Montmagny governor to have them settle on the Island of Orleans. They arrived on May 17. Mrs. De la Peltrine, her lady-in-waiting Charlotte Barre, as well as Jeanne Mance, were part of this trip.\\"Ville-Marie\\", Old Montreal Francois God√© remained in Quebec and did not make the inaugural journey to Montreal. The new arrivals set to work to build the Ville-Marie fort on the spot where Champlain had once stayed. The fort housed as many as 50 early colonists. The first governor was Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. The French and the Dutch (of Fort Orange and New Amsterdam) were primarily interested in fur trading. The Iroquois had allied with the Dutch of Fort Orange and New Amsterdam, who supplied arms to them. In 1641 the war with the Iroquois began. By 1643, Ville-Marie had already been hit by Iroquois raids. In 1649, the situation was so critical that Maisonneuve went back to France to get help. In 1653, to confront this Iroquois danger, a group of 100 settler-soldiers came to stay in Ville-Marie. With them were 15 King's Daughters placed under the care of Marguerite Bourgeoys. Jeanne Mance would set up the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al hospital in Montreal. In the first years, the H√¥tel-Dieu was hosted inside the fort. By 1685, Ville-Marie had a population of some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. The parish church and the seminary of the Sulpician fathers, seigneurs of the Island, dominated the little town. Most business was transacted in the Marketplace, located just next to the mouth of the little river. Here Montrealers and Amerindians would meet to trade. The fort, in use between 1642 and 1674, was demolished in 1688 and the entire settlement was walled and bastioned during the Indian war. The Louis-Hector de Calli√®re residence was built on this place in 1695. In 1705, the settlement was officially renamed Montreal. In 2007, an archaeological dig uncovered the remains of Ville-Marie under a maritime warehouse in Montreal.Montpetit, Jonathan. \\"Dig uncovers 1642 Montreal site\\", Canadian Press, August 20, 2007 In 2015, an archaeological dig uncovered one of the corner posts of the fort.https://pacmusee.qc.ca/en/exhibitions/detail/where-montreal-began/  Gallery  File:Montreal 1647.jpg|Ville-Marie in 1647 File:DollierRuesMontreal.jpg|Ville-Marie in 1672 File:Place Montreal 1675.jpg|Ville-Marie in 1675 File:Pointe-√†-Calli√®re sous-sol.jpg|Pointe-√†- Calli√®re archaeological site See also *The Citadel, Montreal *History of Montreal  References  External links * \\"375 years later, Montreal's lost Fort Ville-Marie resurfaces\\", Montreal Gazette, May 19, 2017 Category:History of Montreal Category:French forts in Canada Category:National Historic Sites in Quebec Category:Military forts in Quebec Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Montreal Category:Old Montreal Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1642 Category:Forts or trading posts on the National Historic Sites of Canada register Category:1642 establishments in the French colonial empire ","title":"Fort Ville-Marie"},{"id":"26056422","text":"Mount Saint Mary‚Äôs Abbey is a monastic community of some fifty Trappistine nuns in Wrentham, Massachusetts. The more complete, formal name of the Order is the Cistercians of the Strict Observance, whose founding at C√Æteaux, France dates back to 1098. This community follows the reforms of the Cistercian Order as established by the 17th-century Abbot Armand de Ranc√© at the Abbey of La Grande Trappe. This community was founded in 1949 by nuns of an Irish monastery, St. Mary‚Äôs Abbey, located in Glencairn, County Waterford. It was the first community of Cistercians nuns in the United States. The foundation was so successful that, by the mid-1950s, all of the Irish nuns had been recalled to their original community. Following the standard need of self- support, this community developed as their main means of income a line of candy for which they are noted. Recently the abbey had some wind turbines built, as part of their effort to help in their fuel needs and at being better stewards of the environment. The abbey partnered with Kearsarge Energy of Watertown to develop and lease 2 solar panel farms since 2013. The first produces 3.6 megawatts of direct current, the second produces 4.8 megawatts of direct current, covering 40 acres, of which the electricity is sold to neighboring Franklin, MA to provide 80% of the town's power. Combined with the wind turbines and the geothermal system, it is the first property in the state to have 3 renewable energy sources. With the steady growth of the community, new communities of the Order were founded by this abbey in Iowa (Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey, 1964), Arizona (Santa Rita Abbey, 1972) and Virginia (Our Lady of the Angels Monastery, 1987).

Biography Pierre-Etienne Bourgeois de Boynes. He was the eldest son of √âtienne Bourgeois de Boynes (1683‚Äì1754), Treasurer General of the Royal Bank, and his first wife, Helen Francine (1692‚Äì1722). Hee first married Mary Margaret Catherine Parat Montgeron (1737‚Äî1753) which he had a daughter, Marguerite (1753‚Äì1762). His first wife died in childbirth; he married his second wife, Charlotte Louise Desgots (1740‚Äì1804) who gave him seven children: * Elizabeth Louise (1764‚Äì1853) (Comtesse de Bourbon-Busset); * Stephen Angel (1766‚Äì1795); * Fran√ßois Etienne (1767‚Äì1792); * Antoine Pierre Philibert (1769‚Äì1803); * Antoine Pierre Louis (1770‚Äì1792); * Charlotte Hermine (1773‚Äì1825) (Marquise de Saint-Phalle); * Armand Louis Fran√ßois (1775‚Äì1853) Of recent nobility, his father had acquired nobility through the purchasing office of secretary of the King, he owed his career to the protection of the Marshal de Belle-Isle. Master of requests in 1745 he became intendant of Franche-Comt√© in 1754, and at the same time, was appointed first president of the Parliament of Besan√ßon, overlapping functions normally in Provence. There was a particularly strong parliamentary revolt on 20 and January 21, 1759. Thirty parliamentarians were exiled by lettres de cachet. But Choiseul reversed policy, and the exiles were recalled, in April 1761. He retired to the Franche-Comt√©. He was appointed advisor of state a month later. Because the castle was not far from Malesherbes, he participated in secret negotiations initiated by Choiseul, with whom he remained on good terms, to a point as Keeper of the Seals of France Chancellor Lamoignon. Considered one of the best minds of the Council, he was especially capable in contentious matters; he was among those who helped the chancellor Maupeou to prepare the coup majesty of 1770. According to Baron Besenval, it was he who had the idea to replace the Parliament of Paris by the Grand Council, an idea which was the starting point for reform. His record is controversial. He undertook a number of useful reforms. He ordered shipments of Kerguelen in the Indian Ocean (which gave the name of the minister to two small islands of Kerguelen), and created an institution in Madagascar. He organized the first major naval fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic Ocean. He tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a school in Le Havre intended for the training of officers, companies of marine guards. But he also wanted to reform the navy by modeling his organization on that of the Army (Ordinance 1772), without a glimpse of the differences that made it impossible model. The situation continued to deteriorate under his ministry, with a shipbuilding downturn, declining stocks of materials, difficulties in the maintenance of the fleet. In terms of policy, he took his distance from politics of Maupeou from late 1771 or early 1772. On April 20, 1774, he was appointed Minister of State. But with the advent of Louis XVI, was condemned for his association with the Maurepas. It claimed he had disrupted his department and he was even accused of embezzlement. Louis XVI, for his part, had told him he thought the changes he had made in the navy had come to nothing. He was fired July 20, 1774 and replaced by Turgot.

Lewis. It was published in March 2009 by Oxford University Press. In addition to Lewis, other contributors to the book include J. Gordon Melton, William Sims Bainbridge, Douglas E. Cowan, David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe, James T. Richardson, and Susan J. Palmer. Scientology gives an overview and introduction to the organization, and presents an analysis of the movement from the perspective of sociology. The book compares the organization to other religious movements, and goes over its history of controversy. It delves into the practices of the organization and activities of its missions. Scientology was given an unfavorable review in the International Journal of Cultic Studies, which considered the book unduly biased in Scientology's favour, a view echoed in a review in satirical magazine Private Eye. It received a positive review in Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review, describing it as \\"the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology\\" to date, a book to be read by journalists and academics alike, and \\"the most important collection of scholarly articles on Scientology published so far ‚Äì in any language\\". Editor At the time of the book's publication, James R. Lewis was employed as a lecturer in the subject of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point. Contents Contributors to the book include: J. Gordon Melton, James R. Lewis, William Sims Bainbridge, Douglas E. Cowan, David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe, James T. Richardson, and Susan J. Palmer. Billed by Oxford University Press as \\"the only comprehensive resource for scholars, students, and others interested in this controversial and little- understood religious movement\\", Scientology is organized into seven main parts (discounting the introduction and appendix), each containing several essays. Part I, \\"Introductory Essays\\", presents an overview and introduction to Scientology and the life of its founder. The second part covers \\"Theoretical and Quantitative Approaches\\", examining Scientology's soteriology as well as the degree to which Scientology can be said to be growing. The third part focuses on the \\"Community and Practices\\" of Scientology, while the fourth part, \\"Sources and Comparative Approaches\\", examines Scientology's religious claims. Part V is focused on \\"Controversy\\", such as Scientology's battles with the anti-cult movement and court cases in different countries concerning Scientology's recognition or lack of recognition as a religion. The sixth part analyzes the organization's activities in its \\"International Missions\\", while the seventh examines \\"Dimensions of Scientology\\", including a chapter on the Xenu myth. Various chapters comment on Scientology's growth. Lewis puts forth the assertion that the religion is growing at a \\"healthy‚Äîbut not a spectacular‚Äîrate\\" (22 percent over the period from 1990 to 2001, from 45,000 to 55,000 according to an American survey of religious self-identification), and states that contrary to the Church's own claims, it is \\"clearly not the world's fastest growing\\". William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist, asserts that Scientology has experienced growth along the West Coast of the United States. Bainbridge looked at statistical data on the percentage of websites managed by Scientologists, and his studies revealed that the most significant portion was in the Pacific Northwest and the state of California. According to Bainbridge, the experience of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in science fiction writing combined with the Church of Scientology's skill with the \\"emerging cyberculture\\" might lead to ways that the organization can change in a future that further utilizes technology. In a section of the book on dealings of the organization in Denmark, researchers found that there was a decrease in the number of people joining the organization, and that the number of dedicated Scientologists in the country remained steady for the past two decades. University of Copenhagen researchers Rie Wallendorf and Peter B. Andersen write that the Church of Scientology in Denmark is wary of those external to the organization, and that this detracts from the likelihood that new members will join. Charles De Gaulle University researcher R√©gis Dericquebourg writes that when compared to the Scientology practice of \\"Auditing\\", other ceremonies carried out by the organization have more restricted levels of participation. According to Dericquebourg, these Scientology ceremonies include social functions which are frequented mainly by \\"elite members\\". University Michel de Montaigne researcher Bernardette Rigal-Cellard investigated the various Scientology missions and determined that these missions operated with a United States-based type of methodology. This form of organizational structure and operational tactics is seen as not working well in areas where the U.S. is not seen favorably, including sections of Western Europe, but agreeable to locations sympathetic to American culture. Critical reception Reviews in scholarly journals Review by Terra Manca Scientology was given a negative review by Terra Manca writing in the International Journal of Cultic Studies, the journal of the International Cultic Studies Association. Manca wrote, \\"it is most likely to please persons who take an uncritical view of Scientology.\\" Of the lack of standards of research utilized in the book, the review stated, \\"far too many contributors in this volume fail to critically assess the data that they gather, thereby falling short of providing evidence that has undergone rigorous academic inquiry. Without rigor or critical assessment, a book such as this one (about a supposed new religious movement [NRM]) risks becoming pro-NRM propaganda.\\" Manca's review put forth the argument, \\"although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization.\\" Manca criticized the book for failing to include substantive analysis of several aspects within the controversial history of the Scientology organization, including its treatment in countries Germany and Belgium; lack of discussion regarding Scientology programs including Narconon, Criminon, World Literacy Crusade, and Applied Scholastics; dearth of coverage regarding use within the organization of the Suppressive Person jargon and related practice of Disconnection; scarcity of commentary on the successor to the organization's intelligence agency Guardian's Office with the Office of Special Affairs, and failure to cite critical scholarship on the subject matter. Manca noted that aside from simply neglecting to utilize key academic scholarship on the topic, the authors of chapters within Scientology also failed to seriously analyze material received from primary-sources including Scientology organization representatives. The review asserted, \\"This lack of critical inquiry leads to some conclusions that appear biased, involves the use of polarized language, and significantly diminishes the quality of information that might have challenged Scientology's claims regarding itself and its founder.\\" The review criticized Scientology for the fact that two contributors had added a reference to Wikipedia to their essays ‚Äì \\"citing questionable sources can produce questionable results, which in turn can discredit the value of academic research\\". Manca questioned the judgement of the book's publisher for allowing this type of writing practice, \\"It is surprising that editors at Oxford University Press allow Wikipedia to stand as an appropriate scholarly source in this or any volume.\\" The International Journal of Cultic Studies book review observed that the researchers were not removed in expressed point-of-view from the topic they wrote about, \\"Despite Lewis's claims, he and many of his contributors fail to remain neutral\\". Manca did not recommend the book for research on the Scientology organization, \\"Because of its numerous and varied shortcomings, this new book on Scientology is a poor sourcebook on the organization.\\" Manca wrote that due to the poor quality of the work, the book itself could be cited as an example of problematic research, \\"Oddly enough, because of its numerous shortfalls and biases, Scientology may be useful to anyone who is studying the pro- cult/counter-cult debate and who wants to see numerous examples of biased scholarship by apparently polarized researchers.\\" The review concluded, \\"As a reference for inquiry into Scientology, however, this book fails on many fronts.\\" Review by Marco Frenschkowski A 30-page review by the German Protestant theologian and history of religion scholar Marco Frenschkowski in Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review stated that the book \\"simply put is the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far\\", adding that \\"this does not mean it will not be controversial, or that every statement in the book holds up to scrutiny.\\" Describing it as a \\"serious attempt at bringing together what different fields of cultural studies (not just religious studies) can say about the most controversial of NRMs\\", the review pointed out that the contributors came from three continents and a variety of scholarly backgrounds, covering not only religious studies, but also such fields as sociology, psychology, philosophy, and judicial and cultural studies, helping it \\"to overcome the Americocentric and 'NRM- specialists' point of view\\". Frenschkowski lauded Lewis's introduction, in which Lewis notes scholars' reluctance to publish Scientology research, given the organization's reputation as \\"a litigious organization, ready to sue anyone who dares criticize the Church\\", and addresses Scientologists' tendency to misunderstand the nature of the academic process. Frenschkowski described Melton's chapter as finding \\"a fine balance between critical observations and giving due weight to the point of view of devoted Scientologists [...] This does not mean defending Scientology: it means taking both members and critics seriously.\\" Frenschkowski welcomed Rothstein's chapter on the Xenu myth as an \\"important study\\", stating that it \\"defines a very good starting point for further research\\". He commented that Rothstein was right to praise \\"the anonymous Wikipedia article on the subject\\", a fact that was reflective of \\"the deeply unsatisfying state of affairs\\" that to date there had been not a single peer-reviewed journal article covering the topic. However, he wished Rothstein had contextualized the myth more with Hubbard's other space opera writings, and the science fiction field in general, and suggested more work needed to be done on this. Frenschkowski listed some minor errors in the anthology, said he regretted the absence of a glossary, and was critical of the fact that there were several overlaps between various chapters; however, his main point of criticism was that apart from some new data based on the quantitative sociological approach, the book mainly presented overviews of data already known, stating that \\"this does not diminish the value of this fine collection, but the next academic publications on Scientology should not be once again overviews but monographs on special questions\\", \\"more specialized, in-depth studies on concepts, ideas and practices working with new data\\". Towards the end of his review, Frenschkowski recalls the editor's prediction, made in the introduction, that the book would \\"likely end up pleasing no one engaged in the Scientology/anti-Scientology conflict, which is perhaps as it should be\\". Summing up, Frenschkowski states that the book pleased him, at any rate, and that he wished for it to be \\"read not just by academics but also e.g. by journalists [...]. It is the most important collection of articles on Scientology published so far ‚Äì in any language.\\" Other reviews The book received a critical analysis in the British satirical and current affairs magazine Private Eye. The review criticized the book for its unusually sympathetic tone and for not mentioning numerous notable controversies surrounding Scientology. Private Eye was critical of the book's presentation of asserted facts regarding the life of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, as given in two separate instances in the book by contributors J. Gordon Melton and David G. Bromley. Melton stated his contribution gave, \\"an overview of the life of L. Ron Hubbard anchored by the general agreed facts\\", and Bromley asserted, \\"Although the basic outline of L. Ron Hubbard's life is not contested, the LRH persona has been a subject of particularly intense debate. Church critics have charged that many of the claims that Hubbard made about his own life and accomplishments are empirically false.\\" The Private Eye review called this notion \\"poppycock\\", writing, \\"Everything about Scientology's founder is contested, though no one reading this book would realise that.\\" As an example of disputed material about Hubbard's life, the review contrasted assertions by Melton about the military career of L. Ron Hubbard with documented United States Navy records cited by author Russell Miller in the biography, Bare-Faced Messiah. The Private Eye review concluded by criticizing Oxford University Press for publishing the book: \\"What is utterly mystifying is why one of the oldest and most respected publishing houses in the world chooses to give its imprimatur to this tendentious drivel.\\" When questioned by Private Eye, a spokesman for Oxford University Press responded, \\"Certainly this book was peer-reviewed.\\" Private Eye joked that the peer reviewers of the book may have been controversial figures Lord Archer and Lord Black. Richard Cimino, founder and editor of the Religioscope Institute-published newsletter Religion Watch, wrote that the book \\"focuses less on the church's abuses than on its organizational dynamics and teachings, although its authors do broach controversial issues.\\" Cimino commented that the book is \\"divided about whether the movement and its distinctive blend of science, psychotherapy and esoteric religion is growing\\". In an article about Scientology by B.A. Robinson at the website of the organization Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, Scientology is listed as a \\"recommended book\\".

The Jeverland was formed in the 15th century from the Barony of Jever, which itself descended from the Banter Viertel, part of √ñstringen and the Wangerland. The town of Wilhelmshaven, founded in 1853, no longer belongs to Jeverland, but is an independent district. Despite that, the formerly independent church parishes of Heppens und Neuende are on the town's territory. In earlier times, agriculture was the mainstay of Jeverland's economy. Trade was chiefly handled by the small coastal 'sluice' ports (Sielhafen) of Hooksiel, R√ºstringersiel and Mariensiel. The state of Kniphausen, which was for a time entirely politically independent, was also located in Jeverland along with its two ports of Inhausersiel and Kniphausersiel.

It is the top title on the NXT brand. The current champion is Finn B√°lor, who is in his record-tying second reign. Introduced on August 1, 2012, it was the first title established for NXT, which at the time was a developmental territory for WWE. The inaugural champion was Seth Rollins. NXT eventually became WWE's third main brand in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the USA Network.  History  The inaugural NXT Champion Seth Rollins In June 2012, WWE established NXT as their developmental territory, replacing Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). On July 1, the NXT Championship was introduced as the brand's top championship, as well as its first title, in turn replacing the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship that had been retired along with the FCW territory. NXT Commissioner Dusty Rhodes announced an eight-man single- elimination tournament, dubbed the \\"Gold Rush\\" tournament, involving four wrestlers from NXT and four wrestlers from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Champion. On the July 26 taping of NXT (aired August 29), Seth Rollins defeated Jinder Mahal in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion. On November 19, 2016, at TakeOver: Toronto, Samoa Joe became the first performer to hold the championship on more than one occasion. After Drew McIntyre won the title in 2017, it was briefly referred to as a world championship, but has not been officially classified as such. In September 2019, the NXT brand itself became WWE's third major brand when it was moved to the USA Network. Inaugural tournament  Belt design The original NXT Championship belt featured a simple design. The large gold center plate was the letter \\"X\\". On the center left side of the X was a smaller letter \\"N\\" while on the opposing right side was the letter \\"T\\". The belt contained six total side plates, three sitting on either side of the center plate; each side plate only featured the WWE logo. When first introduced, the side plates had the WWE scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre- existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network. The plates were on a large black leather strap. On WrestleMania weekend 2017, all existing NXT title belts at the time were redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at TakeOver: Orlando that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. Like the previous design, the plates are gold and on a black leather strap. The letter \\"X\\" again dominates the center plate with smaller letters \\"N\\" and \\"T\\" sitting on the left and right sides, respectively. On this new design, however, the letters are on an octagonal shaped plate. Above the \\"X\\" is the WWE logo, while below the \\"X\\" is a banner that reads \\"Champion\\". Simple ornamentation with some silver fills in the rest of the plate. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championships, the new design includes side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.  Reigns  As of , , there have been 21 reigns among 18 different champions and two vacancies. Samoa Joe, Shinsuke Nakamura and Finn B√°lor are tied with the most reigns at two. Adam Cole's reign is the longest singular reign at 396 days (403 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay) making it the only reign running a continuous year, while Karrion Kross' reign is the shortest at 4 days (3 days as recognized by WWE) as he had to relinquish the title due to a legitimate injury he suffered in winning it. Bo Dallas holds the record as the youngest champion, winning the title two days before his 23rd birthday, while Bobby Roode is the oldest champion, winning the title at 39. Finn B√°lor is the current champion in his record- tying second reign. He won the title by defeating Adam Cole in a sudden death match for the vacant championship (after the two had tied the previous week in a 60-minute fatal four-way iron man match that was originally for the vacant title and had also involved Tommaso Ciampa and Johnny Gargano) at NXT Super Tuesday II on September 8, 2020 in Winter Park, Florida; previous champion Karrion Kross had relinquished the title due to suffering a legitimate injury.

History It runs from the east end of St Mary's Churchyard to Weekday Cross. Around 1681 a row of houses was constructed on the south side of St Mary's Churchyard. They existed until they were pulled down around 1792 when the street was widened. A new wall was constructed along the south side of the churchyard. In 1799, the name of a portion of the street between Short Hill and St Mary's Gate was called \\"St Mary's Church Side\\". The name didn't take and was abandoned about 1815.

However arguably not a town house given the scale and layout across six storeys partly underground; conceivably erected specifically for commercial use in the lace or textile trade. There is machinery in the cellars and a hoist for the carriage of goods in the loft area with trapdoors evident below. More recently used as accountant's offices for Prior & Palmer in conjunction with the No.56 building but internally many alterations have erased much of the interior including no sign of the original staircase. Whilst the loft area is broadly in a close to original state (with exposed reed walls, blue distemper surfaces and original floors) the other storeys have been remodelled and with only small areas of detail such as coving evident behind suspended ceilings. Repaired in recent years and used as offices and, with No.56 next door, in November 2007 was renamed formally as Lace Market House and developed as a business centre serving the newly evolving Nottingham Creative Quarter. Closed down (December 2017) pending conversion as part of a larger residential development scheme.

From there can be seen some iron steps and below there some lower storeys. The front of No.54 has cellars carved from the sandstone which were used in part for the storage of coal; the architecture in this area only one floor below is curious in retaining evidence of a different layout to that currently including a redundant stone lintel. There are bricked up areas that appear not to have been recently explored but to the rear extensive work has taken place to create an additional office space with evidence of further unexplored spaces below. *56.

Closed down (December 2017) pending conversion by the owners as part of a larger residential development scheme and sold to new developers later that year. There is a simple cave system underneath comprising a passageway and bricked up alcoves leading to a chamber close to the cliff edge to the south. The chamber is fitted with brick built bins but mainly filled with building rubble which is likely to have arisen from the demolition some time ago of the properties above, being a row of houses fronting the ancient street called Mailn Hill. The whole flattened area was used for parking by Lace Market House but now stands empty awaiting redevelopment. The main listed building despite many internal alterations has a good main staircase plus side stairs and various areas where original coving etc remains. There are two good plaster relief ceiling roses in the main area and some Georgian wooden cupboards of note in a private office. A substantial rear extension comprising a meeting hall and upper rooms dating from Victorian times may have been used for parish council or ecclesiastical purposes and shows evidence to the rear of a separate entrance. The ground floor hall was used part-time until its closure by a religious group which held services on Wednesdays and Sundays.

Background After the ending of the Finnish Civil War in 1918, thousands of Red Guards fled to Russia, mostly to Saint Petersburg. The leaders of the Guard lived lavishly, spending their time in the best hotels and restaurants of Saint Petersburg. They had millions of Finnish marks worth of foreign exchange that they had stolen from the Bank of Finland. Many other Finnish Communists who had fled to Soviet Russia were living in very poor conditions, and those who openly criticized party leaders were discharged from the party. The party began to schism into so-called \\"revolver oppositions\\", whose target was to remove the gap between the leaders and the supporters by open violence. Deaths * Tuomas W.

The shooters wrote letters describing their motives, and then surrendered voluntarily to militia. In 1922, they were convicted; Voitto Eloranta, who was not even present at the shooting scene, was sentenced to death as the organizer, and the others were sentenced to three to five years in prison in Buryatia. Eventually, the death sentence of Eloranta was commuted, and by July 1922, all the shooters were released from jail. Eloranta, however, was executed in 1923 after Eino Rahja lobbied the reconsideration of the commutations. Eloranta's wife Elvira Willman was executed in April 1925.

Officially spun off from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) in 1995, it provides Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) tools for semiconductor device and process simulations. Crosslight's founder, Dr. Z.M. Simon Li (ÊùéÊπõÊòé), is a pioneer in the field of optoelectronic device simulation TCAD and based on this work, Crosslight claims to be the first commercial vendor of TCAD tools for quantum well laser diodes. Crosslight also licenses other technology from the Stanford University TCAD Group for semiconductor process simulations. History After its initial spin-off from the NRC, Crosslight launched its flagship product LASTIP, a 2D simulator for quantum well laser diodes. Based on its founder's research, LASTIP predates other well-known tools in the field such as MINILASE. By adding the ability to model quantum well active regions, LASTIP was also a significant step-up from earlier comparable efforts such as Hitachi's HILADIES. As early laser diode TCAD tools were primarily developed by individual researchers for their own use, Crosslight claims that LASTIP's commercialization makes them first-to-market in this field. Further improvements in the technology followed including the development of PICS3D for 3D modeling of optoelectronic devices, a feat which earned Crosslight the Laser Focus World Commercial Technology Achievement Award in 1998. For non- laser TCAD applications such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes, a third tool called APSYS was developed. In March 2004, Crosslight licensed the legendary 2D process simulator SUPREM-IV.GS http://www- tcad.stanford.edu/tcad/programs/suprem-IV.GS/Book.html from Stanford University and extended it to 3D as the core of its process simulation tool CSUPREM. In January 2010, Crosslight entered into a partnership with Acceleware with the intention of producing greater speed in thin film solar cell and image pixel sensor simulations. Since its founding, Crosslight has build up a worldwide base of industrial and academic users and has sponsored research and academic projects at various universities and research institutes.

It includes optical gain models for quantum well/wire/dot with different types of spectral broadening, Coulomb interaction for many-body effects, k.p non-parabolic subbands and models optical mode competition in structures supporting multiple lateral modes. PICS3D Photonic Integrated Circuit Simulator in 3D, is a state of the art 3D-simulator for surface and edge emission laser diodes, SOA and other similar active waveguide devices. 2/3 dimensional semiconductor equations (drift-diffusion) are coupled to the optical modes in both the lateral and longitudinal directions. Optical properties such as quantum well/wire/dot optical gain and spontaneous emission rates are computed self-consistently. APSYS Advanced Physical Models of Semiconductor Devices, is based on 2D/3D finite element analysis of electrical, optical and thermal properties of compound semiconductor devices with an emphasis on band structure engineering and quantum mechanical effects. Unlike other TCAD tools used in the microelectronics industry, silicon is merely a special case of a more generalized semiconductor material library. CSUPREM (Crosslight-SUPREM) is a 3D process simulation software package based on the SUPREM.IV.GS code developed at the Integrated Circuits Laboratory of Stanford University. PROCOM (PROcesses of COMpounds) is a 2/3-dimensional process simulation software package for compound semiconductor growth by Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). Given the deposition reactor geometry, chemical species and growth condition parameters, PROCOM predicts the semiconductor film growth rate, composition, thickness uniformity, dopant incorporation and defect distribution based on detailed chemical kinetics and mass/heat transfer models.

It is one of a select group of standard texts that have been included in all four of Everyman's Library (1935), the New American Library of World Literature (1961), Oxford World's Classics (1984), and Penguin Classics (1998). With its rigorous psychological analysis and criticism of contemporary attitudes to sexuality, it has been seen by some critics as the first modern novel in English literature.Martin Tucker (ed.) The Critical Temper: A Survey of Modern Criticism on English and American Literature From the Beginnings to the Twentieth Century (New York: Ungar, 1969‚Äì1989) vol. 4, p. 449; Donald D. Stone Novelists in a Changing World: Meredith, James, and the Transformation of English Fiction in the 1880s (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1972) p. 102; Richard C. Stevenson The Experimental Impulse in George Meredith's Fiction (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 2004) p. 41.  Synopsis  Sir Austin Feverel's wife deserts him to run away with a poet, leaving her husband to bring up their boy Richard. Believing schools to be corrupt, Sir Austin, a scientific humanist, educates the boy at home with a plan of his own devising known as \\"the System\\". This involves strict authoritarian supervision of every aspect of the boy's life, and in particular the prevention of any meeting between Richard and girls of his own age. Richard nevertheless meets and falls in love with Lucy Desborough, the niece of a neighboring farmer. Sir Austin finds out and, disapproving of her humble birth, forbids them to meet again, but they secretly marry. Sir Austin now tries to retrieve the situation by sending Richard to London. Here, however, Sir Austin's friend Lord Mountfalcon successfully sets a courtesan to seduce Richard, hoping that this will leave Lucy open to seduction by himself. Ashamed of his own conduct, Richard flees abroad where he at length hears that Lucy has given birth to a baby and has been reconciled to Sir Austin. He returns to England and, hearing about Lord Mountfalcon's villainy, challenges him to a duel. But this goes badly: Richard is seriously wounded. Lucy is so overcome by this turn of events that she loses her mind and dies.  Origins  In 1856 George Meredith's wife Mary began an affair with the artist Henry Wallis. In the following year, pregnant by Wallis, she ran away to join him, leaving her son Arthur behind. Meredith undertook to bring the child up. The parallels with the opening chapters of the novel are obvious, though Sir Austin is certainly not intended as a self- portrait.H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. 37, pp. 862‚Äì863. Meredith was equivocal in his attitude to Sir Austin's favourite educational theories, which, it has been shown, derived largely from the medical writer William Acton's Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social & Sanitary Aspects (1857) and The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs (1857), from Herbert Spencer's essay \\"Moral Education\\" (Quarterly Review, April 1858), and from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel √âmile.Edward Mendelson (ed.) The Ordeal of Richard Feverel (London: Penguin, 1998) pp. xvi‚Äìxix.  Reception  The Ordeal of Richard Feverel was first published in 1859 by Chapman & Hall in three volumes. The book received generally respectful reviews, though critics were often puzzled by Meredith's rather dense style, and did not all agree in their reading of the book's message, or their estimation of the author's success in presenting it.Ioan Meredith (ed.) George Meredith: The Critical Heritage (London: Routledge, 1996) pp. 61‚Äì85. The book's commercial success, as with all Victorian novels, depended in large measure on the number of copies bought by the various commercial lending libraries, but the largest of them all, Mudie's, took fright at the sexual frankness of the novel and refused to stock it, casting a taint of unrespectability over Meredith's name that lasted for many years. \\"I am tabooed from all decent drawing-room tables\\", Meredith wrote, but he refused to tone down the offending passages.H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. vol. 37, pp. 862‚Äì863. Chapman & Hall left the book unreprinted for nearly twenty years, and when in 1878 Meredith produced a revised (but not bowdlerized) version it was published by another firm, Kegan Paul. From the mid-1880s onward Meredith's reputation as a serious novelist reached such a level as to ensure a stream of reprints.Catalogue entry at Copac. For the past hundred years Richard Feverel, with all its faults, has been considered one of Meredith's finest works, its status as a forerunner of many later developments in the novel being widely recognized. Arnold Bennett wrote, \\"In Richard Feverel, what a loosening of the bonds! What a renaissance!‚Ä¶It was the announcer of a sort of dawn\\", while acknowledging that \\"It is a weak book, full of episodic power and overloaded with wit.\\" Sharon K. Hall and Dennis Poupard (eds.) Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism (Detroit: Gale Research, 1985) vol. 17, p. 265. J. B. Priestley wrote that \\"So far as English fiction is concerned...there can be no doubt that the modern novel began with the publication of The Ordeal of Richard Feverel.\\" Martin Tucker (ed.) The Critical Temper: A Survey of Modern Criticism on English and American Literature From the Beginnings to the Twentieth Century (New York: Ungar, 1969-1989) vol. 4, p. 449. Virginia Woolf's assessment was that: > He makes no attempt to preserve the sober reality of Trollope and Jane > Austen; he has destroyed all the usual staircases by which we have learnt to > climb. And what is done so deliberately is done with a purpose. This > defiance of the ordinary, these airs and graces, the formality of the > dialogue with its Sirs and Madams are all there to create an atmosphere that > is unlike that of daily life, to prepare the way for a new and an original > sense of the human scene. And again: > The book is cracked through and through with those fissures which come when > the author seems to be of twenty minds at the same time. Yet it succeeds in > holding miraculously together, not certainly by the depths and originality > of its character drawing but by the vigour of its intellectual power and by > its lyrical intensity.Sharon K. Hall and Dennis Poupard (eds.) Twentieth- > Century Literary Criticism (Detroit: Gale Research, 1985) vol. 17, p. 273. Legacy The Ordeal of Richard Feverel is referred to in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel Howards End. The aspirational character Leonard Bast mentions that it inspired him to leave London and take an all night walk into the countryside, because he \\"wanted to get back to the earth...like Richard does in the end.\\" It was referred to again in the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of Howards End, in which Leonard discreetly reads a passage from Richard Feverel at his work and dreams of walking in a bluebell wood. Helen later reads the passage out loud when Leonard mentions it as his inspiration for his all-night walk.

It was programmed by David Crane, who later wrote Pitfall!. The object of the game is to either beat the player's opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time, depending on the settings used. Dragster is an unauthorized adaptation of the 1977 Kee Games coin-op Drag Race. Reception Dragster was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as having \\"an interesting premise\\" and as being \\"undeniably clever and, with a lot of patience, ... probably fun\\" but the reviewers also called it the \\"least\\" of Activision's early Atari 2600 releases. Specific criticism was given to the \\"clumsy\\" and \\"annoying\\" gameplay mechanics, and the game design was characterized as \\"ill-suited to the Atari control system\\". World record and controversy In 1982, video gamer Todd Rogers claimed to have set the world record for Dragster with a time of 5.51 seconds. Until January 29, 2018 this claim was accepted by video game record-keeping organization Twin Galaxies, and Guinness World Records, which later also recognized the achievement as the longest-standing video-game world record. Rogers had previously said that the way he achieved the record was by putting the car into second gear as the countdown timer reaches zero. Eric \\"OmniGamer\\" Koziel, a speedrunner and creator of tool-assisted speedruns, analyzed the code of the game. He did not find anything that would enable shifting up from first gear during the countdown and he determined the best possible time is 5.57. On January 29, 2018, the Twin Galaxies administrative staff removed all of Todd Rogers' records and banned him from participating in their competitive leaderboards. Guinness World Records also removed the score from its database and revoked his Guinness World Record for the longest-standing video game high score. The world record is 5.57 seconds which has been achieved by multiple players.

Brocken Brunswick Land () is a historical region in the Southeast of the German state of Lower Saxony, centred around the city of Braunschweig. It refers to the core territory of the historic Duchy of Brunswick and its successor, the Free State of Brunswick, which was disestablished in 1946. Geography The area stretches from the Harz mountain range in the south along the Oker river down to the Burgdorf-Peine Geest in the North German Plain. The natural landscape includes the Elm, Asse and Salzgitter Hills, the Hainberg and Vorholz ranges in the west, as well as the Harly Forest. Cities and districts of the Braunschweig Region Today Brunswick Land roughly corresponds to the central parts of the former Lower Saxon Verwaltungsbezirk Braunschweig in its pre-1978 borders, including: * the independent cities of Braunschweig, Salzgitter, and Wolfsburg * at least parts of the districts of Gifhorn, Goslar, Helmstedt, Peine, and Wolfenb√ºttel. The district of Holzminden, part of the Free State of Brunswick until 1941, today belongs to the neighbouring South Lower Saxony region. Likewise, the eastern Brunswick exclaves of Calv√∂rde and Blankenburg today are part of Saxony-Anhalt, while the northwestern exclave of Thedinghausen belongs to Verden district. On that basis and excluding several unincorporated territories in the Harz mountains, the region has an area of and a population of 1,115,876. The population density, at 237 people/km¬≤, is higher than the Lower Saxon and the German average. Away from the main cities, the region encompasses large agricultural areas. The traffic infrastructure relies on numerous railway lines and controlled-access highways such as Bundesautobahn 2 and Bundesautobahn 39. The main employer in the region is Volkswagen headquartered in Wolfsburg. Important educational facilities include the Braunschweig University of Technology, the Clausthal University of Technology, the Braunschweig University of Art, the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, as well as the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel. Other institutions include the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection in Salzgitter, as well as Braunschweig locations of the German Aerospace Center, the Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants (Julius-K√ºhn-Institut) and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health. Regional associations The Brunswick Landscape Association (Verein Braunschweigische Landschaft) with its seat in Braunschweig was established in 1990. As a cultural-political organisation, it has set itself the aim of promoting the identity of Brunswick Land and ties between the populations and their history after the foundation of the state of Lower Saxony. The effective area covers the central territories around the cities of Braunschweig, Salzgitter and Wolfsburg as well as the adjacent districts of Helmstedt, Peine and Wolfenb√ºttel. The association uses a silhouette of the Saxon Steed as its emblem. The cities and districts of the larger Braunschweig Region form the eastern part of the Hannover‚ÄìBraunschweig‚ÄìG√∂ttingen‚ÄìWolfsburg Metropolitan Region. The associated regional authorities closely cooperate in matters of regional planning and public transport.  Legends and traditions  Brunswick Lion The former Duchy of Brunswick arose in 1814 as successor of the Principality of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, which for centuries was ruled by the Welf descendants of Henry the Lion. He had received the Duchy of Saxony as an Imperial fief in 1142 and chose the City of Braunschweig as his residence. One of the most powerful German princes, he entered into a fierce conflict with the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa and finally was banned in 1180. He could only retain his allodial possessions around Brunswick and L√ºneburg, the nucleus of the later Welf duchy. Like the tales that refer to Henry the Lion (as rendered by Agostino Steffani's opera Henrico Leone), the legends about the medieval trickster Till Eulenspiegel from Kneitlingen, Brunswick Mum beer, or the alleged foundation of Braunschweig and Dankwarderode Castle by the Brunonid brothers Brun and Dankward, are rich in tradition.

For instance, he made one of the earliest null models in biogeography showing that - in records of plant or animal species over space - genera accumulate much faster than species and thereby refuting Paul Jaccard's interpretation of the species-to- genus ratio in Jaccard's dispute with Alvar Palmgren.

It was one of the numerous post-World War II small neighbourhood community malls that were built in the inner suburbs of Toronto where residential neighbourhoods were growing. All of these community plazas were strip malls with one or two anchors. By the 1990s, shopping trends changed to power centres anchored by big-box stores, and many of these community malls, such as Honeydale Mall in the Etobicoke area of Toronto, declined during this time. However, Bayview Village Mall stayed competitive as its owners frequently overhauled the property to keep up with current trends. To distinguish itself from larger shopping centres, the owners of Bayview Village gentrified and sought out high-end independent boutiques not available in larger malls. Bayview Village Mall was the host of the first GAP store in Canada. Bayview Village Mall is located in the affluent neighbourhood of Bayview Village where significant transit-oriented condominium development has enabled it to thrive despite being close to the larger Fairview Mall. Since its redevelopment in 1998, the tenants of the mall have become more exclusive and aimed at the more affluent shoppers from the nearby areas of Bayview Village, Willowdale, York Mills, the Bridle Path, and Lawrence Park. It contains the \\"only North American outpost\\" of a number of high-end fashion designers, as well as outlets for luxury American designers such as Brooks Brothers and a branch of the expensive Toronto grocery store Pusateri's. The target customer for the Bayview Village Shopping Centre is female, over 30 years old, with an annual household income of over . In 2013, the mall was conditionally sold for to a British Columbian property company. This was the biggest single property sale of 2013. Long time anchor store Kmart closed in 1998. The store was demolished and the location redeveloped to house a Chapters and a large LCBO store as well as additional mall space. In 2018, Chapters closed its doors and left the space vacant afterwards. As a result of changes proposed by the owner to develop the site, the LCBO store moved into the former Chapters location in 2019. Site Development In August 2017, the owners proposed a major development of the site to add three residential towers on retail podiums as well as some additional low rise townhouse development and additional retail shops. The towers will be located on the existing surface parking area and additional underground parking is planned. The proposal has been revised following community input to include more parkland. It is currently being considered by the city planning department.

Design and development The Macchi M.33 was a single-seat, wooden, shoulder-wing monoplane flying boat of very clean aerodynamic design for its time. Its cantilever wing was fairly thick and carried stabilizing floats on each side. Italy lacked competitive racing engines in 1925, so the M.33 was powered with a used 1923 Curtiss D-12 engine rated at 378 kilowatts (507 horsepower) in a streamlined nacelle mounted on struts above the fuselage and driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. The M.33 had a flat-plate radiator, a type that was obsolescent by 1925, rather than modern surface radiators.IPMS The Racing and Record Aircraft Special Interest Group Plastic Modelers Society The D-12 engines powering M.33s were worn-out and unreliable and lacked the power of newer foreign engines, and pilots reported that the aircraft suffered from wing flutter. Operational history Despite the M.33s shortcomings, Italy entered two of them in the 1925 Schneider Trophy race hosted by the United States at Baltimore, Maryland. The one piloted by Riccardo Morselli was scratched from the race because of engine ignition problems. Giovanni de Briganti piloted the other M.33; during the race he did not use full throttle out of fear for his aircrafts engine and wing problems, and was further delayed by a navigational error he made during the second lap of the seven-lap race. He came in third with an average speed of 271 kilometers per hour (168 miles per hour); this was well behind the second-place finisher, a British Gloster IIIA piloted by Hubert Broad which finished with an average speed of 321 kilometers per hour (199 miles per hour), and also behind the winner, an American Curtiss R3C-2 piloted by Jimmy Doolittle (1896-1993), which finished with an average speed of 374 kilometers per hour (233 miles per hour).

The show's second season premiered on October 2, 2011. On December 20, 2011, HBO announced the cancellation of the show citing failure to generate a large audience and buzz.

Trying to make a name for themselves in New York's competitive fashion scene, Ben Epstein (Greenberg) and his friend and business partner Cam Calderon (Rasuk) use their street knowledge and connections to bring their ambitions to fruition. With the help of Cam's cousin Rene (Guzman), who is trying to market his own high-energy drink, and their well-connected friend Domingo (\\"Kid Cudi\\"), the entrepreneurs set out to make it big, encountering obstacles along the way that will require all their ingenuity to overcome.

Notable Contributions   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. In a 2015 paper in Science Translational Medicine, Nath and colleagues proposed the controversial hypothesis that endogenous retroviruses may play a causal role in a subset of ALS cases.  Nodding Syndrome  Nodding syndrome is a form of epilepsy endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Accessed 20 September 2019 The cause of the disease remains unknown, however epidemiologic studies identified an association between nodding syndrome and river blindness, a disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. In a 2017 publication in the journal Science Translational Medicine, Dr. Nath and colleagues implicated an autoimmune reaction to O. volvulus as a potential cause of the disease. Honors In 2012, Nath was presented with the Pioneer in NeuroVirology Award by the International Society for NeuroVirology (ISNV) at the 11th International Symposium on NeuroVirology held in New York, New York, USA.

Gaden established Columbia's program in biochemical engineering. He remained at Columbia for 26 years as a teacher, researcher, and department chair, before becoming dean of the College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration at the University of Vermont in 1974. In 1979, he joined the engineering faculty at the University of Virginia as the Wills Johnson Professor of Chemical Engineering. In 1994 he retired from Virginia, becoming Wills Johnson Professor Emeritus. He died in 2012. Early life and education Gaden was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1923. He began attending Brooklyn Technical High School in 1936. He served in the Navy during World War II, where he attended Columbia University on an accelerated schedule, receiving a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. Gaden then served in the Pacific theater, before returning to Columbia to receive his master's degree and doctorate. Work and recognition Large-scale production of penicillin prompted Gaden's doctoral dissertation topic. Gaden's paper explained to chemical engineers the fundamentals of the scientific process behind penicillin production. It also helped them determine how to quantify the amount of oxygen they would need for an effective fermentation. Gaden presented the paper at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in 1950. It was later published in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Gaden spent a year as a researcher at Pfizer, Inc. before he was invited to return to Columbia University to establish its first biochemical engineering program. He twice chaired the school's Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. Gaden was known as a demanding teacher who expected much from the thousands of students whom he taught. In 1986 Gaden received the Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievement from Columbia University. A year later, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute awarded him an honorary doctorate. Gaden's interest in harnessing biological processes to produce chemicals led him to publish extensively and to found the international research journal Biotechnology and Bioengineering, which he edited for 25 years. Elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, he received AIChE's first Food, Pharmaceutical, and Bioengineering Award and its Founders Award in 1988. Later, he received the Chemical Engineering Lectureship Award from the American Society of Engineering Education. In 1994, Gaden was honored in a symposium presented by the American Chemical Society, where he also received the Marvin Johnson Award in recognition of his preeminent research contributions to modern biochemical technology. Retirement and death In 2009, Ohio University and the National Academy of Engineering recognized Gaden as the fifth recipient of the 2009 Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize, the world's top honor in bioengineering. Gaden volunteered to teach illiterate adults how to read and enjoyed birdwatching with his wife . Elmer Gaden Jr died on Saturday March 10, 2012.

Youth and Formation After studying at Downside Abbey and Stonyhurst College he joined the Society of Jesus on 7 September 1887. He followed the regular course of philosophical studies at St Mary‚Äôs Hall, Stonyhurst (1890-1893) and Theology with the French Jesuits, first at Jersey and then Lyons (1897‚Äì1901). He is ordained priest the 18 July 1900, in London.  Missionary calling Inspired by an uncle, missionary in South Africa, he writes in 1902 to the Superior General of the Jesuits, Luis Martin, offering to be sent to any mission land, China or ‚Äòthe wild Indians of Brazil‚Äô. The General leaves the decision to the local provincial who accedes to the desire of Cary-Elwes and sends him to British Guyana in 1904. After three years in Georgetown, headquarter of the British colony, Cary-Elwes is finally sent to the interior of the country. He is stationed first at Morawhanna, at the border of Venezuela where he does catechism and pastoral work. But a new mission is to be opened further south in Guyana, close to the Brazilian border. Cary-Elwes is chosen for the challenging task. In 1909 he travels through the Amazonian forest to reach the Takutu River. He is in Macushi and Wapishana territory, two Amerindian groups whose langue he learns. For two years he has to rely entirely on interpreters for communicating with them. But soon his progressive fluency in the languages allows him to make himself understood among the Patamona people who receive him well. He builds many simple houses and a few churches. Quite a few people receive baptism. His pastoral area covers through which he walks for hours and days, finding this more helpful for prayer: ¬´without a real spirit of prayer my life as a missionary would be impossible¬ª. His natural gentleness, prayerfulness and love for the Indians attracted people. Once he had mastered the Makushi language he used to sit long hours into the night, surrounded by men, women and children, talking, singing and instructing them in an informal way. Dearly loved and adopted by his Rupununi people he was called ‚ÄòLittle padre‚Äô, an affectionate title.  Return to England  In January 1923, struck by a severe mental breakdown that left him disoriented in the forest for several weeks he was taken back to Georgetown and repatriated to England. He recovered fairly well, but a return to Guyana was deemed unthinkable. His Rupununi congregation of Christians kept on asking news about his ‚ÄôLittle padre‚Äô but Cary-Elwes had to remain in England. For another 20 years he gave lectures, missions and retreats, and published his notes on the Makushi, and other tribal languages of the region. Keeping in touch with the mission he used to compose hymns in Wapishana. Cuthbert Cary-Elwes died in London on 23 August 1945.  Recognition  Acknowledging the great contribution the simple missionary made to the people of the Amazonian forest made, the Guyana postal department issued in 2007 a stamp in honour of the Missionary among the Amerindians.

The service allows users to see what others paid for any new or used vehicle in their local area and receive upfront prices from a network of over 15,000 TrueCar Certified Dealers. TrueCar is paid by dealerships so they can be introduced to and communicate with potential new and used car buyers. TrueCar reports its users purchase approximately 1 million cars from dealers in its network each year. The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, with a sales office Austin, TX. History  2005‚Äì2010: Early years  TrueCar was originally incorporated under the name \\"Zag.com Inc.\\" in Delaware in February 2005. Scott Painter and Tom Taira, along with other co-founders, started the business to provide white-label auto-buying programs to affinity groups. The company's initial partner was Capital One in order for its customers to arrange financing, access upfront pricing, and locate inventory online. Other TrueCar co-founders include Jim Nguyen, Oded Noy, and Bernie Brenner. After a year of development, Scott Painter and Tom Taira introduced TrueCar during the Techcrunch's Startup Battlefield in September 2008, launching it as a separate company from Zag.com. TrueCar gathers automotive retail transaction data from thousands of sources in order to enable consumers \\"to see what's paid\\" on any vehicle in the US. The two companies merged in 2010.  2011‚Äì2014: Pre-IPO  In January 2011, TrueCar released ClearBook, a used vehicle index that analyzes the used car market in the same way TrueCar did for new cars. In May 2011, TrueCar acquired News Corp-backed Honk.com, a social car shopping platform. In late 2011, TrueCar launched a television advertising campaign with commercials promoting its services. Shortly thereafter, TrueCar faced backlash from the automotive industry, when several state agencies and regulators notified TrueCar that its practices were noncompliant with some state laws. In response to those notices, TrueCar overhauled its pricing structure, and moved from a pay-per- sale model to a performance-adjusted subscription model for dealers in some states. In August 2011, TrueCar purchased ALG, a company that provides information on future residual values of vehicles, for an estimated $83 million. In January 2012, TrueCar announced a three-year, exclusive partnership with Yahoo! for $150 million. TrueCar took over Yahoo's automotive properties and replaced it with their own solution. TrueCar launched the first all-female racing team in 2012, with support from Penske Media Corporation and Dragon Racing. In June 2012, The Virgin Group announced its partnership in support of TrueCar's \\"Women Empowered\\" initiative. On May 16, 2014, TrueCar became publicly traded on NASDAQ under the stock ticker symbol TRUE.  2015‚Äì2019: Chip Perry as CEO  In December 2015, Scott Painter stepped down as CEO of TrueCar and was replaced by Chip Perry, the former CEO of AutoTrader.com. Under Perry, TrueCar's network of dealerships grew more than 24 percent quarterly over the prior year, as reported in July 2017. Perry invested heavily in a dealer sales team and altered the business model to be more attractive to dealers but less scalable for the business. In 2015, 108 car dealerships sued TrueCar for false advertising of its non-negotiation policy and for violations of the Lanham Act. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in July 2019. Also in 2019, some investors in TrueCar sued the company for misleading shareholders. Separately, in December 2017, TrueCar and the California New Car Dealers Association settled a lawsuit that the association had brought against TrueCar in 2015. In its lawsuit, the association had alleged that TrueCar's billing model violated California law. As part of the settlement, TrueCar agreed to modify its billing model in California. Shortly after disappointing first quarter results in 2019, TrueCar announced the immediate resignations of key senior executives, including CEO Chip Perry, CTO/CPO Tommy McClung, CMO Neeraj Gunsager, and EVP Brian Skutta.  2020‚Äìpresent  In January 2020, the company launched a new brand identity and redesign in partnership with Pentagramhttps://www.pentagram.com/work/truecar. TrueCar's colors, font, and logo were updated to reflect the company's new brand identity. In May 2020, TrueCar announced a program focused on active military members designed to help offset its loss of the USAA Car Buying Service. In May 2020, TrueCar announced a restructuring of the company, including layoffs of 30% of its workforce, in anticipation for significant revenue loss when its key partnership with USAA ends and the COVID-19 pandemic. Current senior leadership includes former USAA executive Christopher W. Claus, as Chairman; Michael Darrow, as President and CEO; Noel Watson, as CFO; and Jeffrey J. Swart, as General Counsel. Capital investments In its 2008 Series A round of venture funding, TrueCar raised $2.8 million from Zag's original investors. It received $8.1 million in Series B investments from Capital One and Anthem Venture Partners and TrueCar raised another $35.5 million in 2010. In September 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in funding from USAA, GRP Partners, Keating Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Capricorn Investment Group. Truecar raised $30 million from Vulcan Capital in December 2013. Shortly after going public, TrueCar completed a secondary offering in November 2014 worth approximately $125 million.

Career Henri de Gu√©n√©gaud became Tr√©sorier de l'√âpargne (Treasurer of Savings) in 1638, succeeding his father, who died that year.Braham 1973, p. 186. In 1643, he became Secretary of State of several regions of France, including Paris, the Maison du Roi, and ecclesiastical affairs. He also became Secretary of State of the Navy that same year. Dubuisson Aubenay, who later wrote a history of the Fronde, became his secretary in 1645. He supported Anne d'Autriche during the Fronde and was made Garde des Sceaux in 1656, but was disgraced in 1669, when he was succeeded as Secretary of State by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Family He was the elder son of Gabriel Gu√©n√©gaud, Lord of the Plessis- Belleville (died 1638), and Marie La Croix, Dame du Plessis-Belleville (died 1655).

He was nicknamed \\"Lordy\\", in allusion to Ted Dexter (who was known as \\"Lord Ted\\") because of his big-hitting, confident batting style. He was a right-hand bat and occasional right-arm off-break bowler, who made 16 One Day International appearances for England between 1996 and 2001, with a best of 118. Brown scored over 15,000 runs in first-class cricket following his debut in 1992. An equally prolific one day player with over 11,000 runs, he also holds the world-record List-A score ‚Äì 268. Brown is the first player in the history of List A cricket to make two double centuries. Early career Brown attended Caterham School in Surrey, where he won the Cricket Society's Wetherall Award for the most promising all rounder in school cricket in 1986, and his early promise led to second XI games for Surrey in 1988. He made his first-class debut in 1992 and was awarded his County Cap in 1994. He shared the Walter Lawrence trophy (with Carl Hooper) in 1998 for scoring the season's fastest first-class century in just 72 balls against Northamptonshire at the Oval including 10 fours and 6 sixes. County cricket Brown scored 268 against Glamorgan at the Oval in the 4th round of the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, a world record individual high score in all one-day cricket. His innings took 160 balls and included 30 fours and 12 sixes. Surrey's final total of 438‚Äì5 in 50 overs was almost matched by Glamorgan who scored 429 all out and is remembered as the highest scoring one day match in the history of county cricket. Brown's innings broke Graeme Pollock's 27-year- old record of 222. His partnership of 286 with Ian Ward was the Surrey record for any wicket in one day cricket until broken by the 294 added by Brown this time with James Benning in 2007 against Gloucestershire in which Brown scored 176 off just 97 balls. The '268 Bar' at the Oval cricket ground is named after Brown's innings. Alistair Brown mostly opened for Surrey in one day cricket, as opposed to his usual Championship batting position of number 5. He holds the record for the highest score ever made in the Sunday League, amassing 203 for Surrey v Hampshire at the Woodbridge Road ground in Guildford in 1997 in a 40 overs a side match. He scored his first 100 off 56 balls, made 150 off 84 and 200 from 118 with 19 fours and 11 sixes. In the final of the inaugural Twenty/20 cup at Trent Bridge in 2003 Brown scored a match winning innings of 55* from just 34 balls in Surrey's victory over Warwickshire. In the 2004 final at Edgbaston he hit 64 from 41 balls in vain as Surrey lost to Leicestershire. He hit 30 sixes in one day cricket in 2006, second only to Cameron White. He started the 2007 season with a century in just 50 balls against Gloucestershire at the Oval in the Friends Provident competition (50 overs a side), the 7th quickest century in English one day cricket and the 12th fastest of all time. He set a new record partnership of 294, in less than 34 overs, for any wicket in one day cricket for Surrey with James Benning, beating his own record of 289 with Ian Ward. He passed 150 runs in just 81 balls and scored 176 in 97 balls, with 8 sixes and 20 fours before missing a reverse sweep. The scorer of 19 one day centuries, he is one of the few contemporary English batsmen to have scored 10,000 runs in list A one-day cricket. Up to the start of the 2008 English season Brown had scored 14,705 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 43.50 with 44 centuries and a highest score of 295 not out against Leicestershire at Oakham School in 2000. Ali Brown has taken 2 first-class wickets with his off spin, taken 236 catches, mostly at slip, and is responsible for one first-class stumping as a substitute wicket-keeper. In 2004, with a century against Lancashire, he completed the feat of scoring a first-class century against every other English county. He played in the Surrey team that won the County Championship in 1999, 2000 and 2002 as well the English domestic one day league in 1996 and 2003 and the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1997 and 2001. He was a member of the side which won the County Championship Division 2 title in 2006 and was rewarded with another contract, being described by coach Alan Butcher as 'a great servant of the club'.

His 16,898 first-class runs at 42.67, and more than 11,000 List A runs, make him one of the most successful English batsmen never to have won a test cap. Lawrence Booth described Brown as one of the best present-day (at the time of writing) English cricketers not to have played Test cricket.

A two-story building was built in 1873. Another school was built sometime around the start of the 20th century and housed the high school until 1960, when the building above was built. This building is pictured to the right as well. Sometime in the late 1960s a consolidation effort was initiated with nearby Prophetstown High School. This effort became a reality in 1969.

Until 1912, the high school only had three grades. The brick building that housed TTHS for 75 years was built in 1921 and had 14 classrooms and a gymnasium. It was located near a railroad junction of the Hooppole, Yorktown & Tampico Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. The first mentioned was abandoned in 1953. In 1967, there were 153 students enrolled at TTHS. In the 1980s, Tampico lost its main railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy route, that was the reason Tampico became a settlement like most other small towns. Declining enrollment and financial concerns led to the closing of Tampico High School in 1996. The 1921 brick building was torn down during the summer of 2012 as part of a district wide facility improvement plan.. As of 2003, the old football field is still there, along with the padded hitting machine which is now rusted. The track outside of the field is still there in cement form.

The Christian- Socials (Christlich-Soziale) are one of the three major groups within the CDU in addition to the Liberals and the Conservatives. Thus social committees from the Christian-social movement have emerged within the CDU. The headquarters of the Foundation is K√∂nigswinter in Bonn, while there is an office in Berlin.  History  The CDA was created after the Second World War, by mostly Christian trade unionists in the industrial areas of North Rhine-Westphalia. The official establishment of the CDA was in 1946 at Kolping House in Herne, Germany. In the early years the CDA's program concerned mainly issues such as the health and safety of workers and their conditions in the factories. Since the association adopted the Offenburger Declaration in 1967, its focus moved to wider societal issues. Priorities of the CDA today cover pension, health and family policy, in addition to labor and social policy.  Internal Structure  Subsidiary bodies of the CDU social committees include its Youth movement, the Youth CDA, former Young Workers Association and the Association of Women in the CDA. The Youth CDA was founded in 1947 also in Herne.

The company was established in 2004 to commercialize technologies developed by the UK MoD's Defense Science and Technology Laboratory. In further research and development, the company has identified innovative applications, equipment and processing methods, and now has 170+ patents, patent applications and utility model applications (Feb, 2019). In 2010 the company acquired Surface Innovations Limited, adding new technologies such as antimicrobial, super hydrophilic and protein resistance coatings. In addition to headquarters in the United Kingdom, P2i has a processing facility in the United States, offices in Shenzhen, China and Taipei City, Taiwan, and representation in Korea. As of February 2016 P2i had deployed hundreds of its nano-coating systems globally, including factories in Brazil, Argentina, USA, China, India, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and the UK. Technology left The treatment decreases the surface energy of objects by adding an perfluorinated carbon polymer coating onto exposed surfaces. The coating reduces the disruption of intermolecular bonds within a liquid. Liquids thus tend to bead up instead of penetrating or absorbing into the object. The treatment process coats objects using a pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition apparatus at room temperature. The coating is introduced as a vapor and ionized. This deposits a polymerized layer of the plasma monomers, which binds covalently and durably to the object's surface. The mild temperature and pressure conditions of this process permit a broad variety of items and materials to be treated. Occurring at low pressure, the coating penetrates complex three-dimensional objects, protecting it internally and externally in the one process. The coating, being very thin, does not alter the look or feel of solid objects, or the vapor porosity of fabrics. History right P2i's process is based on the research and development work of Stephen Coulson and Jas Pal Badyal at Durham University. Coulson's work was funded by the United Kingdom's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) which aimed to protect clothing from water and other liquids while maximizing comfort. P2i Ltd was established as a stand-alone company in 2004, as the first DSTL technology spin-out managed by Ploughshare Innovations (the DSTL's technology transfer company). On 13 July 2010, P2i announced the acquisition of Surface Innovations Ltd, a UK-based technology company with several functional nano- coating patent families in areas such as anti-bacterial resistance and liquid attracting (super wettable). Applications and brands According to P2i's website, current applications for its technology are in the categories of ‚ÄòElectronics, Lifestyle, Life Sciences, Filtration & Energy and Military & Institutional‚Äô For consumer-facing products the company has created sector- specific trademarked brands. The ion-mask brand was used in lifestyle products such as footwear, outdoor clothing and accessories (gloves and headwear). ion-mask products were on sale from several international footwear companies including Timberland, Nike, adidas Golf, Hi-Tec, Magnum Boots, Van Dal, Teva, and K-Swiss. P2i's nano-coating, is used in consumer electronics, focusing initially on the hearing aid sector where the company claims to be applied to 70% of the world's hearing devices. In 2013, P2i diversified its marketing, replacing Aridion with the term Splash-proof, to identify the traditional hydrophobic layer technology. P2i has partnered with Motorola and Huawei and several other top smartphone brands, as well as another leading Chinese manufacturers. P2i has the capability to treat over half a billion phones in 2019.

Hume-Campbell was the second surviving son of Alexander Hume-Campbell, 2nd Earl of Marchmont and his wife Margaret Campbell, daughter of Sir George Campbell of Cessnock. He was educated at a private school in London from 1716 until possibly 1721. He was in the Netherlands in Utrecht and Franeker between 1721 and probably 1725. He attended the University of Edinburgh and became an advocate in 1729. He entered Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1731. He married Elizabeth Pettis of Savile Row, London on 16 July 1737. At the 1734 British general election, Hume-Campbell was returned as Member of Parliament for Berwickshire at the same time as his twin brother Lord Polwarth was elected MP for Berwick- upon-Tweed. There was a double return at the 1741 British general election and he was eventually declared elected on 19 January 1742. He was Solicitor- general to the Prince of Wales from December 1741 to January 1746. He was returned again for Berwickshire in 1747. For most of the time from 1734 to 1754 he was in opposition, and during that time he built up a considerable practice at the English bar.

It was written by Philip Yordan, who fronted for a then uncredited and blacklisted Ben Maddow, and is based on the novel of the same name by John McPartland. Featured is an all star cast, including Joanne Woodward, Sheree North, Tony Randall, Jeffrey Hunter, Cameron Mitchell, and Pat Hingle. Set in a California subdivision, the story follows four neighbor couples, facing problems such as alcoholism, racism, and promiscuity. It received two BAFTA nominations for Best Film From Any Source and Best Foreign Actress (Joanne Woodward).  Plot  New to the city's Sunrise Hills subdivision, electrical engineer David Martin and wife Jean are welcomed by their neighbors. They include appliance store manager Herman Kreitzer, auto mechanic Troy Boone and car salesman Jerry Flagg, plus their wives. Leola, the unhappy wife of Troy, wants to have a child. A war veteran, Troy has applied for the position of police chief. He refuses to discuss children until the job is his. Frequently drunk, Jerry awkwardly makes passes at the other men's wives, humiliating his own spouse, Isabelle. He also is heavily in debt, spending far too much on things he can't afford. He pressures a family to buy a car beyond their means, endangering his job. David also has money problems. Jean strongly urges him to go into sales, a more lucrative field. But he is a skilled engineer who prefers to stick with what he knows best. Herman has a valued employee, Iko, who wants to move into Sunrise Hills with his wife like anybody else. But the racial bias of the time is obvious and Herman's wife dislikes the idea of risking the wrath of neighbors by giving Iko a reference. Also the city council's president, Herman must inform Troy that he can't be police chief due to a lack of education. The ill-tempered Troy gets drunk and sexually assaults David's wife Jean, then beats David badly when confronted by the angry husband. Leola decides to leave. Troy is accidentally pinned under a car, and by the time it is lifted from him, he is dying in his wife's arms. Leola drives out of town as the others reassess their lives.

Reception  David Bowie, upon receiving his first fan letter from America in 1967, wrote the fan back and mentioned this film: \\"I hope one day to get to America. My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages. I was watching an old film on TV the other night called No Down Payment a great film, but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1957 films Category:1957 drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about suburbia Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Martin Ritt Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline Category:Films set in California ","title":"No Down Payment"},{"id":"26057585","text":"Met 3 is part of Metropolitan Miami, a complex of four skyscrapers in the central business district of Downtown Miami, Florida, United States.

It would have contained 76 floors, which would have also made it the tallest building in the United States south of New York City in terms of floor count. In total height, it would have also been the tallest residential building south of New York, consisting of residential condominium units, passing the Four Seasons Hotel Miami, which holds that distinction currently.

It is loosely based on the 1929 novel of the same name by William Faulkner.  Plot  Quentin Compson is a girl of 17 in the small Mississippi town of Jefferson. She lives with her step-uncle, Jason, who has practically raised Quentin ever since her promiscuous mother, Caddy, abandoned her. Jason makes ends meet working in the store of Earl Snopes, a man he detests. He is the provider for several people in the large family house, including Howard, who is Quentin's uncle, and his step-brother, and a mute, mentally handicapped man named Benjy, his other step-brother. Other occupants include Jason's bitter, resentful mother, a black housekeeper, and a black boy who looks after Benjy. Quentin is bored, restless, and not interested in Jason's wishes that she continue her education. When a carnival comes to town, she becomes infatuated with Charlie Busch, a carny worker who tries to seduce her. Caddy returns to town. She has a tentative reunion with Quentin, but takes Jason's side because she has no money and needs him to shelter her now. Caddy flirts with Snopes, who implies that they had intimate relations and is beaten by Jason for saying as much. Benjy also becomes incensed when he catches Quentin sneaking out to meet Busch and tries to strangle her, whereupon Jason decides that Benjy must be committed to an institution. A frustrated Quentin wants to leave with Busch and claims she can get her hands on $3,000. She steals it from a suitcase of money Jason had been saving for her future. To prove the stranger's true intentions, Jason goes to Busch and gives him a choice: the girl or the money. Quentin is crushed when she realizes what Busch is really after. She returns to Jason and promises to be more mature in their future together.

The previous month Wald optioned the Faulkner story, Soldier's Pay. In August 1956 Wald announced he had purchased the screen rights and would made it for 20th Century Fox, and that the team of Harriet Frank and Irvin Ravitch would do the adaptation. Wald had a tendency to film older novels; he said he took advice from a survey of librarians throughout the country to see what older books were \\"perennial favorites\\" with readers. Wald offered the leading roles of Jason and Candace to Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. In January 1957 Gregory Peck signed to star with filming to begin in June. Audrey Hepburn was sought to co star and Jose Quintero to direct. Quintero turned down the film, By May 1957 Martin Ritt was signed to direct and Wald was going to make another Faulkner tale as well, The Hamlet, which became The Long Hot Summer. Ritt did it under a two- picture contract with Fox. Eventually Ritt filmed Long Hot Summer first. In December 1957 filming was postponed due to difficulties in casting. Lana Turner was to star as Caddy. In January 1958 Yul Brynner signed to star.  Reception  Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"lacks texture\\" and is \\"sentiment-dappled and synthetic\\". The negative reception may also have been partly due to Joanne Woodward's being so much older than the character she played; at almost 30 years old, it was hard to find her believable as a 17-year-old girl.
