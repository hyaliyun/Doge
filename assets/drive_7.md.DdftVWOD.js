He served against the First French Republic in the Flanders Campaign and on the Rhine. Severely wounded in 1799, he survived a trepanning operation and briefly retired from military service. He returned to active service and commanded an army corps during the War of the Fifth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. He led his troops in several important battles during the Austrian invasion of Italy in 1809, including one where he was in independent command. Though appointed to command troops in 1813 and 1815, he missed combat in both campaigns. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment from 1810 until his death. The more famous Ign√°c Gyulay, Ban of Croatia was his older brother. Early career Born into a noble Hungarian family on 12 September 1766, Albert Gyulay became a junior Leutnant in the Kaiser Hussar Regiment # 1 on 1 May 1784.Smith, Digby & Kudrna, Leopold (compiler). napoleon-series.org Austrian Generals during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars: Albert Gyulay Previous to his appointment, he received military training as a cadet at the Theresienstatt Academy.Schneid, Frederick C. Napoleon's Italian Campaigns: 1805-1815. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 2002. . 64 His father, S√°muel Gyulay was a general officer and Inhaber of Infantry Regiment # 32 from 1773 until his death in 1802. His mother was Anna Bornemisza de K√°szon. In October 1787 he briefly transferred into the Alvinczi Infantry Regiment # 19 before entering the Szekler Hussar Regiment # 44 in December. The Austro-Turkish War broke out that year and he fought in Transylvania in 1788. On 26 August 1788 he won distinction in a skirmish at the T√∂rzburger Pass at the head of a hussar squadron. Gyulay transferred into his father's regiment as a Hauptmann (captain) of grenadiers in February 1789 and fought at the Siege of Belgrade in autumn that year. He led his company in the Kempf grenadier battalion in Franz von Werneck's column during the successful assault on the city, which capitulated on 8 October. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 21 December 1789. French Revolution In 1793 during the War of the First Coalition, Gyulay fought in several actions and was promoted to Major in the O'Donell Freikorps on 1 May. The following year found him serving in Heinrich, Count of Bellegarde's brigade in a number of minor actions. He defeated the French troops opposed to him in the Battle of Tournay on 22 May 1794. That year he married Justine Wynants (d. 1824). On 19 April 1797, he fought in a successful action in the aftermath of Werneck's defeat at the Battle of Neuwied on the Rhine. The same month he received promotion to Oberstleutnant in his father's regiment. On 26 April 1798, Gyulay became Oberst of the newly formed Infantry Regiment # 48. In the War of the Second Coalition, his troops drove off French attacks in the Battle of Verona on 26 April 1799. At the Battle of Magnano on 6 April, his regiment formed part of Ferdinand Minckwitz's brigade in Konrad Valentin von Kaim's division.Smith, 151 While leading an attacking column against Antoine Delmas' French division, he was struck in the head by a musket ball. The bullet was removed by trepanning at Verona, but the dangerous injury forced Gyulay to retire from the army the next year. He was appointed General-Major on 24 July 1800. 1809 campaign Battle of Sacile, 16 April 1809, showing morning positions Gyulay returned to active service in 1803 and was elevated in rank to Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 14 August 1808. The outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition found him in command of a division in the VIII Armeekorps of Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles. When the Tyrolean Rebellion erupted in April 1809, Archduke John of Austria sent Chasteler into the Tyrol with about 10,000 troops and appointed Gyulay commander of the VIII Armeekorps. By coincidence, his older brother Ign√°c Gyulay led the IX Armeekorps, which was the other major maneuver unit in John's army.Bowden, Scotty & Tarbox, Charlie. Armies on the Danube 1809. Arlington, Texas: Empire Games Press, 1980. 107 Ign√°c Gyulay, Ban of Croatia, was Albert's older brother. On 10 April, Albert Gyulay's VIII Armeekorps advanced from Tarvisio (Tarvis) and two days later it occupied Udine. Near the latter city, he was joined by his brother's corps which had marched from Ljubljana (Laibach).Schneid, 69 French reconnaissance was poor and the opposing army commander, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais remained unaware that the VIII and IX Armeekorps had joined forces. Meanwhile, Archduke John formed a third maneuver unit, an army Advance Guard and placed it under the command of Johann Maria Philipp Frimont.Schneid, p 70 The Advance Guard was created from Frimont's 2nd Division of the VIII Armeekorps. John ordered a night march on the evening of the 14th, Frimont's Advance Guard leading, followed by the VIII Armeekorps, while the IX brought up the rear. Frimont caught Eug√®ne's own advance guard at Pordenone on the morning of 15 April and defeated it.Schneid, 71 The French lost 500 killed and wounded, plus 2,000 prisoners, while Austrian losses were only 253.Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. . 286 Expecting the imminent arrival of two divisions, an overconfident Eug√®ne engaged John's army on 16 April in the Battle of Sacile. Eug√®ne planned a two-division attack on the village of Porcia where Frimont and Albert Gyulay posted their troops. Delayed by the rainy weather, Ign√°c Gyulay's corps camped behind the VIII Armeekorps. John anticipated Eug√®ne's attack and planned to have Albert Gyulay and Frimont absorb the blow, while swinging Ign√°c Gyulay against his enemies' left flank.Schneid, 72-73 The morning attack pressed hard against Frimont's troops in Porcia, so Albert Gyulai launched a counterattack which badly shook the Franco-Italians. Eug√®ne committed a third division to the combat and it captured Porcia. Even so, Albert Gyulai and his troops resisted so fiercely that Eug√®ne sent in a fourth division, leaving himself with only one remaining infantry division, plus cavalry. Delayed by rain, his reinforcements never made it to the battlefield. At this moment, Ignaz Gyulai's corps advanced upon the badly weakened Franco-Italian left flank.Schneid, 73 Archduke John When Eug√®ne recalled his fourth division to save his left flank, Albert Gyulay's troops recaptured Porcia. After an all-day fight, at 5:00 PM the French commander accepted defeat and ordered a withdrawal. Ign√°c Gyulay pursued the two divisions and cavalry of Eug√®ne's left flank, while Albert Gyulay and Frimont pushed back the three divisions of the right. The VIII Armeekorps suffered the brunt of the Austrian losses,Schneid, 74 which were 2,617 killed and wounded, 532 captured and 697 missing, for a total of 3,846. The Franco- Italians lost 3,000 killed and wounded, while 19 guns and 3,500 prisoners fell into Austrian hands.Smith, 286-287 Battle of Piave River, 8 May 1809, showing afternoon positions By the end of April, Eug√®ne withdrew to Verona, gathered reinforcements, and reorganized his army. Archduke John took a position with his left flank behind the Adige River at Legnago and his right flank under Albert Gyulay behind the Alpone River at Soave, near the Arcole battlefield of 1796. On 29 April, Paul Grenier thrust at Soave, but Albert Gyulay repulsed his attack. However, an Italian attack in the hills to the north seized Castelcerino village and threatened to turn the Austrian flank.Schneid, 78-79 The French suffered an estimated 1,000 casualties against 400 Austrians killed and wounded, plus 300 more captured. Albert Gyulay counterattacked the next day with 6,000 infantry and recovered Castelcerino from its 5,000 Italian defenders. Austrian losses numbered 300 killed and wounded and 572 missing, while the French admitted 409 casualties.Smith, 295 On 1 May, John withdrew to the east, pausing behind the Brenta River before crossing the Piave River and camping near Conegliano.Schneid, 79 Hieronymus Colloredo It became evident that Eug√®ne was bent on a close pursuit, so John ordered his army to take up positions to defend the Piave. When Joseph Marie, Count Dessaix's light infantry division crossed the river early on 8 May to bring on the Battle of Piave River, John's troops were drawn up much closer to the river than Eug√®ne suspected, with VIII Armeekorps on the right flank and Ignaz Gyulay's IX Armeekorps on the left.Schneid, 80. None of the sources mention where Frimont's Advance Guard deployed, though his horsemen joined Wolfskeel's ad hoc cavalry division. At this time, Albert Gyulay's corps consisted only of the brigades of Hieronymus Karl Graf von Colloredo-Mansfeld and Anton Gajoli.Bowden & Tarbox, 113 Dessaix was met with a massed cavalry charge led by Christian Wolfskeel von Reichenberg, which he repelled by forming his voltiguers in square. But the French soon came under fire from a 24-gun battery.Schneid, 80 Eug√®ne reinforced Dessaix's 5,000 troops and four cannons with two cavalry divisions and 20 additional guns. With the two grand batteries pounding away at each other, the French horsemen launched a charge that enveloped the ends of the Austrian gun line and crashed into the opposing cavalry. A French dragoon slew Wolfskeel, his second-in-command became a prisoner, and the Austrian cavalry was put to rout. The artillery crews managed to bring away ten guns, but the rest became prizes of their enemies.Epstein, Robert M. Napoleon's Last Victory and the Emergence of Modern War. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1994. 91 The victorious French troopers chased the fugitives until they encountered Colloredo and Gajoli, deployed behind the Piavisella canal. Unable to make headway, the French cavalry withdrew. There was a lull in the battle as Eug√®ne got as much infantry as possible to ford the river before the rising waters drowned the fords. John was unable to take advantage of the situation because his cavalry was beaten and demoralized.Schneid, 81 Late in the afternoon, the French commander launched his final attack, sending Grenier's corps against the Austrian left and Jacques MacDonald's corps against Albert Gyulay's Piavisella line. When Grenier dislodged his left flank brigade, John ordered a general retreat back to Conegliano.Schneid, 82 The French lost about 2,000 casualties, while the Austrian losses numbered 398 killed, 697 wounded, 1,681 captured, and 1,120 missing, for a total of 3,896 men and 15 guns lost.Smith, 300 Battle of Tarvis showing the Malborghetto and Predil Forts As John retreated, he split up his army, sending the rump of the IX Armeekorps east to defend Carniola (modern Slovenia) under Ignaz Gyulay. As Ban of Croatia, Ignaz had the authority to muster the Croatian insurrectio or militia. With the remainder of his army, John marched northeast toward the Austrian base at Villach and recalled Chasteler from the Tyrol to help defend the frontier.Schneid, 82-83 After smashing Frimont's rear guard at San Daniele del Friuli on 11 May, Eug√®ne pursued John northeast. Despite his setback, Frimont clashed with his enemies at Venzone and successfully burned the bridges behind him.Epstein, 94 Archduke John reorganized his Italian army into three major bodies in mid-May. Ign√°c Gyulay assembled 14,880 soldiers and 26 guns into four brigades at Kranj (Krain). Albert Gyulay defended Tarvisio with 8,340 troops and 20 guns in the brigades of Gajoli, Franz Marziani, and Peter Lutz. Frimont's Mobile Corps lay at Villach with 13,060 men and 22 guns in four brigades. In addition, John controlled Franz Jellacic's 10,200-strong Northern Division and Andreas Stoichevich's 8,100-man force in Dalmatia.Bowden & Tarbox, 115-117 Friedrich Hensel In trying to break through the Alpine barrier, Eug√®ne sent MacDonald east with 14,000 troops in three divisions, Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca's division north into the upper Piave valley, and Jean Mathieu Seras' division north up the Soƒça (Isonzo) River. He took 25,000 troops in the corps of Grenier and Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers in John's wake along the Fella River valley. With so many bridges down, the French commander was compelled to send his cavalry, most of his artillery, and his wagon train on Seras' route.Epstein, 122-123 Holding Tarvisio with only 6,000 troops, Albert Gyulay relied on two outlying forts to stall the Franco-Italian advance. At Malborghetto Valbruna, a fort frowned down upon the Fella valley from a mountain spur. The Predil Pass blockhouse stood athwart Seras' road from the south. Malborghetto was defended by Captain Friedrich Hensel with 650 Grenz infantry and 10 cannons, while Captain Johann Hermann, 250 Grenzers, and eight artillery pieces held Predil. Eug√®ne and Seras arrived before the two forts on 15 May and initiated the Battle of Tarvis. Baraguey d'Hilliers bypassed Malborghetto with two divisions and skirmished with Albert Gyulay's main force at Tarvisio on 16 May, while Grenier moved his two divisions into assault positions below the Malborghetto fort. Beginning at 9:30 AM on 17 May, 15,000 troops stormed the position in thirty minutes.Epstein, 123 Hensel and 350 Austrians were killed and between 50 and 300 were captured. Grenier reported 80 casualties but losses were probably much heavier.Smith, 305. Smith says 50 captured.Epstein, 123. Epstein reported 300 captured. Johann Hermann The Malborghetto fort looms over the Fella valley. This view looks west. Meanwhile, Albert Gyulay abandoned Tarvisio and pulled back behind a stream on the east side of the town. The position was buttressed with a line of fortified redoubts. But the batteries were armed with only 10 of the 24 cannons that were planned. He deployed elements of the brigades of Gajoli, Marziani, and Lutz, plus the Strassoldo Infantry Regiment # 27.Smith, 304 After securing Malborghetto, Grenier rapidly moved his two divisions to join those of Baraguey d'Hilliers at Tarvisio in a noon attack. An Italian division overran a key redoubt on Gyulay's left and began to flank the Austrian infantry out of position. As the line began to crack, Grenier's troops advanced, forcing Gyulay to order a retreat. Under pressure of superior numbers, the Austrian troops panicked and fled, losing as many as 3,000 killed, wounded, and captured. Gyulay reported losing 217 men killed, 271 wounded, 1,301 captured, and 170 missing, a total of 1,959 and six guns. To the south, Seras was unable to make an impression on the Predil blockhouse with his artillery. Needing to use the Predil Pass to bring up his cavalry, artillery, and trains, Eug√®ne sent three battalions from Tarvisio to help.Epstein, 124 On the 18th, Seras attacked the Grenzers with 8,500 troops and 12 guns. After a heroic last stand, Hermann and his garrison were killed to a man. The Franco-Italians lost 450 killed and wounded.Smith, 306 After the defeat, Gyulay was unable to follow John's retreat to Graz. Instead, he followed the Drava River east and joined the archduke at Szentgotth√°rd in Hungary on 2 June. Gyulay missed the Battle of Raab on 14 June. Later career Emperor Francis I of Austria appointed him Inhaber of the Albert Gyulay Infantry Regiment # 21 on 7 February 1810, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He was named to command the Reserve Armeekorps on the Danube in 1813 and a division in the Hundred Days campaign of 1815. Neither appointment resulted in combat. He died on 27 April 1835 in Pest. Albert and Justine had four children, S√°muel Bel√° Crescencius (1803‚Äì1886), Albert (b. 1805), Lajos (d. 1845), and Anna Jozefa (d. 1837). Notes References * Bowden, Scotty & Tarbox, Charlie.

Richard et al., (2002), an error is the use of a word, speech act or grammatical items in such a way it seems imperfect and significant of an incomplete learning (184). It is considered by Norrish (1983, p. 7) as a systematic deviation that happens when a learner has not learnt something, and consistently gets it wrong. However, the attempts made to put the error into context have always gone hand in hand with either language learning and second-language acquisition processes, Hendrickson (1987:357) mentioned that errors are ‚Äòsignals‚Äô that indicate an actual learning process taking place and that the learner has not yet mastered or shown a well-structured competence in the target language. All the definitions seemed to stress either on the systematic deviations triggered in the language learning process, or its indications of the actual situation of the language learner themselves which will later help the monitor be it an applied linguist or particularly the language teacher to solve the problem respecting one of the approaches argued in the Error Analysis (Anefnaf 2017), the occurrence of errors doesn't only indicate that the learner has not learned something yet, but also it gives the linguist the idea of whether the teaching method applied was effective or it needs to be changed. According to Corder (1976) errors are significant of three things, first to the teacher, in that they tell him, if he or she undertakes a systematic analysis, how far towards that goal the learner has progressed and, consequently, what remains for him to learn. Second, they provide the researcher with evidence of how language is learned or acquired, and what strategies or procedures the learner is employing in his discovery of the language. Third (and in a sense this is their most important aspect) they are indispensable to the learner himself, because we can regard the making of errors as a device the learner uses in order to learn (p. 167). The occurrence of errors is merely signs of ‚Äò‚Äôthe present inadequacy of our teaching methods‚Äô‚Äô (Corder 1976, p. 163). There have been two schools of thought when it comes to errors analysis and philosophy, the first one, according to Corder (1967) linked the errors commitment with the teaching method arguing that if the teaching method was adequate, the errors would not be committed, the second school believed that we live in an imperfect world and that errors correction is something real and the applied linguist cannot do without it no matter what teaching approach they may use.  Errors vs. mistakes  Chomsky (1965) made a distinguishing explanation of competence and performance on which, later on, the identification of mistakes and errors will be possible, Chomsky stated that ‚Äò‚ÄôWe thus make a fundamental distinction between competence (the speaker-hearer's knowledge of his language) and performance (the actual use of language in concrete situations)‚Äô‚Äô ( 1956, p. 4). In other words, errors are thought of as indications of an incomplete learning, and that the speaker or hearer has not yet accumulated a satisfied language knowledge which can enable them to avoid linguistics misuse. Relating knowledge with competence was significant enough to represent that the competence of the speaker is judged by means of errors that concern the amount of linguistic data he or she has been exposed to, however, performance which is the actual use of language does not represent the language knowledge that the speaker has. According to J. Richard et al (2002), people may have the competence to produce an infinitely long sentence but when they actually attempt to use this knowledge (to ‚Äúperform‚Äù) there are many reasons why they restrict the number of adjectives, adverbs, and clauses in any one sentence (2002, 392). The actual state of the speaker somehow involves and influences the speaker's performance by either causing a good performance or mistakes. Thus, it is quite obvious that there is some kind of interrelationship between competence and performance; somehow, a speaker can perform well if he or she has had already satisfied linguistic knowledge. As a support to this, Corder (1967) mentioned that mistakes are of no significance to ‚Äúthe process of language learning‚Äô‚Äô (P. 167). Error analysis approach Before the rise of error analysis approach, contrastive analysis had been the dominant approach used in dealing and conceptualizing the learners‚Äô errors in the 1950s, this approach had often gone hand in hand with concept of L1 Interference and precisely the interlingual effect (Anefnaf Z. 2017), it claimed that the main cause of committing errors in the process of second language learning is the L1, in other words, the linguistic background of the language learners badly affects the production in the target language. X. Fang and J. Xue-mei (2007) pointed out that contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that the principal barrier to second language acquisition is the interference of the first language system with the second language system and that a scientific, structural comparison of the two languages in question would enable people to predict and describe which are problems and which are not. Error analysis approach overwhelmed and announced the decline of the Contrastive Analysis which was only effective in phonology; and, according to J. Richard et al. (2002), EA developed as a branch of Linguistics in the 1960s and it came to light to argue that the mother tongue was not the main and the only source of the errors committed by the learners. In addition, Hashim, A. (1999) mentioned that the language effect is more complex and these errors can be caused even by the target language itself and by the applied communicative strategies as well as the type and quality of the second language instructions. The aim of EA according to J. Richard et al. (2002) is, first, to identify strategies which learners use in language learning, in terms of the approaches and strategies used in both of teaching and learning. Second, to try to identify the causes of learners‚Äô errors, that is, investigating the motives behind committing such errors as the first attempt to eradicate them. Third, to obtain information on common difficulties in Language Learning, as an aid to teaching or in the preparation of the teaching materials, The two major causes of error, coined by the error analysis approach, are the Interlingual error which is an error made by the Learner's Linguistic background and Native language interference, and the Intralingual error which is the error committed by the learners when they misuse some Target Language rules, considering that the error cause lies within and between the target language itself and the Learners false application of certain target language rules. Error analysis in SLA was established in the 1960s by Corder and colleagues. Error analysis (EA) was an alternative to contrastive analysis, an approach influenced by behaviorism through which applied linguists sought to use the formal distinctions between the learners' first and second languages to predict errors. Error analysis showed that contrastive analysis was unable to predict a great majority of errors, although its more valuable aspects have been incorporated into the study of language transfer. A key finding of error analysis has been that many learner errors are produced by learners making faulty inferences about the rules of the new language. Error analysts distinguish between errors, which are systematic, and mistakes, which are not. They often seek to develop a typology of errors. Error can be classified according to basic type: omissive, additive, substitutive or related to word order. They can be classified by how apparent they are: overt errors such as \\"I angry\\" are obvious even out of context, whereas covert errors are evident only in context. Closely related to this is the classification according to domain, the breadth of context which the analyst must examine, and extent, the breadth of the utterance which must be changed in order to fix the error. Errors may also be classified according to the level of language: phonological errors, vocabulary or lexical errors, syntactic errors, and so on. They may be assessed according to the degree to which they interfere with communication: global errors make an utterance difficult to understand, while local errors do not. In the above example, \\"I angry\\" would be a local error, since the meaning is apparent. From the beginning, error analysis was beset with methodological problems. In particular, the above typologies are problematic: from linguistic data alone, it is often impossible to reliably determine what kind of error a learner is making. Also, error analysis can deal effectively only with learner production (speaking and writing) and not with learner reception (listening and reading). Furthermore, it cannot account for learner use of communicative strategies such as avoidance, in which learners simply do not use a form with which they are uncomfortable. For these reasons, although error analysis is still used to investigate specific questions in SLA, the quest for an overarching theory of learner errors has largely been abandoned. In the mid-1970s, Corder and others moved on to a more wide-ranging approach to learner language, known as interlanguage. Error analysis is closely related to the study of error treatment in language teaching. Today, the study of errors is particularly relevant for focus on form teaching methodology. In second language acquisition, error analysis studies the types and causes of language errors. Errors are classifiedCf. Bussmann, Hadumod (1996), Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics, London: Routledge, s.v. error analysis. A comprehensive bibliography was published by Bernd Spillner (1991), Error Analysis, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: Benjamins. according to: * modality (i.e., level of proficiency in speaking, writing, reading, listening) * linguistic levels (i.e., pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, style) * form (e.g., omission, insertion, substitution) * type (systematic errors/errors in competence vs. occasional errors/errors in performance) * cause (e.g., interference, interlanguage) * norm vs. system  Types of errors  Linguists have always been attempting to describe the types of errors committed by the language learners, and that is exactly the best way to start with, as it helps out the applied linguist to identify where the problem lies. According to Dulay et al. (1982) errors take place when the learner change the surface structure in a particularly systematic manner (p. 150), thus, the error, no matter what form and type it is, represent a damage at the level of the target language production. Errors have been classified by J. Richard et al. (2002) into two categories. The Interlingual Error and the Intralingual Error, those two elements refer respectively to the negative influence of both the speaker's native language, and the target language itself. Interlingual error is caused by the interference of the native language L1 (also known as interference, linguistic interference, and crosslinguistic influence), whereby the learner tends to use their linguistic knowledge of L1 on some Linguistic features in the target language, however, it often leads to making errors. The example, provided by J. Richard et al. (2002) ‚Äò‚Äô the incorrect French sentence Elle regarde les (‚ÄúShe sees them‚Äù), produced according to the word order of English, instead of the correct French sentence Elle les regarde (Literally, ‚ÄúShe them sees‚Äù). (P. 267) shows the type of errors aroused by the negative effect of the native language interference. Intralingual error is an error that takes place due to a particular misuse of a particular rule of the target language, it is, in fact, quite the opposite of Interlingual error, it puts the target language into focus, the target language in this perspective is thought of as an error cause. Furthermore, J. Richard, et al. (2002) consider it as one which results from ‚Äò‚Äôfaulty or partial‚Äô‚Äô learning of the target language. (p.267) thus the intralingual error is classified as follow: Overgeneralizations: in linguistics, overgeneralizations error occur when the speaker applies a grammatical rule in cases where it doesn‚Äôt apply. Richard et al, (2002) mentioned that they are caused ‚Äò‚Äôby extension of target language rules to inappropriate context.‚Äô‚Äô (P.185). this kind of errors have been committed while dealing with regular and irregular verbs, as well as the application of plural forms. E.g. (Tooth  Tooths rather than teeth) and (he goes  he goed rather than went). Simplifications: they result from learners producing simpler linguistic forms than those found in the target language, in other words, learners attempt to be linguistically creative and produce their own poetic sentences/utterances, they may actually be successful in doing it, but it is not necessary the case, Corder (as cited in Mahmoud 2014:276) mentioned that learners do not have the complex system which they could simplify. This kind of errors is committed through both of Omission and addition of some linguistic elements at the level of either the Spelling or grammar. A. Mahmoud (2014) provided examples based on a research conducted on written English of Arabic-speaking second year University students: # Spelling: omission of silent letters: #* no (= know) * dout (= doubt) * weit (weight) # Grammar: ## Omission: ##* We wait ^ the bus all the time. ##* He was ^ clever and has ^ understanding father. ## Addition: ##* Students are do their researches every semester. ##* Both the boys and the girls they can study together. Developmental errors: this kind of errors is somehow part of the overgeneralizations, (this later is subtitled into Natural and developmental learning stage errors), D.E are results of normal pattern of development, such as (come = comed) and (break = breaked), D.E indicates that the learner has started developing their linguistic knowledge and fail to reproduce the rules they have lately been exposed to in target language learning. Induced errors: as known as transfer of training, errors caused by misleading teaching examples, teachers, sometimes, unconditionally, explain a rule without highlighting the exceptions or the intended message they would want to convey. J. Richard et al. (2002) provided an example that occurs at the level of teaching prepositions and particularly ‚Äò‚Äô at ‚Äò‚Äô where the teacher may hold up a box and say ‚Äò‚Äô I am looking at the box ‚Äò‚Äô, the students may understand that ‚Äò‚Äô at ‚Äò‚Äô means ‚Äò‚Äô under ‚Äò‚Äô, they may later utter ‚Äò‚Äô the cat is at the table ‚Äò‚Äô instead of the cat is under the table. Errors of avoidance: these errors occur when the learner fail to apply certain target language rules just because they are thought of to be too difficult. Errors of overproduction: in the early stages of language learning, learners are supposed to have not yet acquired and accumulated a satisfied linguistic knowledge which can enable them to use the finite rules of the target language in order to produce infinite structures, most of the time, beginners overproduce, in such a way, they frequently repeat a particular structure.  Steps  According to linguist Corder, the following are the steps in any typical EA research: # collecting samples of learner language # identifying the errors # describing the errors # explaining the errors # evaluating/correcting the errors collection of errors: the nature and quantity of errors is likely to vary depending on whether the data consist of natural, spontaneous language use or careful, elicited language use. Corder (1973) distinguished two kinds of elicitation:clinical and experimental elicitation. clinical elicitation involves getting the informant to produce data of any sort, for example by means of general interview or writing a composition. experimental elicitation involves the use of special instrument to elicit data containing the linguistic features such as a series of pictures which had been designed to elicit specific features.

He was ordained a priest in Kilkenny on 3 July 1892. Career Whyte went to Sydney in 1892 and was appointed a professor at St Patrick's College, Manly. The rector there at the time was Dr Michael Verdon, later second Bishop of Dunedin. Among Whyte's students were Matthew Brodie later second Bishop of Christchurch and James Liston later seventh Bishop of Auckland.\\"Solemn Last Rites at Dunedin\\", Zealandia, 9 January 1958, p. 14 After leaving that position he was assistant priest at St Benedict's Church and at St Mary's Cathedral. In Sydney, he also held the positions of Archdiocesan Inspector of Schools, Chancellor of the Sydney archdiocese and Director of the Catholic Press. He was also the first resident priest of Stanmore. Whyte was very learned and he spoke three foreign languages, French, German and Italian. Episcopate In 1920 Whyte was appointed Bishop of Dunedin and on the 12th day of December in that year he was consecrated by Archbishop Redwood in St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dunedin with James Liston who had been appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Auckland. During Whyte's episcopate the number of priests in the diocese doubled from 40 to 81; there was a similar increase in the children attending Catholic schools, from 3060 to 6120. In 1927 he founded St. Kevin's College, Oamaru. He added 14 new parishes to the 22 existing in 1920. Religious orders commencing work in the Dunedin diocese over the same period were the Vincentians (who took over Holy Cross seminary in 1934), the Dominican Fathers, the Redemptorist Fathers, the Presentation Sisters, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny and the Sisters of the Assumption. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Whyte was chairman of directors of the New Zealand Tablet Company for many years and was active in promoting the cause of the Catholic press in New Zealand. On 18 December 1941 Whyte suffered a stroke and was taken to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital where he remained for the last 16 years of his life.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, OP, Star in the South: The Centennial History of the New Zealand Dominican Sisters, St Dominic's Priory, Dunedin, 1970, pp. 244 In July 1942 the golden jubilee of Whyte's ordination was celebrated bringing visitors from all parts of New Zealand. The jubilee Mass was celebrated by Archbishop O'Shea and at the jubilee dinner an ode written by the New Zealand poet Eileen Duggan was read out.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, OP, p. 245 Whyte celebrated his diamond jubilee in 1952, while his silver jubilee as a bishop was marked in December, 1945, by ceremonies of an entirely religious nature. In January 1943 Hugh John O'Neill was appointed as Coadjutor Bishop of Dunedin, but ill health forced his resignation in 1946. In 1949 John Kavanagh was appointed as Apostolic Administrator \\"sede plena\\" and coadjutor with the right of succession. Death Whyte died on 26 December 1957, aged 89-year. He had been a priest for 65 years and a bishop for 37 years.

According to Matthews, \\"the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war.\\" Prior to the Hijra travel, Muhammad struggled non- violently against his oppressors in Mecca.Boulding, Elise. \\"Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History\\", p. 57 It wasn't until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more offensive perspective.Howard, Lawrence. \\"Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses\\", p. 48 According to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the \\"sword verses\\" over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances. For example, according to Diane Morgan, Ibn Kathir (1301‚Äì1372) asserted that the Sword Verse abrogated all peace treaties that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters. Modernists reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation. Peace and conciliation Numerous scholars and authors, both Muslim and non-Muslim have testified to the underlying rejection of violence, cruelty, coercion, and intolerance of the Quran and its embrace of justice and self-defence. According to Fawzy Abdelmalek, \\"many Muslim scholars speak of Islam as a religion of peace and not of violence. They say that the non-Muslims misunderstand the Quran verses about Jihad and the conduct of war in Islam.\\" Nissim Rejwan asserts that \\"violence and cruelty are not in the spirit of the Quran, nor are they found in the life of the Prophet, nor in the lives of saintly Muslims.\\" According to Feisal Abdul Rauf, \\"the Quran expressly and unambiguously prohibits the use of coercion in faith because coercion would violate a fundamental human right‚Äî the right to a free conscience. A different belief system is not deemed a legitimate cause for violence or war under Islamic law. The Quran is categorical on this: \\"There shall be no compulsion in religion\\" (2:256); \\"Say to the disbelievers [that is, atheists, or polytheists, namely those who reject God] \\"To you, your beliefs, to me, mine\\" (109:1‚Äì6)\\" Charles Matthews characterizes the peace verses as saying that, \\"if others want peace, you can accept them as peaceful even if they are not Muslim.\\" As an example, Matthews cites the second sura which commands believers not to transgress limits in warfare: \\"fight in God's cause against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits [in aggression]; God does not love transgressors\\" (2:190). Chiba and Schoenbaum argue that Islam \\"does not allow Muslims to fight against those who disagree with them regardless of belief system\\", but instead \\"urges its followers to treat such people kindly\\".60:8 Yohanan Friedmann has argued that the Quran does not promote fighting for the purposes of religious coercion, although the war as described is \\"religious\\" in the sense that the enemies of the Muslims are described as \\"enemies of God\\" (8:57‚Äì62). Solomon A. Nigosian has argued that in \\"duty to halt aggression or to strive for the preservation of Islamic principles\\", fighting may be involved, where the Quran encourages them to \\"fight courageously and steadfastly against recalcitrant states, be they Muslim or non-Muslim.\\" He also argues that the \\"Quranic statement is clear\\" on the issue of fighting in defence of Islam as \\"a duty that is to be carried out at all costs\\", where \\"God grants security to those Muslims who fight in order to halt or repel aggression\\". According to Chandra Muzaffar, \\"The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not.\\" In the Islamic telling of Cain and Abel, Abel tells his murderous brother that \\"If thou dost stretch thy hand against me to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah\\".Al-Ma'ida Some scholars, such as Jawdat Said,Said, Jawdat. \\"The Doctrine of the First Son of Adam\\", 1964 have identified this as an example of pacifism.McGaffey, Rahula. \\"Making Peace: Non-violence and peacebuilding in Palestine\\" Various Ahmadis scholars like Muhammad Ali, Maulana Sadr-ud-Din, Basharat Ahmad and also the British orientalist Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V \\"Jihad\\" p. 414 \\"When shall war cease\\".

Sword verses Quran scholars claim that the textual context of this particular passage is defensive war after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was broken by the Qurayshi-affiliated Banu Bakr tribe when they attacked the Muslim-allied tribe of Banu Khaza'a. In response, the Prophet sent a letter requesting the Quraysh to either terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr or pay a ransom. The Quraysh rejected both of Mohammad's offers, thus, breaking the treaty. It is also agreed upon that the verse refers to only the ones who broke the treaty. The previous verse says: This has been used to argue that fighting is only permissible as a form of defence.http://alpha.quran.com/2/190-192?startPlay=undefined There are two points made in verse 2:191 that may cause some debate. The first is that the killing of others is authorized in the event of \\"persecution;\\" Muhsin Khan translates, Micheline R. Ishay has argued that \\"the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty\\". Mufti M. Mukarram Ahmed has also argued that the Quran encourages people to fight in self-defence. He has also argued that the Quran has been used to direct Muslims to make all possible preparations to defend themselves against enemies. At-Tawba 5 Antonie Wessels identifies two verses in the Quran (9:5 and 9:29) that are called \\"sword verses\\" though he notes that the word 'sword' does not occur in the Quran. In particular, verse 9:5 from Surah At-Tawba is known as the Ayat al- sayf, Ayah of the Sword or The Sword Verse. According to Yusuf Ali, in order to understand the context, we need to read from verse 1 of this surah. It says that there was a peace treaty between the Muslims and the Mushriks (pagans) of Makkah. This treaty was violated by the Mushriks of Makkah. A period of four months was given to the Pagans of Makkah to make amends. Otherwise, a war would be declared against them. The Quran not only says that a Pagan seeking asylum during the battle should be granted refuge, but also that he should be escorted to a secure place so that he may be enticed to join the fold of Islam. Reuven Firestone says that Ibn Kathir held that four of the \\"sword verses\\" refer specifically to \\"four types of people against whom the Muslims are obligated to fight: 9:5 refers to fighting the idolaters; 9:29 refers to fighting the Scriptuaries until they pay the poll tax; 9:73 refers to fighting those who outwardly appear as Muslims but who actually oppose Muhammad and the community of Islam, and 49:9 refers to fighting Muslims who unjustly oppress other Muslims.\\" Arun Shourie has criticized the sword verse and many others from the Quran. He says that the sunnah and the hadith are equally evocative in their support of Jihad, which he deems to be the leitmotiv of the Quran.Shourie, Arun. Indian Controversies, Essays in Religion and Politics ASA Publications, New Delhi-110021 Patricia Crone states that the famous Verse of the Sword is directed against a particular group accused of oath-breaking and aggression, and exempts those polytheists who remained faithful. Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the rules mentioned above. Here also it is stressed that one must stop when they do.Patricia Crone, Encyclopedia of the Quran, War article, p. 456 Explaining the context of this verse, Quranic scholars (such as Muhammad Asad and Maulana Muhammad Ali) state that the permission to fight and kill is being given regarding specific tribes already at war with the Muslims who have breached their peace agreements and have attacked the Muslims first.Asad, Muhammad: The Message of The Quran. Footnote 7, p. 256. Redwood Books, Wiltshire, Great Britain Oliver Leaman purports that Quran 60.8 implies that \\"non-Muslims of good will and pacific nature cannot be the targets of war simply on account of their different religious background.\\" Warfare The Quran asserts that if the use of force would not have been allowed in curbing the evils by nations, the disruption and disorder caused by insurgent nations could have reached the extent that the places of worship would have become deserted and forsaken. As it states: Javed Ahmed Ghamidi divides just warfare into two types: # Against injustice and oppression # Against the rejecters of truth after it has become evident to them The first type of Jihad is generally considered eternal, but Ghamidi holds that the second is specific to people who were selected by God for delivering the truth as an obligation. They are called witnesses of the truth (Arabic:', see also Itmam al-hujjah); the implication being that they bear witness to the truth before other people in such a complete and ultimate manner that no one is left with an excuse to deny the truth. There is a dispute among Islamic jurists as to whether the act of being \\"witness\\" was only for the Companions of Muhammad or whether this responsibility is still being held by modern Muslims, which may entitle them to take actions to subdue other Non-Muslim nations. Proponents of Companions of Muhammad as being \\"the witness\\" translate the following verse only for the Companions while others translate it for the whole Muslim nation.Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, The Meaning of the Qur'an (tafsir), commentary on verse 2:143. Translatedquran.com As in Quran: Similarly, proponents of the companions of Muhammad as being \\"the witness\\" present the following verse to argue that the companions were chosen people as witnesses just as God chooses Messengers from mankind. As in Quran: Following is the first verse of the Quran in which the Companions of Muhammad, who had migrated from Mecca, were given permission to fight back if they were attacked: The reason for this directive in Medina instead of Mecca considered by most Muslim scholars is that without political authority armed offensives become tantamount to spreading disorder and anarchy in the society. As one of Islamic jurist writes: Subduing the enemy These verses told Muslims that they should not merely fight the Banu Quraish if they resist them in offering Hajj, but the Quran goes on to say that they should continue to fight them until persecution is uprooted and Islam prevails in the whole of Arabia. Initially, Muslims were required to fulfil this responsibility even if the enemy was 10 times stronger. Afterwards, the Quran reduced the burden of this responsibility. As in Quran: Some interpret above verses that jihad never becomes obligatory unless the military might of the Muslims reaches a certain level. In the times of Muhammad, when large-scale conversions took place in the later phase, the Quran reduced the Muslim to enemy ratio to 1:2. It seems that Muslims should not only consolidate their moral character, but it is also imperative for them to build their military might if they want to wage Jihad when the need arises. The Quran gave a similar directive to Muslims of Muhammad's times in the following words: Other scholars consider the later command of ratio 1:2 only for a particular time.Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi.Tafhim al-Quran. Verse 8:66 A policy was adopted regarding the extent of the requirement that arose in wars that the Muslims had to fight. In the battles of Badr, Uhud and Tabuk, the response was much more and each Muslim was required to present his services as a combatant. As in Quran: Quran also states that turning backs in the battlefield, except for tactical purposes, is a big sin and will bring wrath of God.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i-Quran, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 450‚Äì51 As in Quran: Proper fighting motivation Islamic scholars agree that Jihad should not be undertaken to gratify one's whims nor to obtain wealth and riches. Many also consider that it must also not be undertaken to conquer territories and rule them or to acquire fame or to appease the emotions of communal support, partisanship and animosity. On the contrary, it should be undertaken only for the cause of Allah as is evident from the words. As in Quran: Muhammad, in various instances, also explained very forcefully this purport of the Quran: * Abu Musa Ash'ari narrates that once a person came to Muhammad and said that some people fight for the spoils of war, some for fame and some to show off their valour; he then asked Muhammad: \\"Which of them fight in the way of Allah\\". Muhammad replied: \\"Only that person fights in the way of Allah who sets foot in the battlefield to raise high the name of Allah\\". Sahih Bukhari 2810 * Abu Hurayrah narrates from Muhammad: \\"I swear by the Almighty that a person who is wounded in the way of Allah ‚Äì and Allah knows full well who is actually wounded in His way ‚Äì he would be raised on the Day of Judgement such that his colour be the colour of blood with the fragrance of musk around him\\". Sahih Bukhari 2803 * Ibn Jabr narrates from Muhammad: \\"A person whose feet become dust ridden because of [striving] in the way of Allah will never be touched by the flames of Hell\\". Sahih Bukhari 2811 * Sahal Ibn Sa'ad says that Muhammad once said: \\"To reside in a border area for a day to protect [people] against an enemy [invasion] is better than this world and everything it has\\". Sahih Bukhari 2892. Similarly, as a reward for participation in such a strive, the Quran states: ; Opportunities for plunder and reward in heaven Sura 4 verses 71‚Äì76 urge Muslims to liberate the oppressed and also warns those who stay behind and fail to fight that they shall miss out on plunder, but those who fight and slain shall go to heaven: Most Muslim scholars consider it an eternal directive and believe that all types of oppression should be considered under this directive.Concept of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb, Islam online (English), ask scholar , Islamonline.net. Similarly, if a group of Muslims commit unwarranted aggression against some of their brothers and does not desist from it even after all attempts of reconciliation, such a group according to the Quran should be fought with: Regulation of warfare Islamic Law, based upon the Quran and practices of Muhammad has set down a set of laws to be observed during the lesser Jihad. Quran forbids fighting in the sacred month and similarly within the boundaries of Haram (the area around the Grand Mosque of Mecca). But if non-Muslims disregard these sanctities, Muslims are asked to retaliate in equal measure.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i-Quran, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 479‚Äì80 It is stated in Quran: Observance of treaties and pacts is stressed in the Quran. When some Muslims were still in Mecca, and they could not migrate to Medina, the Quran stated: Similar reports are attributed to Muhammad: The basic principle in fighting in the Quran is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defence, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.Micheline R. Ishay, The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era, University of California Press, p. 45Douglas M. Johnston, Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik, Oxford University Press, p. 48 The principle of forgiveness is reiterated in between the assertions of the right to self-defence. During his life, Muhammad gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, Abu Bakr, in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army: These injunctions were honored by the second Caliph, Umar, during whose reign (634‚Äì644) important Muslim conquests took place.Nadvi(2000), p. 519 These principles were also honoured during the Crusades, as exemplified by sultans such as Saladin and al-Kamil. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic laws of war, commenting on how al- Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food: During the Battle of Siffin, the Caliph Ali stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy.Encyclopaedia of Islam (2005), p.204 In addition to the Rashidun Caliphs, hadiths attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the Muslim conquest of Egypt: The early Islamic treatises on international law from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic economic jurisprudence, ethics and military jurisprudence to international law, and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the law of treaties; the treatment of diplomats, hostages, refugees and prisoners of war; the right of asylum; conduct on the battlefield; protection of women, children and non-combatant civilians; contracts across the lines of battle; the use of poisonous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.  Al-Anfal 39  According to verses , the objectives of Muslims in their fighting should be to: # Put a stop to tumult, oppression injustice (Uproot fitnah (') or persecution, some scholars argue that the word fitnah means Shirk ) # Establish supremacy of God, through Islam, in the Arabian Peninsula Military campaigns of Muhammad and his companions After Itmam al-hujjah (clarification of religion to the addressees in its ultimate form), Jews were subdued first and had been granted amnesty because of various pacts. Those among them who violated these pacts were given the punishment of denying a Messenger of God. Muhammad exiled the tribe of Banu Qaynuqa to Khyber and that of Banu Nadir to Syria.Ibn Hisham, al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 40‚Äì42, 151‚Äì60 the Banu Qaynuqa at Khyber was crushed by an attack at their strongholds. Prior to this, Abu al-Rafi and Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf were put to death in their houses.Ibn Hisham, al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 43‚Äì48Ibn Sa'ad, al-Tabaqatu'l-Kubra, vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1960), p. 28 The tribe of Banu Qurayza was guilty of treachery and disloyalty in the battle of the Ahzab.Ibn Hisham, al-Sirah al- Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 180‚Äì82 When the clouds of war dispersed and the chances of an external attack no longer remained, Muhammad laid siege around them. When no hope remained, they asked Muhammad to appoint Sa'd ibn Mua'dh as an arbitrator to decide their fate. Their request was accepted. Since, at that time, no specific punishment had been revealed in the Quran about the fate of the Jews, Sa'd ibn Mua'dh announced his verdict in accordance with the Torah. As per the Torah, the punishment in such situations was that all men should be put to death; the women and children should be made slaves and the wealth of the whole nation should be distributed among the conquerors.Deuteronomy, 20:10‚Äì14Caesar E. Farah. Islam: Beliefs and Observances, pp.52 In accordance with this verdict pronounced, all men were executed.Ibn Hisham, al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 188‚Äì89 John Esposito writes that Muhammad's use of warfare, in general, was alien neither to Arab custom nor to that of the Hebrew prophets, as both believed that God had sanctioned battle with the enemies of the Lord.John Esposito(2005), Islam: The Straight Path, p.15 No other incident of note took place regarding the Jews until the revelation of At-Tawba, the final judgement, was declared against them: This directive related to both the Jews and the Christians. The punishment mentioned in these verses is a show of leniency to them because they were originally adherents to monotheism. The story holds that they did not benefit from this leniency because, after Muhammad's death, they once again resorted to fraud and treachery.Sahih Bukhari, 2730Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-kharaj, Fasl fi'l-Fay wa al-Khiraj, (1302 AH), p. 42Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri, Futuhu'l-Buldan, (Qumm: Manshurat al-Arummiyyah, 1404 AH), p. 73Ibn Athir, Al- Kamil fi'l-Tarikh, 1st ed., vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Beirut, 1965), p. 112 Consequently, the Jews of Khyber and the Christians of Najran were exiled once and for all from the Arabian peninsula by Umar. This exile actually fulfilled the following declaration of the Quran about them: In contrast, when the polytheists of Arabia had been similarly subdued, it was proclaimed in At- Tawba that in future no pact would be made with them. They would be given a final respite of four months and then they would be humiliated in retribution for their deeds and would in no way be able to escape from this punishment. After this time limit, the declaration is made in the Quran: After the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, Muhammad himself singled out nations by writing letters to them. In all, they were written to the heads of eight countries.The names of these heads of state are 1. Negus of Abyssinia, 2. Maqawqas of Egypt, 3. Khusro Parvez of Persia, 4. Qaysar of Rome, 5. Mundhar Ibn Sawi of Bahrain, 6. Hudhah Ibn 'Ali of Yamamah, 7. Harith Ibn Abi Shamir of Damascus, 8. Jayfar of Amman, see Muhammad as a diplomat Consequently, after consolidating their rule in the Arabian peninsula, the Companions launched attacks against these countries giving them two options if they wanted to avoid war: to accept faith or to become a dhimmi by paying the Jizya. None of these nations was considered to be adherents to polytheism, otherwise, they would have been treated in the same way as the Idolaters of Arabia. Battle of Badr Since their emigration from Mecca (622), the Muslims in Medina had depended not on farming or trading, but on continuous raids on Meccan caravans. When word of a particularly wealthy caravan escorted by Ab≈´ SufyƒÅn, head of the Umayyad clan, reached Muhammad, a raiding party of about 300 Muslims, to be led by Muhammad himself, was organized. By filling the wells on the caravan route near Medina with sand, the Muslims lured Ab≈´ SufyƒÅn's army to battle at Badr, near Medina, in March 624. Despite the superior numbers of the Meccan forces (about 1,000 men), the Muslims scored a complete victory, and many prominent Meccans were killed. The success at Badr was recorded in the Qur æƒÅn as a divine sanction of the new religion: \\"It was not you who slew them, it was God‚Ä¶in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself\\" (8:17). = Surprise attack= The Quran commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence. The Quran had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate.Maududi (1967), p. 177, vol. 2 This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war.Maududi (1998), p. 36 Forcible prevention of religious practice is considered as an act of war in Islam. Peace verses Khaled Abou El Fadl notes several verses that can easily be interpreted in support of tolerance and diversity ‚Äì a precondition for peaceful coexistence. Quran 49:13, 11:118‚Äì9, 5:48 indicate an expectation and acceptance of diversity among human beings: that diversity is part of \\"divine intent\\"; including diversity of religion: Abou El Fadl also notes verses giving a \\"mandate in favor of peace\\" and commanding Muslims not to \\"turn away unbelievers who seek to make peace\\". Comparisons with the Bible After studying the Quran in search of passages that recommended violence and comparing them with those of the Bible, American professor Philip Jenkins, who is the author of books on religious violence, came to the conclusion that the Quran is, in all, \\"far less bloody and less violent than ... the Bible.\\" In the Quran, he says, violence is generally recommended only as self-defense, whereas in the Bible \\"[t]here is a specific kind of warfare laid down ... which we can only call genocide.\\" However, Andrew Bostom, associate professor of medicine at Brown University and editor of The Legacy of Jihad, disagrees with Jenkins' assessment, stating that the Bible talks about a \\"place in time\\" and that the Quran \\"urges an ongoing struggle to defeat unbelievers\\" along with \\"The notion of jihad martyrdom is extolled in the Quran.\\" Another analysis, performed by Tom Anderson based on a text analytics software he has developed, named Odin Text, estimated that violence appears twice as much in the Old Testament as in the Quran. However, Anderson states \\"First, I want to make very clear that we have not set out to prove or disprove that Islam is more violent than other religions.\\" See also * The Bible and violence * Dar al-Harb * Islam and violence * Religion and peacebuilding * Religious violence Notes References Criticism of Islam Quran Religious ethics ","title":"Violence in the Quran"},{"id":"30056672","text":"Zaner-Bloser, Inc., headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, publishes handwriting, reading, writing, spelling, and vocabulary programs. History  Zanerian College of Penmanship  Zaner-Bloser teaching cursive Zanerian College of Penmanship Founded by Master Penman Charles Paxton Zaner, the company‚Äôs history can be traced back to 1888 when it was known as the Zanerian College of Penmanship. Zaner was able to streamline the Spencerian script method‚Äîwhich was widely used in the 19th century‚Äîby adapting a handwriting approach that was more practicable for modern business documents and personal communication.Zaner-Bloser Script Zaner‚Äôs enthusiasm about this utilitarian art inspired him to open a school that would prepare students for successful careers in the penmanship industry. In 1891, Zaner sold shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship to another skilled penman, Elmer Ward Bloser (forming the partnership that later created the Zaner-Bloser Company). While most penmanship schools at the time focused on training students for careers in ornamental writing, the Zanerian College emphasized the importance of an eclectic education by teaching psychology, physiology, and English composition.  Formation  In 1895, the Zanerian College of Penmanship became known as the Zaner-Bloser Company, which continued to offer penmanship courses, and began publishing professional materials about handwriting and illustration and selling handwriting supplies. The Zaner & Bloser Company published The Zaner Method of Arm Movement Writing in 1904, making the simplified Zanerian writing style more readily accessible to children in elementary schools all over the United States. In 1972, Zaner-Bloser, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Highlights for Children.  Contributors  Charles Paxton Zaner Charles Paxton Zaner Charles Paxton Zaner, born near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1864, began showing a fondness for handwriting early in his youth. In 1882, he enrolled in G. W. Michael's Pen Art Hall in Oberlin, Ohio. After graduation, Zaner worked as a penman at two different business colleges before deciding to open his own school in 1888‚Äîthe Zanerian College of Penmanship. In 1889, fellow Master Penman Lloyd Kelchner became a partner with Zaner, and two years later, Elmer Ward Bloser‚Äîanother skilled penman‚Äîjoined the partnership. That same year, Kelchner left the business arrangement, leading Zaner and Bloser to become equal partners in what had then become the Zaner-Bloser Company. Zaner built a reputation for himself as a Master Penman. He maximized his exposure and recognition in the industry with monthly magazines that included countless lessons in penmanship and pen art, for which he enlisted the help of other industry experts. This, as well as numerous other endeavors, established Zaner as a pivotal figure in what is called the \\"Golden Age of Ornamental Penmanship\\". Elmer Ward Bloser Elmer Ward Bloser was born in 1865 and raised on his parents‚Äô farm in Pennsylvania. His interest in writing was apparent even as a child, when he sold writing inks and supplies to neighborhood children. In 1883, Bloser began attending G.W. Michael‚Äôs Pen Art Hall, where his writing acumen eventually earned him a position as penmanship instructor. Bloser‚Äôs penmanship career advanced with such success that he was considered one of the finest in the industry. In 1891, he purchased shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship, which later became the Zaner-Bloser Company. After Charles Paxton Zaner's untimely death in 1918, Bloser purchased the company‚Äôs remaining shares, and continued to manage Zaner-Bloser‚Äôs successful operation until his own death in 1929.

Ramirez was brought by his parents to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of three. He had been injured after a car crash with a tree in January 2011, and was investigated by authorities for driving without a license, a minor infraction; illegal immigrants were not permitted to hold driver's licenses at the time.Gene Maddaus, Your Legislature At Work: As Budget Talks Drag On, Assemblyman Tim Donnelly Tries To Get Illegal Immigrant Ousted From Fresno State Student Government, LA Weekly (March 22, 2011).

She is the only female governor in a history of Kyiv Oblast since its establishment in 1932. Biography In 1980 she graduated from the Philology Department of Kyiv University after which she worked as a teacher at the professional technical college (PTU) #4 in Kyiv city. In 1981 Ulianchenko became a Komsomol activist. In 1987 Ulianchenko was elected a deputy to the municipal raion council of Soviet Raion of Kyiv city and a deputy head of the Soviet Raion executive committee. In May 1990 she started working at the local office of the Communist Party committee. From 1991 to 1993 Ulianchenko as an administrator worked in various government institutions Verkhovna Rada, Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and Presidential Administration Secretariat. From 1993 to 1994 Ulianchenko worked for a water transportation company \\"Blasko\\". Soon after the legal proceedings around the company she emigrated to the United States. However, Ulianchenko claims that she moved there to give birth to her child. In 1999 she began serving as the chief of department for the Ukrsoyuzservis. In March 2000 she worked for the Prime minister office chaired by Viktor Yushchenko. In 2002 Ulianchenko was a secretary for the political bloc Our Ukraine in Verkhovna Rada. In March 2005 Ulianchenko was elected a deputy to Verkhovna Rada as part of the political bloc Our Ukraine, which she served until May 2006. In June 2006 she was appointed the Governor of Kyiv Oblast. On May 16, 2009, Ulianchenko became the leader of Our Ukraine and few days later a head of Presidential Administration.Yushchenko appoints Vera Ulyanchenko as head of his secretariat, UNIAN (May 20, 2009) As the head of Presidential Administration she was noticed for her quick reaction on the announcement of the President of Russian Federation Dmitri Medvedev to the President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko.

Talisse (born 1970) is an American philosopher and political theorist. He is currently Professor of Philosophyhttp://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/philosophy/faculty/talisse.html and Chair of the Philosophy Department at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is also a Professor of Political Science. Talisse is a former editor of the academic journal Public Affairs Quarterly,http://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/paq.html and a regular contributor to the blog 3 Quarks Daily,http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/aboutus.html#tp where he posts a monthly column with his frequent co-author and fellow Vanderbilt philosopher Scott Aikin.http://people.vanderbilt.edu/~scott.f.aikin/ He earned his PhD in Philosophy from the City University of New York in 2001. His principal area of research is political philosophy, with an emphasis on democratic theory and liberalism. Research Talisse's philosophical work tends to employ the idiom of pragmatism, though his recent writings seem aimed at criticizing much of that tradition. Talisse is especially keen to object to the political philosophies of John Dewey, Richard Rorty, and Richard Posner. Talisse's 2007 book, A Pragmatist Philosophy of Democracy, is in large part a criticism of Deweyan Democracy.Talisse, Robert B. A Pragmatist Philosophy of Democracy, New York: Routledge, 2007 As Dewey is often regarded as the most important pragmatist philosopher, the book and related articles have stimulated several critical replies and a symposium issue of the leading journal in pragmatist philosophy, Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society.Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society , volume 45, no. 1 (2009). See also Festenstein, Matthew, \\"Pragmatism, Inquiry, and Political Liberalism,\\" Contemporary Political Theory volume 9, no. 1 (2010), pp. 25-44. Talisse's contention is that Deweyan Democracy is incompatible with a due recognition of what John Rawls called \\"the fact of reasonable pluralism,\\" which is the fact that several different views of the good life exist and persist among free persons. Deweyan Democracy, Talisse contends, is based on the idea that all social institutions should be designed to realize but one conception of the good life; Deweyan Democracy is consequently unfit as a model of modern democracy. In place of Deweyan Democracy, Talisse presents a view he allies with Charles Sanders Peirce according to which the epistemic processes of inquiry and reasoning supply sufficient grounds for democracy. Talisse's view is hence properly regarded as a species of deliberative democracy. In drawing on Peirce, Talisse is allied with Cheryl Misak of the University of Toronto, who argues for a similar view.Misak, Cheryl. Truth, Politics, and Morality (New York: Routledge, 2000) Talisse and Misak are commonly discussed and criticized together, as proposing a single kind of view generally known as \\"Peircean Democracy.\\"See Bacon, Michael, \\"The Politics of Truth: A Critique of Peircean Deliberative Democracy,\\" Philosophy and Social Criticism, vol 36, no 9 (2010): pp. 1075-1091 The view proposed by Talisse and Misak is also sometimes called \\"pragmatist political liberalism.\\" Talisse is also known as a proponent of epistemic democracy, the view according to which part of the justification for democracy lies in its ability to produce collective decisions that are in some sense true or correct. He has also published several articles criticizing the value pluralism associated with Isaiah Berlin, William Galston, and John Gray; his 2012 book, Pluralism and Liberal Politics is devoted to these debates. Folk epistemology In his most recent writing, Talisse has downplayed the pragmatist roots of his views, and instead attempted to devise a deliberative democratic theory from what he calls \\"folk epistemology\\".Talisse, Robert. Democracy and Moral Conflict (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Ch 3 The idea is that there are epistemic norms which govern epistemic agents simply in virtue of the fact that they hold beliefs. One such norm is that we take what we believe to be true, and therefore tend to see the falsity of a statement to be a decisive reason against believing it. Talisse argues that the truth norm of belief can be shown to imply additional norms of belief, and that once these norms are identified they can be seen to provide compelling reasons for epistemic agents to uphold the social and political norms of democracy. Talisse's surprising conclusion is that our most basic reasons to be democrats, it seems, are epistemological and not moral. Given the epistemological nature of Talisse's democratic theory, his work tends to engage questions about public discourse, argumentation, the media, and public ignorance. Informal logic Talisse has also contributed to contemporary discussions in informal logic. In a paper published in 2006 titled \\"Two Forms of the Straw Man\\",Talisse and Aikin, \\"Two Forms of the Straw Man,\\" Argumentation 20.3 (2006): 345-352 Talisse and Aikin proposed an original analysis of a new form of the Straw Man Fallacy, what they called The Weak Man Fallacy. In the traditional Straw Man, one misconstrues one's interlocutor's argument in a way that makes it especially weak, and then refutes it. In the Weak Man version, one selects an especially weak rendition of the opposing view, treats it as representative of the opposition as such, and refutes it, leaving one's audience with the impression that the opposition has thereby been refuted when in fact only the most vulnerable version of the opposing view has been addressed. Talisse and Aikin have also published a paper about the rhetorical strategy of repeating one's interlocutor's position in a dismissive or mocking tone of voice, which is titled \\"Modus Tonens\\".Talisse, Robert and Scott Aikin, \\"Modus Tonens,\\" Argumentation 22 (2008), pp. 521-529 Talisse and Aikin have written a book together about atheism that is forthcoming from Prometheus Books titled Reasonable Atheism. 2002 conference controversy In 2002, Talisse co-organized a conference marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of the pragmatist philosopher and public intellectual Sidney Hook. The conference provoked some controversy when several neoconservatives, including Irving Kristol, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Hilton Kramer, who had been invited to speak at the conference withdrew upon learning that the pragmatist philosopher Cornel West had also been invited. According to Talisse, some of those who withdrew threatened to also attempt to convince those who had provided funding for the event to withdraw.Alterman, Eric. \\"Who's Afraid of Cornel West?\\" The Nation, July 15, 2002 Despite the protests, the conference was held at the City University of New York Graduate Center in October 2002, with West as a participant. Public appearances In February 2010 Talisse appeared on the popular podcast Philosophy Bites where he was interviewed by Nigel Warburton about pragmatism and American philosophy.

Rogers was one of the first Black comedians allowed to directly address a white audience when he worked. Before Rogers, African-American funny men had to either work in pairs or groups, only conversing with each other, and they had to play a character, while popular white comedians, such as Bob Hope and Jack Benny got to play themselves. Rogers worked by himself, always dressed well, often wearing a tuxedo, and never wore blackface. His humor was clean, topical, and political. Rogers was inducted into the National Comedy Hall of Fame in 1993, and is often called the Jackie Robinson of comedy, because he opened the door for other performers such as Dick Gregory and Bill Cosby. As a singer, he often accompanied himself on a distinctive 10-stringed stringed instrument called a Martin tiple, including a 1975 television performance in a musical duet with Redd Foxx on the Sanford and Son series, playing a character named \\"Smiley Rogers.\\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0737237/ Early life Timmie Rogers was born in Detroit. At the age of eight, he was earning money by dancing on the street. At the age of 12, Rogers ran away from home and found a job as a dishwasher on a boat, where he learned the languages of the cooks; eventually, he spoke nine. Rogers would later write and record in French and German. Later he cleaned ashtrays at a local ballroom, absorbed what he saw and was invited to dance onstage before acts. By 1932, Rogers was part of a successful dance team, Timmie & Freddie, that performed on the vaudeville circuit. They split in 1944 as blacks across the country were developing a collective voice in the name of civil rights, and Rogers decided to try it on his own, his way. Career He was known as the Unknown Pioneer of (Black) Comedy. He insisted on not wearing blackface when performing his comedy act and stood firm with his conviction. His catchphrase was \\"Oh Yeah!\\" and it was a part of his act for over 50 years. Rogers starred in US television's first black prime-time show Uptown Jubilee on CBS Television in 1949. He was also a recurring guest star on The Jackie Gleason Show for over 12 years, and would continue to work with Jackie Gleason for the next thirty years. Rogers later credited Gleason for giving him national exposure which helped his career. Rogers also wrote music including \\"If You Can‚Äôt Smile and Say Yes\\", a song recorded by Nat King Cole. He also wrote songs for Carmen McRae and Sarah Vaughan. In the late 1950s and living in Philadelphia, he recorded on Cameo and Parkway Records. His hits included \\"Back to School Again\\" and \\"I Love Ya, I Love Ya, I Love Ya\\". Death On December 17, 2006, Rogers died of undisclosed causes in Los Angeles at the age of 91. He was survived by two daughters, five grandchildren and one great grandchild.

An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and MagnetismGreen, G. (1828). An essay on the application of mathematical analysis to the theories of electricity and magnetism. Nottingham. Printed for the author, by T. Wheelhouse.Cannell, D.M. (1999) George Green: An Enigmatic Mathematician, American Mathematical Monthly 106(2), 136‚Äì151. is a fundamental publication by George Green in 1828, where he extends previous work of Sim√©on Denis Poisson on electricity and magnetism. The work in mathematical analysis, notably including what is now universally known as Green's theorem, is of the greatest importance in all branches of mathematical physics. It contains the first exposition of the theory of potential. In physics, Green's theorem is mostly used to solve two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflows at any point inside a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter. It is in this essay that the term 'potential function' first occurs. Herein also his remarkable theorem in pure mathematics, since universally known as Green's theorem, and probably the most important instrument of investigation in the whole range of mathematical physics, made its appearance. We are all now able to understand, in a general way at least, the importance of Green's work, and the progress made since the publication of his essay in 1828. But to fully appreciate his work and subsequent progress one needs to know the outlook for the mathematico-physical sciences as it appeared to Green at this time and to realize his refined sensitiveness in promulgating his discoveries.Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society By American Mathematical Society. Published for the Society by Macmillan & Co., 1900. p. 139.  Overview  Poisson's electrical and magnetical investigations were generalized and extended in 1828 by George Green. Green's treatment is based on the properties of the function already used by Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson, which represents the sum of all the electric or magnetic charges in the field, divided by their respective distances from some given point: to this function Green gave the name potential, by which it has always since been known. In 1828, Green published the paper which is the essay he is most famous for today. When Green published his Essay, it was sold on a subscription basis to 51 people, most of whom were friends and probably could not understand it. The wealthy landowner and mathematician Edward Bromhead bought a copy and encouraged Green to do further work in mathematics. Not believing the offer was sincere, Green did not contact Bromhead for two years. Upon publishing the work, he first introduced the term 'potential' to denote the result obtained by adding the masses of all the particles of a system, each divided by its distance from a given point; and the properties of this function are first considered and applied to the theories of magnetism and electricity. This was followed by two papers communicated by Sir Bromhead to the Cambridge Philosophical Society: (1)' On the Laws of the Equilibrium of Fluids analogous to the Electric Fluid ' (12 Nov. 1832); (2)' On the Determination of the Attractions of Ellipsoids of Variable Densities ' (6 May 1833). Both papers display great analytical power, but are rather curious than practically interesting. Green's 1828 essay was neglected by mathematicians till 1846, and before that time most of its important theorems had been rediscovered by Gauss, Chasles, Sturm, and Thomson J.Maxwell, J. C. (1881). A treatise on electricity and magnetism. p. 14. It did influence the work of Lord Kelvin and James Clerk Maxwell. The self-taught mathematician's essay was one of the greatest advances that were made in the mathematical theory of electricity up to his time. \\"His researches,\\" as Sir William Thomson has observed, \\"have led to the elementary proposition which must constitute the legitimate foundation of every perfect mathematical structure that is to be made from the materials furnished in the experimental laws of Coulomb. Not only do they afford a natural and complete explanation of the beautiful quantitative experiments which has been so interesting at all times to practical electricians, but they suggest to the mathematician the simplest and most powerful methods of dealing with problems which, if attacked by the mere force of the old analysis, must have remained forever unsolved.\\" Near the beginning of the memoir is established the celebrated formula connecting surface and volume integrals, which is now generally called Green's Theorem, and of which Poisson's result on the equivalent surface ‚Äì and volume ‚Äì distributions of magnetization is a particular application. By using this theorem to investigate the properties of the potential, Green arrived at many results of remarkable beauty and interest. We need only mention, as an example of the power of his method, the following: ‚Äî Suppose that there is a hollow conducting shell, bounded by two closed surfaces, and that a number of electrified bodies are placed, some within and some without it; and let the inner surface and interior bodies be called the interior system, and the outer surface and exterior bodies be called the exterior system. Then all the electrical phenomena of the interior system, relative to attractions, repulsions, and densities, will be the same as if there were no exterior system, and the inner surface were a perfect conductor, put in communication with the earth; and all those of the exterior system will be the same as if the interior system did not exist, and the outer surface were a perfect conductor, containing a quantity of electricity equal to the whole of that originally contained in the shell itself and in all the interior bodies. It will be evident that electrostatics had by this time attained a state of development in which further progress could be hoped for only in the mathematical superstructure, unless experiment should unexpectedly bring to light phenomena of an entirely new character.Whittaker, E. T. (1910). A history of the theories of aether and electricity from the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century. Dublin University Press series. London: Longmans, Green and Co.; [etc.]. pp. 65‚Äì69 One of the simplest applications of these theorems was to perfect the theory of the Leyden phial, a result which (if we except the peculiar action of the insulating solid medium, since discovered by Faraday) we owe to his genius. He has also shown how an infinite number of forms of conductors may be invented, so that the distribution of electricity in equilibrium on each may be expressible in finite algebraic terms ‚Äì an immense stride in the science, when we consider that the distribution of electricity on a single spherical conductor, an uninfluenced ellipsoidal conductor, and two spheres mutually influencing one another, were the only cases solved by Poisson, and indeed the only cases conceived to be solvable by mathematical writers.Baynes, T.

As her reward, she received a fully nickel-coated Columbia bicycle from the American Bicycle Company, along with an ornate tool storage pouch, a solid silver cyclometer from The Standard Watch Company, and a silver search lamp from the Bridgeport Brass Company.New York Times, February 16, 1896 Death On October 1, 1898, Caroline Miskel Hoyt, who had become acutely ill with kidney problems, became gravely ill following the birth of her son. Both died the next day, and mother and son were interred together at the Hoyt family plot in Charlestown, New Hampshire.The Atlantic Monthly, Volumes 287‚Äì288 The loss brought about the decline of Charles Hoyt, leading to his death in November 1900.

Born in Brisbane, he was a businessman when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Reserve in 1937. Called up for active duty shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939, he served with No. 23 Squadron in Australia before posting to the South West Pacific theatre with No. 21 Squadron in Singapore. In March 1942 he joined No. 75 Squadron in Port Moresby, New Guinea, flying P-40 Kittyhawks under the command of his eldest brother, John. During the ensuing Battle of Port Moresby, Les shot down four Japanese aircraft. Jackson took over command of No. 75 Squadron after his brother was killed in action on 28 April 1942, leading it in the Battle of Milne Bay later that year. Credited with a fifth aerial victory, he became the RAAF's first ace in the New Guinea campaign, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). By 1944, Jackson was wing leader of No. 78 (Fighter) Wing in Western New Guinea, gaining promotion to wing commander in September that year. Awarded a bar to his DFC in March 1945, he served as chief flying instructor at No. 8 Operational Training Unit in Australia, and saw out the war as commander of Air Defence Headquarters, Madang. After leaving the RAAF in 1946, Jackson returned to the business world, running two garages. He died in Southport, Queensland, in 1980.  Early career  Les Jackson was born on 24 February 1917 in the Brisbane suburb of Newmarket, Queensland, the fourth son of businessman William Jackson and his wife Edith. His first job following education at Brisbane Grammar School was as an accountant in the family firm of J. Jackson & Co. Pty Ltd.

Five Kittyhawks led by John Jackson attacked and destroyed a dozen Japanese planes on the ground, while four others including Les provided protective cover above; he survived an encounter with three Mitsubishi Zeros that saw two of his fellow pilots shot down. Two days later he recorded his first aerial victory when he intercepted and destroyed a Zero escorting a force of bombers towards Port Moresby. On 6 April, Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that his brother John dropped to him.Ewer, Storm Over Kokoda, pp. 155‚Äì157Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 169 In the following weeks, Les accounted for another three Japanese aircraft shot down.

On 25 August, the Kittyhawks launched an attack on enemy barges at Goodenough Island that resulted in all seven vessels being set on fire without the loss of any aircraft.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 607‚Äì609 The next day, Jackson personally led two of his unit's five concerted strafing assaults on the main Japanese convoy approaching Milne Bay. On 27 August, he and a fellow pilot each claimed a Zero; the Japanese fighters had been focussing on machine-gunning one of their own aircraft that had crash-landed following combat with a USAAF B-26 Marauder, presumably to prevent it falling into Allied hands, and were 'bounced' by the Australian pilots.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 611‚Äì613 His victory made Jackson an ace, the first from the RAAF in New Guinea.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, pp. 58‚Äì59 By 28 August, Japanese troops were threatening to overrun the RAAF airfield at Milne Bay, and the Kittyhawk squadrons were ordered to withdraw to Port Moresby for one night. Returning to Milne Bay the next day, Jackson‚Äôs plane developed trouble and he had to ditch on the coast; with the help of New Guinea natives, he reached Port Moresby by boat three days later. By 7 September the Japanese had withdrawn their troops from the Milne Bay area; Generals Sydney Rowell and Cyril Clowes both described the efforts of Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons as \\"the decisive factor\\" in repulsing the invading forces.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 615‚Äì617 No. 75 Squadron was redeployed to Horn Island, Queensland, in September 1942, and Jackson handed over command to Squadron Leader John Meehan the following January.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 620RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, p. 46 In recognition of his \\"courage and leadership\\" in New Guinea, Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), which was promulgated in the London Gazette on 26 March 1943.Recommended: Distinguished Flying Cross at Australian War Memorial.

It was nominated for the 2010 Spiel des Jahres award and won the 2010 Deutscher Spiele Preis. Each player in Fresco takes the role of master painter attempting to restore the fresco on a cathedral ceiling, earning points for each section they repair. Players must manage a team of apprentices who will buy or mix the required paints, paint portraits to earn money, and keep the bishop happy. Overworked apprentices may leave the painter's service, reducing the actions the player can take. A player can improve morale, and even gain extra actions, by letting his workers sleep late. However, this can allow earlier players to block his ability to buy necessary paints or to restore a section of the fresco before he can get to it. During each turn in Fresco, players secretly assign their five apprentices to any of several locations. Choices are then revealed and each location is visited in turn. At the market apprentices can buy paint in the primary colors. At the cathedral they can restore a fresco using specified colors to score points and gain income for future turns. In the studio they can paint portraits for the bourgeois to earn money. At the workshop they mix the purchased paints into more valuable secondary colors. Or apprentices can be given a night off at the theater to improve morale. Play continues until most or all of the fresco is restored, whereupon the points are totaled and the painter who has impressed to bishop most greatly is the winner. Fresco can be played with the standard game only or with any of eleven \\"expansion modules.\\" Modules 1-3 were included in the original publication of Fresco. Queen published a boxed expansion featuring Modules 4-6 in 2010 and a second expansion containing Modules 8-10 in 2013. The Modules include: *In the original box:  Module 1: The Portraits. Gives the player various random rewards for painting portraits in the studio.  Module 2: The Bishop's Request: Gives additional point and paint rewards if players forfeit some of their income from the restored fresco to meet specific requests.  Module 3: Special Blend Colors: Makes available additional paint colors (brown and pink) that must be mixed and can provide higher points if used to restore the cathedral. * First expansion (2010):  Module 4: The Wishing Well: Gives early players in the market each turn an opportunity to get a small random bonus.  Module 5: The Leaf Gold: Painters can acquire gold leaf. If they use this to gild paint of a particular, randomly determined, color, they earn additional points.  Module 6: The Glaziers: Painters may acquire pieces of stained glass in various colors at the glaziery! A new location. When they restore a segment of the fresco near a cathedral window, they must also supply glass in specified colors for additional points. But if they fail, their point reward for restoring the fresco is reduced. * 2010 Essen Spiel module:  Module 7: The Scrolls: Players can get substantial extra points for restoring fresco sections in a particular row or column. A small addition made available at Essen, Queen Games later published this as a standalone expansion. * 2011 Essen Spiel module:  The Bishop's Favor (unnumbered \\"mini-expansion\\"): An additional random small reward is given to a painter for each fresco segment he restores under the bishop's supervision. Created for the 2011 Essen Spiel, this mini- expansion was later made available to purchase online. * Second expansion (2013):  Module 8: The Bells: The painters may contribute to the restoration of the cathedral bells for additional points. However, if they cannot afford the full cost they cannot earn income until they fulfill their pledge.  Module 9: The Wall Fresco: Adds an additional small fresco to be restored. The sections of the wall fresco require only one paint to restore, but their rewards are smaller.  Module 10: The Medico: An illness is spreading among the apprentices, reducing their ability to work, but a visiting medicine seller has the cure.

The name translates into English as \\"son of Alasdair\\". The feminine form of the name is NicAlasdair, which translates into English as \\"daughter of Alasdair\\". These surnames originated as a patronyms, however they no longer refer to the actual name of the bearer's father. There are numerous Anglicised forms of MacAlasdair. The Irish form of MacAlasdair is Mac Alasdair. Other similar Irish surnames are Mac Alastair, Mac Alastruim and Mac Alsandair. The feminine forms of these surnames for unmarried females are Nic Alasdair, Nic Alastair, Nic Alastruim, and Nic Alsandair.

The Irish and Scottish Gaelic have many Anglicised forms. The Scottish Gaelic name has been borne by a notable Scottish clan, which was once seated on the south-west coast of Scotland. The Irish names have been borne by descendants of Scots who settled in the north of Ireland. Etymology The Scottish Gaelic MacAlasdair originated as a patronym, in the form of mac Alasdair, which translates into English as \\"son of Alasdair\\". Today, however, the surname MacAlasdair does not refer to the actual name of the bearer's father. The name Alasdair is a Scottish Gaelic equivalent of the English Alexander, which is derived from the Latin form of the Greek Alexandros. This Greek name is composed of two elements: the first, alexein, meaning \\"to defend\\"; the second, aner, meaning \\"man\\" or \\"warrior\\" (the genitive of aner is andros). Alexander has been an extremely popular given name in Scotland since the Middle Ages, when it was borne by three Scottish kings. The name was introduced into the country through Margaret (died 1093), the Hungarian-born wife of Malcolm III, King of Scots; in time one of their sons became Alexander I, King of Scots (died 1124). One of the earliest instances of a form of MacAlasdair are records of \\"Ranald Makalestyr\\", who obtained a lease of lands in Arran, in 1455. Ranald is later also referred to in documents as \\"Ranald Alexandri\\", and \\"Reginald McAlestir\\" (also \\"McAlestere\\" and \\"McAlestre\\"). Feminine form MacAlasdair is a masculine surname. The Scottish Gaelic form of this surname for females is NicAlasdair. This feminine name is composed of the prefix Nic- which is an abbreviated form of the Scottish Gaelic nighean which translates into English as \\"daughter\\". Like the masculine form of the surname, NicAlasdair no longer refers to the actual name of the bearer's father.

The given name Alasdar is an Irish form of the English Alexander. The form of this Irish surname for unmarried females is Nic Alasdair; this name is actually a contracted form of In√≠on Mhic Alasdair, which translates into English as \\"daughter of Mac Alasdair\\". The form of Mac Alasdair for married females is Bean Mhic Alasdair, which translates into English as \\"wife of Mac Alasdair\\"; this surname can also be represented in the contracted form Mhic Alasdair. ;Mac Alastair A similar Irish surname is Mac Alastair, which translates into English as \\"son of Alastar\\". which is a transcription of: The Irish Alastar is an equivalent of the English Alexander. which is a transcription of: Like, Mac Alasdair, this surname no longer refers to the bearer's father, and like Mac Alasdair feminine forms of the name include Nic Alastair, Bean Mhic Alastair, and Mhic Alastair. ;Mac Alastruim Another form of the name is Mac Alastruim, which translates into English as \\"son of Alastrom\\".

Anglicised forms of Mac Alastruim include MacElistrum, MacElestrim, MacEllistram. Anglicised forms of Mac Alsandair include Alexander, MacAlshander, MacAlshender, MacAlshinder, MacCalshander, MacElshander, and MacKalshander. Families The surname MacAlasdair, and its various Anglicised forms, have been borne by members of Clan MacAlister, a noted Scottish clan that was historically seated on the south-west coast of Scotland. These MacAlasdairs are a branch of Clan Donald (Scottish Gaelic Clann Dh√≤mhnaill), although there has been confusion over who the identity of the clan's eponymous ancestor. As late as the late 19th century, it was claimed that the clan descended from Alasdair √íg, son and heir of Aonghas M√≤r, son and heir of D√≤mhnall (died mid 13th century), the eponymous ancestor of Clan Donald. However a more modern understanding is that the clan's eponymous ancestor is Alasdair M√≤r (died 1299), younger son of D√≤mhnall (eponymous ancestor of Clan Donald). Bearers of the Irish Mac Alastair, and its various Anglicised forms, include descendants of Clan Donald who settled in what is today County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Bearers of the Irish Mac Alastruim, and its various Anglicised forms, include a family centred in what is today County Kerry, Republic of Ireland; this family, according to Patrick Woulfe who wrote in the early 20th century, has been located in Kerry for centuries. According to Woulfe, Mac Alsandair, and associated Anglicised forms, are also of Scottish origin.

They are large stone and brick structures, all designed by Cass Gilbert in the Georgian Revival and Second Renaissance Revival architectural styles, built during the 1910s. In 1978 they were designated as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are now contributing properties to the Downtown Waterbury Historic District. The complex was financed by the Chase family, owners of the Chase Brass Company, one of Waterbury's major industries at the time. In the wake of a 1902 fire that had destroyed a portion of downtown, the Chases and other local businessmen saw an opportunity for urban renewal. Cass Gilbert won the competition to design a new complex a few blocks from the old city hall building (since demolished) on West Main Street. Unusual for the time, the complex would house not just the mayor and city council but the public safety functions of city government such the police and fire departments, courts and jails. In keeping with the contemporary City Beautiful movement, the complex included other large-scaled buildings in its \\"court of honor\\", such as Chase's headquarters, a building named Lincoln House for the city's charitable organizations and a dispensary. Similar architectural characteristics and motifs unite the buildings thematically. They have flat roofs, rusticated ground levels, and pilasters dividing bays in the middle stories. The two largest, City Hall and the Chase Building, have an opposite configuration. Many of the same decorative patterns are used on all the buildings. One in particular is the use of quotations from Abraham Lincoln. This is interesting since Lincoln never visited Waterbury nor had any particular connection with the city. It is possible that they reflect a renewed interest in Lincoln in the wake of the centenary of his birth or the 50th anniversary of his death, both recent occurrences at the time of the complex's construction. The headquarters building and Lincoln House have since been converted to other uses, mainly private office space and additional city offices. City government continues to occupy City Hall. By the end of the 20th century the decline of the city's industries had led to the deterioration of the building, and it was condemned by the city's building department. A bond issue was later passed to raise money for its restoration. Buildings The five buildings in the complex cover a area of Grand and Field streets on the south edge of downtown Waterbury, just north of the Interstate 84 viaduct. City Hall and the Chase Building are on opposite sides of Grand between Church, Field and Leavenworth streets; the other four are on the east side of Field. Immediately adjacent are some other public buildings: a National Guard facility to the south; the city's post office and a federal court building on the east along the south side of Grand (across from a row of commercial buildings), a state courthouse and the Silas Bronson library and its park to the west. City Hall Located on the south side of Grand, City Hall has three sections. A large main block faces the street, with two projecting rear wings on the south housing the police and fire departments. They are connected by a rear section to form a courtyard. A garage has been added to the fire station since construction. The main block is a three-story, 17-by-3-bay ( long by high) Georgian Revival structure, faced in marble on its first story and brick with marble trim on the upper two. Atop its flat roof is a small penthouse, from which a four-stage tower rises. It is set back from the street to allow for a fountain plaza Gilbert referred to as the entourage. The entourage is a rectangular area, reached by steps from the street, with a paved oval at the center. In the middle of the oval is a round marble fountain within a round catch basin. Six carved light standards, each with two lamps, flank the steps leading from the street. On either side of the entourage are large flagpoles on bronze bases inside grass parterres bordered by small hedges. At the rear of the parterres are marble urns with fountains flanking the balustraded entrance steps. Exterior On the north (front) facade, the first-story marble is rusticated. Trabeated six-over-six double-hung sash windows are slightly recessed in arched surrounds. The corners are slightly recessed; the middle 11 bays project slightly to form a small pavilion. Atop the first story of that pavilion is a blind paneled balustrade. Large fluted composite pilasters divide each bay, set with recessed nine-over-nine double- hung sash and projecting cornice caps in the pavilion and full round-arched windows on the ends. At the end of the pavilion are narrow sash windows with bronze grilles. The center bays of the end sets, and the pavilion bays, have bronze geometric balconies with center medallions. A thin terra cotta belt course with gougework and geometric shapes sets off the third story. The pavilion has trabeated six-over-six sash flanked by blind bays at its end, and the end bays have circular bas-reliefs, depicting, from east to west, \\"Industry\\" as a workman amid gears and cogs, the city seal, \\"Commerce\\", as a figure of Mercury with a caduceus, \\"Force\\" as a Roman gladiator, and Justice. In the pilaster capitals are two designs, one of which features a prominent eagle. The marble frieze below the roofline has a regular pattern of decorated discs with swags at the pavilion ends. Above it is a modillioned cornice with carved leaves and bead-and-reel moldings. They in turn support a broad balustrade. At the pavilion ends and above the three center bays are panels with vertical gougework in a wave pattern. The center is further decorated with the inscription Quid Aere Perennius, Latin for \\"more lasting than brass.\\" On the east and west sides are a central entrance with steps on either side. Above it is an arched tablet with an inscription: \\"Impartiality is the life of Justice as Justice is of all government. Justice is the constant desire and effort to render to every man his due\\" by the Roman emperor Justinian I on the west, and \\"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it\\" attributed to Abraham Lincoln on the east. The third story has a panel (further inscribed with \\"Reason is the Life of Law\\" on the west) between two circular bas-reliefs in carved leaf surrounds. On the east side they depict \\"Truth\\" as a woman contemplating a skull and \\"Prudence\\" as a woman gazing into a mirror; on the west are \\"Wisdom\\" as an aged man holding a lamp and \\"Order\\" as a female with a mace. The cupola, clock tower and weathervane atop Waterbury City Hall The tower's lowest stage has corner pilasters and louvered flat-topped openings in all four sides. Above it is a blind balustrade with corner posts and swags. Pilasters frame arched openings. Another blind balustrade, its corners topped with urns, has clocks in all four faces. The final stage is a bell-cast gilded roof with bronze weathervane. On the east side, the fire station wing is a nine-by-eleven-bay two-story structure. Like the main block it is stone on the first and brick up top. Five of the six arched bays on the east side are used for fire engine garages, their double doors topped with radiating-sash fanlights. The seventh bay is a regular door, leading to offices. The two stories are separated by another blind balustrade. Above the arched second story windows, set with six-over-six trabeated sash, is a plain cornice and marble-topped parapet. The police wing, on the east, is mostly identical. A rear wing houses the jail. It has eleven bays at street level, and the main entrance is in the center of the west facade. Its rear bays have trabeated openings with bronze grilles. Inside the wall between the two wings is a courtyard. It has gardens and benches. Several of those latter are original Gilbert designs. Interior The center door is screened by a bronze grille. It has a full foliate surround and fan, radiating from a central cluster to end in anthemia. On the door itself are grilles of square panels with center medallions that alternate between round and square shapes and rosette bindings. Behind it, there is a small vestibule. Bronze commemorative plaques on the sides honor local World War I veterans. A rear entry with sidelights topped by teardrops and an elliptical arch with fanlight, all of leaded glass, opens into the east-west central hallway. The hallway is sided in Vermont marble with carved panels featuring a fleur de lis pattern at the base, supported on eagle brackets and divided by pilasters with oak and acorn capitals. To the west of the vestibule is a panel with gilded letters both serving as a building directory and dedication plaque. Entrances are set in arcaded surrounds with medallions; the stairway and vestibule arches have eagle keystones. Atop the wall is a frieze with a center lamp between griffins holding ribbons and garlands. The coffered ceiling is painted with triangles and rosettes. Round hanging bronze glazed lanterns with clustered bulbs provide light. The front lobby is also lit from the rear by a six-over-six double-hung sash set with leaded and stained glass, opaque on the bottom but with a cartouche and swag on top. The stair climbs to a Palladian window, also with stained glass. It is decorated with swags and ribbons, corner cartouches and panels topped with eagles in the center and vases and foliation topped with a lit torch on the outer panels. A cartouche-enclosed oval at the top has the date \\"1915\\" carved within. At the landing next to this window the stairs divide. They are girded by an iron balustrade with bronze railing. The stairwell is further balustraded with a stylized compass in the center and a wave beneath the rail. In the second floor hallway, decoration is more restrained. It has marble floors, wainscoting, door and window surrounds and pilasters but the walls themselves are plaster. The pilasters are topped with Roman Doric capitals that support a decorated frieze and dentilled cornice. In the metopes are painted vases and medallions. The ceilings are plain. The original mayor's office is directly opposite the top of the stairs. It has freestanding fluted Roman Doric columns in the entrance. Fluted wall pilasters and marble wainscoting supporting a full entablature and arched ceiling. On either end of the hallway are city council chambers. The eastern one was originally built for that purpose; the western one was a courtroom. In the former, the aldermens' desks are within a semicircular balustrade outlined with paralleling benches for the public. The Roman Doric continues to be used. Fluted pilasters in that mode support a full entablature and modillioned cornice. On the ceiling are octagonal panels with rosettes at the center. From it hangs a bronze chandelier with two levels of electric candles. The wall sconces, corner lights and door clock are original. A 1934 map of Waterbury has been substituted for an original decoration behind the mayor's chair. Due to the change in use, there is less original detail in the west chamber. The balustrade, wall clock and light fixtures are among those aspects that do. The ceiling, also original, has the same center rosettes as its eastern counterpart but with square panels on the outer portions. alt=A section of a stone building. There is an arched entrance above steps at the lower level, and four columns leading to the top. Chase Headquarters Building Facing city hall from the other side of the street, the Chase building's 21-bay south (front) facade is in length, making the Chase building wider than city hall which it complements by reversing the facade planes. An iron fence with small trees runs along the sidewalk; from it a walk leads up to balustraded steps at the main entrance. On either end two three-bay‚Äìwide wings project four bays to the street. In the central 15-bay section, the middle three bays project forward slightly. The three-story building is faced entirely in Indiana limestone. The first story is, like City Hall's marble, rusticated, with the bays on the inside of the wings and the center pavilion made a series of segmented arches to give them an arcade appearance. On the east and west elevations only the interior bays are in arches. Within them are large six- over-six double-hung trabeated sash windows. Above them a cornice forms the base for fluted pilasters with Tower of the Winds capitals that divide the windows on the upper two stories. The second story windows are also sash, set in rectangular openings with sills and cornice caps on consoles topped with rosettes or oval patera. The middle bays of the wings are six-over-six in a slightly recessed arch with pedimented lintel on consoles. They have a small balcony with iron guardrails. A stringcourse around the building sets off the third story and forms its window sills. The central section has six-over-six with a plain surround. On both second and third stories of the wings' south face they are flanked by narrower four-over-four sash. The frieze below the roof cornice has rosettes or patera atop each pilaster. In the middle of the wings, and above the central pavilion, is a solid panel. That above the pavilion has \\"CHASE\\" carved in it. The north (rear) facade is less ornate but also well-delineated. A balustrade runs along the flat roof; there is a penthouse in the center. Four fluted Tower of the Winds columns rise from the balcony level of the central pavilion. The windows they divide are identical to those in the middle bays of the wing end second stories, with the third stories likewise fenestrated with shorter six-over-six. Two bronze lanterns flank the main entrance, with grille-covered four-over-four sash in the outside bays. alt=A round-arched window with a complicated iron and glass decoration. A lantern-like light fixture hangs in front. At the bottom of the window is written \\"Go forward without fear and with manly heart\\", a quotation attributed to Abraham Lincoln. The words \\"AD 1919\\" are also visible in the top of the glass in stylized script. The simple bronze door leads, as in City Hall, into a vestibule. Opposite it, across the central hallway, is the main staircase. At its landing is a multilevel stained glass window, with urns, foliate and architectural motifs flanking a central panel with another quotation from Lincoln: \\"Go forward without fear and with manly heart.\\" Near the top is \\"A.D. 1919\\". Across from the top of the stair is the building's dedication plaque. An iron balustrade with bronze railings runs along the stairs, marble like all the building's flooring. The ceilings are enameled, and the door and window surrounds dark wood. Waterbury National Bank building The former Waterbury National Bank Building, now headquarters for Junior Achievement of Southwestern New England, is located on the southeast corner of Field and Grand. It is a four-story five-by-seven-bay structure faced, like the Chase Building on the far corner, in limestone. All four facades are finished; a cast-iron fence sets off the north and west facades from the sidewalks. Both of those facades have an identical treatment, echoing the Chase Building and City Hall. Like them, the first story is finished in rusticated segmented arches. They are set with six-section rounded-arch windows, again creating an arcade effect. The windows' sections are a full window with flanking sidelights and three matching sections in the fan. Beneath them are wooden panels decorated with the same wave pattern used in City Hall's parapet panels. The corners are emphasized with slight recess and pilasters. As with the other two buildings, pilasters, here with Corinthian capitals, spring from a stringcourse above the first story to divide the bays of the second and third stories, forming a balustrade. Six-over-six trabeated double-hung sash on the second floor are topped with cap cornices. Above them the third level windows are plainer and shorter trabeated six-over-six. Above the third story is a full entablature with gouge work and medallions topped by a broad dentilled and modllioned cornice. The fourth-story windows are the same as the ones below. Above them is a slightly less broad dentilled cornice supporting a small parapet. The entrance is a simple bronze door. It opens into the former bank lobby. Bronze cashiers railings with grilles atop marble counters lead to where the tellers' cages once stood. There are front and rear mezzanines. From the marble floor square columns with neck moldings rise to the coffered marble ceiling. Iron stairs with bronze railings lead to the upper floors. Some of them have their original terrazzo floors. There are also original dark wood surrounds on some office doors, with a few having their original panels below and glazed panels of opaque glass in their upper sections and even transoms. At the first floor stair entry are the original bronze directory panel and mail chute. Power House An older building is joined to the bank building's southern elevation, between it and the Lincoln House. It is a two-story structure of brick, painted to match the limestone bank, in Flemish bond. Arched windows with stone keystones and impost blocks relate it to the other buildings in the area. It also has brick quoins and a flat roof. It is likely the only remaining structure in the neighborhood that predates the construction of the buildings, built around 1900. Originally it was used as a power station. Gilbert, who hoped to make it part of a theater that would have been the complex's sixth building, called it the \\"Power House\\" on those plans. It was later renovated and annexed to the bank building. Lincoln House On the east side of Field Street, south of the bank building, is Lincoln House. It is a three-story five-bay square Georgian Revival structure of brick laid in Flemish bond with marble trim. A flat roof is pierced by a brick chimney near the center of the north side. Exterior The west (front) facade has a slightly exposed basement with revetted four-pane sash windows. Above a marble water table, all windows are trabeated, with marble surrounds. A stringcourse of header bricks laid vertically creates a springline for the round arches with keystones that enclose the second floor windows. Both they and the first-story windows are six-over-six double-hung sash; the third story has three-over-three. Above them is a narrow dentilled cornice and parapet capped with salt-glazed tile, the latter of which runs around the entire building. All the other three facades are similarly treated. On the east (rear) the entrance is at ground level, and the windows are correspondingly dropped to provide better lighting at that level. The south side has a centrally located basement entry, matched by a smaller sash in the center of the north facade. Marble steps lead up to the main entrance, in the middle of the west elevation. Its ornate surround has engaged columns on marble bases topped by a plain frieze and open pediment. Inside that pediment is the entrance fanlight, with a molded surround of its own topped by a keystone. The door itself has deep panels, six horizontal ones atop two vertical. Interior It opens into a small vestibule. Originally on the walls were marble plaques with more Lincoln quotes, including \\"With malice toward none, and with charity towards all ...\\" from his second inaugural address. At the end of the vestibule is a door with elliptical fanlight, leaded sidelights and Adamesque detailing. Off to the right is an office and waiting room. It has another tribute to Lincoln, a shield-shaped marble plaque with the entire Gettysburg Address on it above a facsimile of Lincoln's signature. At the top is a bas-relief of Lincoln below an eagle in flight. Behind the vestibule door is a central hallway. Wainscoting along the hall continues to the main staircase in the rear. On the left is the dining room, with the greatest amount of detail of any room in the building. It has a flat baseboard with similar chair rail and picture molding. The brick of the chimney breast projects into the room space, echoing the brick of the hearth below. Above it is a Federal style mantel where flat pilaster rise to a plain frieze topped by a molded shelf. The kitchen, in the rear, retains much of its original cabinetry. At the rear of the hall the main staircase continues the wainscoting. Made of wood with round oak newel on a square base with neck molding and circular cap, it has a somewhat Victorian feel. It ends in a square room upstairs. Another stair, rising from the rear entrance, was designed to be used by those served by the charities housed in the building, and thus climbs to the third floor in short, gentle flights. It has exposed brick walls. The main stairs end in a small, plain square room on the second floor. It leads into a wider version of the central hall, meant to serve as a waiting room. Off it are some bedrooms and examining rooms. The third story is all bedrooms, and the basement is equipped with showers and fumigating rooms. Chase Memorial Dispensary The Chase Memorial Dispensary is located immediately to the south of Lincoln House on Field Street. It was the last building of the complex constructed, after the space in Lincoln House allotted to the dispensary proved inadequate. Like Lincoln House, it is of brick in Flemish bond, five bays square, with marble accents and a flat roof. Exposed basement windows below the water table are, like its neighbor, four-pane sash, with those on the upper stories trabeated six-over- six double-hung sash, in round arches on the second story. Unlike Lincoln House, the dispensary is only two stories in height. Atop the building is a narrow frieze created by vertically laid bricks and a marble cornice with Wall of Troy molded marble dentilling. The roofline has a marble balustrade instead of a parapet. The side elevations are mostly similar in treatment. The north facade has four-over-four frosted glass in the second and fourth bays at both levels and the south has a large, two-level arched window in the center bay with two six-over-six windows. In the rear the balustrade has five solid marble panels. The chimney, brick capped with marble, rises from the roof just south of the northeast corner. At the centrally located main entrance, the marble steps fan out, flanked by a cast-iron railing. It supports cast iron and frosted glass lamps on bronze standards. The doorway is recessed in a brick arch with marble keystone, carved with an oval chrysanthemum patera, and impost blocks paneled on the outer facings and autographed on the inner ones. Above the entry a marble panel reads \\"Henry Sabin Chase Memorial Dispensary\\". The front and rear doors open into identical vestibules, with screened doors at the exterior and interior doors repeating the outside doors' fanlights, sidelights and surrounds. The door designs, six horizontal panels above two vertical ones, are similar to that on the neighboring Lincoln House. From the vestibules there is access to a large central room with coved ceiling. A main desk area is on the north with a dumbwaiter connecting it to a similar area on the second floor. The stair opening is to the south; examining rooms and offices are on the east and west. The stair, flanked by an oak railing with square balusters, leads to the basement and the second floor. Upstairs, the layout is identical to the first floor except for offices in the vestibule spaces. Many sinks remain in the examining room along with cabinets and shelving. The original light fixtures, molded milk glass globes hanging from brass chains, also remain although some were damaged by plaster falling from the ceiling. alt=A black-and-white engraving of a building front very similar to the entrance pavilion on City Hall and the Chase Building Aesthetics Gilbert took as his main inspiration for City Hall the house designed in 1772 by Robert Adam for Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn at 20 St. James Square in London. \\"I have been studying a number of English examples of the Georgian period\\", he wrote to a friend, \\"and find so many in which the material was all brick or stone that I am justified in quoting this one as typical.\\" He had wanted the facing to be entirely marble as well, but the city insisted on brick and stone, an alternation which Gilbert had felt would be disharmonious given the narrow window spaces. Adam's work also inspired the coffered ceilings inside. The central stair was a tribute to the one at New York City Hall, which Gilbert had used as an example of why the face would look better with stone exclusively. Chase had originally approved a brick-and-stone concept for the company headquarters across the street, but then thought better of it. \\"...[I]t would seem a presumptuous attempt on the part of private citizens to imitate and share the dignity of city hall\\", Chase wrote Gilbert. \\"The position we hold in the community is such that we dislike very much having this impression exist.\\" For the same reason the brothers vetoed the use of a marble facade. The architect and the brothers then toured Manhattan looking for other ideas, and left it to Gilbert to come up with his ultimate solution, limestone deployed in a more Renaissance Revival style. He in turn persuaded the Chases to accept the wrought iron fence out front, using the J.P. Morgan Library in Manhattan as an example of how that element could be successful. The addition of the bank building to the complex allowed Gilbert to use the three buildings to frame the view of the clock tower for westbound traffic on Grand Street. The entourage of City Hall and corresponding setback of the Chase Building allow the tower to dominate a wide open area. When traveling the opposite direction, the large buildings emphasize the parks around them, with glimpses of the denser city beyond the spaces. Like the City Hall and Lincoln House, the Chase Building prominently features, among its architectural decorations, quotations from Abraham Lincoln. It is not known why this is so, as Lincoln had no connections to Waterbury. It is possible that renewals of interest in Lincoln in either 1909, the centenary of his birth, or 1915, the 50th anniversary of his death, may have led to this. Gilbert had apparently added \\"Quid Aere Perennius\\", the Horace quote on his own, perhaps as a joke. It now serves as the city's motto. Gilbert had also designed a flag for Waterbury, but the city's aldermen rejected it in favor of a design featuring the city seal. The city hall is frequently included in listings of Gilbert's major buildings, and he wished to remembered for it. It was used as a model for a new city hall in Lexington, Kentucky, and possibly that in Mount Vernon, Ohio, as well. Paul Wayland Bartlett, the sculptor whom at one point Gilbert had considered asking to contribute work to the building, called it \\"one of the most beautiful buildings in the United States.\\" History The complex took several years to conceive and a decade to build. It has continued to play a role in the city's history since then. 1902‚Äì1912: Renewal and concept In 1902 a fire burned three acres () of downtown Waterbury west of Waterbury Green. The city, at the height of the industrial prosperity its brassmakers had led, was easily able to rebuild. Eminent citizens of the city had also seen in the process the opportunity to rethink and reshape the city's downtown, as their counterparts had done six decades earlier when they had created the Green out of a swampy remnant of the original town common. The first part of the process was the construction of a new train station, for which the streets and blocks near it were cleared and realigned to allow the creation of a small park. Architects McKim, Mead and White gave the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad a significant Second Renaissance Revival building, capped by a clock tower based on the Torre del Mangia that has since become a symbol of the city. After three years of construction, it was completed and opened in 1909. and Henry and Frederick Chase, brothers who owned the eponymous brass company, not only the largest in the city but the country, along with the world's largest clock factory, saw how the clock tower created a new focal point along Grand Street. They felt that the street should now be the main route into downtown, worthy of its name, and developed a 20-year plan to remake it. In line with the principles of the contemporary City Beautiful movement, they felt it should be the location of a \\"court of honor\\" of newer, grander city hall, and other important public and private buildings. 1912‚Äì1924: Construction The Chases committed $100,000 of their own money ($ in contemporary dollars) to the project, primarily spent on design work while the city committed $30,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), spent on salaries. At the time the economy was still recovering from the Panic of 1907, so the private funding was crucial. First, the Chases sought to renovate Library Park, on the southeast corner of Grand and Meadow. They hired Frederick Law Olmsted's firm for this. In 1912 Waterbury's existing, smaller City Hall, on West Main Street opposite the Green, was burned down by an arsonist. This provided an opportunity to move the city's government to the Grand Street blocks the Chases wanted to serve as an entry to the city. Cass Gilbert, who had moved to Ridgefield a few years earlier, won a competition to design City Hall as the first of a complex of buildings that would highlight the public and private heights of the city. He may have been the favorite because the members of the city's building commission had apparently been impressed by his Ives Memorial Library, the main building of the New Haven Free Public Library. It is not certain whether Gilbert was the Chases' first choice for the project. The three did establish a productive relationship, and Gilbert quickly laid out a park for the small block opposite the train station and designed a fountain for it as well. Construction began on City Hall in 1912, shortly after the old building had burned, when the Grand Street site narrowly won in a referendum. Three years later it was opened, in a dedication ceremony presided over by Governor Marcus H. Holcomb. In 1917, the entourage that Gilbert had envisioned as ceremonial space was the gathering place for men signing up for the draft upon U.S. entry into World War I. Two years later it served as the reviewing stand for the parade held when troops returned. The privations caused by the Panic of 1907 had made clear the city's need for a single facility from which all its charities could operate. After studying such facilities in other Northeastern cities, the Associated Charities made recommendations to Gilbert in 1915. His design for Lincoln House was the only one significantly altered prior to construction. The original design called for a full frieze, wooden dentilled cornice and balustrade of brick and wood around the rooftop. Lincoln House was finished in 1916. Since most medical supplies at that time were geared to war production needs, it remained largely unoccupied until 1917. In 1921 Associated Charities, as much to avoid the stigma of its name that discouraged those it was meant to serve from seeking help from it as to reflect that it had become known by the name of the building, changed its name to the Lincoln House Association. During that time the Chases were occupied with seeing through the construction of their new corporate headquarters. The existing buildings were acquired and demolished. After Henry Chase died in 1918, his brother Frederick assumed his responsibilities. He continued the good relationship with Gilbert Henry had had. In the last years of his life, Henry Chase had begun acquiring the land for the bank building. Gilbert was asked to draw up plans, and delivered them in late 1919. Construction began a few months later, and was completed in 1922. The last building to be added was the dispensary. It had always been planned‚ÄîGilbert was instructed to design it in 1916‚Äîbut the shortage of materials caused by the war resulted in its construction being put off. In 1923 the Chase family created a permanent endowment fund for it. Construction began in 1923 and the building was in use within the year. 1925‚Äìpresent:Use, decline and preservation Gilbert had hoped to add a sixth building, a theater, using land owned by the Chases to the east of the bank building and the Power House to the rear of the bank, a ca. 1900 structure the family also had bought to make the complex viable. He drew up plans for it in 1919, but after the completion of the dispensary other projects, such as the Supreme Court building in Washington, drew his attention and he was unable to return to Waterbury before he died in 1934. The land was eventually sold to the federal government in the late 1930s for the city's new post office. In 1930 the city's Chamber of Commerce moved into the Power House from Lincoln House. The charities and dispensary were very busy places at that time with the onset of the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor visited City Hall in 1936 on their way to a rally in Library Park. World War II affected the buildings as well. Scrap metal was piled up on the entourage in front of City Hall, and the tower was surrounded with scaffolding so that air wardens could keep watch from it. The Power House's door was sandbagged. Parades on V-E and V-J days were held down Grand Street with the reviewing section in front City Hall, as parades still are on civic holidays like Independence and Memorial days. After the war, there were other changes. The Lincoln House Association changed its name again, to the Family Service Association (It is now Family Services of Greater Waterbury). Other tenants of the space in those years included the city's Adult Probation Department, Legal Aid, and the local Chamber of Commerce, which was headquartered in the Power House next door. That building was also renovated, sometime before 1950, with the addition of a second story and a paint job, bringing the brick closer to the bank building's limestone and better concealing the divide between the new and old brickwork. The Chase companies, by then Chase Brass & Copper, continued to use the headquarters building until the early 1960s. In 1963 ten residents interested in preserving the building bought it from the company. After three years, they in turn sold it to the city. It has been used as supplemental municipal office space ever since. In the late 20th century, other organizations that had been housed in the buildings also left them. The Chamber of Commerce left the Power House in 1960. In 1974, the Family Service Association, in need of space more suited to its needs, left Lincoln House after half a century for new quarters on Murray Street. The dispensary left as well that year. Lincoln House passed through several owners, its future uncertain for a while, until it was rehabilitated into law offices by one. The dispensary is now home to the Connecticut Community Foundation. By the early 21st century, most city government functions, including the mayor's office and council meetings, had been moved across the street to the Chase Building. City Hall itself had fallen into serious decline. Inspections found water leaking through the ceiling and into the walls and roof, rusting the structural steel and loosening stones on the face. Vandals opened a fire hose in 2005, flooding the entire building. More flooding damaged the building when copper piping was stolen. The Fire Department eventually ordered all government bodies out of the building save the City Clerk's office, which could not function without access to the records vault. In 2006 the City Council approved a $48 million bond issue to repair and restore the building. Aldermen from the Independent Party who believed the public should decide on a spending program that large succeeded in getting the issue put to a referendum in 2007, which defeated it. After council trimmed the proposal to $36 million, the Independent aldermen agreed not to seek another referendum, and it was adopted. The building was reopened in 2011.

The German raider encountered and sank the American tanker while cruising in the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil. Background Stanvac Calcutta was a 10,170 ton tanker with a crew of forty-two merchant mariners and nine armed guards aboard. The ship was commanded by Gustav O. Karlsson and the guards by Ensign Edward L. Anderson. Throughout World War II merchant ships were lightly armed and out of the six to be attacked by German raiders, only Stanvac Calcutta and offered serious resistance and both were sunk. When Ensign Anderson was assigned to the ship he was responsible for finding armaments and it proved to be difficult. Anderson acquired one /50-caliber naval gun salvaged from World War I and an /25-caliber anti-aircraft gun from the same era to arm his ship. Stier was heavily armed, she was under the command of Captain Horst Gerlach and mounted six guns, one gun, two cannons and two torpedo tubes. Captain Karlsson left Montevideo on 29 May 1942 headed north along the coast for Caripito, Venezuela.Gleichauf, pg. 130-133 Action A week after leaving Montevideo at 10:12 am on 6 June, the American ship was east of Pernambuco, Brazil, weather was overcast and the sea rough. Suddenly gunfire was heard and the Americans observed Stier sailing out of a squall and quickly heading towards Stanvac Calcutta almost head on and signaling the Americans to cut their engines. The Germans apparently believed the tanker was an unarmed merchantman. Beforehand Captain Karlsson and Ensign Anderson had planned a course of action for defending the vessel. As soon as the Germans were spotted, Stanvac Calcutta turned to the side to bring her guns to bear and when the raider closed to an estimated , Ensign Anderson ordered his gunners to open fire. In succession the armed guards fired five shots with the aft 4-inch gun and several rounds of the bow anti-aircraft gun. The last of the five shells struck and disabled a 150 mm gun aboard Stier just before it began delivering broadsides of four cannons and machine gun fire. Merchant sailors were trained and used to man the anti-aircraft gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck several times in the bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when it was clear that the American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts. While operating the crank a piece of shrapnel entered Anderson's back, paralyzing his legs but he continued to lower the boat and after looking around to see if anybody else needed help, the ensign slipped over the side into an oil slick. With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer in the water and attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few moments later the Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides. Aftermath Sixteen merchant sailors and armed guards were killed in action, thirty-seven prisoners were taken, of whom fourteen were wounded, one armed guard died later aboard Stier. Two Germans were wounded and Stier continued raiding for 4 months, sinking only two more ships before being sunk by in a mutually destructive battle. SS Stanvac Calcutta was one of the few World War II merchant ships to be awarded the Merchant Marine Gallant Ship Citation. Ensign Anderson was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander before leaving the navy sometime after the war. The American prisoners were eventually turned over to the Japanese.

Begun in 1901, it originally was a monthly literary magazine for the Whitewater Normal School. The original staff included seven editors and four reporters. Over the years, it has evolved into a weekly newspaper complete with an advertising and business staff, as well as an editorial staff with 14 members. The goal of the newspaper is to provide students and Whitewater residents with campus and community news. The current sections of the newspaper are News, Biz & Tech, Opinion, Lifestyle, Arts & Rec, and Sports. The paper appears in newsstands on Wednesdays. The paper currently has a circulation of 7,000. In addition to offering employees the chance to get acquainted with the journalism industry, the newspaper also gives them the chance to advance to editorial and business management positions. Staff writers can receive course credit for their work on the paper or apply to join a paid position. History The newspaper began as monthly literary magazine until it became a weekly newspaper on April 1, 1913. The four-page paper sold subscriptions for 75 cents per year. In May 1928, credit points started to be given for those working for the Royal Purple. The newspaper began to provide free newspapers for university students this year. Subscriptions were still offered to non-students and are still offered to this day. The newspaper has switched between a bi-weekly and weekly newspaper over the course of its history. In 1992, the Royal Purple switched back to being a weekly newspaper and made the change from a broadsheet to tabloid style production. The word ‚ÄúThe‚Äù in front of Royal Purple has also been switched in and out over the newspaper's life. Color debuted on the front page for the first time in spring 1999. An online edition of the Royal Purple made its first appearance in February 2000. It was known as www.purpleonline.com. A new website, www.royalpurplenews.com, was debuted in 2007. The website saw a second upgrade and full redesign in the summer of 2016.

One of these occurred in April 2009. The newspaper has normally had a stable relationship with the UW-Whitewater athletics program which has become a national power in football in recent years. The relationship was shattered on Wednesday, April 22 when head football coach Lance Leipold barred the newspaper from covering the football team. Leipold was upset over an article run in the newspaper titled \\"Athletes need a reality check,\\" by Michael Daly. Leipold subsequently barred the newspaper from covering the team. After receiving backlash from the general public, Leipold relented in his ban on newspaper coverage. Leipold was reprimanded by athletic director Paul Plinkse and chancellor Richard Telfer.http://archive.jsonline.com/business/43539347.html/ References University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Student newspapers published in Wisconsin ","title":"Royal Purple newspaper"},{"id":"30057262","text":"The Snake‚ÄìColumbia shrub steppe is an ecoregion defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

C. (1940). Genetic differences in maze-learning ability in rats. Yearbook of the National Society for Studies in Education, 39, pp. 111-119  Experiment set-up  Tyron's rat chart Prior to Robert Tryon‚Äôs study of selective rat breeding, concluded in 1942, many psychologists believed that environmental, rather than genetic, differences produced individual behavioral variations. Tryon sought to demonstrate that genetic traits often did, in fact, contribute to behavior. To do so, Tryon created an experiment that tested the proficiency of successive generations of rats in completing a maze. He initiated the experiment by exposing a genetically diverse group of rats to the maze, labeling those who made the fewest errors ‚Äúbright‚Äù, and those with the most errors ‚Äúdull‚Äù. Tryon then mated the ‚Äúbright‚Äù males with ‚Äúbright‚Äù females, and ‚Äúdull‚Äù males with ‚Äúdull‚Äù females. After their children matured, Tryon repeated the maze test with them, and again separated the ‚Äúbright‚Äù and the ‚Äúdull‚Äù, again breeding ‚Äúbright‚Äù with ‚Äúbright‚Äù and ‚Äúdull‚Äù with ‚Äúdull‚Äù. Tryon continued this process for seven generations, creating two distinct breeds of ‚Äúbright‚Äù and ‚Äúdull‚Äù rats. In order to demonstrate that behavior had little effect on the genetically selectively bred rats, and lessen the chance of error when making his conclusions, Tryon cross-fostered the rats‚Äîthat is, he had a ‚Äúdull‚Äù mother raise ‚Äúbright‚Äù children, and vice versa. The independent variables in his experiment were the parental pairings, the choice of environment and parents for upbringing, and number of rats put through the maze. The dependent variable was the number of errors made by the rats in 19 trials of the maze.Gray, Peter. Psychology. 6th ed. New York: Worth, 2007. Print.  Implications and conclusions  While Tryon's results showed that the ‚Äúbright\\" rats made significantly fewer errors in the maze than the ‚Äúdull\\" rats did, the question exists of what other sensory, motor, motivational, and learning processes also influenced the results of the experiment. A common misconception of this experiment and other similar experiments is that the observed change in the performance in the maze directly correlates with general learning ability. This is not the case. Rather, it has become a widely accepted belief among behavior geneticists that the superiority of the bright rats was confined to Tryon‚Äôs specific test; thus, it is not possible to claim that there is a difference in learning capacity between the two groups of rats. Genetic variation, such as better peripheral vision, can make some rats ‚Äúbright‚Äù and others ‚Äúdull‚Äù, but does not determine their intelligence.Martinez, Joe and Raymond Kesner. Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Massachusetts: Elsevier Inc., 2007. Print. Nonetheless, Tryon‚Äôs famous rat-maze experiment demonstrated that the difference between rat performances was genetic since their environments were controlled and identical.Cooper, R.

Approximately 75% of the images on the web do not have proper ALT text labels, making them inaccessible through Screen readers. The solution aimed at by Phetch is to label the images external to the web page rather than depending upon the web page author to create proper alt text for each image. Rather than paying people to do the mundane task of labeling images, Phetch aims to create a fun game that produces such descriptions as a side effect of having fun. Phetch was created by Luis von Ahn and Shiry Ginosar of Carnegie Mellon University following the pattern set by the earlier ESP game. Phetch is played by 3 to five people. One is designated as a describer, while the rest are seekers. The describer is shown an image, which he describes to the seekers. The seekers use an Internet image search engine to attempt to find the image being described.Marks, Paul: \\"Gamers help the blind get the picture\\", New Scientist, Daily News, 16 May 2006. The first seeker to find the image gains points and becomes the describer for the next round. The describer is also rewarded for a successful outcome. The data produced as the side effect of playing the game is the describer's descriptions of the image. An imagined system for serving these descriptions from a centralized server is described in the Phetch paper.von Ahn, Luis; Ginosar, Shiry; Kedia, Mihir; Blum, Manuel: \\"Improving Accessibility of the Web with a Computer Game\\", ACM CHI Notes 2006.

'Skeleton' leader 'Skeleton' in 1881 Jeffries was born in Shadwell in London in 1864, the son of Emma (n√©e Petty) (born 1838) and William Jeffries (1832‚Äì1870), a mariner, who married in 1859 at Christ Church in Tower Hamlets.London, England, Marriages and Banns, 1754-1921 Record for Emma Petty - Ancestry.co.uk website Employed by a firm of tobacconists, from 1881 the 16-year-old Charles Jeffries was the second-in-command of a Whitechapel branch of the Skeleton Army and was well known for disrupting Salvation Army public meetings and on occasion had assaulted Salvation Army Soldiers and Officers. The 'Skeleton Army' adopted the tunes of The Salvation Army, but altered their words, and wore cap bands on their hats reading 'Skeleton Army'. 'Skeletons' used banners with skulls and crossbones; sometimes there were two coffins and a statement like, ‚ÄúBlood and Thunder‚Äù (mocking the Salvation Army's war cry \\"Blood and Fire\\") or the three Bs: ‚ÄúBeef‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeer‚Äù and ‚ÄúBacca‚Äù - again mocking the Salvation Army's three S's - \\"Soup\\", \\"Soap\\" and \\"Salvation\\". Banners also had pictures of monkeys, rats and the devil. They paraded the streets and conducted meetings loudly within earshot of those of the Salvationists, usually causing the Salvation Army's meetings to end in a riot. Colonel George Holmes of The Salvation Army, who was a boy Salvationist in 1881, later recalled: > \\"It was very rough. I remember attending an Open-Air Meeting one Sunday > night outside 'The Blind Beggar.' Afterwards we marched to our Hall in > Whitechapel Road.

He and the other former 'Skeletons' quickly became the object of attack from their old colleagues. Jeffries wrote in his diary: > \\"In the Open-Airs my old mates gave me many a blow and kick - but I stuck > fast. At times they would follow me home singing, 'Jeffries will help to > roll the old chariot along' - and, thank God, I am doing it.\\"Claughton, pg > 10 In late 1882 Jeffries attended training college, and became an Officer. In March 1883 he was promoted to Lieutenant and was sent to Penzance where in seven months he made 300 converts. During this period Jeffries was summoned before the magistrates five times for preaching in the streets. Promoted to Captain, he was sent to St Blazey and then to Devonport, at both of which he made conversions.Claughton, pg 15 He was among the first Salvation Army officers to arrive in Australia, landing in Sydney in August 1884, and where he was Social Secretary for a period. He was imprisoned in Sydney in 1889 for seven days with seven other Salvationists for preaching in the open. By now promoted to Adjutant, when he left Australia in March 1897 he had promoted the work of The Salvation Army by opening twelve new corps, established Rescue Homes and commenced Social Work in Adelaide and Melbourne, and had also married Captain Martha Harris and had four children.Claughton, pg 17 In October 1899 Jeffries was appointed Provincial Commander for Wales. In January 1900 he was at the London Headquarters discussing his plans for evangelizing the Welsh-speaking people of Wales. In December 1901 he was appointed Provincial Commander for the North West of England.Claughton, pg 27 In 1907 Colonel Jeffries was appointed Assistant Field Secretary at the National Headquarters in London, and in 1911 became Field Secretary, making him responsible for appointing and promoting some 2,000 Corps Officers. Jeffries served in China from February 1918 until April 1919, when General Bramwell Booth summoned him back to London where he was appointed Commissioner. Commissioner In January 1922 Jeffries was appointed as Principal of the International Training College at Clapton, a post he held for nine and a half years. Here he was responsible for the training of between four and five hundred Cadets a year. General Erik Wickberg later recalled Jeffries: > \\"We were 500 Cadets in my Session.

The Principal is responsible for the overall running of the university, presiding over the main academic body of the university, known as the Senatus Academicus (Academic Senate). The Senate has the responsibility for superintending and regulating teaching in the University, including the regulations for the conferring of degrees, and the Senate also administers the property and revenues of the University (subject to the authority of the University Court.) The Principal is appointed by the University Court. The current office of Principal dates to 1858 with the passage of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858. The Principal is, by convention, appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews by the Chancellor, and can confer degrees in the absence of the Chancellor. As of April 2017, the Principal was Professor Sally Mapstone, who had previously served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford. History Until the mid 1700s the University comprised three colleges and the Provosts of St Salvator's College and Principals of St Leonard's College and St Mary's College were responsible for the oversight of their own institutions. In 1747 the Colleges of St Leonard's and St Salvator's were combined into the United College, with the University now led by two principals. The modern office of Principal dates from 1858, with the passage of the University (Scotland) Act 1858. From 1858 until 1889 the senior of the two Principals (of the United College or St Mary's) undertook the responsibilities of Principal of the University, when in 1889 the Principal of the United College was made Principal of the University. The University of St Andrews Act 1952 created the Principal as a separate office, to be appointed by the Monarch of the United Kingdom. The power to appoint the Principal is vested in the University Court by Schedule 2 of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966. The Education (Scotland) Act 1981 transferred the power to the Court, with the previous power to appoint the Principal being vested in the Monarch of the United Kingdom. The Principal is also a member of the University Court, as required by Ordinance 121 of the University. In 2009, Professor Louise Richardson was the first woman appointed as Principal, with her successor, Professor Sally Mapstone being the second woman appointed to the office. Professor Mapstone had previously served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) at the University of Oxford. Vice-Chancellor The Principal is, by convention, appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews by the Chancellor, and can confer degrees in the absence of the Chancellor.

Establishment The Darwin Initiative was announced by the UK Government in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. It was established as a non-departmental public body of DETR, moving to DEFRA on its formation in 2001. In 2010 DEFRA provided annual funding of ¬£7 Million. This will be increased during the period to 2014. Darwin Advisory Committee The Darwin Initiative is managed by the Darwin Advisory Committee (DAC), and currently chaired by Professor David Macdonald. The first chairman was Sir Crispin Tickell who was succeeded by Professor David S. Ingram in 1999. Ingram held the post until handing over to Macdonald in 2005. The DAC comprises experts from government, academic, science and the private sector. The DAC's Terms of Reference state its purpose to be > \\"To advise the Secretary of State for the Environment on the principles and > objectives of the Darwin Initiative for the Survival of Species grant > programme in implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity especially > Article 5, taking into account the past experience of the grant programme.\\" The DAC therefore advises Ministers on development of the Initiative and makes recommendations on applications for funding. The DAC is supported by a small secretariat team provided by DEFRA. Under the 2010 UK quango reforms, the Darwin Advisory Council will be reconstituted as a committee of experts effective by March 2011. Projects funded The scope of supported projects is very broad and includes:  Institutional capacity building * Training * Research * Work to implement the Biodiversity Convention * Environmental education or awareness Supported projects include some based in the UK, UK Overseas Territories and over 100 countries worldwide.

He was among the first New Zealanders to travel to the US and, like his fellow countrymen Pat O'Connor and Abe Jacobs, became a major star with the National Wrestling Alliance during the Television-era. He won the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship in 1958 and, later in the US, held the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship, NWA Iowa Heavyweight Championship, and the NWA Americas 6-Man Tag Team Championship with Apache Bull Ramos and Mike Riker. Hrstich is credited, along with Bobby Graham and \\"Killer\\" Buddy Austin, as the trainer of 8-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race. In 2009, Fight Times Magazine ranked Hrstich No. 10 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers. Professional career Start with the Dominion Wrestling Union Dick Hrstich was born in the former Yugoslavia, in the city now known as Drasnice, Croatia and emigrated with his family to New Zealand at a young age. He held an \\"outstanding record\\" as a champion amateur wrestler before turning pro during the mid-1950s. Trained by Anton Koolmann, Hrstich soon established himself as one of the country's up and coming stars. One of his most memorable bouts was against \\"The Zebra Kid\\" George Bollas and promoter Al Karasick speculated to the press that Hrstich would become a great drawing card. In April 1958, Wrestling Review wrote that Hrstich \\"appears to be another Lofty Blomfield\\". Two months later, on 11 June, he defeated Fred Wright in Christchurch for the then vacant NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship. Later that year, he travelled overseas to wrestle in NWA Hawaii and Stampede Wrestling; he lost to Stan Kowalski in Honolulu on 19 October and went to a draw with Reggie Parks in Edmonton, Alberta on 4 November 1958. Moving to the United States Hrstich returned to the US a year later, this time farther east in Kansas City, Kansas for Central States Wrestling, where he defeated \\"Butcher Boy\\" Lee Henning at Memorial Hall on 23 April 1959. While competing in the United States, Hrstich was billed as Dick or Ray Gordon, so as to make his name more easy for announcers to pronounce, and kept the ringname for the remainder of his career. In the fall of that year, in the American Wrestling Association, he faced such opponents as Jack Terry, Billy Goelz, Aldo Bogni, Don McClarty and Frank Townsend in the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area. On 24 October, he and Henning teamed together in a tag team match against Butch Levy & Bob Rasmussen in St. Paul. It was during this latest tour that Hrstich decided to wrestle in the US full-time and vacated the NWA New Zealand title. Spending the rest of the year in Kansas City, Hrstich made several more appearances at Memorial Hall wrestling Stanley Lisowski and Chick Garibaldi in singles matches as well as taking part in a few tag team matches. On 19 November, he and Thor Hagen beat Chick Garibaldi & Kinji Shibuya and teamed with Tommy O‚ÄôToole in a 6-team championship tournament a month later. Other teams included Rip Hawk & Rock Hunter, Thor Hagen & Sonny Myers, Bob Geigel & Otto Von Krupp, Bill Cole & Chick Garibaldi, and Jerry Gordett & Joe Hamilton. On 10 December 1959, Hrstich and Krupp defeated Tarzan \\"Killer\\" Kowalski in a handicap match at Memorial Hall; Kowalski took the first fall, however Krupp was awarded the second when Kowalski was disqualified. During his time in central Missouri, he along with Bobby Graham and \\"Killer\\" Buddy Austin helped train Harley Race, a future 8-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, while the young rookie was starting his career working for St. Joseph wrestling promoter Gust Karras.Race, Harley and Gerry Tritz. King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story. Champaigne, Illinois: Sports Publishing LLC, 2004. (pg. 13) Oliver, Greg. The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels. Toronto: ECW Press, 2007. (pg. 58) Hrstich then headed south where he worked for Texas promoter Pat O‚ÄôDowdy in Odessa wrestling Ed Sharpe and Dick Hutton at the Floyd Gwin Auditorium in early 1960. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for promoters Morris Siegel and Ed McLemore, he also faced Paul \\"Butcher\\" Vachon, Marquis de Paree, Duke Keomuka, and Joe Pizza during October‚ÄìNovember 1960. On 16 December 1961, he won the vacant NWA Iowa Heavyweight Championship in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. By 1962, Hrstich was back in the Central States territory and, on 9 February, he captured the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship from Buddy Austin in St. Joseph. Hrstich held the title for two months before dropping the belt to his old rival Lee Henning on 5 May 1962. Maple Leaf Wrestling Hrstich left the area shortly afterwards to wrestle for Canadian promoter Frank Tunney's Toronto-based promotion Maple Leaf Wrestling and began appearing on events at its home arena, Maple Leaf Gardens, by the end of the month. In his first major appearance, on 24 May, Hrstich and Jim Hady wrestled The Tolos Brothers (Chris and John Tolos) to a 30-minute time limit draw. He also wrestled Steve Stanlee, Stan Stasiak and Jean Baillargeon during the next two months as well as facing his one-time tag team partner, Tommy O‚ÄôToole, beating him in both of their two encounters. One of his biggest matches was against Taro Sakuro, a bout which he lost, with 13,997 fans in attendance at the Maple Leaf Gardens on 30 August. In the following weeks, he also lost matches to Sweet Daddy Siki and Johnny Valentine, making his Toronto debut. His last appearance was on 11 October 1962, in which he lost to Taro Sakuro in a rematch. Hrstich met a number of rising NWA stars while working for Tunney, most notably, Bruno Sammartino. Return to St. Louis He spent the spring of 1963 wrestling for Sam Muchnick and appeared in televised matches on Wrestling at the Chase. His loss to Dick the Bruiser at the Kiel Auditorium, on 1 February 1963, signalled the start of Muchnick's \\"push\\" to make Bruiser one of the top stars in his promotion.Matysik, Larry. Wrestling at the Chase: The Inside Story of Sam Muchnick and the Legends of Professional Wrestling. Toronto: ECW Press, 2005. (pg. 170) Two months later, Hrstich met NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz in St. Louis on 20 April 1963. Hrstich later travelled the road with Thesz and headlined together in tag team matches. He also had a brief stint in Jim Crockett Promotions that summer. On 25 July, he fought Pat O'Hara to a 20-minute time-limit draw in front of 3,437 fans at the Greensboro Coliseum. Nearly three weeks later, the two men teamed up against, and lost to, the Tolos Brothers in Lexington, North Carolina. Hrstich moved on to Georgia Championship Wrestling, then run by promoters Don McIntyre and Steve Manderson, where he and several other NWA stars including Lou Thesz, Eddie Graham, and The Mighty Hercules appeared for the next three months. In the first week of October, Hrstich defeated Felix Godo at the Municipal Auditorium in Atlanta, Georgia, wrestled Tarzan Tyler to a draw at the Fort Gordon Sports Arena and beat Marcus Godo at the William Bell Auditorium in Augusta. Hrstich wrestled The Mighty Hercules to a draw at that same venue the following week and scored victories over Hercules, Tyler, Ivan Zukoff, The Outlaw, Lenny Montana and Gene Anderson. From Indianapolis to Florida On 25 April 1964, Hrstich appeared at the Southside Armory in Indianapolis for Dick the Bruiser and Wilbur Snyder's first official World Wrestling Association show. He and Billy Goelz wrestled in the opening match and fought to a 20-minute draw. From late-1964 until early 1965, Hrstich wrestled for Championship Wrestling from Florida. One of his first matches in the territory was against Harry Smith in St. Petersburg on 20 November 1964. After a brief series of matches against Bill Dromo in March 1965, he finally left Florida for Don Owen in Portland, Oregon. Pacific Northwest Wrestling In his first two months in Pacific Northwest Wrestling, Hrstich feuded with Roy McClarty though both their matches resulted in draws; he and Stan Stasiak, however, did beat McClarty and Enrique Torres in a tag team match in Seattle four months later. On 14 June 1965, he beat Maurice \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon via disqualification. That fall, he lost matches to Rick Hunter and Don Leo Jonathan. On 6 November 1965, Hrstich lost a tag team match with Sandor Kovacs against Bill Dromo & Ivan Kameroff in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Tri-State Wrestling Hrstich briefly returned to St. Louis where, on 7 January 1966, he and ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù Bob Ellis were beaten by Fritz Von Erich in a handicap match at the Kiel Auditorium before moving on to Tri-State Wrestling. Paired with Mike Clancy and The Great Bolo, Hrstich came out on the losing end in matches against The Assassins (Assassin #1 & Assassin #2). He fared better in the singles division with victories over Boris Managoff and Chuck Karbo and also made appearances for NWA Western States in Texas. Hrstich teamed with Nick Roberts and Kurt Von Steiger in a six-man tag team match against Jack Brisco, Don Kirk & Ricky Romero in Amarillo on 14 April. He would go on to have a series of matches with Brisco in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma until the end of the year. He also faced Brisco in tag team matches as well; he and Don Kent wrestled Brisco & Ramon Torres to a draw in Springfield on 11 May, lost a six- man tag team match with Bob Orton and Chris Tolos to Brisco, Danny Hodge & Battleship Johnson in Tulsa on 31 October, and with Orton traded matches with Brisco and Hodge in Little Rock during the first week of November. In addition to the Tri-State territory, he was also among the many NWA veterans to pass through the Continental Wrestling Association during October‚ÄìDecember 1966. Later career and retirement Hrstich spent some time in Arizona during the final years of his career and helped train Jody Arnold, the kayfabe nephew of Don Arnold, who became a major star in the region during the 1970s and 80s.

Both countries established diplomatic relations on May 31, 1949. Argentina was the first South American country to recognize Israel. History President Mauricio Macri and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Buenos Aires, in 2017. President Alberto Fern√°ndez and Netanyahu in Jerusalem, in 2020. Relations between the two were tied during the early years of Nazi hunting when Israel's Mossad kidnapped former Nazi Adolf Eichmann despite Argentine protestations of a violation of its sovereignty. Immediately after World War II, Argentina was a safe haven for former Nazi officials because they brought badly needed capital investment and/or technical expertise. According to declassified British Foreign and Commonwealth Office documents, Israel sold arms to Argentina before and during the Falklands War. The arms sales to Argentina included Douglas A-4 Skyhawk jets which would later be used in the war with the United Kingdom. Carlos Menem was the first head of state of Argentina to make a diplomatic visit to Israel, in 1991. He proposed to mediate between Israel and Syria in their negotiations over the Golan Heights. However, the relations were further tested when Hezbollah was blamed for bombing the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community centre in 1992 and 1994, respectively. Since 2013, roughly 100 Jewish organizations across Argentina have called for the government to repeal its pact with the Islamic Republic of Iran over the AMIA terrorist attacks.AMIA: la comunidad jud√≠a pedir√° derogar el acuerdo In 2012, Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner met an Israeli-Palestinian delegation and announced that Argentina would spearhead the Latin American role in reinvigorating the peace process in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In 2010, Argentina announced the intention to join Brazil in recognizing an independent Palestinian state, provoking sharp criticism from Israel.

Realizing that the passports were fraudulent, Argentinian police arrested the suspects. Argentinian prosecutors discovered that the suspects had previously used fake passports to enter other countries, including Portugal. In January 2020, President Alberto Fern√°ndez traveled to Israel for his first presidential trip abroad.

The company was one of the four largest suppliers to Union forces through the American Civil War. History The Presumpscot River dropped 16 feet at Gambo Falls where the river formed the border between the towns of Windham and Gorham. Sebago Lake formed a large natural reservoir upstream of Gambo giving the falls an unusually reliable water supply with comparatively minor flow peaking from storm runoff.Wells, Walter The water-power of Maine (1869) Sprague, Owen & Nash, Augusta Early European settlers built a sawmill powered by the falls. In 1824 the sawmill was converted to a powder mill by Edmund Fowler and Lester Laflin. Their Gorham Powder Company became known among the local population as the Gambo powder mills. Lester Laflin was a grandson of American Revolutionary War gunpowder manufacturer Matthew Laflin. The Laflin family manufactured gunpowder in Massachusetts for several generations. When Lester came east to Maine, his first cousins traveled west to build gunpowder mills in New York and Chicago. Lester, his partner, and their mill foreman drowned on Sebago Lake on 22 June 1827.Dole, Samuel Thomas Windham in the Past (1916) Following an explosion killing seven employees on 19 July 1828,The Newsletter of Presumpscot Regional Land Trust Winter 2009-2010 the Gambo Falls mill was enlarged by Oliver Whipple concurrently with construction of locks for the Cumberland and Oxford Canal. Whipple had been manufacturing gunpowder in Lowell, Massachusetts since 1818. The new canal provided reliable transportation from Portland harbor for sulfur from Sicily and saltpeter from India and from Sebago Lake for charcoal and lumber from forests to the north. Whipple's Gambo mill used the lumber to manufacture kegs holding as much as 25 pounds of powder. Kegs of gunpowder were shipped to Portland in canal boats when possible, but moved in horse-drawn sleighs when the canal was frozen. Canal boats carried about 25 tons, and sometimes sailed all the way to Boston when weather was favorable. After plant explosions killed one employee each in 1835, 1847, 1849, 1850, and 1851, a major explosion on 12 October 1855 killed seven employees, including Whipple's brother and son, injured five more and destroyed a canal boat and parts of the mill. Manufacture of gunpowder in response to orders avoided the hazard of storing powder inventories until orders were received, but required water power on demand. The canal lock system controlled outflow from Sebago Lake; and, as a shipper interested in the well-being of its customer, canal management was receptive to regulating water releases to meet needs of the powder mill. Oriental Powder Company organized Gilbert Grafton Newhall of Salem, Massachusetts, purchased the property in early 1855 to manufacture powder for Crimean War belligerents, and organized Oriental Powder Company to repair the damage and construct new facilities. A charcoal house, saltpeter refinery, wheel mills, press mills, kernelling mills, glazing mills, and storehouses were dispersed along both banks of the river and canal for a mile upstream of Gambo to minimize damage during infrequent explosions. Charcoal was manufactured from dried, debarked alder packed into cast iron retorts. Charcoal was made from willow, poplar or maple when alder was unavailable. Crude saltpeter was dissolved in hot water in kettles holding as much as . Impurities were skimmed from the surface or settled to the bottom so a hot, saturated solution could be decanted for crystallization. Moist saltpeter crystals were mixed with appropriate amounts of sulfur and charcoal by heavy rotating wheels to form a cake which was then cut unto smaller pieces in bronze- or zinc-toothed kernelling mills. The kernels were sieved into desired sizes and dried prior to being tumbled with graphite which reduced tendency for the finished grains to stick together during storage. Intermediate products were transported between the dispersed production and storage facilities in wooden wheelbarrows constructed with no iron parts and pushed over plank walkways by workmen going barefoot in the summer or wearing shoes without iron nails during colder weather. Newhall gave his name to a small company town of employee residences built near Gambo Falls. Company offices were in Portland, Maine to avoid business disruption by the periodic explosions at the manufacturing facilities.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls p.139 By 1860, Oriental was one of four companies making 69% of United States gunpowder sales. The larger DuPont and Hazard Powder Company mills each provided approximately one-third of the Union gunpowder supply for the civil war.Wilson, Mark R. The business of civil war: military mobilization and the state, 1861-1865 (2006) JHU Press p.118 The fourth major supplier was Lester Laflin's cousins' mill which later evolved into the early smokeless powder manufacturer Laflin & Rand. The DuPont mill was uncomfortably close to the battle line and considered potentially vulnerable to sabotage from southern sympathizers in the slave state of Delaware. The federal government purchased as much powder as Oriental Powder Company could produce through the war years. Wartime production included large cast hexagonal powder grains for Rodman guns; and an Columbiad was installed at Gambo to test this specialized powder. Production increased to 1250 tons per year as accidental explosions killed one employee on 8 July 1861, three on 7 July 1862, and another on 14 November 1863. Demand for gunpowder declined when the civil war ended, but picked up briefly during the Franco-Prussian WarNutt, Charles History of Worcester and its people (1919) Lewis Historical Publishing p.341 and Russo-Turkish War. Oriental Powder Company was ranked 4th (after DuPont, Laflin & Rand, and Hazard) among the six companies of the United States Gunpowder Trade Association popularly known as the powder trust.Winkler, John K. The DuPont Dynasty (2005) Kessinger Publishing pp.122&123 Decline Canal boats were unable to compete with rail service and the canal was unused after the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway reached Gambo Falls (by then called Newhall) in 1871. Oriental Powder Company employees assumed control of the former canal dam at Sebago Lake when the canal locks ceased operations; but water users in Westbrook, Maine, were unsatisfied with timing of water releases. Court action was initiated in January 1877, following a drought. Legal maneuvering continued for several months between Oriental Powder Company and Westbrook water users while water releases were controlled by whichever side mustered a larger number of employees at the dam. Legislation enacted in February 1878 effectively passed control of water releases from Sebago Lake to water users in Westbrook. As smaller Maine gunpowder mills went out of business following the civil war, Oriental Powder Company acquired the assets of the North Buckfield Powder Mill in 1880, the Warren Powder Mill in 1887, and the Camden Powder Mill in 1892. Machinery was salvaged from these mills, and a subsidiary Oriental Powder Company of Pennsylvania began manufacturing rock blasting powder at Fairchance, Pennsylvania in 1902. As telegraph became available for sales communications, the powder company reduced the risk to manufacturing facilities by building magazines for powder inventories near distant rail distribution centers like Chicago and Salt Lake City.San Francisco Examiner 6 April 1876 Calamity in Salt Lake City Local supplies of charcoal and keg staves became more expensive as forest resources were exhausted. The rock blasting powder market for mining and railroad construction fluctuated with financial panics. The Newhall mill ceased operations on 1 June 1893 as smokeless powder and dynamite became preferred for traditional uses of gunpowder. Eastern Dynamite Company was formed in 1895 and began manufacturing dynamite at Newhall. Four employees died in three fatal explosions through the final decade of explosives manufacture. March 19, 1904, was the last of 32 recorded blasts claiming 46 lives along the river. Mill operations after the 1904 explosion were limited to manufacturing wood flour shipped elsewhere for mixing with nitroglycerine to form dynamite. Production of wood flour continued into the 1950s after ownership passed to the Atlas Powder Company in 1912. The civil war Columbiad remained at Newhall until scrapped during World War II.

CNN. 20 December 2012 The boat was later named SIEV-221. Incident At about 6.30 a.m. local time the boat collided with rocks north of Flying Fish Cove close to Rocky Point and was then smashed against the nearby cliffs, complicating rescue attempts. For a period of about one hour, the unpowered boat was washed back and forth as backwash pushed it away from the cliff. Many of those who entered the water grabbed onto the flotsam and jetsam as the boat quickly broke up. Residents tried to help victims by throwing them life jackets and other objects. Some refugees were battered by the debris from the disintegrating boat and some were able to use the life jackets thrown from the shore. Rescue efforts by Australian Customs and Border Protection included allocation of and ACV Triton, with at least 42 survivors having been recovered from the ocean. One man was able to scramble ashore himself with a great leap. Poor weather conditions made rescue operations difficult. Two critical care teams from the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia left from Perth to provide medical assistance. Aftermath The Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, stated that \\"all available assets\\" were put on standby, and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that she would cut short her holiday to manage the emergency. A criminal investigation based on people smuggling laws is being undertaken.PM wants bipartisan probe into the Christmas Island asylum-seeker disaster The Australian ‚Äì Joe Kelly and Paul Maley (16 December 2010) ‚Äì Retrieved 20 December 2010. It was originally thought the boat held about 70 people but this figure may be as high as 100. The political repercussions of the disaster continue, and are concerned with knowledge of the boat's movements and what actions were taken. Prime Minister Gillard responded to initial questions of why the boat wasn't intercepted by explaining that considering the very rough seas, the response time by border protection authorities was adequate and that the extreme weather made radar less effective. The search for survivors of the shipwreck was suspended on 18 December after doctors advised that survival was by then unlikely. Memorial services for those who were lost occurred on the 19 and 20 December. On 25 January 2011, three Indonesian men were charged with people-smuggling in connection with the incident. The men, who were on board the vessel when it sank, could face up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to A$220,000 per person. The first burials for those killed in the incident were held on 15 February 2011, with twelve funerals occurring in Sydney, as families of the dead lived there, and five bodies being sent to other countries. The funerals in Sydney attracted opposition from the then Shadow Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison, who criticized the financial cost, and from some of the family members, who said the government failed to honor traditional Muslim funeral ceremonies. Investigation On 11 July 2011, as part of the coronial inquest into the incident, the Western Australia's Coroner, Alastair Hope, began a series of public hearings on the island. The inquest heard conflicting evidence related to the knowledge of whether or not the Australian Navy was aware of and expecting another asylum boat. Sonja Radovanovic, the Assistant director of the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre claimed that she was told about another asylum boat in the vicinity by custom officials and that she was to speed up the processing of asylum seekers from a boat intercepted earlier that week.

It uses this to fire an adhesive, barbed proboscis as a means of defense, and to capture prey. This organ has adhesive secretion to aid in securing its meal. McIntosh, 1876)thumb300px Although this creature does not have a dedicated respiratory system, Parborlasia corrugata is able to obtain oxygen by absorbing it through its skin. An animal of its size would typically find it difficult to receive enough oxygen this way, but this worm has a low metabolic rate, and also enjoys the advantage of its environment, which is cold, oxygen-rich Antarctic waters. When Parborlasia corrugata experiences lower levels of oxygen in the water, it flattens and elongates its body to aid in the uptake of oxygen by increasing its skin area. This manoeuvre also reduces the distance that the oxygen must travel to diffuse into its body. Potential predators avoid this species as it has a chemical defense: acidic mucus with a pH 3.5.

It is famous for its larval form, rather than the adult moth, primarily because of the caterpillar's defense mechanism, urticating bristles that inject a potentially deadly venom. The caterpillar has been responsible for many human deaths, especially in southern Brazil. Its venom has been the subject of numerous medical studies. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1855. Description These caterpillars are about 4.5 to 5.5 centimeters (about 2 in) long, with background colors ranging from green to brown. Well camouflaged, they have rows of tubercles crowned with whorls of easily detachable spines of different sizes. Discovery Caterpillars of many species can cause irritation by their hollow body hairs that envenom or detach easily, or can be poisonous if ingested; however, prior to investigations into Lonomia caterpillars, it was not known that caterpillars could produce toxins which in sufficient quantities could kill a human being. Lonomia obliqua is found in the south of Brazil in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paran√°. The species appears to be spreading to the southeast of Brazil, and recent accidents with the species were reported in the states of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais. L. obliqua is also found in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. The species became internationally known when an epidemic occurred in an agrarian community in Rio Grande do Sul. Doctors were mystified when scores of patients came in with the same symptoms. Hematoma and gangrene-like symptoms manifested, spreading throughout the body, eventually causing massive blood leakage into the brain and, in several cases, death. At first the cause could not be determined, although each victim stated they had \\"just handled a bunch of leafy branches to break the trail or gather vegetation.\\" Exploring the area, the only creature commonly found within all the incidents was the L. obliqua caterpillar. Its hair growth covers its body, and each clump of spines is able to easily puncture the skin and release toxins into the victim. Toxicity Lonomia obliqua has a toxic venom which causes disseminated intravascular coagulation and a consumptive coagulopathy, which can lead to a hemorrhagic syndrome. The toxins are stored in sacks at the base of each spine. As the spines penetrate the victim, venom flows through the hollow bristles and into the puncture wound. It was discovered that the toxin in the caterpillar's skin held potent anti-clotting agents. This anti-clotting agent would attach to another protein of the body's cells and cause them to leak as blood is unable to clot. This internal bleeding would fill the surrounding tissue with \\"bruised blood\\". This internal bleeding spreads through the internal organs and eventually leads to compression and brain death. This accounts for the minimum of 500 deaths resulting from contact with L. obliqua caterpillars. The poison only takes effect in fairly large amounts; in order to experience the extreme effects caused by the toxins, a human victim would probably need to be stung at least 20 to 100 times because each sting only injects a minute amount of venom. Of the 26 species of the genus Lonomia found on the American continent, only Lonomia obliqua and Lonomia achelous have caused severe reactions, leading to hemorrhagic syndrome. Since 1989 the number of human accidents caused by these caterpillars has been increasing in the southern region of Brazil. Most victims were male (63%), many were between 0 and 19 years old (45%), and lesions are especially common on the hands (38%). The reported death rate is 2.5%. Effects of venom Disseminated intravascular coagulation occurs as the toxin interacts with the victim's body. One serious effect on envenomed victims is hemorrhage syndrome. \\"First described by Arocha-Pinango and Layrisse in Venezuela in 1967, the hemorrhagic diathesis caused in humans by touching the Lonomia species begins with inflammatory changes at the site of envenoming, followed by systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, vomiting, and malaise. After 24 hours, a severe bleeding disorder ensues, leading to ecchymosis, hematuria, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhages, and acute kidney injury.\\" Case studies Gregarious L. obliqua caterpillars clustered on a tree trunk. Contact with multiple caterpillars can result in more significant envenomation, and more serious health effects. Although few cases are recorded, a case study of a fatal encounter was published in Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria: \\"A 70-year-old, previously healthy woman developed a sudden coma. Four days before, she had started to present hematuria. Shortly after admission, her coma was rated as Glasgow 3. Physical examination revealed several skin hemorrhages, and gross hematuria was present. Based on information in a note left by the patient, two small hyperemic lesions were identified on the tip of her left toe. Along with the note was the green caterpillar which was hidden inside of her slipper. CT-scan imaging revealed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages. She died seven days after being envenomed.\\" In another case, internal bleeding spread throughout the lower body. While this victim did not die, prompt medical attention was necessary. Treatment While there are many reported cases of serious injuries and fatalities, there are not many records of proper treatment should an individual be stung. According to Dr. Robert Norris, stings and abrasions caused by Lonomia obliqua should be treated with antifibrinolytics. If blood products are required, they must be given cautiously to avoid fueling the constant consumptive coagulopathy. An antiserum is produced by the Butantan Institute in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It effectively reverses the coagulation disorders induced by Lonomia obliqua venom, and patients treated with this antiserum recover rapidly. Medical applications L. obliqua caterpillar toxin has been the subject of numerous studies to determine its medical value. In particular the component called \\"Lopap\\" (L. obliqua prothrombin activator protease) has exhibited anticoagulant and anti-apoptotic qualities.

Three British warships and several boats filled with sailors and marines under assignment for the Louisiana Campaign attacked an American privateer in port. After repulsing two attacks from British troops and sailors, killing one of their commanders, the Americans won a tactical victory and scuttled their ship the following morning to prevent its capture.James, pp.223-224 The battle took place within the Portuguese Empire, a non-belligerent trading partner of the United States during the war. British forces attempted to make a landing after being repulsed by American forces, but the Portuguese governor and American consul resident on Faial prevented this from happening and the Royal Navy ultimately sailed away to continue its assignment against New Orleans.James, p.224 Background The Royal Navy ship HMS Plantagenet of seventy-four guns, commanded by Captain Robert Loyd, was sailing to the West Indies with the thirty-eight gun frigate HMS Rota and the eighteen gun brig-sloop HMS Carnation in preparation for the Louisiana Campaign. On the night of September 26, the three ships were cruising in company in Fayal Roads (Fayal Roadstead) when they spotted the Baltimore clipper , a brig with seven guns and a complement of about ninety men. She was commanded by Captain Samuel Chester Reid, who was not prepared to surrender his ship. Captain Loyd ordered a pinnace under Lieutenant Robert Faussett be sent from Plantagenet to ascertain the nationality of the stranger in port. When the British came within gun range of the American vessel and requested the crew identify themselves, Captain Reid declared he would fire if the British came any closer.James, p.223Coggeshall, pp.378-379 Battle \\"Night battle of the Privateer Brig General Armstrong of New York\\" by Emanuel Leutze. According to British reports, Lieutenant Faussett was unable to stop his boat in the rough tides and it drifted too close to General Armstrong. The Americans then opened fire with their 9-pound long guns and hit the pinnace. Two men were killed and seven others wounded before the pinnace could retire out of range.James, pg. 224 Carnation immediately moved in and anchored in front of the American ship to begin negotiations. When discussions failed‚Äîand since General Armstrong had fired the first shot in a neutral port‚ÄîCarnation cut her cable and lowered four boats filled with heavily armed men towards General Armstrong, while Captain Reid maneuvered the ship closer to shore. The first attack occurred at around 8:00 pm. When the Americans observed the incoming boats they maneuvered again to receive them. In the following skirmish, Carnation was kept out of range by enemy fire and the boats were repulsed with a loss estimated by Reid at twenty dead and twenty wounded. One American was killed and another wounded.James, p. 224Coggeshall, pp. 378‚Äì379 At about 9:00 pm, twelve boats armed with carronades and filled with 180 marines and sailors from Plantagenet and Rota were towed into battle by Carnation, which stopped out of gun range. The boats divided into three divisions for another attack. Lieutenant William Matterface commanded the boats and Carnation provided covering fire. Loyd anchored Rota and Plantagenet a few miles away and they did not participate in the engagement. Just after 9:00 pm the British boats advanced, but accurate American fire and strong currents kept Carnation from closing the range and she was damaged. It took Lieutenant Matterface and his boats until about midnight to reach General Armstrong, largely due to the current but partly because of where Loyd had stopped his ships. While the Americans waited they offloaded three of their cannon and erected a battery. When the British arrived, they attempted to board General Armstrong but American gunners sank two of the British boats before they could get close, captured two more, and killed many boarders with swords and musketry at point-blank range. Lieutenant Matterface and several other officers were killed and no one of sufficient rank survived to lead the remaining Britons.James, p.224Coggeshall, pp.378-379 \\"The Privateer Brig General Armstrong Captain S. C. Reid Commander. Which fought a thrilling battle in the Harbor of Fayal.\\" Altogether 36 sailors of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines were killed in action, and another 93 were wounded. The main action lasted over a half hour and only two Americans were killed. Seven were wounded, including Reid who was hit with a musket ball. Reid's men fired nails, knife blades, brass buttons, and other makeshift projectiles from their cannon which reportedly caused severe pain to the surviving British. After being repulsed the British slowly rowed back to their ships and it was 2:00 am on September 27 when they found them. Captain Loyd's response to the defeat was to send the Carnation back to destroy General Armstrong after daylight but when she arrived, American fire caused further damage so Carnation broke off the attack. A little later Carnation appeared again but Captain Reid had already chosen to scuttle his brig by firing one of his swivel guns straight through the hull. The vessel was boarded while it sank and the British set the sails on fire. Reid and his crew escaped to shore. The British wanted to land a detachment to search for the Americans but the Portuguese governor and the resident American consul John Bass Dabney prevented them from doing this.James, p.224 Captain Reid and the crew of General Armstrong were credited with helping delay the British attack on New Orleans and when they returned to America they were greeted as heroes.Coggeshall, pp. 378‚Äì379James, p. 224 However, later historical analysis showed that this was likely not the case.http://bobrowen.com/nymas/warof1812paper/paperrevised2006.html The above historical retelling and similar accounts of the Battle of Fayal are disputed by scholars. An English eyewitness and numerous official reports from the American embassy and Portuguese records claim the British squadron intended to seize General Armstrong illegally and surreptitiously. It would not have made sense for the British to send fully armed launches to ascertain the identity of General Armstrong. This could have been easily done by contacting their own consulate or the American consulate, or simply sending a peace delegation to the ship when it was in dock.Exploit at Fayal; Wallace C.

Thyroid disorders are prevalent in women of child-bearing age and for this reason commonly present as a pre-existing disease in pregnancy, or after childbirth. Uncorrected thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy has adverse effects on fetal and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Due to an increase in thyroxine binding globulin, an increase in placental type 3 deioidinase and the placental transfer of maternal thyroxine to the fetus, the demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy. The necessary increase in thyroid hormone production is facilitated by high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations, which bind the TSH receptor and stimulate the maternal thyroid to increase maternal thyroid hormone concentrations by roughly 50%. If the necessary increase in thyroid function cannot be met, this may cause a previously unnoticed (mild) thyroid disorder to worsen and become evident as gestational thyroid disease. Currently, there is not enough evidence to suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction is beneficial, especially since treatment thyroid hormone supplementation may come with a risk of overtreatment. After women give birth, about 5% develop postpartum thyroiditis which can occur up to nine months afterwards.This is characterized by a short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20‚Äì40% remain permanently hypothyroid. The thyroid in pregnancy Fetal thyroxine is wholly obtained from maternal sources in early pregnancy since the fetal thyroid gland only becomes functional in the second trimester of gestation. As thyroxine is essential for fetal neurodevelopment it is critical that maternal delivery of thyroxine to the fetus is ensured early in gestation. In pregnancy, iodide losses through the urine and the feto-placental unit contribute to a state of relative iodine deficiency. Thus, pregnant women require additional iodine intake. A daily iodine intake of 250 ¬µg is recommended in pregnancy but this is not always achieved even in iodine sufficient parts of the world. Thyroid hormone concentrations in blood are increased in pregnancy, partly due to the high levels of estrogen and due to the weak thyroid stimulating effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that acts like TSH. Thyroxine (T4) levels rise from about 6‚Äì12 weeks, and peak by mid-gestation; reverse changes are seen with TSH. Gestation specific reference ranges for thyroid function tests are not widely in use although many centres are now preparing them. Hypothyroidism Clinical evaluation Hypothyroidism is common in pregnancy with an estimated prevalence of 2-3% and 0.3-0.5% for subclinical and overt hypothyroidism respectively. Endemic iodine deficiency accounts for most hypothyroidism in pregnant women worldwide while chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient parts of the world.Mandel SJ. \\"Hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis in the pregnant state: maternal aspects.\\" Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004; 18: 213-24. The presentation of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is not always classical and may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of normal pregnancy. A high index of suspicion is therefore required especially in women at risk of thyroid disease e.g. women with a personal or family history of thyroid disease, goitre, or co-existing primary autoimmune disorder like type 1 diabetes. Risks of hypothyroidism on fetal and maternal well-being Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by noting a high TSH associated with a subnormal T4 concentration. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is present when the TSH is high but the T4 level is in the normal range but usually low normal. SCH is the commonest form of hypothyroidism in pregnancy and is usually due to progressive thyroid destruction due to autoimmune thyroid disease. Several studies, mostly retrospective, have shown an association between overt hypothyroidism and adverse fetal and obstetric outcomes (e.g. Glinoer 1991). Maternal complications such as miscarriages, anaemia in pregnancy, pre- eclampsia, abruptio placenta and postpartum haemorrhage can occur in pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism. Also, the offspring of these mothers can have complications such as premature birth, low birth weight and increased neonatal respiratory distress. Similar complications have been reported in mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism. A three-fold risk of placental abruption and a two-fold risk of pre-term delivery were reported in mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism. Another study showed a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in women with pre-term delivery (before 32 weeks) compared to matched controls delivering at term. An association with adverse obstetrics outcome has also been demonstrated in pregnant women with thyroid autoimmunity independent of thyroid function. Treatment of hypothyroidism reduces the risks of these adverse obstetric and fetal outcomes; a retrospective study of 150 pregnancies showed that treatment of hypothyroidism led to reduced rates of abortion and premature delivery. Also, a prospective intervention trial study showed that treatment of euthyroid antibody positive pregnant women led to fewer rates of miscarriage than non treated controls. It has long been known that cretinism (i.e. gross reduction in IQ) occurs in areas of severe iodine deficiency due to the fact that the mother is unable to make T4 for transport to the fetus particularly in the first trimester. This neurointellectual impairment (on a more modest scale) has now been shown in an iodine sufficient area (USA) where a study showed that the IQ scores of 7- to 9-year-old children, born to mothers with undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy, were seven points lower than those of children of matched control women with normal thyroid function in pregnancy. Another study showed that persistent hypothyroxinaemia at 12 weeks gestation was associated with an 8-10 point deficit in mental and motor function scores in infant offspring compared to children of mothers with normal thyroid function. Even maternal thyroid peroxidase antibodies were shown to be associated with impaired intellectual development in the offspring of mothers with normal thyroid function. It has been shown that it is only the maternal FT4 levels that are associated with child IQ and brain morphological outcomes, as opposed to maternal TSH levels. Management of hypothyroidism in pregnancy Medications to treat hypothyroidism have been found to be safe during pregnancy. Levothyroxine is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Thyroid function should be normalised prior to conception in women with pre-existing thyroid disease. Once pregnancy is confirmed the thyroxine dose should be increased by about 30-50% and subsequent titrations should be guided by thyroid function tests (FT4 and TSH) that should be monitored 4-6 weekly until euthyroidism is achieved. It is recommended that TSH levels are maintained below 2.5 mU/l in the first trimester of pregnancy and below 3 mU/l in later pregnancy. The recommended maintenance dose of thyroxine in pregnancy is about 2.0-2.4 ¬µg/kg daily. Thyroxine requirements may increase in late gestation and return to pre-pregnancy levels in the majority of women on delivery. Pregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal FT4 and elevated TSH) should be treated as well, since supplementation with levothyroxine in such cases results in significantly higher delivery rate, with a pooled relative chance of 2.76. Hyperthyroidism Clinical evaluation Hyperthyroidism occurs in about 0.2-0.4% of all pregnancies. Most cases are due to Graves‚Äô disease although less common causes (e.g. toxic nodules and thyroiditis) may be seen. Clinical assessment alone may occasionally be inadequate in differentiating hyperthyroidism from the hyperdynamic state of pregnancy. Distinctive clinical features of Graves‚Äô disease include the presence of ophthalmopathy, diffuse goitre and pretibial myxoedema. Also, hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, a self-limiting hyperthyroid state due to the thyroid stimulatory effects of beta-hCG . This distinction is important since the latter condition is typically mild and will not usually require specific antithyroid treatment. Red cell zinc may also be useful in differentiating the two. Hyperthyroidism due to Graves‚Äô disease may worsen in the first trimester of pregnancy, remit in later pregnancy, and subsequently relapse in the postpartum. Risks of hyperthyroidism on fetal and maternal well-being Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia and up to a four-fold increased risk of low birth weight deliveries. Some of these unfavourable outcomes are more marked in women who are diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy. A recent study has also shown that already high normal maternal FT4 levels are associated with a decrease in child IQ and gray matter and cortex volumes, similar to the effects of hypothyroidism. Uncontrolled and inadequately treated maternal hyperthyroidism may also result in fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism due to the transplacental transfer of stimulatory TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs). Clinical neonatal hyperthyroidism occurs in about 1% of infants born to mothers with Graves‚Äô disease. Rarely neonatal hypothyroidism may also be observed in the infants of mothers with Graves‚Äô hyperthyroidism. This may result from transplacental transfer of circulating maternal anti- thyroid drugs, pituitary-thyroid axis suppression from transfer of maternal thyroxine. Management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy Ideally a woman who is known to have hyperthyroidism should seek pre-pregnancy advice, although as yet there is no evidence for its benefit. Appropriate education should allay fears that are commonly present in these women. She should be referred for specialist care for frequent checking of her thyroid status, thyroid antibody evaluation and close monitoring of her medication needs. Medical therapy with anti-thyroid medications is the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in preventing pregnancy complications by hyperthyroidism. Surgery is considered for patients who suffer severe adverse reactions to anti-thyroid drugs and this is best performed in the second trimester of pregnancy. Radioactive iodine is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy and the puerperium. If a woman is already receiving carbimazole, a change to propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended but this should be changed back to carbimazole after the first trimester. This is because carbimazole can rarely be associated with skin and also mid line defects in the fetus but PTU long term also can cause liver side effects in the adult. Carbimazole and PTU are both secreted in breast milk but evidence suggests that antithyroid drugs are safe during lactation. There are no adverse effects on IQ or psychomotor development in children whose mothers have received antithyroid drugs in pregnancy.Current guidelines suggest that a pregnant patient should be on PTU during the first trimester of pregnancy due to lower tetragenic effect and then be switched to methimazole during the second and third trimester due to lower liver dysfunction side effects. Postpartum thyroiditis Postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) is a syndrome of thyroid dysfunction occurring within the first 12 months of delivery as a consequence of the postpartum immunological rebound that follows the immune tolerant state of pregnancy. PPTD is a destructive thyroiditis with similar pathogenetic features to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The disease is very common with a prevalence of 5-9% of unselected postpartum women. Typically there is a transient hyperthyroid phase that is followed by a phase of hypothyroidism. Permanent hypothyroidism occurs in as much as 30% of cases after 3 years, and in 50% at 7‚Äì10 years. The hyperthyroid phase will not usually require treatment but, rarely, propanolol may be used for symptom control in severe cases. The hypothyroid phase should be treated with thyroxine if patients are symptomatic, planning to get pregnant, or if TSH levels are above 10 mU/L. Long-term follow up is necessary due to the risk of permanent hypothyroidism. Nearly all the women with PPTD have positive TPO antibodies. This marker can be a useful screening test in early pregnancy as 50% of women with antibodies will develop thyroid dysfunction postpartum. In addition some but not all studies have shown an association between PPTD and depression so that thyroid function should be checked postpartum in women with mood changes.

The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given the label \\"five per cent philanthropy\\".Tarn, J.N. (1973) Five Per Cent Philanthropy. London: CUP Background The precursor to the aims of MDCs was the work of Edwin Chadwick and others in exposing the sanitary conditions of slums in large metropolitan areas. Once Chadwick's reforms had been implemented poverty remained rife in the overcrowded inner cities, and reformers had to look elsewhere for the solution to the problems of the working class. The publication of Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 and The Communist Manifesto, as well as fear of further uprisings such as that of the Chartists in 1848, increased concern for the welfare of the working class amongst the middle and upper classes. Model dwellings Peabody Square Model Dwellings in Blackfriars Road, Southwark. Out of this environment, various societies and companies were formed to meet the housing needs of the working classes. Improved accommodation was seen as a way of ameliorating overcrowding, as well as the moral and sanitary problems resulting from that. The movement started in a small way in London, with the Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes and Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes finding difficulty in raising sufficient capital to build commercially viable projects. Support from public figures and demonstrations at the Great Exhibition all improved public awareness, if not raising investment. The middle of the century saw the peak in MDC building, with around twenty-eight separate companies operating in London prior to the 1875 Cross Act.White, J. Rothschild Buildings: life in an East End tenement block, 1887-1920, p.19 The movement picked up pace again after the Act, which granted local authorities the right to clear slum dwellings, however the entrepreneurial focus of the companies was restricted by an inability to make a competitive return and the intervention of large- scale municipal housing. The most successful builders post-1875 were those making a smaller return, such as the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, and the East End Dwellings Company, often founded on religious principles as much as commercial. Companies The Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes The first of these companies was formed out of the Labourer's Friend Society, which in 1844 agreed to change its name and purpose towards building houses for labourers that might be adopted by others as a template. Their first urban building project was completed in 1846 at Bagnigge Wells, Pentonville, designed by Henry Roberts. Although the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes (SICLC) had the Prince Consort as its first president and contributed to the Great Exhibition of 1851, their block dwellings, in particular, were subject to criticism. The design of SICLC dwellings paid particular attention to sanitation and ventilation but was otherwise functional and utilitarian, and the resulting estate was seen as grim and unpleasant. The Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes The Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes (MAIDIC) was formed in 1841, earlier than the SICLC, but spent several years acquiring capital to begin its building projects. These commenced after the company obtained a Royal Charter which established the Company on more commercial grounds, guaranteeing a minimum return of five per cent on investment. This was outlined in the Company's resolution: > That an association be formed for the purpose of providing the labouring man > with an increase of the comforts and conveniences of life, with full return > to the capitalist. The first MAIDIC blocks were completed in 1848, constituting twenty-one two room apartments and ninety three room apartments in Old St Pancras Road, again on an 'associated' model - that is, with shared amenities such as lavatories and kitchen. This type of large, block residence with shared facilities became the norm for model dwellings companies. The MAIDIC was one of the largest MDCs and by 1900 housed over 6,000 people.Wohl, A.S. (1977) The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London. London: Edward Arnold The Peabody Trust The Peabody Trust was founded after an unprecedented donation in 1862 of ¬£150,000, by the American banker George Peabody for the good of the poor in London. A committee was set up to choose the most appropriate way to spend the money, and it was decided to build a number of block dwellings for the very poorest of the city. These apartments were of similar design to other companies, but rents were offered at lower levels, leading to complaints from other MDCs.Dennis, R. (1989) The Geography of Victorian Values: philanthropic housing in London, 1840-1900. Journal of Historical Geography 15(1), pp.40-54 Tenancy in a Peabody Dwelling came with strict rules: rents had to be paid weekly and punctually, and many trades were not permitted to be carried on at the dwellings. There was also a night-time curfew and a set of moral standards to be adhered to.Stedman Jones, G. (1984) Outcast London: a study in the relationship between classes in Victorian society. London: Penguin The Improved Industrial Dwellings Company The largest MDC working in central London was the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company (IIDC), founded by Sir Sydney Waterlow in 1863, which housed around 30,000 individuals by 1900. Its rigorous selection procedure, rules and financial regulations meant that the IIDC was one of the more financially successful of these firms.Tarn, J.N. (1968) The Improved Industrial Dwellings Company London:s.n. The Artizans', Labourers' and General Dwellings Company alt=Artizans, Labourers and General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) emblem, High Road, London N22 The Artizans' Company became one of the largest of the MDCs, concentrating on suburban, low-rise estates rather than the central, high-rise model of other companies. It was founded by a former labourer, William Austin, in 1867 and immediately set about building and selling model dwellings first in Battersea, then Salford, Gosport and elsewhere. Their first major contribution to the MDC movement came at Shaftesbury Park in Battersea, a large, suburban estate opened by Lord Shaftesbury in 1872 as a \\"workmen's city\\" for \\"clerks, artisans and labourers\\". Building continued at a larger estate in Kilburn, Queen's Park, then a still larger estate at Hornsey, Noel Park, and finally Leigham Court in Streatham. The company also diversified into block dwellings and other, more commercially minded estates such as Pinnerwood Park near Harrow. By 1900, the Artizans' Company provided dwellings for 42,000 people in over 6,400 residences East End Dwellings Company The EEDC was founded in 1882 by a committee from the parish of St Jude, Whitechapel, headed by Canon Samuel Barnett.Connor, JE and Critchley, BJ (1984) The Red Cliffs of Stepney: History of Buildings erected by the East End Dwellings Co. 1885-1949, Connor and Butler The company was one of the most successful providers of housing to the very poor in the East End of London, being founded along religious lines rather than being preoccupied with capital return on investment, which was the biggest reason behind the lack of success of earlier builders. Following Octavia Hill's principles of female residence managers, the company employed female rent collectors including Beatrice Potter (later Webb, co-founder of the London School of Economics) and Ella Pycroft. The company built a large number of dwellings in what is now the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, starting with Katharine Buildings in 1885. Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company The Four Per Cent Company was founded by a group of Anglo-Jewish philanthropists in 1885, headed by the banker Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild. They built large residences across Spitalfields and Whitechapel, later branching out towards Hackney and South London, with a remit to provide (although not exclusively) for destitute Jews in the East End. The company later renamed itself the Industrial Dwellings Society (1885) Ltd., and is today known as IDS. Other companies There were a large number of companies operating in the nineteenth century, particularly in London, around twenty-eight at the time of the Cross Act. Other names include the South London Dwellings Company (founded by Emma Cons), the Chelsea Park Dwellings Company, the National Dwellings Society, the City and Central Dwellings Company, the London Labourers' Dwellings Society (founded by William Alexander Greenhill), the Real Property Investment Association and later the Guinness Trust, Lewis Trust and Sutton Trust. Outside of London, the Pilrig Model Dwellings Company and Edinburgh Co-Operative Building Company were active in Edinburgh, Scotland, building a number of what have come to be referred to as colony houses. Other companies, such as the Chester Cottage Improvement Company and the Newcastle upon Tyne Improved Industrial Dwellings Company built in specific areas only. Other buildings were erected by individuals, such as Hugh Jackson's New Court, in Camden Town, London, and Sir James Gowans' Rosebank Cottages in Edinburgh. The Newcastle Upon Tyne Improved Industrial Dwellings Company was set up by James Hall of Hall Brothers Steamship Company, Tynemouth, after visiting Sir Sydney Waterlow's establishment in London. It built 108 flats at Garth Heads between 1869 and 1878; the chairman, directors and shareholders were mostly prominent local businessmen. The company was wound up in 1968 and the buildings at Garth Heads are currently used for private student accommodation. Other schemes Baroness Burdett Coutts Baroness Burdett-Coutts was a private philanthropist who gave to many and varied charitable endeavours. One of the most significant private inputs into the provision of working class housing was Columbia Square in Bethnal Green, a block estate completed in 1857. Architecturally, it was a precursor to the imposing Peabody Dwellings, having been designed by Peabody's architect, Henry Darbishire. The addition of a grand marketplace modelled on Saint Chapelle in Paris made the design distinct, but the project was seen overall as a failure, finally being demolished in 1960. Criticism and support Contemporary The MDC movement was strongly supported by individuals like Lord Shaftesbury, who was president of the Artizan's Company for some time, for providing a plan to \\"completely alter for the better the domiciliary habits of the people of the metropolis\\".Welch, Caroline (2006) Noel Park: A Social and Architectural History. London: Haringey Council Libraries, Archives & Museum Services Others, such as Engels, criticised the movement as \\"Proudhonist\\", and a means of ensuring the longevity of capitalism through a process of embourgeoisement.Engels, F. The Housing Question, Der Volkstaat 26 June 1872 Other In the twentieth century and beyond, opinions over the MDC movements have tended towards two positions. The first, adopted by free market economists, asserts that the financial success of some of these companies shows that they could have been a significant help to the poor, if their operation was not interrupted by the arrival of social housing in the form of London County Council estates.Morris, S.

(2008) British social housing and the voluntary sector. Journal of Economic Affairs 28(2), pp. 5‚Äì10 Others argue that the failure of MDCs to meet the needs of the very poorest demonstrates that they were a stepping stone towards the inevitable necessity of state intervention to solve the housing crisis.Gauldie, E. (1974) Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918. London: Allen & Unwin MDCs have been particularly criticised for failing to provide for the very poorest of society, concentrating on the labour aristocracy, the upper strata of the working classes.

Facts and questions of law Between 1970 and 1973, Wimpey Construction UK Ltd entered into extensive negotiations to purchase 14 acres of land owned by Ronald Cornwall near a proposed motorway bypass near Esher. However, the land was eventually sold by the vendor to Woodar Investment Development Ltd, whom in turn entered into a sale contract with Wimpey Ltd for ¬£850,000 (), as well as to complete the purchase, Wimpey would be obliged to pay a further ¬£150,000 to a third party, Transworld Trade Ltd.Law Report of the judgment Bailii.org.uk - Openlaw JISC Bailii]. Transworld was a Hong Kong based company linked to the original land owner Ronald Cornwall. However, the contract contained several termination clauses, with the important clause that the contract would terminate if the government started compulsory purchase action for this land, and 8 months later, the government gave Woodar formal notice that they were going to compulsory acquire 2.3 acres of the land. In the following year, in 1974, with a drop in land prices, with the land original purchased for ¬£70,000, Wimpey's solicitors wrote to Woodar informing them that they were rescinding the contract based on the compulsory acquisition clause, but also offering to purchase the land again for the reduced price of ¬£48,000 per acre. Woodars solicitors response was to inform them that this was wrongful rescission, as the rescission clause only allowed compulsory acquisition commenced after the date of the contract, pointing out that the government had started to acquisition process before the sale date, including public advertising and holding public meetings on the matter. Woodar sued for damages and in the High court it was awarded ¬£462,000 damages, subsequently reduced on appeal by the Court of Appeal to ¬£272,943. Separately, the claimant, Woodar, argued that Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd should be followed so they could claim the full ¬£1m, passing on the ¬£150,000 element of this, the overage sum envisaged as due directly to a third party by the contract (a non-signatory to the contract). Judgment Court of Appeal The panel sitting, Buckley, Lawton and Goff , found no entitlement to terminate and held reluctantly that they were bound by Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd into holding that the additional ¬£150,000 could be recovered. House of Lords The Judicial Committee held by a majority (Lords Salmon and Russell dissenting) that there had in fact been no repudiatory breach as Wimpey, as they had calculated, were entitled to rescind following the intervening compulsory purchase affecting the site. As obiter dicta the Lords discussed where the Court of Appeal was right that if Woodar did have a good claim for breach of contract, they could claim damages on behalf of Transworld Trade Ltd. Lord Wilberforce said that Jackson could be supported on its special facts, as a type of contract including family holidays, ordering meals in restaurants and hiring a taxi for a group.

Facts Mr Collier was one of three partners of a property developer. They had assented to a court order to pay ¬£46,000 to Wright Ltd in monthly instalments of ¬£600, and were jointly liable. From 1999 the payments went down to ¬£200 a month. In 2000, swore Mr Collier, there was a meeting where Wright Ltd said he would be severally liable (for ¬£15,600), rather than jointly (as a partner). The other two partners went bankrupt in 2002 and 2004. In 2006, when Mr Collier had finally made his payments (totalling exactly one third of the debt) Wrights served on him a statutory demand for the 'balance of the debt'. Mr Collier applied under rule 6.4 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (because the debt was disputable on ‚Äòsubstantial grounds‚Äô (r.6.5(4)(b)); so he only needed to show there was a ‚Äògenuine triable issue‚Äô in which case the court would set aside the demand. He alleged the variation agreement was binding, or if not that Wright Ltd was estopped from enforcing the full payment. Judgment The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment 'below' (= 'at first instance') on the promissory estoppel point. Arden LJ held that Foakes v Beer applied, but referring to the ‚Äòbrilliant dictum‚Äô of Denning J in High Trees, held that promissory estoppel could aid Mr Collier. Where he had been assured that he could repay only part of the debt, he had relied on the assurance by making his payments, Wright Ltd resiling from the promise ‚Äò itself be inequitable‚Äô [42]. Longmore LJ was more cautious than Arden LJ, confirming the need for some ‚Äòmeaningful reliance‚Äô (after Rees), suggesting it was not a foregone conclusion that Wright's demand was entirely 'inequitable', but most importantly stressing the need for 'true accord'; stating: Mummery LJ agreed, and stated that the appeal should be allowed because there was a prospect of real success on the \\"estoppel argument\\". Significance David Uff, instructed by Jai Ramsahoye of Betesh Partnership,(for Collier) sought to carve out a third exception to Pinnel's Case (above and beyond Sir Edward Coke's own \\"the gift of a horse, hawk, robe etc. in satisfaction is good\\" and that established by Williams v Roffey) submitting that: serving to illustrate the ongoing tension between Pinnel's Case/Foakes v Beer \\"doctrine\\" and that of promissory estoppel and the judicial reticence to displace/modify a doctrine that flowed from no less a man than Sir Edward Coke; some commentators seeing the case as leaving some doors open to side-stepping Foakes v Beer via promissory estoppel (formulated in High Trees). Others have criticized the judgment:- Alexander Trukhtanov wrote:A Trukhtanov, ‚ÄòFoakes v Beer: reform at common law at the expense of equity‚Äô (2008) 124 LQR 364-368 Jill Poole suggests there was an implicit assumption that WilliamsWilliams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd. [1991] 1 QB 1 (CA)could not apply in this context. She suggests that the importance of the case should not be exaggerated, relating only to a finding of an \\"arguable defence of promissory estoppel\\". A mixed supporter includes: Robert Pearce QC, who after highlighting the uncertainty as to whether the courts will follow the implications inherent in High Trees, D & C Builders v Rees and this case, specify \\"as a corollary, if there is 'true accord' [true later agreement], it will necessarily follow that it will be inequitable for the creditor to seek payment of the balance\\" going on to say: See also Notes English contract case law Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases 2007 in British law 2007 in case law English estoppel case law ","title":"Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd"},{"id":"30058808","text":"Sabatinca chrysargyra is a species of moth belonging to the family Micropterigidae.

Judgment The House of Lords held this was too vague for the contract to be enforced. There was no objective standard by which the court could know what price was intended or what a reasonable price might be.

He was admitted B.A. 28 November 1584, M.A. 23 May 1588, B.D. 2 July 1594, and D.D. 5 February 1597. In 1593 Latewar was proctor, at which time he was rector of Hopton, Suffolk. In 1596 he was recommended by the university of Oxford as one of the candidates for the first Gresham professorship of divinity.John Ward, Lives of Professors at Gresham College, p. 36 On 28 June 1599 he was appointed rector of Finchley, Middlesex,Richard Newcourt, Repertorium Ecclesiasticum i. 605 As chaplain to Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, Latewar accompanied Blount on his expedition to Ireland.

The sixth and final of the Binngarra type Manly ferries, the vessel entered service in 1922. Since its decommissioning as a ferry in 1983, the vessel has since been had a number of owners who have attempted to find a new role and restore it. Since 2003, it has been laid up at Balls Head Bay on the north side of Sydney Harbour as attempts to restore the vessel have continued. Baragoola is an Australian Aboriginal word for \\"flood tide\\".savethebaragoola.com Background Kuring-gai (1901) was the forerunner to the \\"Bingarra-type\\" vessels including Barrenjoey. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to Barrenjoeys at the ends of the sun deck. The Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in Sydney Cove - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the prosperous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing engine size and power. The first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative Walter Reeks‚Äìdesigned vessels; the SS Manly (1896), and SS Kuring-gai (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \\"Binngarra- class\\" ferries. They both had high forecastles at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the Sydney Heads. The steel-hulled Kuring-gai was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels. Manly and Kuring-gai had both, however, followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels. Whereas the \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their promenade decks. The Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's \\"Binngarra-class\\" ferries, Binngarra (1905), Burra-Bra (1908), Bellubera (1910), Balgowlah (1912), Barrenjoey (1913), and Baragoola (1922), were designed by Mort's Dock and Engineering, initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie. The first five were built at Mort's Woolwich yard and Baragoola was built at the Balmain yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. Design and construction Baragoola's launch day, 14 February 1922 Costing between ¬£75,000 and ¬£85,000, Baragoola was launched on 14 February 1922 by Mrs Hunter McPherson. It was the sixth and final \\"Binngarra\\" type vessel,Baragoola Ferries of SydneyManly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola History Works December 2007 and while 6 metres shorter and with a greater beam, she was otherwise similar to her older sister ships Binngarra (1905), Burra-bra (1908), Bellubera (1910), Balgowlah (1912), and Barrenjoey (1913 - later North Head). Baragoola is 498 tons and 60.7 meters long. As built, the vessel was powered by a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine with cylinder diameters of 18\\", 28\\", and 47.5\\", with 27\\" stroke, developing . It had two marine horizontal multitubular (navy type) boilers. During acceptance trials on 11 August 1922, she achieved an average speed of 14.7 knots in 6 runs, with one maximum of 15 knots, over the measured mile. While this exceeded the contracted speed requirements, she was slower than her sisterships, and earning the name 'slow boat' due to her being 6 metres shorter and of greater beam. As a steamship her working speed was 14 knots. Brand new Baragoola performing sea trials 1922 on Sydney Harbour The layout of Baragoola public spaces was typical of Manly ferries built until 1938. In her original open upper deck configuration, she had a summer capacity of 1218 passengers, and a winter capacity of 926. Following her upper-decks being enclosed in the early 1930s, her capacity was 1523 passengers. On the lower deck, aft, was a segregated Ladies Saloon with toilets, a main cabin and forward was a smoking saloon (usually reserved for men) with external toilets. This area also contained the original Mail Room and was the site of the later crew's mess. The internal hull arrangement has two void spaces at either end, a hold immediately aft of the forward void, the engine room behind the hold connected to the control room and (second from the aft) a compartment that contains batteries, auxiliary diesel tank, fresh water tank and the Engineer's Quarters. She was fitted with electro-hydraulic steering equipment after World War 2 which replaced her earlier chain steering. In 1961, the vessel was converted to diesel-electric and her tall funnel replaced with one short and squat. Four British Thomson-Houston 7 cylinder diesels were installed, generating a total of , and driving two new English Electric electric engines, enabling her to achieve 16 knots. These engines are the only remaining operational ones of their type, having only ever been installed in three Manly ferries. The large steam ferry, Curl Curl was retired when Baragoola was recommissioned following her diesel-electric conversion. Ferry service Baragoola was involved in a number of collisions while in service. On Christmas Eve 1926, off Kirribilli Point, she collided with the Sydney Ferries Limited's Kosciusko.Marine Court Sydney Morning Herald 10 February 1927 On 12 September 1927, Baragoola ran down a lifeboat from the French steamer Ville D'Amiens, five people were thrown out of the lifeboat, one of whom was hospitalised.Ferry Boat and Skiff Collide in Sydney Harbour Sydney Morning Herald 13 September 1927 The people were rescued by two fishing trawlers in the vicinity and the lifeboat was severely damaged. On 28 August 1934, Baragoola struck and killed a whale. The event was widely reported in the media when the disposal of the corpse took multiple attempts over nine days.with whale adventure in Sydney Harbour Sydney Morning Herald 28 August 1934 Baragoola at Mort's Dock with recently enclosed upper decks. c. 1930 Like her sisters, Bellubera and Barrenjoey, Baragoola's open upper deck was closed- in in 1931/2, improving passenger amenities. At this time, she was modified to trial pulverised coal, however, this was stopped when the vessel and passengers were being showered in coal dust. Between 8 March and 3 August 1939, Baragoola was converted to an oil burner using tar under natural draught, like the Curl Curl, Dee Why and South Steyne. Improved propellers were fitted at this time. The conversion to oil firing was reversed due to oil shortages during the war, however, with coal bunkers having been previously replaced by oil tanks, she could only make a couple of trips per day and she smoked badly without forced draft being available. Modifications in 1948 included the replacement of her chain-operated steering gear with Brown Brothers (later known as Vickers) hydraulic equipment. In 1958, Baragoola was withdrawn for a rebuild including the replacement of its steam engines with English Electric 7SKM diesel-electric engines. It returned to service in 1961. In 1973 and loaded with sight-seers, she took part in the on-Harbour celebrations for the opening of the Sydney Opera House. Baragoola was included in the sale of Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company to Brambles in April 1972. It had a re-fit in 1974. In December 1974, the Manly service was taken over by the NSW State Government and her traditional Manly ferry colours of green, cream and brown were replaced by the Public Transport Commission's blue and white.tHansard 13 November 1974 New South Wales Legislative Assembly Following the 1982 delivery of the Freshwater, Baragoola was withdrawn on 8 January 1983 gaining significant media coverage. A second new ferry, Queenscliff, entered service in 1983, several years after which, the aging North Head was retired from service. Post service life Baragoola was sold to Bob Hyde for use as a floating university. The university never eventuated, and she was laid up at Rozelle Bay until 1988 when she was sold to David Ashton of Waterview Wharf, Balmain. In late 2003, she was evicted from Waterview Wharf and relocated to the Coal Loader in Balls Head Bay where it remains today. In 2009, following a period of animosity from NSW Maritime, Ashton offered the vessel for sale by auction and she passed into ownership of Adrian Thompson, who considered scrapping the vessel.Baragoola - Triumph & Tragedy David Ashton 2010 In March 2010, Baragoola was sold to the Baragoola Preservation Association, a not for profit organisation who have undertaken the task of restoring the vessel.Baragoola Restoration Steams Ahead Manly Daily 28 September 2010An Australian Army training activity with Black Hawk helicopters and the adjacently moored Cape Don, damaged the vessel's upper works on 1 December 2010.Black Hawk down draught - veteran ferry cops a blast The Daily Advertiser 2 December 2010 The vessel is listed on the Australian Register of Historic VesselsBaragoola Australian Register of Historic Vessels Historic gallery File:Sydney Ferry BARAGOOLA launch day.jpgBeing launched, 1922 File:Sydney Ferry BARAGOOLA at Kurraba Point 1920s.jpgAt the Kurraba Point base in her original configuration, 1920s File:Ferry BARAGOOLA underway on Sydney Harbour (8290452200).jpg1920s or early 1930s.

Allen passed over as a fugitive to New England. Admitted to the church of Boston on 11 January 1638/39, on 9 June following, at his own request and that of the church of Charlestown, he was dismissed from Boston, and was admitted to Charlestown on 22 December 1639 (O.S.). Then, or soon afterwards, he became Teacher, as the fellow-worker of Zechariah Symmes, pastor of Charlestown.J.A. Vinton, The Symmes Memorial: A Biographical Sketch of Rev. Zechariah Symmes (David Clapp & Son, Boston 1873), pp. 1-17, at p. 5. In this capacity he succeeded John Harvard, who had died in September 1638 little more than a year after arriving in Charlestown. He is supposed to have married Harvard's widow, Anna, for he acted as administrator in the execution of Harvard's estate and paid his bequests. His recorded children were Mary (1639/40), Sarah (1641), Elizabeth (1643) and Mercy (1646), of whom only Mary survived infancy, and a son, Thomas.J. Savage, A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, 4 Vols. (Little, Brown & Co., Boston 1860), I, pp. 36-37 (Internet Archive). On 3 May 1639 Allen received the large grant of 500 acres of land from the General Court, \\"in regard to Mr. Harvard's gift\\".R. Frothingham, The History of Charlestown, Massachusetts (Charles C. Little & James Brown, Boston 1845), p. 75, note 4 (Internet Archive). Cotton Mather observed that he \\"approved himself a pious and painful minister of the Gospel at Charlestown\\", where he remained Teacher until 1651. In his first years in New England he witnessed the foundation of the town of Woburn. The texts of his sermons, not least his series upon the words of St John the Baptist in the closing verses of St John's Gospel, chapter 3, concern the doctrine of Justification by Faith. During this time also he conceived and developed his best-known work, A Chaine of Scripture Chronologie, which constructed a chronology of the history of the world, in seven periods down to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 3968 Anno Mundi.P.W. Jackson, The Chronologers' Quest: Episodes in the Search for the Age of the Earth (Cambridge University Press 2006), p. 18 (Google). Although not published until 1659 in London, the Epistle to Allen's book by William Greenhill (as quoted by Cotton Mather) states: \\"This work having had its conception in a remote corner of the world, it was latent in his closet, the greatest part of seven years... and it had still been suppressed, had not the author been pressed, and charged with hiding of a talent in a napkin, by... [Mr. John Cotton].\\" (John Cotton died in 1652It is unclear whether the identification of Mr Allen's Jehoiadah as John Cotton is in Greenhill's words or Mather's.). Greenhill remarks that its author, wearied with controversy, was glad to leave others to \\"dispute\\" while he should \\"compute\\": like (he says with a flourish), malle se computare quam disputare.Quoted in extenso in C.

In that year he returned to Norwich in Old England, where he found a ministry as \\"preacher of the city\\" in St. George's parish. (He was not the rector of St. George's, Norwich.) On his return he wrote a letter (dated 8 November 1651 from Norwich) affirming the missionary work of John Eliot and Thomas Mayhew, jnr., as they had themselves told him of it, in preaching the gospel among the Native Americans. Allen had not had the strength to follow that calling himself.'Letter of Thomas Allen', in Henry Whitfield, Strength out of Weakness.

He was pastor of the congregational church in Norwich from 1657, but was ejected following the Act of Uniformity 1662. After this he preached there whenever opportunity arose. John Cromwell succeeded him as pastor, and Cromwell's successor, Martin Fynch, who knew Allen, gave a character of him in his preface dated 1674 to a volume of Allen's sermons.

He was one of the first black Americans to participate in the antebellum American Back-to-Africa movement under the auspices of Captain Paul Cuffe's 1815 voyage to Sierra Leone. Early life Little is known of Gwinn's early life. Presumably he was previously enslaved to the Massachusetts Gwinn family or had immigrated from the Southern states after being emancipated. By the early 1800 he was a free black and lived in antebellum Massachusetts. He was listed in the 1810 census as a resident of Boston Ward 1 in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. He was described as being of the 'Methodist order' and as being \\"from Boston\\" by Paul Cuffe. Emigration to Sierra Leone  The journey  In 1815 and at age sixty, Gwinn decided to immigrate with his fifty-six-year-old wife Elizabeth and seventeen-year-old daughter Nancy Gwinn to Sierra Leone. The Gwinn family was one of eight families to emigrate to Sierra Leone under the auspices of Captain Paul Cuffe. Cuffe, a man of Native American and African American ancestry, had visited Sierra Leone in 1811 to assess whether he'd like to immigrate there. His Native American wife, however, did not want to leave the land of her ancestry. He returned four years later with 38 African Americans. The emigrants, mainly Bostonians, were the first black Americans to immigrate on a large scale directly from the United States to Africa. The Gwinns traveled in Cuffe's Traveller to Sierra Leone and did not pay for expenses. They were expected to work on Governor Charles MacCarthy's farm once they arrived in Sierra Leone. According to records in the Massachusetts Historical Society, William Gwinn traveled to Sierra Leone \\"with his wife and two Children.\\"  Settlement  The group arrived in Sierra Leone about the end of January or early February. Cuffe wrote to the African Institution in London's William Allen on April 1, 1816 to let him know that homesteads had been acquired for the settlement. Gwinn worked a 10-acre farm with 5 families from Boston. 29 people that were going to work the 10 acres together included: * Thomas Jarvis, his wife and five children. Jarvis was about 50. * Peter Wilcox, his wife and five children. Wilcox was about 40. * Robert Rigsby, his wife and one child * William Guinn, his wife and daughter Another settler was David George, a Baptist preacher who had escaped enslavement and then traveled to Nova Scotia before emigrating to Sierra Leone. The same year, Gwinn's daughter Nancy married George Davis, the African born son of African American parents who had immigrated via Nova Scotia (under the auspices of John Clarkson) to found Freetown, Sierra Leone in 1792.  Integration with 1792 Nova Scotian Settlers  Most of the 38 emigrants integrated with the original founders (known as the Settlers of the Colony of Sierra Leone who had arrived in 1792).  Later years and descendants  Little is known of what became of Gwinn himself; however a letter from other colonists indicated that 'Friend Gwinn' had a lost a leg since arriving in Sierra Leone. Gwinn likely settled in Settler Town as that was where the original \\"American emigrants reside.\\" The Gwinns have descendants in Sierra Leone and the United States through the union of George Davis I to Miss Nancy Gwinn in 1816.

Early life William was the fourth son of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg and Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt, eldest daughter of Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia, a niece of Frederick II of Prussia. Military career In 1779 he joined the Royal Danish Army and quickly rose to the rank of Oberst. In 1781 he commanded his own regiment, being promoted to major general in 1783, moved to the Danish Foot Guards in 1785 and promoted to lieutenant general in 1795. In 1801 he became governor of Copenhagen and later the same year faced the Battle of Copenhagen in that role. In 1806 he paid 10,000 Reichstaler to leave the Danish army. His brother Frederick had just been made king of W√ºrttemberg and in Stuttgart made William a field marshal and W√ºrttemberg's minister for war. From 1810 to 1821 William temporarily lived in his manor house at Hirrlingen near Rottenburg but more often in the Schloss Stetten in Remstal. On 29 June 1811 he took on Freiherr Friedrich von Phull as vice-president of the War Department (and de facto Minister for War, though William remained minister de jure until 1815). In 1815, on leaving office, William shifted to studying science and successfully practised as a physician. In 1817 the University of T√ºbingen awarded him an honorary degree in medicine. As a member of the royal house of W√ºrttemberg, William also held a seat in the Kammer der Standesherren (House of Lords) of the W√ºrttembergische Landst√§nde parliament from 1819 to his death in 1830.  Marriage and issue  William's wife, Wilhelmine von Tunderfeld-Rhodis On 23 August 1800, in Coswig, Frederick married one of his mother's ladies in waiting, Wilhelmine Freiin von Tunderfeld-Rhodis (1777‚Äì1822), daughter of Baron Karl August Wilhelm von Tunderfeld-Rhodis. She was a scion of a military family from Sweden, originally from the Baltic. The couple had six children, only three of whom reached adulthood: * Alexander, Count of W√ºrttemberg (1801‚Äì1844), poet; married Countess Helene Festetics von Tolna (1812‚Äì1886), daughter of Ladislas Graf Festetics of Tolna. * Duke August (1805‚Äì1808) * Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach, Count of W√ºrttemberg (1810‚Äì1869); married firstly Princess Th√©odolinde of Leuchtenberg (1814‚Äì1857). He married secondly Princess Florestine of Monaco (1833‚Äì1897). * Duke Friedrich August (1811‚Äì1812) * Duke Franz (1814‚Äì1824) * Marie, Countess of W√ºrttemberg (1815‚Äì1866); married Wilhelm, Count of Taubenheim (1805‚Äì1894). Since this was a morganatic marriage, on 1 August 1801 William renounced his descendants' claim to the throne of W√ºrttemberg. This had an effect in 1921, on the death of William II of W√ºrttemberg, when his descendants were excluded from inheriting. However, by then the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg had itself been superseded.

Early life Shigekata's father, Hosokawa Nobunori, was the 4th daimy≈ç of Hosokawa clan, but his elder brother, the 5th daimy≈ç, unfortunately was killed, because the family crest of another person was similar to that of the Hosokawa clan. Family * Father: Hosokawa Nobunori (1676‚Äì1732) * Wife: daughter of Koga Michie * Concubine: Yokoshi later Entei-in * Children:  Hosokawa Harutoshi (1758‚Äì1787) by Yokoshi  Norihime later Korin'in married Hosokawa Okinori  Hidejiro Daimyo Shigekata was the 6th daimy≈ç of Kumamoto of Hosokawa clan, noted for successful financial reform of Kumamoto Domain, for establishing Jish≈´kan Han school, Medical School Saishunkan (school) and new ideas of criminal law. There were financial difficulties of the Kumamoto Han. The deficits at the time of his father's administration reached 400,000 Ry≈ç. The financial situation of his Han worsened because of the Edo bakufu's sankin-k≈çtai policy, and because of famine. Shigekata himself had kept a card of a pawn shop in order not to forget his young hard days, for one reason because he was one of 21 children born to Hosokawa Nobunori. The reform of Horeki In 1752, he appointed Hori Katuna the great Bugy≈ç, often translated as \\"commissioner\\", \\"magistrate\\" or \\"governor\\", was a title assigned to government officers in pre-modern Japan. Hori immediately went to Osaka to negotiate with Kohnoike family and others for loan, but the wealthy families of Osaka refused the requests of Kumamoto han. Then, Hori was successful in borrowing a huge sum of money from Kajimaya in return for 100,000 koku of rice. Kajimaya requested considerable reduced financial interest from Kumamoto han. Originally, 100 koku for samurai meant 40 koku of rice, or the samurai obtained 40%. After the reform, 20 koku per 100 koku went to a samurai, and then 13 koku, this meant a reduction of 65%.Higogaku Koza\\" The reform of Horeki, its present-day significance. Yoshimura T. p108‚Äì131, Kokudaka (Áü≥È´ò) or the system of koku refers to a system for determining land value for tribute purposes in Edo period Japan and expressing this value in koku of rice. This tribute was no longer a percentage of the actual quantity of rice harvested, but was assessed based on the quality and size of the land. The system was used to value the incomes of daimy≈ç, or samurai under daimy≈ç. Kumamoto han wanted samurai to be satisfied with the Horeki reform, and at the same time, they would train themselves as samurai. One was to build a school of han for samurai and others. Another idea was to rehabilitate those who were against the rules, and Shigekata started completely new criminal laws of the han. In addition, Shigekata and Hori started the production of washi (Japanese paper), silk, and monopolized production of wax. They at times examined the land and its production (Kenchi, in Japanese). Toward the end of the H≈çreki years (1751‚Äì1763), the financial status of the Han had greatly improved. Stockpiled rice and cereal helped the han in the famine of Tenmei. Criticisms of the reform *Because it was so radical, it was not without objections, especially by samurai. In 1772, Matsuno Hichizou, a metsuke, pointed out three bad points of Hori. In 1774, Masuda Yaichiuemon, criticized the Reform in 18 secret letters. Iguchi Souemon, a bugy≈ç favoring the Reform, committed seppuku because he was insulted by Nagaoka Mondo, who was against Hori. Ariyoshi Daizen, a kar≈ç, made magic (paranormal) against Shigakata and Hori.History of Kumamoto viewed from topis, edit. Iwamoto C. The Merits and Demerits of the Reform of Horeki, p134, Gen Shobou, Fukuoka, 2007 Furukawa Koshoken, a travel journalist, visited Kumamoto around the last of Shigekata years; he found a discrepancy between the life of ordinary people and the popularity of Shigekata, and wrote he believed that in Kumamoto, there was nothing good politically.Higogaku Koza p127 In later years, Yokoi Sh≈çnan criticized the present situation in Kumamoto han, in his Jimu Shian.Hogogaku Koza p75 Schools Shigekata established a famous Han school, Jish≈´kan within the campus of Kumamoto Castle in 1755. This school is known for producing many noted scholars in later years such as Yokoi Sh≈çnan, Inoue Kowashi and Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç. It was open to any class of people, if admission was recognized, not only in Kumamoto people but also in other provinces, with scholarships when students were very bright. There was no such system in other Han schools at this time. At the most popular period, 255 schools were established in the Edo period in Japan, one in every Han or local country. Other famous schools of Han were Nisshinkan of Aizu, K≈çj≈çkan of Yonezawa, Kohdohkan of Mito, Meirinkan of Ch≈çsh≈´, Shin-yukan of Nakatsu, Kohdohkan of Saga, Z≈çshikan of Satsuma were known, in addition to Jish≈´kan. Medical school He established the first public han medical school, Saishunkan (school) in Miyaderamura, Akitagun (now Nihongi), Kumamoto, in 1756 and the school was opened the following year. Its botanical garden was established in Yakuencho, Kumamoto.Anecdotes of Hosokawa Shigekata Kawaguchi K. Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, 2008Higo Iikushi Yamasaki M. p.6, 1929, Saikai Jih≈çsha, Kumamoto. Penal reform Another important reform he made was about the criminal laws. There had been only the death penalty and exile as punishment. Exile was changed to caning and penal labour. Tattooing was changed to shaving the eyebrows, once in 5 days. His idea was to let them work for the Han, and rehabilitate them into society. His reform was made a model in Meiji Restoration. Those who worked were given money in preparation for the days after punishment. Additional academic pursuits In his later life, he was interested in biology, the records of plants and animals; which were said to be professional. An interesting animal, possibly drawn by a professional (though he himself drew pictures), was made of the Honsh≈´ wolf, which is now extinct. The picture of the wolf is in a book. There were 16 albums of minute pictures of animals and dry plants in the Eisei Bunko, the collection of treasures of the Hosokawa Family.Hosokawa[2008:84‚Äì85] In his days, daimy≈ç interested in Western matters were rare.

Recreational NGOs organised by Filipinos Hong Kong Musicians Union In 1948, with the growing numbers of Filipino musicians in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Musicians Union (HKMU) was established.Hong Kong Musicians Union http://www.hkmu.org/ It was founded by British musician Pete O‚ÄôNeil, then followed by Filipino musician Andy Hidalgo and this has been the norm ever since. The musicians rented flats in Hillwood Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, for musical jam sessions to explore and improve their music skills until they were able to purchase a Union House in Mirador Mansion in 1957. They would meet at the Filipino Club in Tsim Sha Tsui for general assemblies. HKMU, in co-ordination with the Philippine Consulate General and the Government of Hong Kong, has been co-organizing an annual Concert in the Park,Free Filipino concert at Cultural Centre Piazza on Sunday http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det2.php?id=1921 18 November 2009. to celebrate their love for music and promote the city‚Äôs vibrant music scene. The event was held in Kowloon Park during its inaugural years, but has since moved to the Piazza of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Recreational NGOs organised by Non-Filipinos Hong Kong Philippine Kali Association Founded in 1998 by Fong Wing Hong, Hong Kong Philippine Kali Association is aimed at promoting the traditional Filipino martial arts, which are fighting with sticks, blades, and improvised weapons. In addition, the association provides adolescents with training courses, helping them to learn self-defense, self- confidence, self-discipline, respect for others, and to serve the community.Hong Kong Philippine Kali Association http://www.kali-fong.com.hk Religious NGOs There are a number of Filipino NGOs in Hong Kong founded by both Filipinos and non-Filipinos on their religious background, such as Catholic, Christian, and Muslim associations that serve the Filipinos' religious interests. Religious NGOs organised by Filipinos The Filipino Catholic Association (FCA) Among the religious NGOs that are founded by Filipinos, the Filipino Catholic Association (FCA) which is located at the Kowloon Rosary Church has the longest history. It was established on 8 April 1958, appointed by Lawrence Bianchi, Bishop of Hong Kong at the time. All Filipino Catholics are welcome to join the FCA. Its objective is to preserve faiths of members and to encourage them to share their blessings with others by charity and mercy works. Monthly meetings, celebrations, choir, and visits to sick members are regularly held by the FCA. The FCA also requests its members to attend obsequies for the deceased.Parish Groups Rosary Church Kowloon http://rosarychurch.catholic.org.hk/A7Eng.html#e7 Jesus Is Lord Church (JIL Church) Jesus Is Lord Church (JIL Church) is a Christian organisation that originates in the Philippines. In Hong Kong, there are nine JIL Churches located at Sham Shui Po, Wan Chai, Central, North Point, Discovery Bay, Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, Sai Kung and Stanley respectively.Jesus Is Lord Church Hong Kong http://www.jilhongkong.org/ Muslim Filipino Association (MUSFILA) Muslim Filipino Association (MUSFILA) engages in numbers of political movements, for example the organisation participated in a march to the US Consulate to protest against war in Gaza in 2008.The Hong Kong march rally for Palestine:Solidarity beyond color, race and religion http://www.arkibongbayan.org/2009/2009-01Jan11-hkjan11/hkjan11.htm 11 January 2008. Religious NGOs organised by Non-Filipinos Some religious organisations in Hong Kong also set up Filipino ministries to serve Filipinos in Hong Kong particularly, for example the International Christian Assembly (ICA) Hong Kong.International Christian Assembly Hong Kong http://www.icahk.org/ St Anne‚Äôs Church has a division named the St. Anne‚Äôs Filipino Catholic Group in Hong Kong. The Group organises activities like prayer group, choir, home visitations, retreat, and pilgrimage for believers. It also joined the \\"Hand to Hand, Heart to Heart, Door to Door\\" program to collect donations, clothes, stationeries, toys and canned food for the needy in the Philippines in 2009.St Anne's Church http://www.stannes.hk/organization/ministries/filipinos Others Philippine Association of Hong Kong Established in 1961, the organisation is run by officials of different nationalities.PAHK. History. Philippine Association of Hong Kong http://www.pahk.com.hk/History.htm People with business and social interests are its main target members. On one hand, it emphasises on charity involvement. On the other hand, it devotes itself to promotion of Philippine trade and investment. Thus, it serves as a multi- purpose NGO with officials from multiple countries.

Chip Tsao Incident On 27 March 2009, Chip Tsao, a Hong Kong writer, wrote an essay titled 'The War at Home' which was publicised in a free magazine called \\"HK magazine\\". He claimed that the Philippines alleged her sovereignty of Spratly Islands and he described the Philippines as the 'nation of servants'.Tsao, Chip (27 March 2009), \\"The War at Home\\", HK Magazine, http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=454117&publicationSubCategoryId;=202 1 April 2009.

They considered Tsao‚Äôs essay as a ‚Äòracist essay‚Äô. They also called for more attention to racism and discrimination in Hong Kong. Demonstration The Philippine Government imposed a mandatory insurance on the hiring of Filipino domestic helpers. The Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong were worried that might reduce their competitiveness towards the workers from the other countries, thus they demonstrated outside the Philippine Consulate on 9 November 2010.Mandap, Daisy C.L.. Mandatory OFW insurance scares off overseas employers http://www.sunweb.com.hk/Story.asp?hdnStoryCode=6547& December 2010. Filipinos also joined some demonstrations on different issues in Hong Kong, such as anti-article 23 and the legislation of minimum wage. Media The SUN (newspaper), Hong Kong News, HKPinoyTV (online video news) and The Mission For Migrant Workers (MFMW) (Newsletter and magazine) are the main sources of Filipino media accessible in Hong Kong. Filipino newspapers circulated in Hong Kong, such as The SUN (Newspaper), are a main source of media coverage for these Filipino NGOs. The SUN is established in 1995. Leo A, Deocadiz and Daisy Catherine L. Mandap are the publisher and editor of the newspaper. There are still pools of writers, mostly Filipino domestic helpers that graduated from the annual writing workshops conducted by The SUN's editors. They contribute articles to The SUN. The SUN embraces news about Filipinos in Hong Kong, news on internet and Manila newspapers. There are also feature stories about lives in Hong Kong which are from the Filipinos' views. Amidst the advent of mobile devices and the impending dominance of social video as a media platform, HKPinoyTV was launched four years ago with a vision to provide free high definition original content video news service to the Filipino community in Hong Kong. It is currently operated and maintained by professional broadcast journalists as a public service. With a region leading 88.3% smartphone penetration in Hong Kong (eMarketer 2015), HKPinoyTV's mobile-friendly media delivery platform is always accessible (24/7) to the mobile device equipped and social media savvy overseas Filipinos. With more than 170,000 Filipino workers and residents, relevant news and interesting stories abound in Hong Kong. With informative content standing on a solid online platform, HKPinoyTV redefines the media landscape for the Filipinos in Hong Kong.

Brown was called \\"The Berlin Patient\\" at the 2008 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, where his cure was first announced, in order to preserve his anonymity. He chose to come forward in 2010. \\"I didn't want to be the only person cured,\\" he said. \\"I wanted to do what I could to make [a cure] possible. My first step was releasing my name and image to the public.\\"  Procedure  Timothy Ray Brown was born in Seattle, Washington, on March 11, 1966, and raised in the area by his single mother, Sharon, who worked for the King County sheriff's department.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/health/timothy-ray-brown-first- patient-cured-of-hiv-dies-at-54.html He journeyed across Europe as a young adult and was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 while studying in Berlin. In 2006, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. On February 7, 2007, he underwent a procedure known as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat leukemia (performed by a team of doctors in Berlin, Germany, including Gero H√ºtter). From 60 matching donors, they selected a [CCR5]-Œî32 homozygous donor, an individual with two genetic copies of a rare variant of a cell surface receptor. This genetic trait confers resistance to HIV infection by blocking attachment of HIV to the cell. Roughly 10% of people of European or Western Asian ancestry have this inherited mutation, but it is rarer in other populations.; The transplant was repeated a year later after a leukemia relapse. Over the three years after the initial transplant, and despite discontinuing antiretroviral therapy, researchers could not detect HIV in Brown's blood or in various biopsies. Levels of HIV-specific antibodies in Timothy Brown's blood also declined, suggesting that functional HIV may have been eliminated from his body. However, scientists studying his case warn that this remission of HIV infection is unusual. Brown, the \\"Berlin patient\\", suffered from serious transplant complications, graft-versus-host disease and leukoencephalopathy, which led researchers to conclude that the procedure should not be performed on others with HIV, even if sufficient numbers of suitable donors could be found. Eleven years later, at the same conference, it was announced that it appeared that a second man had been cured. He was called \\"The London Patient\\", who later identified himself as Adam Castillejo. He also received a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma) but was given weaker immunosuppressive drugs. The selected donor also carried the CCR5-Œî32 mutation. As of 2017, six more people also appear to have been cleared of HIV after getting graft-versus-host disease; only one of them had received CCR5 mutant stem cells, leading researchers to conclude that when a transplant recipient has graft-versus-host disease, the transplanted cells may kill off the host's HIV-infected immune cells.  Later life  In July 2012, Brown announced the formation of the Timothy Ray Brown Foundation in Washington, D.C., a foundation dedicated to fighting HIV/AIDS. In September 2020, Brown revealed the leukemia that prompted his historic treatment had returned in 2019 and that he was terminally ill. Brown entered hospice care in Palm Springs, California, where he later died on September 29, 2020.; ; He was 54 years old.

After the creation of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg the 1815 reestablished estates became a bicameral parliament by 1819. The parliament raised taxes for the counts, dukes and then kings of W√ºrttemberg, and discussed matters of public policy more widely in its later years. Chambers The parliament comprised two chambers since 1819‚Äì1918: * The \\"Kammer der Standesherren\\" from the hereditary nobility or \\"First Chamber\\", and * The \\"Kammer der Abgeordneten\\" from the commoners It was succeeded in 1919-33 by the Landtag of the \\"Free People's State of W√ºrttemberg\\", a part of the Weimar Republic. History Eberhard III and his Council c.1400 As the power of the House of W√ºrttemberg grew, inevitably this involved \\"Diets\\" - councils - meeting with the Count to debate on public policy. The first formal assembly of the Estates, called a Landtag, occurred in Leonberg in 1457 when Count Ulrich V summoned the notables of the towns to counterbalance the knights (Ritterschaft) who attended the Diet. Two years later, the second Diet was called in T√ºbingen when the Count sought to have the majority of his son, Eberhard V, recognized by the Diet and was attended by the town's bailiff and judge as well as officials from 13 other towns. The Estates (Landschaft), the largest political body in the Duchy, were an entity that had existed even before the founding of the Duchy. The prelates were the abbots of the fourteen monasteries of the Duchy, who were generally present at the diets as Ducal appointees after the Reformation. Roughly 30 noblemen, usually Ducal councillors or some other senior officials, also regularly attended. Since the Estates were intended to be the representatives of the Duchy's inhabitants, about 75% of the participants of a Diet were townsfolk, and the peasantry had almost no input. The Estates had no means of imposing their will, and were to a certain extent dependent on the Duke to be effective. At times they were able to convince the Duke to make reforms, such as with the Treaty of T√ºbingen in 1514. During times of minority or absence of the Duke, the Estates had a large decree of control over policy and government, which they effectively lost in times of majority. Duke Ulrich, for example, rarely called Diets. Of the burghers that attended the Landtag of 1520, all of them belonged to the court and council of 44 towns, all of them being Ehrbarkeit (meaning: honourable and reliable). The lack of resistance on their part to Ulrich's strong government shows that the Estates had neither a strong leader and popular support nor a permanent position in the Duchy's constitution and could be easily coerced. The Estates became useful to the Duke for the payment of his debts and for the declaration of the war, and they provided the Duchy's leading inhabitants political power and a forum to debate in. The Treaty of Esslingen in 1492, which stated that 12 members of the Estates could assume rule in times of incompetence, became the basis for following compromises between the Duke and the Estates throughout the 16th centuries. The regency of Duke Ulrich was a time of transition for the Estates, as they authored a government based on collegiate principle, with four nobles acting as regents and two prelates as advisers. The Estates voiced the interests of the towns to the regency, but during the Swabian War this regency became opposed to the wishes of the local burghers, among whom the war was very unpopular. The Estates would continue to vote more men and money to the war, which would end in defeat for the Swabian League. The Estates would continue to exercise their right to approve taxation to the Duchy's frequent wars, a right that would be extremely tested during Ulrich's reign. Late 1700s By the late 1700s the long history of the parliament was remarked on by Edmund Burke. The then-Duke Frederick invited Burke to Stuttgart in the 1790s, but he excused himself on the grounds of old age and infirmity, instead sending Frederick a copy of his Letters on a Regicide Peace.Burke E., The Correspondence of Edmund Burke vol. 10, pp. 191, 318.

Funded by Hugh J. Chisholm, owner of Rumford's paper mill, and designed by Cass Gilbert, the district encompasses a collection of 50 high quality brick duplexes, of similar yet varied construction, which were built in 1901-2 on a series of tree-lined streets, with a small park at the center. As of the district's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, only one of the Gilbert-designed houses had been destroyed. The company divested itself of the houses in the late 1940s, with most being sold to their occupants. Description The Strathglass Park District is located in central Rumford, bounded by Lincoln Avenue, Hancock Street, Maine Avenue, and York Street. The main access to the area is via a stone gate off Maine Avenue, which quickly radiates out into three nearly-parallel streets, which are terminated to the north at Clachan Place. There is a narrow park near the northern end on Lochness Road, the central of the three main roads. All of the houses in this complex are duplexes, built of brick. Stylistically they are essentially variant of the Shingle style, but elements of Queen Anne and Dutch Revival styling are also to be found. The brick was locally manufactured, while the slate for the roofs was brought on from Vermont and Pennsylvania by train. The walls were built with hollow internal spaces, improving their ability to insulate. The interiors were generously sized, a notable contrast to the cramped quarters often found elsewhere in worker housing. The houses were provided with hardwood floors, simplifying cleaning, and with electricity provided for a nominal fee by Chisholm's Rumford Falls Power Company. Hugh J. Chisholm began developing his paper works at Rumford in the 1880s. Having seen the condition and poor quality of worker housing in large industrial cities, he decided to attract workers by providing higher-quality accommodations, hiring New York City architect Cass Gilbert to design the buildings. Chisholm named his development \\"Strathglass\\", after the Strathglass River in Scotland, which ran near his family's ancestral seat. The street names in the district are also Scottish in origin. When the houses were ready for occupancy, the company allotted them to employees recommended by their foremen. It only charged minimal rent, to cover operating expenses and amortization. The company provided snow removal services, lawn mowing, and rubbish removal. The company divested itself of the properties in 1948-49, with most of the houses purchased by their occupants.

This decomposition is theoretically possible and is unique for polynomials with coefficients in any field, but rather strong restrictions on the field of the coefficients are needed to allow the computation of the factorization by means of an algorithm. In practice, algorithms have been designed only for polynomials with coefficients in a finite field, in the field of rationals or in a finitely generated field extension of one of them. All factorization algorithms, including the case of multivariate polynomials over the rational numbers, reduce the problem to this case; see polynomial factorization. It is also used for various applications of finite fields, such as coding theory (cyclic redundancy codes and BCH codes), cryptography (public key cryptography by the means of elliptic curves), and computational number theory. As the reduction of the factorization of multivariate polynomials to that of univariate polynomials does not have any specificity in the case of coefficients in a finite field, only polynomials with one variable are considered in this article. Background Finite field The theory of finite fields, whose origins can be traced back to the works of Gauss and Galois, has played a part in various branches of mathematics. Due to the applicability of the concept in other topics of mathematics and sciences like computer science there has been a resurgence of interest in finite fields and this is partly due to important applications in coding theory and cryptography. Applications of finite fields introduce some of these developments in cryptography, computer algebra and coding theory. A finite field or Galois field is a field with a finite order (number of elements). The order of a finite field is always a prime or a power of prime. For each prime power q = pr, there exists exactly one finite field with q elements, up to isomorphism. This field is denoted GF(q) or Fq. If p is prime, GF(p) is the prime field of order p; it is the field of residue classes modulo p, and its p elements are denoted 0, 1, ..., p‚àí1. Thus a = b in GF(p) means the same as a ‚â° b (mod p). Irreducible polynomials Let F be a finite field. As for general fields, a non-constant polynomial f in F[x] is said to be irreducible over F if it is not the product of two polynomials of positive degree. A polynomial of positive degree that is not irreducible over F is called reducible over F. Irreducible polynomials allow us to construct the finite fields of non-prime order. In fact, for a prime power q, let Fq be the finite field with q elements, unique up to isomorphism. A polynomial f of degree n greater than one, which is irreducible over Fq, defines a field extension of degree n which is isomorphic to the field with qn elements: the elements of this extension are the polynomials of degree lower than n; addition, subtraction and multiplication by an element of Fq are those of the polynomials; the product of two elements is the remainder of the division by f of their product as polynomials; the inverse of an element may be computed by the extended GCD algorithm (see Arithmetic of algebraic extensions). It follows that, to compute in a finite field of non prime order, one needs to generate an irreducible polynomial. For this, the common method is to take a polynomial at random and test it for irreducibility. For sake of efficiency of the multiplication in the field, it is usual to search for polynomials of the shape xn \\\\+ ax + b. Irreducible polynomials over finite fields are also useful for Pseudorandom number generators using feedback shift registers and discrete logarithm over F2n. The number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree n over Fq is the number of aperiodic necklaces, given by Moreau's necklace- counting function Mq(n). The closely related necklace function Nq(n) counts monic polynomials of degree n which are primary (a power of an irreducible); or alternatively irreducible polynomials of all degrees d which divide n.Christophe Reutenauer, Mots circulaires et polynomes irreductibles, Ann. Sci. math Quebec, vol 12, no 2, pp. 275-285  Example  The polynomial P = x4 \\\\+ 1 is irreducible over Q but not over any finite field. * On any field extension of F2, P = (x+1)4. *On every other finite field, at least one of ‚àí1, 2 and ‚àí2 is a square, because the product of two non-squares is a square and so we have #If -1=a^2, then P=(x^2+a)(x^2-a). #If 2=b^2, then P=(x^2+bx+1)(x^2-bx+1). #If -2=c^2, then P=(x^2+cx-1)(x^2-cx-1). Complexity Polynomial factoring algorithms use basic polynomial operations such as products, divisions, gcd, powers of one polynomial modulo another, etc. A multiplication of two polynomials of degree at most n can be done in O(n2) operations in Fq using \\"classical\\" arithmetic, or in O(nlog(n) log(log(n)) ) operations in Fq using \\"fast\\" arithmetic. A Euclidean division (division with remainder) can be performed within the same time bounds. The cost of a polynomial greatest common divisor between two polynomials of degree at most n can be taken as O(n2) operations in Fq using classical methods, or as O(nlog2(n) log(log(n)) ) operations in Fq using fast methods. For polynomials h, g of degree at most n, the exponentiation hq mod g can be done with O(log(q)) polynomial products, using exponentiation by squaring method, that is O(n2log(q)) operations in Fq using classical methods, or O(nlog(q)log(n) log(log(n))) operations in Fq using fast methods. In the algorithms that follow, the complexities are expressed in terms of number of arithmetic operations in Fq, using classical algorithms for the arithmetic of polynomials. Factoring algorithms Many algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite fields include the following three stages: # Square- free factorization # Distinct-degree factorization # Equal-degree factorization An important exception is Berlekamp's algorithm, which combines stages 2 and 3. Berlekamp's algorithm The Berlekamp's algorithm is historically important as being the first factorization algorithm, which works well in practice. However, it contains a loop on the elements of the ground field, which implies that it is practicable only over small finite fields. For a fixed ground field, its time complexity is polynomial, but, for general ground fields, the complexity is exponential in the size of the ground field. Square-free factorization The algorithm determines a square-free factorization for polynomials whose coefficients come from the finite field Fq of order q = pm with p a prime. This algorithm firstly determines the derivative and then computes the gcd of the polynomial and its derivative. If it is not one then the gcd is again divided into the original polynomial, provided that the derivative is not zero (a case that exists for non-constant polynomials defined over finite fields). This algorithm uses the fact that, if the derivative of a polynomial is zero, then it is a polynomial in xp, which is, if the coefficients belong to Fp, the pth power of the polynomial obtained by substituting x by x1/p. If the coefficients do not belong to Fp, the p-th root of a polynomial with zero derivative is obtained by the same substitution on x, completed by applying the inverse of the Frobenius automorphism to the coefficients. This algorithm works also over a field of characteristic zero, with the only difference that it never enters in the blocks of instructions where pth roots are computed. However, in this case, Yun's algorithm is much more efficient because it computes the greatest common divisors of polynomials of lower degrees. A consequence is that, when factoring a polynomial over the integers, the algorithm which follows is not used: one compute first the square-free factorization over the integers, and to factor the resulting polynomials, one chooses a p such that they remain square-free modulo p. Algorithm: SFF (Square-Free Factorization) Input: A monic polynomial f in Fq[x] where q=pm Output: Square-free factorization of f R ‚Üê 1 # Make w be the product (without multiplicity) of all factors of f that have # multiplicity not divisible by p c ‚Üê gcd(f, f‚Ä≤) w ‚Üê f/c # Step 1: Identify all factors in w i‚Üê1 while w ‚â† 1 do y ‚Üê gcd(w, c) fac ‚Üê w/y R ‚Üê R¬∑faci w ‚Üê y; c ‚Üê c/y; i ‚Üê i+1 end while # c is now the product (with multiplicity) of the remaining factors of f # Step 2: Identify all remaining factors using recursion # Note that these are the factors of f that have multiplicity divisible by p if c ‚â† 1 then c ‚Üê c1/p R ‚Üê R¬∑SFF(c)p end if Output(R) The idea is to identify the product of all irreducible factors of f with the same multiplicity. This is done in two steps. The first step uses the formal derivative of f to find all the factors with multiplicity not divisible by p. The second step identifies the remaining factors. As all of the remaining factors have multiplicity divisible by p, meaning they are powers of p, one can simply take the p-th square root and apply recursion. Example of a square-free factorization Let : f = x^{11} + 2 x^9 + 2x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 +1 \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}_3[x], to be factored over the field with three elements. The algorithm computes first : c = \\\\gcd(f, f') = x^9 + 2x^6 + x^3 + 2. Since the derivative is non-zero we have and we enter the while loop. After one loop we have , and with updates , and . The second time through the loop gives , , , with updates , and . The third time through the loop also does not change . For the fourth time through the loop we get , , , with updates , and . Since w = 1, we exit the while loop. Since c ‚â† 1, it must be a perfect cube. The cube root of c, obtained by replacing x3 by x is x2 + 1, and calling the square-free procedure recursively determines that it is square-free. Therefore, cubing it and combining it with the value of R to that point gives the square-free decomposition : f= (x+1)(x^2+1)^3(x+2)^4. Distinct-degree factorization This algorithm splits a square-free polynomial into a product of polynomials whose irreducible factors all have the same degree. Let f ‚àà Fq[x] of degree n be the polynomial to be factored. Algorithm Distinct-degree factorization(DDF) Input: A monic square-free polynomial f ‚àà Fq[x] Output: The set of all pairs (g, d), such that f has an irreducible factor of degree d and g is the product of all monic irreducible factors of f of degree d. Begin i:=1;\\\\qquad S:=\\\\emptyset,\\\\qquad f^*:=f; while \\\\deg f^*\\\\ge 2i do g=\\\\gcd(f^*, x^{q^i}-x) if g ‚â† 1, then S:=S\\\\cup{(g,i)}; f* := f*/g; end if i := i+1; end while; if f* ‚â† 1, then S:= S\\\\cup{(f^*,\\\\deg f^*)}; if S = ‚àÖ then return {(f, 1)} else return S End The correctness of the algorithm is based on the following: > Lemma. For i ‚â• 1 the polynomial :x^{q^i}-x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x] is the > product of all monic irreducible polynomials in Fq[x] whose degree divides > i. At first glance, this is not efficient since it involves computing the GCD of polynomials of a degree which is exponential in the degree of the input polynomial. However :g=\\\\gcd \\\\left (f^*, x^{q^i}-x \\\\right ) may be replaced by :g=\\\\gcd \\\\left (f^*, \\\\left (x^{q^i}-x \\\\mod f^* \\\\right ) \\\\right ). Therefore, we have to compute: :x^{q^i}-x \\\\mod f^*, there are two methods: > Method I. Start from the value of :x^{q^{i-1}}\\\\mod f^* computed at the > preceding step and to compute its q-th power modulo the new f*, using > exponentiation by squaring method. This needs :O \\\\left (\\\\log(q) \\\\deg(f)^2 > \\\\right ) arithmetic operations in Fq at each step, and thus :O \\\\left > (\\\\log(q) \\\\deg(f)^3 \\\\right ) arithmetic operations for the whole algorithm. > Method II. Using the fact that the q-th power is a linear map over Fq we may > compute its matrix with :O \\\\left (\\\\deg(f)^2(\\\\log(q)+\\\\deg(f)) \\\\right ) > operations. Then at each iteration of the loop, compute the product of a > matrix by a vector (with O(deg(f)2) operations). This induces a total number > of operations in Fq which is :O \\\\left (\\\\deg(f)^2 (\\\\log(q)+\\\\deg(f)) \\\\right ). > Thus this second method is more efficient and is usually preferred. > Moreover, the matrix that is computed in this method is used, by most > algorithms, for equal-degree factorization (see below); thus using it for > the distinct-degree factorization saves further computing time. Equal-degree factorization Cantor‚ÄìZassenhaus algorithm In this section, we consider the factorization of a monic squarefree univariate polynomial f, of degree n, over a finite field Fq, which has r ‚â• 2 pairwise distinct irreducible factors f_1,\\\\ldots,f_r each of degree d. We first describe an algorithm by Cantor and Zassenhaus (1981) and then a variant that has a slightly better complexity. Both are probabilistic algorithms whose running time depends on random choices (Las Vegas algorithms), and have a good average running time. In next section we describe an algorithm by Shoup (1990), which is also an equal-degree factorization algorithm, but is deterministic. All these algorithms require an odd order q for the field of coefficients. For more factorization algorithms see e.g. Knuth's book The Art of Computer Programming volume 2. Algorithm Cantor‚ÄìZassenhaus algorithm. Input: A finite field Fq of odd order q. A monic square free polynomial f in Fq[x] of degree n = rd, which has r ‚â• 2 irreducible factors each of degree d Output: The set of monic irreducible factors of f. Factors := {f}; while Size(Factors) < r do, Choose h in Fq[x] with deg(h) < n at random; g:=h^{\\\\frac{q^d-1}{2}}- 1 \\\\pmod f for each u in Factors with deg(u) > d do if gcd(g, u) ‚â† 1 and gcd(g, u) ‚â† u, then Factors:= Factors\\\\,\\\\setminus\\\\, \\\\\\\\{u\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{(\\\\gcd(g,u),u/\\\\gcd(g,u))\\\\\\\\}; endif; endwhile return Factors. The correctness of this algorithm relies on the fact that the ring Fq[x]/f is a direct product of the fields Fq[x]/fi where fi runs on the irreducible factors of f. As all these fields have qd elements, the component of g in any of these fields is zero with probability :\\\\frac{q^d-1}{2q^d} \\\\sim \\\\tfrac{1}{2}. This implies that the polynomial gcd(g, u) is the product of the factors of g for which the component of g is zero. It has been shown that the average number of iterations of the while loop of the algorithm is less than 2.5 \\\\log_2 r, giving an average number of arithmetic operations in Fq which is O(dn^2\\\\log(r)\\\\log(q)). In the typical case where dlog(q) > n, this complexity may be reduced to :O(n^2(\\\\log(r)\\\\log(q)+n)) by choosing h in the kernel of the linear map : v \\\\to v^q-v \\\\pmod f and replacing the instruction :g:=h^{\\\\frac{q^d-1}{2}}- 1 \\\\pmod f by :g:=h^{\\\\frac{q-1}{2}}- 1 \\\\pmod f. The proof of validity is the same as above, replacing the direct product of the fields Fq[x]/fi by the direct product of their subfields with q elements. The complexity is decomposed in O(n^2\\\\log(r)\\\\log(q)) for the algorithm itself, O(n^2(\\\\log(q)+n)) for the computation of the matrix of the linear map (which may be already computed in the square-free factorization) and O(n3) for computing its kernel. It may be noted that this algorithm works also if the factors have not the same degree (in this case the number r of factors, needed for stopping the while loop, is found as the dimension of the kernel). Nevertheless, the complexity is slightly better if square-free factorization is done before using this algorithm (as n may decrease with square-free factorization, this reduces the complexity of the critical steps). Victor Shoup's algorithm Like the algorithms of the preceding section, Victor Shoup's algorithm is an equal-degree factorization algorithm.Victor Shoup, On the deterministic complexity of factoring polynomials over finite fields, Information Processing Letters 33:261-267, 1990 Unlike them, it is a deterministic algorithm. However, it is less efficient, in practice, than the algorithms of preceding section. For Shoup's algorithm, the input is restricted to polynomials over prime fields Fp. The worst case time complexity of Shoup's algorithm has a factor \\\\sqrt{p}. Although exponential, this complexity is much better that previous deterministic algorithms (Berlekamp's algorithm) which have as a factor. However, there are very few polynomials for which the computing time is exponential, and the average time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in d\\\\log(p), where is the degree of the polynomial, and is the number of elements of the ground field. Let g = g1 ... gk be the desired factorization, where the gi are distinct monic irreducible polynomials of degree d. Let n = deg(g) = kd. We consider the ring R = Fq[x]/g and denote also by x the image of x in R. The ring R is the direct product of the fields Ri = Fq[x]/gi, and we denote by pi the natural homomorphism from the R onto Ri. The Galois group of Ri over Fq is cyclic of order d, generated by the field automorphism u ‚Üí up. It follows that the roots of gi in Ri are : p_i(x), p_i(x^q), p_i \\\\left (x^{q^2} \\\\right ), p_i \\\\left (x^{q^{d-1}} \\\\right ). Like in the preceding algorithm, this algorithm uses the same subalgebra B of R as the Berlekamp's algorithm, sometimes called the \\"Berlekamp subagebra\\" and defined as :\\\\begin{align} B &= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha \\\\in R \\\\ : \\\\ p_1(\\\\alpha), \\\\cdots, p_k(\\\\alpha) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}_q \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\{u\\\\in R \\\\ : \\\\ u^q=u\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} A subset S of B is said a separating set if, for every 1 ‚â§ i < j ‚â§ k there exists s ‚àà S such that p_i(s) e p_j(s). In the preceding algorithm, a separating set is constructed by choosing at random the elements of S. In Shoup's algorithm, the separating set is constructed in the following way. Let s in R[Y] be such that :\\\\begin{align} s&=(Y-x) \\\\left (Y-x^q \\\\right )\\\\cdots \\\\left (Y-x^{q^{d-1}} \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=s_0+\\\\cdots+s_{d-1}Y^{d-1}+Y^d \\\\end{align} Then \\\\\\\\{s_0,\\\\dots ,s_{d-1}\\\\\\\\} is a separating set because p_i(s)=g_i for i =1, ..., k (the two monic polynomials have the same roots). As the gi are pairwise distinct, for every pair of distinct indexes (i, j), at least one of the coefficients sh will satisfy p_i(s_h) e p_j(s_h). Having a separating set, Shoup's algorithm proceeds as the last algorithm of the preceding section, simply by replacing the instruction \\"choose at random h in the kernel of the linear map v \\\\to v^q-v \\\\pmod f\\" by \\"choose h + i with h in S and i in {1, ..., k‚àí1}\\". Time complexity As described in previous sections, for the factorization over finite fields, there are randomized algorithms of polynomial time complexity (for example Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm). There are also deterministic algorithms with a polynomial average complexity (for example Shoup's algorithm). The existence of a deterministic algorithm with a polynomial worst-case complexity is still an open problem. Rabin's test of irreducibility Like distinct-degree factorization algorithm, Rabin's algorithm is based on the Lemma stated above. Distinct- degree factorization algorithm tests every d not greater than half the degree of the input polynomial. Rabin's algorithm takes advantage that the factors are not needed for considering fewer d. Otherwise, it is similar to distinct- degree factorization algorithm. It is based on the following fact. Let p1, ..., pk, be all the prime divisors of n, and denote n/p_i=n_i, for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k polynomial f in Fq[x] of degree n is irreducible in Fq[x] if and only if \\\\gcd \\\\left (f,x^{q^{n_i}}-x \\\\right )=1, for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k, and f divides x^{q^n}-x. In fact, if f has a factor of degree not dividing n, then f does not divide x^{q^n}-x; if f has a factor of degree dividing n, then this factor divides at least one of the x^{q^{n_i}}-x. Algorithm Rabin Irreducibility Test Input: A monic polynomial f in Fq[x] of degree n, p1, ..., pk all distinct prime divisors of n. Output: Either \\"f is irreducible\\" or \\"f is reducible\\". for j = 1 to k do n_j=n/p_j; for i = 1 to k do h:=x^{q^{n_i}}-x \\\\bmod f; g := gcd(f, h); if g ‚â† 1, then return \\"f is reducible\\" and STOP; end for; g:= x^{q^{n}}-x \\\\bmod f; if g = 0, then return \\"f is irreducible\\", else return \\"f is reducible\\" The basic idea of this algorithm is to compute x^{q^{n_i}} \\\\bmod f starting from the smallest n_1,\\\\ldots,n_k by repeated squaring or using the Frobenius automorphism, and then to take the correspondent gcd. Using the elementary polynomial arithmetic, the computation of the matrix of the Frobenius automorphism needs O(n^2 (n+\\\\log q)) operations in Fq, the computation of :x^{q^{n_i}}-x \\\\pmod f needs O(n3) further operations, and the algorithm itself needs O(kn2) operations, giving a total of O(n^2 (n+\\\\log q)) operations in Fq. Using fast arithmetic (complexity O(n\\\\log n) for multiplication and division, and O(n(\\\\log n)^2) for GCD computation), the computation of the x^{q^{n_i}}-x \\\\bmod f by repeated squaring is O(n^2\\\\log n\\\\log q), and the algorithm itself is O(kn(\\\\log n)^2), giving a total of O(n^2\\\\log n\\\\log q) operations in Fq.

He was the father of the actor Kiichi Nakai and actress Kie Nakai. Biography Sada was born in Shimogy≈ç-ku, Kyoto, to a merchant class family. After graduating from the 2nd Kyoto Municipal Commercial School, he entered the School of Political Science and Economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. While a student, he roomed at a boarding house owned by the actor Shuji Sano, and on graduation was offered a position at Shochiku Studios in Kanagawa. He also was given his stage name by Shugi Sada. In his debut appearance in 1947, Phoenix, directed by Keisuke Kinoshita, Sada was paired with Kinuyo Tanaka in a love scene. As Tanaka was already a big-name movie star, this was an immediate boost for Sada's career. Later that year, he was selected for the lead role in Kane no Naru Oka (Èêò„ÅÆÈ≥¥„Çã‰∏ò), a movie adaptation of a popular NHK radio drama. Sada's career took off in the 1950s, and he starred in an average of eight to ten movies per year. In 1956, he was awarded the Mainichi Film Award and Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Actor as a professional scout in Anata Kaimasu (I Will Buy You), Masaki Kobayashi's critical study of the institutional ethics of Japanese baseball.

Career √Åbrah√°m had swum competitively for years, when at the age of 12 her form master and later her coach, Tibor Radv√°nyi invited her for a training of Ferencv√°rosi TC. She fell in love with handball immediately, but at first she found it very hard to quit swimming completely and practiced both sports parallelly for a year, before deciding to concentrate fully on handball. For the age of 13 she was already a signed player of Ferencv√°ros, with them she spent four seasons, playing in the youth team. She moved to Budapesti Spartacus SC in 2000 and made her debut in the Hungarian top flight yet in that year. In 2002 Vasas SC offered her a contract she could not refuse and √Åbrah√°m joined the Hungarian record champions. She stayed five years by the red and blues, where she worked together among others with legendary Hungarian handball coach Lajos Mocsai. √Åbrah√°m left the financially struggling Vasas in 2007 and switched to V√°ci NKSE on a two-year deal. In V√°c she got significantly more playing minutes than by any former teams and as a result, she quickly developed into one of the most effective line players in the league. In the summer of 2009 she was close to reach an agreement over the extension of her contract, but when it was made clear that Lucia Uhr√°kov√° is joining the club and therefore √Åbrah√°m may lose her first team place, she rather chose newcomers Veszpr√©m Barab√°s KC and the regular playing time. Her decision was proved to be right, as she scored a career record 128 league goals in the following season and also received her first senior international call-up from Eszter M√°t√©fi in September 2010, in preparation for the GF World Cup. She made it to the traveling squad and debuted in the Hungarian national team on 21 September 2010 against Germany. Three months later, she was selected into the national team for the European Championship as well, however, this spell was cut short as she was replaced by T√≠mea T√≥th after the preliminary round, to widen the options on back positions. The performances shown by √Åbrah√°m have impressed Si√≥fok KC, that secured her services for two years, starting from 1 July 2011. The deal was announced on 5 May 2011, when the ambitious club revealed that they signed √Åbrah√°m along with other two Hungarian internationals, Bernadett B√≥di and Ren√°ta M√∂rtel. In June 2015 she announced her retirement from professional handball. Between 2015-2017 she played for a Hungarian second division team, Pilisv√∂r√∂sv√°ri KSK.

The structure, measuring , was built in the Egyptian Revival style; it is one of the city's few buildings in that style. The building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and erected by general contractor Turner Construction with the help of structural engineer Gunvald Aus. The warehouse was built in 1914‚Äì1915 to a design by Gilbert, and was one of several commercial and industrial buildings along the East River waterfront. The land was originally owned by the Havemeyer family, and leased to Austin, Nichols & Company, at one point the world's largest grocery wholesaler. Austin, Nichols & Company occupied 184 Kent Avenue from 1915 until the mid-1950s, after which the structure was occupied by several manufacturers. Starting in the 2000s, the building was used as a residential structure, and a 2010s renovation added residential condominiums. The warehouse was designated a New York City Landmark in 2005, though the designation was controversial and was overturned by the New York City Council in 2006. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, a less restrictive designation that allowed for the warehouse's redevelopment into condominiums. History  Context  The industrial waterfront of Brooklyn was developed in the 19th century with the construction of major shipping hubs such as Red Hook's Atlantic Basin, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and Industry City. The village of Williamsburg in northern Brooklyn was incorporated on the bank of the East River in 1827, with much of the commercial enterprises located on the waterfront, and after becoming a part of the city of Brooklyn in 1855, Williamsburg grew quickly. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the future warehouse's site was owned by Henry Osborne Havemeyer, founder of Havemeyers & Elder and later the American Sugar Refining Company. The Havemeyer family also operated the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal and the Domino Sugar Refinery just to the north. The grocery wholesalers Austin, Nichols & Company, founded in 1879, had moved their headquarters to several increasingly large spaces before erecting a ten-story building on 55-61 Hudson Street in Tribeca, Manhattan. The company also operated eight smaller locations in Manhattan. In June 1912, Austin, Nichols & Company vice president Harry Balfe announced his intention to consolidate all operations in a single building on the Brooklyn waterfront. The consolidated headquarters would save money and allow easier accessibility from the nearby waterfront and rail terminal, as well as from surrounding streets. In April 1913, the company confirmed that it would build a new headquarters.  Planning and construction  Henry's son Horace Havemeyer commissioned architect Cass Gilbert to design the Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse. Gilbert's office began the design process in late 1912 or early 1913. At the time of the building's construction, the Real Estate Record and Guide magazine stated that previous warehouses had been designed \\"exclusively from the point of view of the engineer\\", so it was unusual to see the plans being prepared by such a renowned architect as Gilbert. There was some urgency in constructing the Brooklyn warehouse, as the Hudson Street building's lease was set to expire in 1914, but nevertheless, Horace insisted that he wanted the building to be of top quality. Some of the site's preexisting structures had been razed by mid-1913 in preparation for the warehouse's construction. Gunvald Aus was hired as a structural engineer and asked to create separate plans dealing with the building's concrete and steel. Austin, Nichols & Company signed a long- term lease agreement with Havemeyer & Elder in November 1913. The contract stipulated that Havemeyer & Elder would build a factory for Austin, Nichols & Company, who would then be the lessee. The same week, the construction contract was given to Turner Construction. At the time, it was predicted that Austin, Nichols & Company would be the first of several wholesale companies to relocate to Williamsburg. The Brooklyn Bureau of Buildings received the plans for the Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse in January 1914 and approved them that April. Concrete construction had started in March 1914, and peaked that June with 672 men employed in the construction process. By September, the building structure was essentially completed. The first operations at the Austin, Nichols & Company warehouse started in January 1915, immediately following the expiration of the Hudson Street building's lease, and the company had completed its relocation to its new headquarters by March. Shortly afterward, contracts were awarded for the construction of a pier on the waterfront. Engineering News reported that \\"the remarkable progress made in its construction is indicative of what can be done in reinforced concrete with proper organization and supervision.\\"  Use as warehouse  North 4th Street side Austin, Nichols & Company continued to grow, with an annual sales income of $40 million by 1920. Its chief activity was the production and export of foods under the Sunbeam Foods brand. At its peak, the company was among the world's largest wholesale grocers. In 1923 Austin, Nichols & Company acquired the large wholesale department of Acker, Merril & Condict. The Federal Trade Commission sued Austin, Nichols & Company, alleging that the acquisition would result in a monopoly, but later dropped the charges. By the mid-1920s, Austin, Nichols & Company suffered from decreasing sales, due to either the lawsuit or to the rise of chain stores. The company had closed its other locations by the late 1920s, selling off its packing subsidiary as well. After Austin, Nichols & Company's other locations closed, the Williamsburg warehouse was used solely for importing and manufacturing products for the company. Starting in the 1930s, after Prohibition in the United States was repealed, the company started handling liquor. Austin, Nichols & Company's lease was renewed in 1934, and a distillery was subsequently installed. After the company's grocery business was sold to Francis H. Leggett & Co. in 1938 or 1939, the company's focus turned exclusively to liquor sales. The Lehigh Warehouse and Transportation Company leased three floors of the building in 1939, but Austin, Nichols & Company continued to occupy the building through the 1950s. Austin, Nichols & Company bought a new structure in Maspeth, Queens, in 1955 and subsequently moved all of their operations there. The warehouse, now known as 184 Kent Avenue, continued to be used by small manufacturers for the next three decades, until 184 Kent Avenue Associates bought the building in 1986. However, by the 1990s, the warehouse was dilapidated. In 1999, the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals granted a variance to allow the renovation of the interior for residential use.  Conversion to residential building  The family of businessman Louis Kestenbaum paid $4 million for 184 Kent Avenue in 2000, with Kestenbaum using part of the building for his company and leasing the remainder. The Kestenbaums rented the building out as studio apartments. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated 184 Kent Avenue as an official city landmark in September 2005. However, the designation was controversial: while twenty-seven people and organizations spoke in favor of landmark designation at the LPC's public hearing on the matter, the Kestenbaums and New York City Council member David Yassky opposed it. The Kestenbaums, who called the structure an \\"eyesore\\", wanted to demolish or significantly modify the building's exterior to create new rental apartments. In November 2005, a majority of City Council members voted to overturn the landmark designation, a rare move, as such revocations had occurred only four times in the previous fourteen years. Council member Simcha Felder said, \\"This is a piece of trash. We should knock it down and put something nice up.\\" Yassky said that \\"it's a nondescript white box of a building\\" that was similar to many other structures on the waterfront. Mayor Michael Bloomberg vetoed the vote in December 2005, but the City Council then voted to override his veto. The renters were evicted in 2006. In early 2006, shortly after the City Council vote, the Kestenbaums sold 184 Kent Avenue to Jason Halpern's JMH Development. Halpern successfully advocated to get the structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which did not restrict the future use of the building as much as a New York City landmark status did. JMH's plans called for the preservation of the exterior, and in December 2008, the company announced that 184 Kent's exterior would be preserved in perpetuity. JMH Development completed the conversion of 184 Kent Avenue into 338 rental apartments in 2010. A for-profit nursery school leased space in the building the next year. Kushner Companies, LIVWRK and Rockpoint Group bought the property in April 2016, intending to turn the rental units into condominium units. Morris Adjmi Architects led the redesign. The former warehouse was rebranded the \\"Austin Nichols House\\" and sales in the building began in 2016. There were several controversies involving 184 Kent Avenue following its conversion to luxury apartments. In 2016, several fires of unexplained origin were started at the building, though no one was injured. Another controversy involved an alleged infestation of rodents. A 2018 lawsuit alleged that Kushner Companies imposed hazardous conditions or otherwise harassed the building's rent-regulated residents in an attempt to get these tenants to move away. Records showed that when Kushner Companies had bought the building in 2015, it had 316 rent-regulated tenants, a number that had declined to 71 when the lawsuit was filed three years later.  Design  Seen from North 4th Street, facing east toward Kent Avenue The Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse was among the earlier buildings to use reinforced concrete on a huge scale. Note: This includes and Accompanying six photos, exterior and interior, from 2006-2007 The building measures and takes up a lot bounded by Kent Avenue on the east, North 3rd Street on the south, the East River on the west, and North 4th Street on the north. The facade rises to a height of on Kent Avenue and on the river, and the building is located on a lot of about . The interior contains of floor area. The structure, built in the Egyptian Revival style, is one of the city's only Egyptian Revival buildings. Its primary construction material is reinforced concrete. Gilbert used the material to increase the building's maximum load weight and to make the structure fireproof.  Facade  The reinforced concrete facade is relatively simplistic and painted in shades of white. The facade is divided into numerous architectural bays, which generally contain groupings of three narrow, slightly-recessed windows on each floor. The western facade is divided into eight bays, all of which contain 3 windows on each floor, except for the southernmost bay, which only contains 2 windows. The eastern facade is divided into nine bays; the northernmost and southernmost bays contain 2 windows while the remaining seven bays contain 3 windows. A similar pattern can be found on the longer northern and southern facades, where most of the bays contain 3 windows, while the end bays and two of the center bays contain 2 windows. Loading docks, now sealed, were located on the western, northern, and southern facades. Little ornamentation was used on the facade. A concrete marquee was located along the western half of the southern facade, above the loading docks. Other features of the facade included a concrete cornice at the top of the building, as well as inward-sloping walls and long uninterrupted wall sections. In a letter to Gilbert dated April 3, 1913, Turner Construction wrote that \\"Concrete, for grocery warehouses, has become almost the standard form of construction throughout the century.\\" Gilbert later said, \\"The nature of the materials dictates the form of all its parts, and assuming that the purpose of the structure is kept in mind, as it should be, this purpose is necessarily expressed in very simple terms.\\" Gilbert chose to place emphasis on the scale of the building's dimensions, saying that a building's \\"principal claim to beauty\\" was derived from its proportion instead of its decoration. Havemeyer had originally asked Gilbert to design the western facade on the riverfront so that it would appear as massive as possible. While the initial proposals featured three different variants of window fenestration, the final plans simplified the design to the extent that the facades were all nearly identical. To save money, the windows' recessions were reduced in depth, but Havemeyer agreed to add rounded mullions between the two or three window panes in each bay. This serves to unite the \\"various levels of fenestration\\" on the building.  Features  North 3rd Street facade, looking west toward the East River Upon its completion, the Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse included four tracks with 68 freight cars, a freight-loading system with several large derricks, and a telegraph service to instantly duplicate orders that were made in the Manhattan sales building. Loading bridges took railcars from car floats, unpowered barges with rail tracks on them. The building was used to process various foodstuffs, import European groceries, as well as manufacture and export dry goods. Material was carried through the factory via a system of chutes, conveyors, and pneumatic tubes. Upon the building's completion in 1915, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle stated that the facilities could accommodate 100 freight cars or 400 lighters a day, and that the number of required freight trucks had been cut from 100 to 35 per day. The warehouse employed 1,500 workers and nearly all of the floor space was being used. Each floor was designed for a different purpose. The basement contained storage rooms for fish and olives, as well as an engine room, while the first floor contained administrative offices and the receiving and shipping divisions. Restrooms, as well as a restaurant and lockers for employees, were located in the mezzanine. The second floor included the exports and olive departments; storage and processing of dry foods, fruit, and canned foods; and the laundry room. The third floor contained the departments of extract & syrups, dried fruit, and small-scale coffee packing. The fourth floor contained more dry food/ingredient storage and large-scale coffee packing. The fifth floor contained storage of dry foods and other non-food products, as well as administrative offices and another employee restaurant. The sixth floor was used for roasting and storing coffee, as well as cutting and grinding spices. The modern-day lobby of 184 Kent Avenue, now a rental building, contains a green wall in its lobby. The interior includes 338 luxury condominium apartments, which range from studio apartments to three-bedroom suites. There is also of rentable commercial space on the first floor. A cafe area and enclosed courtyard are located within the building. Other residential amenities include a musicians' room, a movie room, a riverfront gym, a children's play space, and shared rooftop space.  Impact  National Register of Historic Places plaque In September 1914, Austin, Nichols & Company vice president Balfe said \\"The work of the architects, contractors and all connected with it, has in our opinion simply been wonderful.\\" Likewise, an anonymous writer in the Engineering News stated in November 1914 that the warehouse is \\"a good example of a modern reinforced-concrete building of the concrete type\\" and that Gilbert's design was \\"somewhat unique\\". When the plant was finished in March 1915, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote a sub-headline declaring that the building was a \\"Model of Modern Construction and Efficiency\\". In 1921, as reinforced concrete structures were becoming more popular, Arthur S. McEntee wrote in Architecture magazine, \\"The Austin-Nichols Warehouse, Brooklyn, is an excellent example of the modern adaptation of Egyptian architecture to the present-day requirements of commercialism.\\" The similarities of reinforced-concrete buildings to Egyptian design were also observed by European critics such as Le Corbusier and Wilhelm Worringer. Gilbert went on to design other reinforced-concrete industrial buildings such as the Brooklyn Army Terminal, built in 1919 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and the R. C. Williams Warehouse, built in Chelsea, Manhattan, in 1927. The Brooklyn Army Terminal was also built by Turner Construction and involved more complex infrastructure, including its own rail yard. The later Williams Warehouse, built for a competitor of Austin, Nichols & Company, contained its own direct rail connection. Both the Williams Warehouse and the Brooklyn Army Terminal were built with recessed architectural window bays in their facades. In a 1928 drawing, Gilbert cited the Brooklyn Army Terminal and the Austin, Nichols & Company Warehouse as being among his best works.

Project background In 2007, in Gusev, for the first time in Russia, was established a production of set-top boxes for receiving satellite and terrestrial television broadcasts. Several months later, the General Satellite Corporation started building a plant in Gusev to manufacture household electronics products. The agreement between the mayor of Gusev, Nikolay Tsukanov, and the president of the General Satellite Corporation, Andrey Tkachenko, was signed in 2008, in order to create a modern industrial park in the city. The idea was approved by local authorities and was presented at the International Investment Forum \\"Sochi-2008\\". The decision to locate the new production facilities in Gusev, according to Andrey Tkachenko, was made for two reasons. First, the experience of the first similar plant that had been working in Gusev as part of the special economic zone - the official residence of the Corporation - was successful. Second, the administration of the city took a great interest in cooperation for the creation of Technopolis and in a comprehensive solution to the problem of the territory development. In 2009, two plants, JSC NPO Digital Television Systems (DTS) and Prankor, Ltd., were run - their products have no analogues in Russia. The plants produce set-top boxes for receiving the satellite and terrestrial TV broadcasts, and the production conveyor ensures a complete production cycle: starting with the motherboard and all the way up to the case and the satellite antennas as well. Formerly, most of these devices in the Russian market were imported, usually from China. Project mission To create in Gusev a new effective pole for innovative development of Russia. Project objectives * comprehensive economic development of Gusev, improving its social infrastructure, creating conditions for the development of innovative activity in the city and transformation of Gusev into a Technopolis toward 2013. * establishing in Gusev a radio-electronics industry cluster. The Project envisages the construction of 5 high-tech industries, 2 of which are already running. * testing an innovative model of small cities development in Russia, which can be applied to revive other towns in the country, according to the Project results. Investments *Total investments in the Project (2008‚Äì2013): 5 billion rubles. * Until the February 2010, invested: 1,5 billion rubles. Technopolis area 400 hectares. Over 3000 jobs. Project milestones * 2009: ‚Äî Opening the Plant for the household radio-electronics products' manufacture; ‚Äî Commissioning the Plant for manufacturing metal and plastic products by stamping. * 2010: ‚Äî Opening a Factory for the production of corrugated cardboard and packaging; ‚Äî Commissioning the House-Building Plant. * 2011: ‚Äî Erection of the first stage of the cottage settlement in Gusev; ‚Äî Commissioning the social and business center of Technopolis. * 2012: ‚Äî Inaugurating a microelectronics Factory (microprocessors assembly and casing); ‚Äî Construction of the second stage of the cottage settlement in Gusev; ‚Äî Integrated land improvement and social infrastructure construction; ‚Äî Opening a branch of SPSU, organization of educational and research process at the University's Education and Research Complex. * 2013: ‚Äî Inaugurating a printed circuit board producing Plant; ‚Äî Setting on foot a Customs Warehouse. The anticipated outcomes of the Project Development of new industries in Gusev * Household radio- electronics manufacturing Plant * Television antennas and case manufacturing Plant * Corrugated cardboard and packaging producing Factory * House-Building Plant * Microelectronics Plant. Creation of Educational and Scientific Research Center * Design Bureau * University Educational and Scientific Park (UESP) * Venture Fund for supporting and implementing research and development accomplished both within Technopolis and outside of it * Business Incubator ‚Äì Industrial Park (BII). Social and economics outcomes for the city and region * increase the level and quality of life for the city and district residents; * strengthening innovation and business activity in the Kaliningrad region; * creating in Gusev a new Kaliningrad region growth pole. National-scale results * formation of a modern radio-electronics industry cluster that can be an engine of innovation development of the branch; * testing an innovative model of development of small cities in Russia according to the example set by Gusev; * formation of a complex enterprise that can provide for the mobile digitalization of Russian TV; * creating an innovative growth pole and attracting Russian and foreign investments into domestic high-tech industry; * formation of Russia's image as a technologically advanced country. Criticism of the Project The market observers, in general, welcomed the General Satellite initiative and the investment prospects. \\"Industrial parks development, on one hand, is very expensive, and on the other ‚Äì it is extremely knowledge-intensive‚Äù, - Pavel Zhavoronkov, an analyst at the investment firm Sovlink, said, while making a comment on the General Satellite Corporation plans. - ‚ÄúBased on the payroll size, 1500 to 2400 million rubles will be spent till the year 2011. The average payroll should be 1.95 billion, which will \\"swallow\\" almost 40% of the capital raised. The establishment of such an Industrial Park is possible only if stringent standards and practices are observed in the construction and cash flow. From the perspective of the country, it is an invaluable contribution to the development and science.\\" While implementing such projects, developers are often faced with many difficulties, of which the most serious are legislation \\"gaps\\" and official circumlocution6. In this case, the local officials led by Georgi Boos ‚Äì the Kaliningrad region Governor ‚Äì proved to be a considerable support for the Project.

It was recorded by various musicians from that label's roster, including Was (Not Was), August Darnell, Material, Suicide, Cristina, and The Waitresses, all performing original seasonal songs. The album was reissued in 1982, as a \\"Special Edition\\", with a revised track listing. In 2004, a further revised version was issued on CD, as ZE Xmas Record Reloaded 2004. The 2004 version was remastered and re-released again in 2016 under its original title and artwork, with one of the 1982 \\"Special Edition\\" songs restored. The record has been described as \\"the first-ever alternative Christmas album\\". ZE Records founder Michel Esteban has described it as an \\"improbable and delicious offering.\\" It is widely, but unofficially, known as the \\"ZE Christmas Album\\". It featured the first release of The Waitresses' \\"Christmas Wrapping\\", a song later frequently included on numerous seasonal compilations, particularly in the UK, where it reached the singles chart in December 1982. Concept and recording By 1981, ZE Records, a New York-based record label established by Michael Zilkha and Michel Esteban, had achieved some commercial success and a growing critical reputation. For the 2004 reissue of the album, Esteban gave the following background explanation in his liner notes: Each of the bands on the label was asked to come up with a Christmas song. Chris Butler, founder and songwriter of The Waitresses, commented in a later interview: Track listing Original 1981 LP The original album was initially released in the UK on white vinyl, and issued on ZE but with the distributor Island Records catalogue number ILPS 7017. Later copies used black vinyl.Record Collector magazine, Rare Record Price Guide 2010, , p.1355 The track by Material, with singer Nona Hendryx, was recorded at the same sessions that produced the band's single \\"Bustin' Out\\". The recording by Cristina ‚Äì Zilkha's girlfriend and later wife ‚Äì was her first to be produced by the duo Was (Not Was), who also contributed their own track to the album. The August Darnell track, \\"Christmas On Riverside Drive\\", was later credited to Darnell's group, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and was included on expanded reissues of their album Tropical Gangsters. The sleeve design was by Tony Wright, the art director of Island Records. The front cover showed stylised figures of some of the musicians, including Darnell, Hendryx, and Alan Vega, and a snowman, skating around a Christmas tree in the snow, and the back cover showed snow falling in a New York street scene at night. Revised 1982 \\"Special Edition\\" LP For the revised 1982 version of the album, released as Island ILPS 7022, the tracks by Alan Vega and Charl√©lie Couture were replaced by tracks by The Three Courgettes ‚Äì a British band featuring singer Barb Jungr, who recorded the song in London ‚Äì and James White (later known as James Chance). The James White track has been described as a \\"droll, blasphemous, nearly tuneless piece of skronk\\". According to another source: The running order of the album was completely revised, and a radically shortened and remixed version of the Material track was used. The sleeve design was maintained but with an additional red star stating \\"Special 1982 Edition\\". At the same time as the album was re-released in 1982, \\"Christmas Wrapping\\" by The Waitresses was issued as a single (Island WIP6821), and reached # 45 on the UK singles chart. Reissue on CD, 2004 After ZE Records closed in 1984, most of the original recordings were unavailable for many years although some, including \\"Christmas Wrapping\\", appeared on other compilations. The CD version of the album, produced by Esteban and issued on the revived ZE label in 2004, features all the tracks on the original 1981 album, except that the Material track is the shorter version used on the 1982 album. It also contains the James White track contained on the 1982 album, but not the track by The Three Courgettes. In addition, the CD contains three further tracks, two of them, by Lisi and Miss OD (also known as Oph√©lie Doll) newly recorded by Esteban in France; and the remaining track, by Portuguese-born singer Lio with her sister, actress Helena Noguerra, and transsexual icon Marie France, recorded in 1988 for a French TV show. \\"Bells of Christmas\\", recorded by Miss OD, was a song originally recorded by The Beach Boys, and Esteban dedicated the album to Brian Wilson. The running order of the album was again completely different from that on either the 1981 or 1982 vinyl LPs, and a new sleeve design was used. Reissue on CD, 2016 Michel Esteban remastered and re-released the album again on ZE on November 20, 2016, on CD in a replica LP sleeve with the original artwork and a label replicating the white vinyl LP, as well as MP3 and FLAC downloads with a digital booklet (the latter of which is also downloadable for free on the ZE web site). Unlike the 2004 Reloaded edition, this one includes the 3 Courgettes song at the end of the album. A couple of the song titles were also slightly altered.

Battle Different portions of an Austrian army, which were scouting for forces of the Ottoman Empire, fired on one another by mistake, causing self-inflicted casualties. The battle took place on the night of 21‚Äì22 September 1788. The Ottomans took advantage and captured the city of Kar√°nsebes (now Caransebe»ô, Romania): The army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town. The army's vanguard, a contingent of hussars, crossed the Timi»ô River to scout for the presence of the Ottoman army. There was no sign of the Ottoman forces, but the hussars came across a group of Romani people, who offered to sell schnapps to the weary soldiers. The cavalrymen bought the schnapps and started to drink. Soon afterwards, some infantry crossed the river. When they saw the party going on, the infantrymen demanded alcohol for themselves. The hussars refused to give them any of the schnapps and, still drunk, set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels. A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot.\\"Zur Kriegsgeschichte\\" (On the history of the war), Real Zeitung (Erlangen, Bavaria, (Germany)), 7 October 1788, no. 80, pp. 723‚Äì729 ; see especially pp. 726‚Äì728.\\"VI.

Immediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another. During the conflict, some infantry began shouting, \\"Turci! Turci!\\" (\\"Turks! Turks!\\"). The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army's attack was imminent. Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Austrians, Serbs, Croats, and Italians from Lombardy, as well as other minorities, many of whom could not understand one another. While it is not clear which one of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled. The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted, \\"Halt! Halt!\\" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as \\"Allah! Allah!\\".\\"Zur Kriegsgeschichte\\" (On the history of the war), Real Zeitung (Erlangen, Bavaria, (Germany)), 7 October 1788, no. 80, pp. 723‚Äì729 ; see especially pp. 726‚Äì728.\\"III.

As the hussars fled through the camps, a corps commander, General of Artillery Colloredo, thought that it was a cavalry charge by the Ottoman army and ordered artillery fire. Meanwhile, the entire camp awoke to the sound of battle; rather than waiting to see what the situation was, everyone fled. The troops fired at every shadow, thinking the Ottomans were everywhere; in reality, they were shooting fellow Austrian soldiers. The incident escalated to the point where the whole army retreated from the imaginary enemy, and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was pushed off his horse into a small creek. Two days later, the Ottoman army arrived. They discovered dead and wounded soldiers and easily took Kar√°nsebes.  Losses  In determining losses, accounts of this incident do not distinguish between losses that were caused by friendly fire, those that were caused by the Turks, and those that resulted from pillaging by the Austrians or by the local Wallachians. One account states that the Austrian rear guard suffered 150 casualties.(Real Zeitung, 1788), p. 728. Another account states that in the days following the incident, 1,200 wounded men were taken to the fortress at Arad, 60 km (37 miles) north of Timi»ôoara.(Politisches Journal, 1788), p. 1059. Another source claims that 538 men, 24 j√§ger, and one officer went missing after the incident, but most returned to duty. Also lost were 3 cannons and the chest containing the army's payroll.(Gramm, 2008), p. 83. In his account of the incident, Paul Bernard, author of a 1968 biography of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, claimed that the friendly fire incident caused 10,000 casualties;Bernard, Paul, Joseph II (New York, New York: Twayne, 1968), p. 137. however, he provided no source for this claim.(Mayer, 1997), p. 61 footnote 65. Neither the Austrian war archives' records nor those who have examined them corroborate Bernard's claim.There is no mention of 10,000 casualties in (Oestreichische milit√§rische Zeitschrift, 1831), (Criste, 1904), (Mayer, 1997), or (Gramm, 2008). Bernard's account of the war has been dismissed as inaccurate.Szabo, Franz A., \\"Paul Kaunitz and the Hungarian Diet of 1790‚Äì91,\\" in: Kastner, Georg; Mindler- Steiner, Ursala; Wohnout, Helmut, ed.s, Auf der Suche nach Identit√§t: Festschrift f√ºr Dieter Anton Binder (Vienna, Austria: Lit Verlag, 2015), p. 284, endnote 33: \\"Paul P.

Nevertheless, Bernard's claim of 10,000 casualties was repeated by Geoffrey Regan.Regan, Geoffrey, The Brassey's Book of Military Blunders (Washington, DC: Brassey's, 2000), p. 48. Although tens of thousands of casualties occurred within the Austrians' ranks during their 1787 campaign against the Turks, the vast majority of the casualties were the result of disease, particularly malaria and dysentery.In \\"Geschichte des Feldzugs 1788 der k.k.

Second part.], Oestreichische milit√§rische Zeitschrift (in German), 3: 3‚Äì18 (1831), there are monthly reports of the number of men on sick leave during the campaign: by the end of May, 55 officers and 5,306 non- commissioned officers and enlisted men had been stricken with malaria (German: Wechselfieber) (see p. 7); by the end of June, 12,000 men had developed malaria or dysentery (German: Ruhr) (see p. 12); by the end of July, 20,000 men had been stricken with dysentery (see p. 18). Published sources Contemporary sources that attest to the incident include: * \\"Zur Kriegsgeschichte\\" (On the history of the war), Real Zeitung (Erlangen, Bavaria, (Germany)), 7 October 1788, no. 80, pp. 723‚Äì729 ; see especially pp. 726‚Äì728.From pp. 726‚Äì728 of: \\"Zur Kriegsgeschichte,\\" Real Zeitung (Erlangen, (Germany)), 7 October 1788, no. 80, starting at: \\" ‚Äî Seit vorgestern, sagt ein Schreiben aus Temeswar von 25sten Sept., ‚Ä¶ \\" : \\"Since the day before yesterday, says a letter from Timi»ôoara of the 25th of September, the office of supplies, the paymaster, the field war office, and the field post office have been here; headquarters is 3 hours away. The pavement has already been dug up in various areas, and all preparations made to be able to withstand a siege. Whether one believes with reason that the Grand Vizier is too clever to still undertake in this season the besieging of a place like Timi»ôoara, yet the confusion and fear is very great because incidents occur which one would have regarded as impossible a little while ago. On the 21st during the night, the following scene occurred near Lugoj. In and nearby this place stood the baggage and about 1,000 wagons. Around midnight came many Wallachians with loud shouts: \\"The Turks! The Turks!\\" Frightened by this false alarm, all awoke with a start and thought to save themselves. A few houses that were set afire by just these Wallachians multiplied the fear. Thus many hundreds of wagons, riders, and pedestrians [continued onto p. 727] caused in their confusion a risk of death with every step. Now the Wallachians began to rob, there was shooting, and this was the signal for the Turks, who attacked the [baggage] train. On our way in the darkness, our men came upon another regiment. The officers of the first cried: \\"Halt! Halt!\\" Those of the second believed that they'd heard the Turkish call, \\"Allah!\\", fired, and shot many of their comrades. During this night, it was supposed that Emperor Joseph was in danger of being captured by the enemy. Finally the Hungarian grenadiers and cavalry regiments were compelled to repel the enemy. The Prince of W√ºrtemberg received a contusion from a cuirassier's horse that came rushing down from a height. On the 22nd, 8 Wallachians were hanged. The Emperor's adjutant, Prince Philipp von Liechtenstein, brother of reigning prince, shall be taken prisoner. General Brechainville must withdraw as far as Denta. General Aspremont was dismissed, and Major Orelly transferred to a garrison regiment. The Turks advance ever farther; the Grand Vizier shall have destroyed the bridges on which he passed over the Danube, so that his Asiatics cannot run away. Thus our private report from the Banat! In the court report from the field camp of the main army near Sacu on the 23rd of the month, it reads: On the 21st the army left its camp near Ilova in 2 columns [and headed] for Caransebe»ô. When the rear guard of the 2nd column fell back, there arose a false alarm, and when the pickets fired, such confusion gripped the army's baggage train that had been sent ahead towards Caransebe»ô that the teamsters, packers, and grooms hurriedly fled, the lashings of the pack horses slipped off, loads and baggage were thrown, and other such disorder began. Because some wagons had become lost [and were] out of sight of the column, not all of the lost baggage could be collected, but order was re-established and the march resumed. Meanwhile, the other column had traveled as far as Caransebe»ô in complete order, and its rear guard had held off the advancing enemy with every step. The cavalry, supported by the infantry, often attacked [the enemy] and always drove it back with losses. Near Caransebe»ô the Turks attacked a hussar regiment, and as this [regiment] fell back, [the Turks] reached Caransebe»ô. Their infantry crept up to the first houses, [continued onto p. 728] began to set them afire, but our infantry drove them [back], whereupon the Turks returned to Armeni»ô. Our losses among the rear guard may amount to 150 men, dead and wounded. The enemy's losses are considerable. Our cavalry captured 3 banners. On the 22nd, our army moved into camp near Sacu, without seeing the enemy.\\" (in German) * \\"Aus dem Feldlager der Hauptarmee, bey Sakul, vom 23.

The Austrian army had encamped in a valley between Ilova and Slatina-Timi»ô, where they were subject to attack, from the surrounding hills and mountains, by the Turks, who were armed with small arms and light artillery and who were aided by the Wallachians. From p. 1055: \\"The Wallachians were the most brutal helpers of the Turks, and showed them all of the paths, which they knew exactly, over the mountains, and initiated all sorts of treachery.\\" In response to these constant attacks, the Austrians withdrew northwards, along the valley towards Caransebe»ô, while they were repeatedly attacked by the Turks. From pp. 1058‚Äì1059: \\"Of this retreat one has read many private letters in the Austrian newspapers, according to all of them [the retreat] was accompanied by many adversities and losses among the Emperor's army. Especially the rapacious Wallachians, who roamed around and did more damage than the Turks themselves, caused a great confusion and calamity on the 21st of September at Lugoj, where the vanguard and the baggage of the army were. They spread, before the break of day, the cry [that] the Turks were there. All who were in Lugoj thought, in the confusion, of nothing [other] than saving themselves ; the roads were filled with several thousand wagons, cavalrymen, and pedestrians ; each shoved the others in order to get away, and the confusion was so great that many people lost their lives. In this confusion and darkness, two imperial regiments collided with each other, regarded each other as Turks, and shot at each other for a while, so that many were killed and wounded among each party. Meanwhile, the Turks actually attacked, but withdrew, satisfied with the great booty that was lost in the confusion. In all, much went missing during this retreat, of which one has no entirely reliable news. Among other things [that were lost] are claimed 15 cannons, and 64 munitions wagons, besides a large part of the baggage, the regiments' treasure chest [i.e., chest containing the soldiers' pay], and so forth. To the fortress at Arad 1,200 wounded soldiers were brought in those days.\\" (in German) * \\"Foreign Intelligence,\\" The European Magazine and London Review, 14 : 308 (October 1788).From p. 308 of: \\"Foreign Intelligence,\\" The European Magazine and London Review, 14 : 308 (October 1788): \\"Vienna, Oct. 4. The last accounts received here from the Imperial army mention, that in their march for Illova [i.e., Ilova], in the evening of the 21st of September, two columns crossing each other in the dark, and a false alarm of the approach of the enemy, gave rise to a confusion, in which some corps of Austrian infantry fired at each other, and the bat men and servants were struck with such panic, that, throwing off the loads from their horses, and out of the carriages, they fled precipitately, so that many officers lost their baggage, and some regiments their field equipage. The Turks harassed the rear guard, but were vigorously repulsed in the attacks they made upon it, and obliged to abandon three of their standards. A smart skirmish however took place near Caransebe»ô, in which the Austrians had 150 men killed and wounded; and some houses in that town were burnt by the Turks. The Emperor continued his march on the 23rd to Zakul [i.e., Sacu], and on the 24th to Lugosch [i.e., Lugoj], where he remained on the 28th, the heavy baggage being sent on to Temeswar [i.e., Timi»ôoara], without meeting any further interruption from the enemy. On the day preceding the arrival of the army at Caransebe»ô, a considerable number of lawless Wallachians inhabiting the neighborhood of Lugosch, ran into the town, spreading a false alarm that the enemy were close at their heels. This had the effect they wished for. The army baggage (then at Lugosch) was immediately sent off to Temeswar, when the Wallachians proceeded to pillage whatever they found unguarded, and even many of the houses. A military force however soon put an end to these enormities, and several of the plunderers were taken, and immediately broken on the wheel.\\" * \\"Du Quartier-G√©n√©ral de l‚ÄôArm√©e principale, pr√®s de Sakul, le 23.

History of the 1788 campaign of the imperial main army against the Turks (continuation)), Oestreichische Milit√§rische Zeitschrift (Austrian military journal), 4 : 58‚Äì70 (1831): \\"In the evening of 20 September, after the evening gun [sounded], the chevals de frise [i.e., obstacles against cavalry] were hoisted, the tents dismantled, the reserve artillery harnessed, and [the army] marched in two lines towards Caransebe»ô. To them were joined the wagons with the chevals de frise, horses with the tents, and the pack horses. In front, hussars and j√§gers rode in a line in order to prevent deserters from informing the enemy about the time of the army's departure. A detachment of hussars with an officer were further assigned, after the army's departure, to maintain the campfires in order to conceal the march from the enemy for as long as possible. Several hours before midnight, the infantry of the main army marched in two columns, each of 6 battalions. Behind the first of the two columns marched, as a rear guard, a corps which was composed of 7 grenadier battalions and 4 fusilier battalions, then 30 squadrons, and which was under the command of the Cavalry General Count Kinsky. The corps of the Lieutenant Field Marshal Count Wartensleben, which now bore the name of \\"reserve corps\\" and consisted of 12 battalions and 12 squadrons, followed as a rear guard of the second column. [p. 59] Since the departures from the camp of the reserve corps were arduous on account of the steepness of the Gornitz mountains, its march thus had to occur more slowly, and [since] it had encamped farthest forward, it was thus ordered that the two infantry columns should halt in column as soon as the [columns'] heads reached the Ilova stream, until the two rear guards had joined [them], whereupon all would then march and continue towards Caransebe»ô in two lines beside each other. Initially the march departed in best order during the most beautiful moonlit night. The two infantry columns halted at the right time; the reserve corps had already arrived by road at the Slatina post office; only the small detachments which were used for the chains [Note: each \\"chain\\" was formed by a detachment of cavalry riding in a single row abreast in front of each infantry column and in single file along both sides of each column; the purpose of the \\"chain\\" was to prevent soldiers from defecting to the Turks and betraying the army's movement], were still back at the Slatina bridge, and the two infantry columns had just resumed marching, when all at once an event, trivial in itself, occurred which transformed the most beautiful moonlit night into a night of terror and confusion, and [which] brought the horrors of devastation to many of the most beautiful villages and places. Despite the strictest orders, the desire to make a profit caused a Wallachian farmer to haul brandy with a two-horse wagon onto the bridge, over which the remaining hussars had to march. Some of these hussars had [some brandy] poured [for them], and had perhaps too much of the goods, when several soldiers of the free corps likewise stepped forward and demanded their share. The hussars, for whom this wasn't opportune, began a brawl with them, and [p. 60] chased them from there. These [free corps soldiers], prompted by vindictiveness, natural to common people [but] neglecting any other consideration, moved back a stretch, fired their guns at the hussars, and shouted repeatedly and loudly, \\"Turks! Turks!\\" Upon this cry and shooting, the hussars also fired their guns and raced with hanging reins over the bridge between the two hussar divisions waiting there, to which they belonged. This haste and the cry \\"Turks, Turks\\", which they let resound, brought these two divisions into disorder; so that the units themselves began to fire on each other, and rode forwards towards the columns. The cry of \\"Halt! Halt!\\" by which one wanted to bring these hussars to a standstill, was taken for the battle cry of the Turks, \\"Allah! Allah!\\", and multiplied the confusion, because it seemed to give confirmation that the Turks were in the vicinity. This disorder would soon have dispersed, if, unfortunately (against given orders) a group of grooms with teams of draft and pack horses, which should have been far ahead, had not halted between the columns of infantry; which now, seized by panic-fueled fears, fled in the greatest haste and amid continuous uproar. The two columns of infantry rested on the road. Many of the men had taken off their knapsacks and were sleeping. These [soldiers] believed ‚Äì awakened by the shooting from this first [chance to] sleep ‚Äì that they saw the enemy among the noises of the grooms and packers racing by them, [and] [p. 61] some of them fired their guns at the supposed enemy, [while] some escaped into the adjoining fields. But here order was soon restored through the efforts of Field Marshal Lacy and the other generals and staff officers, while the two corps (the Kinsky and reserve corps) which formed the rear guards had remained, en masse, calm on the road and had formed battle lines towards the commotion. As soon as people were convinced that no enemy was pursuing the column so far, the march to Caransebe»ô continued, where the first units arrived in the morning. His Majesty the Emperor found himself, at the beginning of the march, among the wagons of the marching column on the left, in the vicinity of Wartensleben's battalion. So as the shooting and alarm arose, he mounted his horse and tried to maintain order by shouting and drawing attention to his person. However, since in the first moments no one heeded him, bullets crossed from all sides, so the Emperor rode towards Caransebe»ô ‚Äì despite the belief that the Turks had broken through the lines of the columns ‚Äì accompanied by only a single person, since his entourage had lost sight of him amid the turmoil. In order to defend it against the advancing enemy, [the Emperor] had cannons brought up to the double bridge which was located an hour away from Caransebe»ô [and which] had been built across the stream coming from the village of Bolva»ôni»õa, where this [stream] crosses the road. Then he went to Caransebe»ô, where Field Marshal Lacy [p. 62] and General of Artillery Colloredo soon followed, in order to report to His Majesty about the actual course of events of the incident, and [to inform him] that order had been restored among the troops. During that night His Royal Highness the Archduke Franz was on horseback with the corps of Cavalry General Count Kinsky, which was positioned behind the right-hand column of infantry. Immediately upon the raising of the alarm and the skirmishing, Count Kinsky had the first battalion of Nadasdy close a square around the prince, for the safety of his person, where he remained on the road until order was restored. The battalion later received a present of 150 ducats from His Majesty the Emperor. We have seen that the brief disorder, which had prevailed among the troops largely as a result of surprise, was soon dispelled by the presence of mind of generals and officers. However, this disorder was not the greatest evil which arose from that incident on the bridge at Slatina. If older, veteran troops who were accustomed to order and discipline could be excited by the fear of surprise for [some] moments, then it's easy to estimate what its spread among the advancing grooms and packers, horses carrying tents and packs, and the luggage must have caused in the way of trouble. Here the disorder and confusion knew no bounds. The drivers of the horses carrying packs, tents, and cooking gear cut off the girdles of the saddles, threw the loads in the middle of the road, mounted the horses bareback, and raced amid the cry, \\"The Turks are here! Save yourself! All is lost!\\" [p. 63] ‚Äì in long gallops from there. The teamsters of the reserve artillery, like the other haulers, cut the traces [i.e., harnesses], and likewise hurried away. The individual soldiers around there fired their guns here and there, without knowing why or at whom, and thereby increased the fear and commotion among the baggage train. Soon the entire road was covered with people running around as if [they were] crazy ‚Äì on foot, on horseback, on wagons ‚Äì yelling, fleeing, weeping ‚Äì throwing anything that got in their way. It [i.e., the road] was sown with saddles, saddle bags, tents, cauldrons, gear, trunks, etc. The disorder in this baggage train was limitless, beyond all words, beyond all description. However, the consequences of this for the local residents of this stretch [of road] were even sadder. That mob of servants, once [set] in motion, couldn't be stopped by anything, and when they finally believed themselves to be safe, they used their momentary independence to rob and plunder, which then spread to all who encountered them. The first victim of it was the beautiful town of Caransebe»ô. From here the blind uproar, as a forerunner of the real disorder, worked its way to Lugoj, which, like all of the little places along the road, [having been] abandoned by its residents, fell as easy booty into the hands of the unbridled [mob]. ‚Äì But let us turn our view from these horrors, after which the harshest punishments followed very soon, without always reaching the truly guilty and without making good again the smallest part of the ruin that this night brought to so many innocents. Let us return [p. 64] to the troops who had long been completely restored to order and who were on the march. It was quite certain that the reserve corps should have served as the rear guard of the entire army. However, during the night, this corps probably had started moving earlier after the disorder, and during the night [it] had moved ahead of the corps of Cavalry General Count Kinsky, to whom the duty of rear guard now fell. The Turks had then been alerted by the shooting ‚Äì for there had also occurred some cannon shots ‚Äì and [by] the tumult, and [so the Turks] followed [the Austrian army] closely with numerous cavalry as soon as [the Turks] had convinced themselves of the [Austrian] army's retreat. By the gray dawn [the Turks] had reached, near the pass of Caransebe»ô, the cavalry of Cavalry General Count Kinsky and attacked repeatedly, but [the Turks] were repeatedly driven back with losses. The two infantry columns as well as the reserve corps had already passed the pass. The former [i.e., the infantry columns] already stood behind the town on the heights there encamped in two squares. In order to give time to the cavalry of his corps to break through the pass, General Kinsky had his 4 fusilier battalions form squares in front of them, which, with their well directed cannon and small arms fire and their awe-inspiring resolve, held back the enemy cavalry. The grenadiers passed first through the narrow pass; the cavalry followed them. However, after going through [the pass], [the cavalry] ‚Äì instead going down that path which would have led them to the camp appointed for them (without making contact with the town) ‚Äì followed the grenadiers [p. 65], whereby a sort of confusion arose. This made it possible for the Turks to gain time to spread around the town from both sides and to use the houses and garden walls in order to make their fire more steady. Yet the fire from the squares behind the town soon drove them from their hide-outs. The cavalry strongly repelled the attacks of the spahis [i.e., Turkish cavalry], and reached, without great loss, their camp on the other side of the Timi»ô [river]. The Turks left many dead and wounded on the site and 2 large banners in our hands. However, the town of Caransebe»ô went up in flames as a result of the battle and in large part fell to ashes. [The remainder of] the night passed quietly.\\" (in German) * Criste, Oskar, Kriege unter Kaiser Josef II.

The planning provided that the entire baggage train, baggage and munitions reserves be sent to the front, in stages during the march. At nightfall, the tents were dismantled and the chevals de frise hauled in, loaded onto wagons, and likewise sent away. In front, a line of j√§gers and hussars rode in order to prevent desertions. In the camps, troops were left, who maintained campfires in order to conceal the Austrians' departure from the Turks. As soon as the wagons had enough of a head start, the infantry, in two columns of six battalions each, set into motion. The columns were so deployed that they could form squares if necessary. The left column marched on the main road; the right, parallel and not too far from it. The rearguard behind the left-hand column was composed of eleven battalions and twelve squadrons under lieutenant field marshal Wartensleben; behind the right-hand column, eleven battalions and thirty squadrons under Cavalry General Kinsky. Lacy and his staff rode with the left-hand column. The retreat of the Austrians led to the notorious \\"Battle of Caransebe»ô\\", which gained Emperor Joseph an entry in the book of military blunders. [Here Gramm adds in footnote 303: \\"Regan, Military Blunders, pp. 48 ff. Here it's not a matter of a profound work ; the account is, just like that contained in the above-named work about Mack, verifiable only in broad outline. Both accounts, however, are of interest because the present awareness of the events is reflected in them.\\"] The infantry left at about nine o'clock. Cavalry General Kinsky was ordered only to depart with his rear guard when Wartensleben, whose unit had advanced farther, was abreast of Kinsky's rearguard, which was marching behind the left column. The maneuver succeeded in the best order ; only the cavalry guards standing on the other side of the Timi»ô [river] still had to catch up over the bridge. They consisted of some men of the Wallachian freikorps and four squadrons, which were detailed for backup, two each of W√ºrttemberg dragoons and of Graeve hussars. In order to let the rear guard close up and restore the march order, Lacy had the column halt. With that, some soldiers laid down their knapsacks, [and] the soldiers laid down to sleep. When the hussars arrived at the bridge, they came upon a Wallachian farmer there, [p. 83] who had loaded his cart with brandy. The hussars served themselves generously, but [they] didn't let the infantry of the freikorps, who were gradually arriving at the bridge, have a share. Thereupon the Wallachians began to shoot at the hussars and to cry \\"Turks, Turks\\" at the same time. The already rather drunk cavalrymen threw themselves on their horses and galloped off, taking up the cry of \\"Turks, Turks\\". That unleashed a mass panic. The shooting and the wild shouts gave the impression to the soldiers who were startled from their sleep, that the Turks were actually attacking. A wild shoot-out began, which escalated all the more when individual units, in the dark, regarded their neighbors as the enemy and shot at them. The frightened teamsters unlimbered the cannons and took flight on the draft horses. Also the packers followed, cutting the horses loose from the wagons and speeding away. The post road was soon littered with saddles, baggage, chairs, tents, and baskets ; the entire left column was seized by complete disorganization. In the middle of this chaos one finds Lacy, with Mack at his side. The archduke Franz, who was likewise stuck in the uproar, was brought safety inside the square of the 39th Hungarian infantry regiment by Lieutenant Field Marshal Kinsky, who had been assigned [to the archduke] as an escort ; the archduke remained in the regiment's protection until [it reached] Caransebe»ô. By personal action, Lacy and the members of his staff restored order. Around thirty guns were unlimbered, the harnesses were nowhere to be seen. Lacy had the cannons pulled by the soldiers, whereby almost all could be salvaged. After the order of march was re-established, the two infantry columns resumed marching and by dawn reached camp, which had been located on the near side of the Timi»ô [river] near Caransebe»ô. Besides large quantities of equipment and many horses, two three-pounders and a six-pounder were lost, as well as fourteen carts of munitions and twenty air rifles. The value of the lost goods, including the wages, amounted to 136,717 guilders, 43 kreuzer. Twenty four j√§ger as well as one officer and a further 538 men were missing ; however many were present again later. As a result of the aimlessly fired shots, officers and men of different regiments were killed or wounded. [Here, Gramm adds in footnote 309: \\"Regarding this, extremely exaggerated figures of losses are found in the secondary literature, so that in Regan, Military Blunders, p. 49: \\"At the first light of dawn it became clear how great was the disaster that the Austrians had suffered: More than ten thousand men had been killed or wounded by their own comrades.\\" \\"] [p. 84] Meanwhile, the Turks had also noticed that the Austrians were in the process of clearing out and [so the Turks] began the pursuit. Both rear guards had strict orders to remain abreast in order to support each other. Nevertheless, Wartensleben pulled away with the rear guard that was detailed to the rear of the left column and moved into position behind both infantry columns as far [back] as the last hussar in camp. Thus Kinsky's rear guard, which was marching behind the right column, had to ward off the attacking Turks alone. Lacy had just ridden back in order to see where Kinsky was. When he'd gotten an overview of the situation and noticed that Kinsky was under attack, he looked for the other rear guard and must have made the unpleasant discovery that Wartensleben was already engaged. He could force only the Graeve hussar regiment to deploy in order to cover the left flank. Furthermore, one had neglected to occupy the houses on the edge of town. Thus the advancing Turks succeeded in entering the place and starting fires. The Austrians, of whom several used the opportunity for much plundering, could withdraw from the Turks, but had to abandon Caransebe»ô and retreat behind the Timi»ô [river]. Since this position also wasn't tenable, the retreat continued the next day to Sacu and on 24 September, to Lugoj. During the Turk's advance, the German inhabitants of the mountain towns were frightened and fled, whereupon the Romanian population completely pillaged and laid waste their homes. Large bands of robbers formed, until a cavalry unit was finally dispatched in order to restore order. Around a hundred members of the robber bands were killed, the rest were taken prisoner. Of the prisoners, fifty-five were hanged in Denta, among them two priests and two women. The Turks stayed in Caransebe»ô and just made some raids, but [they] didn't attack the Austrians. Finally they withdrew on 10 October from Caransebe»ô.\\" (in German) Available at: University of Vienna, Austria The incident is also mentioned in: * Schlosser, F.C. with Davison, D., trans., History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth Century till the Overthrow of the French Empire. ...

His early research attracted the attention of Vincent Wigglesworth of Cambridge University, a prominent insect researcher, and Donald Griffin of Harvard University, who studied bats. From there, his career took him to UCLA and UC San Diego School of Medicine, before finally arriving at Washington University. Suga became a U.S. citizen in 1993, prompted by an incident at Lambert International Airport where a customs agent couldn't recognize Suga's picture on his green card, issued in 1966. Work Suga's work revealed much about the location and function of auditory system in the brain. Whilst at Washington University, he mapped the areas of the bat brain involved in processing Doppler shift (velocity) information, and in processing distance information for echolocation.

Solna cemetery Carl Christoffer Gj√∂rwell (the elder) (born 10 February 1731 in Landskrona, died 26 August 1811 in Stockholm), was a Swedish journalist, a prolific editor of some twenty journals and a psalmist whose hymns were published in the Moravian hymnal Sions Nya S√•nger (\\"New songs of Zion\\") and elsewhere. His name is alternatively rendered as Carl Christoffersson Gj√∂rwell, Carl Christopher Gj√∂rwell or Karl Kristofer Gj√∂rwell. Gj√∂rwell studied at Lund University and at Germany's University of Greifswald before coming to Stockholm to become a librarian at the National Library of Sweden. Early life and education Gj√∂rwell was an illegitimate son of lieutenant- colonel Christoffer Donatson Feif (b. 1694). Feif had been knighted by the new Queen Ulrika Eleonora in 1719 under the name Ehrensparre for his services in the Norwegian campaign of 1716-1718. He was the grandson of Scottish √©migr√© merchant Donald Fyfe, who had set up business in Stockholm.Herman Hofberg, Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon, 2nd ed., Vol. 1, Stockholm: 1906, Albert Bonniers Forlag, p. 393. Enrolling at Lund University and still unacknowledged by Feif, he consulted with history professor Sven Lagerbring (1707‚Äì1787) about what name he should use. The professor replied: \\"It means little what name you choose. Do well (Swedish: Gj√∂r well, with modern spelling g√∂r v√§l) what you do, and you will have a good name.\\" The young man liked the advice and, from those two words, devised his last name. Literary career After a few years in Lund, he undertook (1750‚Äì51) a scientific expedition to the Netherlands and France, after which he initially wanted to go as a missionary to the Khoikhoi people of South Africa or to the Lenape Native Americans of Pennsylvania. Later he changed plans and in 1756 began service at the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm. From 1755 he was editor of Den Svenska Mercurius, the first significant Swedish journal of literary criticism. Gj√∂rwell married Brita-Nora M√ºllern in 1765, and they had a son and two daughters. The son was the architect Carl Christoffer Gj√∂rwell Jr. (1766‚Äî1837). Daughter Britt-Louise married Krigskommissar (Colonel) Karl Gustaf Almqvist and was mother of Carl Jonas Love Almqvist. The second daughter, Gustava, married John Lindahl of Norrk√∂ping. In 1772 Gj√∂rwell had to cede control of his bookstore to his creditors over an unpaid debt of 140,000 daler. Probably it was the publishing enterprise, which was bound up with his bookselling business, that caused Gj√∂rwell's catastrophe, but he nevertheless continued to work as the editor of journals and books. Gj√∂rwell was chiefly occupied with history and literary history, and was especially taken with German literature. Despite changing public tastes, various twists of fate and whichever wandering turns his life took, he bore all reverses with stoic calm, happy in his family, his employment and his religious life in the prayer halls of the Moravian Herrnhut brethren. Gj√∂rwell died in 1811 and is buried at Solna Church.

These tables went beyond the tables of Henry Briggs, Adriaan Vlacq, and Gaspard de Prony. Edward Sang's grave in Newington cemetery, Edinburgh (plot R1.101) Personal life Sang was born in Kirkcaldy on 30 January 1805, the son of Jean Nicol and Edward Sang, Provost of Kirkcaldy. He attended the Subscription School in Kirkcaldy and from there went on to study at the University of Edinburgh. In the 1830s he is listed as a teacher of mathematics living at 32 St Andrew Square in Edinburgh. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in May 1836. In 1884 he was awarded their Makdougall-Brisbane Prize. He served as their Vice President 1883 to 1885. In 1841 he took the role of Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College. In 1854 he briefly served as Professor of Mechanical Science in Constantinople. He returned to Edinburgh in 1854 to again teach mathematics. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts in 1828, and was its President from 1857-58. In 1884 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. Sang died at his home, 31 Mayfield Road, Edinburgh Newington on 23 December 1890. Grave He is buried with his wife and children in Newington Cemetery, Edinburgh. The grave can be found when entering from Dalkeith Road, near the cemetery lodge, and then going straight for about 50 meters until meeting a circular plot of graves. Sang's grave is slightly towards the left, on the second circle from the outside.

(Elmslie, Nicol, Millar, Wilkie and Chalmers are middle names taken from ancestors' surnames.) Family Edward Sang was married to Isabella Elmslie (2 February 1804, Tannadice, Forfar ‚Äì 24 August 1880) and they had five children: * Anna Wilkie (23 November 1832 ‚Äì 25 September 1917) * Jane Nicol (16 May 1834 ‚Äì 9 February 1878) * Edward Elmslie (9 January 1836 ‚Äì 31 October 1882) * Flora Chalmers (11 May 1838 ‚Äì 10 May 1925) * Isabella Millar (24 July 1841 ‚Äì 3 March 1884) None of the children married. The engineer John Sang (1809-1887) was a brother of Edward Sang. In 1851, he invented a planimeter which he called \\"platometer.\\" Mathematical work Demonstrating the rotation of the Earth In 1836, Sang explained how a spinning top could be used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth, anticipating Foucault's pendulum. (see Johann G. Hagen: La rotation de la terre, ses preuves m√©caniques anciennes et nouvelles, 1911) Trigonometric and logarithmic tables Sang worked for many years on trigonometric and logarithmic tables. Summaries of his tables were published by Alex Craik. Sang's 1871 table and his project for a 9-place million table were (re)constructed as part of the LOCOMAT project. Various other works * Edward Sang's logarithmic method for constructing a skew arch. Publications The following list is certainly still incomplete. Some page ranges may be slightly incorrect. Note that Pebble's list of publications contains more items, but some of them seem spurious, and others are not actual publications. Nevertheless, the present list is very likely incomplete.

It is the second short film in the Fast & Furious franchise, and stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Tego Calder√≥n and Don Omar. Los Bandoleros details the events prior to Fast & Furious where runaway fugitive Dominic Toretto plots to steal oil from a tanker in the Dominican Republic. It was released on July 28, 2009. It was later included as a bonus on the Blu-ray and Special Edition home releases of Fast & Furious. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster both appear on the poster, but are not in the film. Plot Tego Leo is imprisoned in the Dominican Republic, and engages in a debate with other prisoners regarding corporations holding back the electric car and starting wars for oil. Rico Santos, meanwhile, encounters difficulty in locating gas in order to get home on time for dinner. Han Lue later arrives, and is collected from the airport by Cara and Malo. They drive him back to Rico's house, where his aunt Rubia is struggling to keep up with her gas bills. Han goes outside to see Dominic Toretto working on his car, before they both go inside to enjoy a meal with the entire family. Dom discusses breaking Tego out of prison and stealing oil to support the family. Dom, Cara, and Han later head to a nightclub to meet with corrupt local politician Elvis, who is able to arrange for the robbery to take place on a highway the following morning. After managing to break Leo out of prison and finalizing the plan with Rico, Dom is surprised by the arrival of Letty Ortiz. The two drive together to a beach, and rekindle their romance.

Schauffler published poetry, biographies of Beethoven, Brahms, and Schumann and a series of books celebrating American holidays. Biography Schauffler was born on 8 April 1879 in Br√ºnn, where his parents were missionaries. By the time he was two he was back in the United States where his family founded the Schauffler College of Religious and Social Work in Cleveland in 1886 for Bohemian immigrants who were interested in social or religious work. One of the first of his Holiday books Schauffler's first successful career was as a cellist and he studied with several notable musicians. His academic studies started at the Northwestern University, but he completed his degree at Princeton before going on to study at the University in Berlin in 1902-3. By this time he had already been editor of the Nassau Literary Magazine for a year. On his return from Berlin he combined his skills as a music editor for another magazine. He came to notice in 1912 when he published a book of poetry named after a poem called Scum o' the Earth. This poem had come to notice after being published in a magazine. The poem had focussed attention on the monetary divide between middle class American and poor immigrants. He represented the United States in men's singles and doubles tennis at the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens.Robert Schauffler - Sports-Reference.com In 1907 he published the first of several books that celebrated American holidays. The first were Thanksgiving and Our American Holidays - Christmas. The book he created for Christmas includes several extracts from Dickens, Shakespeare, Leigh Hunt and William Morris. The first section deals with whether there is or is not a Santa Claus by quoting the 1897 editorial by Francis Pharcellus Church. The book is certain that there is.Is There a Santa Claus, Francis Pharcellus Church, in Our American Holidays - Christmas, edited by Schauffler Schauffler published Arbor Day two years later and there then followed books for Washington's Birthday, Lincoln's Birthday and Independence Day. His final holiday books were not published until after the war and there were Armistice Day in 1927,Armistice Day Plays for Our American Holidays in 1928, Halloween in 1933, and Columbus Day, five years later. His books before World War I involved several on travel. He wrote Through Italy with the Poets in 1908, Romantic Germany the following year and in 1913 he published Romantic America.

Jaffa is famous for its association with the biblical stories of Jonah, Solomon and Saint Peter as well as the mythological story of Andromeda and Perseus, and later for its oranges. Etymology The town was mentioned in Egyptian sources and the Amarna letters as Yapu. Mythology says that it is named for Yafet (Japheth), one of the sons of Noah, the one who built it after the Flood.One example of this legend is the sixteenth-century French pilgrim Denis Possot who recorded, \\"Jaffe, est le port de la Terre saincte, anciennement nomm√© Joppe, faict et construict premierment en ville et cit√© grande √† merveilles et de grant renom, par Japhet, fils de No√©.\\" in his Le Voyage de la Terre Sainte (Geneva: Slatkine Reprints 1971, reprint of Paris edition, 1890, orig. 1532), p. 155.Another pilgrim, Sir Richard of Guylforde, wrote,\\"This Jaffe was sometyme a grete Cytie [...] and it was one of the firste Cyties of the worlde founded by Japheth, Noes sone, and beryth yet his name.\\" In the pilgrimage narrative from 1506, recorded by his chaplain in 1511, edited by Sir Henry Ellis (London: Camden Society, 1851), p. 16. The Hellenist tradition links the name to Iopeia, or Cassiopeia, mother of Andromeda. An outcropping of rocks near the harbor is reputed to have been the place where Andromeda was rescued by Perseus. Pliny the Elder associated the name with Iopa, daughter of Aeolus, god of the wind. The medieval Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi referred to it as Yaffa.le Strange, 1890, pp. 550-551 History Market at Jaffa, by Gustav Bauernfeind, 1877 Ancient Jaffa was built on a high ridge, with a broad view of the coastline, giving it a strategic importance in military history.Stacey Jennifer Miller, The Lion Temple of Jaffa: Archaeological Investigations of the Late Bronze Age Egyptian Occupation in Canaan. BA thesis, University of California, Los Angeles, 2012 The tell of Jaffa, created through the accumulation of debris and landfill over the centuries, made the hill even higher.  Middle Bronze Age  The city as such was established at the latest around 1800 BCE. Aaron A. Burke and Martin Peilst√∂cker, The Egyptian Fortress in Jaffa, Popular Archaeology, 3 March 2013  Late Bronze Age  Jaffa is mentioned in an Ancient Egyptian letter from 1440 BCE. The so-called story of the Taking of Joppa glorifies its conquest by Pharaoh Thutmose III, whose general, Djehuty hid Egyptian soldiers in sacks carried by pack animals and sent them camouflaged as tribute into the Canaanite city, where the soldiers emerged and conquered it. The story predates the story of the Trojan horse, as told by Homer, by at least two centuries. The city is also mentioned in the Amarna letters under its Egyptian name Ya-Pho (Ya-Pu, EA 296, l.33). The city was under Egyptian rule until around 800 BCE. Hebrew Bible: conquest to return from Babylon Jaffa is mentioned four times in the Hebrew Bible, as a city opposite the territory given to the Hebrew Tribe of Dan (), as port-of-entry for the cedars of Lebanon for Solomon's Temple (), as the place whence the prophet Jonah embarked for Tarshish () and again as port- of-entry for the cedars of Lebanon for the Second Temple of Jerusalem (). Jaffa is mentioned in the Book of Joshua as the territorial border of the Tribe of Dan, hence the modern term \\"Gush Dan\\" for the center of the coastal plain. The tribe of Dan did not manage to dislocate the Philistines from Jaffa, but many descendants of Dan lived along the coast and earned their living from shipmaking and sailing. In the \\"Song of Deborah\\" the prophetess asks: \\"◊ì◊ü ◊ú◊û◊î ◊ô◊í◊ï◊® ◊ê◊ï◊†◊ô◊ï◊™\\": \\"Why doth Dan dwell in ships?\\" After Canaanite and Philistine dominion, King David and his son King Solomon conquered Jaffa and used its port to bring the cedars used in the construction of the First Temple from Tyre. The city remained in Israelite hands even after the split of the united Kingdom of Israel. Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian periods In 701 BCE, in the days of King Hezekiah (◊ó◊ñ◊ß◊ô◊î◊ï), Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invaded the region from Jaffa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, under Persian rule, Jaffa was governed by Phoenicians from Tyre. Hellenistic to Byzantine periods Alexander the Great's troops were stationed in Jaffa. It later became a port city of the Seleucid Empire until it was taken over by the Maccabees () and ruled by the Hasmonean dynasty. According to Josephus, however, the harbor at Jaffa was inferior to that of Caesarea., s.v. Antiquities 15.9.6. (15.331) During the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, Jaffa was captured and burned by Cestius Gallus. The Roman Jewish historian Josephus (Jewish War 2.507‚Äì509, 3:414‚Äì426) writes that 8,400 inhabitants were massacred. Pirates operating from the rebuilt port incurred the wrath of Vespasian, who razed the city and erected a citadel in its place, installing a Roman garrison there. The New Testament account of Saint Peter bringing back to life the widow Dorcas (recorded in Acts of the Apostles, , takes place in Jaffa, then called in Greek (Latinized as Joppa). relates that, while Peter was in Jaffa, he had a vision of a large sheet filled with \\"clean\\" and \\"unclean\\" animals being lowered from heaven, together with a message from the Holy Spirit telling him to accompany several messengers to Cornelius in Caesarea Maritima. Peter retells the story of his vision in , explaining how he had come to preach Christianity to the gentiles. In Midrash Tanna'im in its chapter , reference is made to Jose ben Halafta (2nd century) traveling through Jaffa. Jaffa seems to have attracted serious Jewish scholars in the 4th and 5th century. The Jerusalem Talmud (compiled 4th and 5th century) in Moed Ketan references Rabi Akha bar Khanina of Jaffa; and in Pesachim chapter 1 refers to Rabi Pinchas ben Yair of Jaffa. The Babylonian Talmud (compiled 5th century) in Megillah 16b mentions Rav Adda Demin of Jaffa. Leviticus Rabbah (compiled between 5th and 7th century) mentions Rav Nachman of Jaffa. The Pesikta Rabbati (written in the 9th century) in chapter 17 mentions R. Tanchum of Jaffa. Several streets and alleys of the Jaffa Flea Market area are named after these scholars. During the first centuries of Christianity, Jaffa was a fairly unimportant Roman and Byzantine locality, which only in the 5th century became a bishopric.Michel Le Quien, Oriens Christianus, III, 627. A very small number of its Greek or Latin bishops are known.Michel Le Quien, Oriens Christianus, III, 625‚Äì30, 1291; Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, Munich, I, 297; II, 186.Catholic Encyclopedia, Early Islamic period Jaffa Museum in Old Saraya building In 636 Jaffa was conquered by Arabs. Under Islamic rule, it served as a port of Ramla, then the provincial capital. Al-Muqaddasi (c. 945/946 ‚Äì 991) described Yafah as \\"lying on the sea, is but a small town, although the emporium of Palestine and the port of Ar Ramlah. It is protected by a strong wall with iron gates, and the sea-gates also are of iron. The mosque is pleasant to the eye, and overlooks the sea. The harbour is excellent\\". Crusader/Ayyubid period Jaffa was captured in June 1099 during the First Crusade, and was the centre of the County of Jaffa and Ascalon, one of the vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. One of its counts, John of Ibelin, wrote the principal book of the Assizes of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin conquered Jaffa in 1187. The city surrendered to King Richard the Lionheart on 10 September 1191, three days after the Battle of Arsuf. Despite efforts by Saladin to reoccupy the city in the July 1192 Battle of Jaffa, the city remained in the hands of the Crusaders. On 2 September 1192, the Treaty of Jaffa was formally signed, guaranteeing a three-year truce between the two armies. Frederick II fortified the castle of Jaffa and had two inscriptions carved into city wall, one Latin and the other Arabic. The inscription, deciphered in 2011, describes him as the \\"Holy Roman Emperor\\" and bears the date \\"1229 of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.\\" Mamluk period In 1268, Jaffa was conquered by Egyptian Mamluks, led by Baibars. Abu'l-Fida (1273‚Äì1331), writing in 1321, described \\"Yafa, in Filastin\\" as \\"a small but very pleasant town lying on the sea-shore. It has a celebrated harbour. The town of Yafa is well fortified. Its markets are much frequented, and many merchants ply their trades here. There is a large harbour frequented by all the ships coming to Filastin, and from it they set sail to all lands. Between it and Ar Ramlah the distance is 6 miles, and it lies west of Ar Ramlah.\\" Ottoman period mapped by the British Royal Engineers after the Oriental Crisis of 1840 In 1515, Jaffa was conquered by the Ottoman sultan Selim I.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 151 In the census of 1596, it appeared located in the nahiya of Ramla in the liwa of Gaza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3 % on various products; a total of 7,520 ak√ße. The traveller Jean Cotwyk (Cotovicus) described Jaffa as a heap of ruins when he visited in 1598. Botanist and traveller Leonhard Rauwolf landed near the site of the town on 13 September 1575 and wrote \\"we landed on the high, rocky shore where the town of Joppe did stand formerly, at this time the town was so demolished that there was not one house to be found.\\" (p. 212, Rauwolf, 1582) The 17th century saw the beginning of the re-establishment of churches and hostels for Christian pilgrims en route to Jerusalem and the Galilee. During the 18th century, the coastline around Jaffa was often besieged by pirates and this led to the inhabitants relocating to Ramla and Lod, where they relied on messages from a solitary guard house to inform them when ships were approaching the harbour. The landing of goods and passengers was notoriously difficult and dangerous. Until well into the 20th century, ships had to rely on teams of oarsmen to bring their cargo ashore.Thomson, 1859, vol 2, p. 275 On 7 March 1799 Napoleon captured the town in what became known as the Siege of Jaffa, ransacked it, and killed scores of local inhabitants as a reaction to his envoys being brutally killed when delivering an ultimatum of surrender. Napoleon ordered the massacre of thousands of Muslim soldiers who were imprisoned having surrendered to the French., quoted in Napoleon's deputy commissioner of war Moit described it thus: Many more died in an epidemic of bubonic plague that broke out soon afterwards.Jaffa: a City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, pp. 8‚Äì9 The governor who was appointed after these devastating events, Muhammad Abu-Nabbut, commenced wide-ranging building and restoration work in Jaffa, including the Mahmoudiya Mosque and Sabil Abu Nabbut. During the 1834 Peasants' revolt in Palestine, Jaffa was besieged for forty days by \\"mountaineers\\" in revolt against Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt.Thomson, page 515. Residential life in the city was reestablished in the early 19th century. In 1820, Isaiah Ajiman of Istanbul built a synagogue and hostel for the accommodation of Jews on their way to the holy cities of Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed. This area became known as Dar al-Yehud (Arabic for \\"the house of the Jews\\"); and was the basis of the Jewish community in Jaffa. The appointment of Mahmud Aja as Ottoman governor marked the beginning of a period of stability and growth for the city, interrupted by the 1832 conquest of the city by Muhammad Ali of Egypt. By 1839, at least 153 Sephardi Jews were living in Jaffa. The community was served for fifty years by Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi miRagusa. In the early 1850s, HaLevi leased an orchard to Clorinda S. Minor, founder of a Christian messianic community that established Mount Hope, a farming initiative to encourage local Jews to learn manual trades, which the Messianics did in order to pave wave for the Second Coming of Jesus. In 1855, the British Jewish philanthropist Moses Montefiore bought the orchard from HaLevi, although Minor continued to manage it. American missionary Ellen Clare Miller, visiting Jaffa in 1867, reported that the town had a population of \\"about 5000, 1000 of these being Christians, 800 Jews and the rest Moslems\\".Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches ‚Äî notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'. Edinburgh: William Oliphant and Company. 1871. Page 97. See also Miller's populations of Damascus, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nablus and SamariaThompson (above) writing in 1856 has '25 years ago the inhabitants of the city and gardens were about 6000; now there must be 15,000 at least...' Considering the length of time he lived in the area this may be a more accurate count. The city walls were torn down during the 1870s, allowing the city to expand. Jaffa, an Historical Survey. Written with the assistance of Mr. Tzvi Shacham, the curator of the Antiquities Museum of Tel Aviv‚ÄìJaffa Jaffa street beside port 1914 By the beginning of the 20th century, the population of Jaffa had swelled considerably. A group of Jews left Jaffa for the sand dunes to the north, where in 1909 they held a lottery to divide the lots acquired earlier. The settlement was known at first as Ahuzat Bayit (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ó◊ï◊ñ◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊™), but an assembly of its residents changed its name to Tel Aviv on 21 May 1910. Other Jewish suburbs to Jaffa were founded at about the same time. In 1904, rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864‚Äì1935) moved to Ottoman Palestine and took up the position of Chief Rabbi of Jaffa. In 1917, the Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation resulted in the Ottomans expelling the entire civilian population. While Muslim evacuees were allowed to return before long, the Jewish evacuees remained in camps (and some in Egypt) until after the British conquest.Friedman, Isaiah (1971). \\"German Intervention on Behalf of the \\"Yishuv\\"\\", 1917, Jewish Social Studies, Vol. 33, pp. 23‚Äì43. During the course of their campaign through Ottoman Palestine and the Sinai against the Ottomans, the British took Jaffa in November 1917 although it remained under observation and fire from the Ottomans. The battle of Jaffa in late December 1917 pushed back the Ottoman forces securing Jaffa and the line of communication between it and Jerusalem (which had been taken on 11 December in the Battle of Jerusalem). British Mandate British soldiers outside Jaffa municipality building Alhambra Cinema, 1937 According to the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Jaffa had a population of 47,799, consisting of 20,699 Muslims, 20,152 Jews and 6,850 Christians,Barron, 1923, p .6 increasing to 51,866 in the 1931 census, residing in 11,304 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 13 During the British Mandate, tension between the Jewish and Arab population increased. A wave of Arab attacks during 1920 and 1921 caused many Jewish residents to flee and resettle in Tel Aviv, initially a marginal Jewish neighborhood north of Jaffa. The Jaffa riots in 1921, (known in Hebrew as Meoraot Tarpa) began with a May Day parade that turned violent. Arab rioters attacked Jewish residents and buildings killing 47 Jews and wounding 146.Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances in the British Mandate of Palestine in May 1921, with correspondence relating thereto (Disturbances), 1921, Cmd. 1540, p. 60. The Hebrew author Yosef Haim Brenner was killed in the riots. At the end of 1922, Tel Aviv had 15,000 residents: by 1927, the population had risen to 38,000. Still, during most of the 1920s Jaffa and Tel Aviv maintained peaceful co- existence. Most Jewish businesses were located in Jaffa, some Jewish neighbourhoods paid taxes to the municipality of Jaffa, many young Jews who could not afford the housing costs of Tel Aviv resided there, and the big neighbourhood of Menashiya was by and large fully mixed. The first electric company in the British Mandate of Palestine, although owned by Jewish shareholders, had been named the Jaffa Electric Company. In 1923, both Jaffa and Tel Aviv had begun a rapid process of wired electrification through a joint grid.Ronen Shamir (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press The 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in British Palestine inflicted great economic and infrastructural damage on Jaffa. It began on 19 April 1936 with a riot which ended with 9 Jews killed and scores injured. The Arab leadership declared a general strike, which began in the Jaffa Port, a place that had already become a symbol of Arab resistance.The Land That Become Israel: Studies in Historical Geography, ed. Ruth Kark, Yale University Press & Magnes Press, 1989, \\"Aerial Perspectives of Past Landscapes,\\" Dov Gavish, pp. 316‚Äì317 Military reinforcements were brought in from Malta and Egypt to subdue the rioting which spread throughout the country. The Old City, with its maze of homes, winding alleyways and underground sewer system, provided an ideal escape route for the rioters fleeing the British army. In May, municipal services were cut off, the old city was barricaded, and access roads were covered with glass shards and nails. In June, British bombers dropped boxes of leaflets in Arabic requesting the inhabitants to evacuate that same day. On June 16, British Royal Engineers blew up from 220 to 240 Arab homes from east to west, leaving an open strip that cut through the heart of the city from end to end, leaving 6,000 Jaffa Palestinians destitute.Matthew Hughes, 'The Banality of Brutality: British Armed Forces and the Repression of the Arab Revolt in Palestine,1936 ‚Äì 39,' English Historical Review Vol. CXXIV No. 507 pp.323-354 pp.322.323. On the evening of 17 June 1936, 1500 British soldiers entered Jaffa and a British warship sealed off escape routes by sea. On 29 June, security forces implemented another stage of the plan, carving a swath from north to south. The mandatory authorities claimed the operation was part of a \\"facelift\\" of the old city. Local Arab papers could only employ sarcasm in describing what had happened, speaking of the operation as one in which the British forces beautified the city by using boxes of dynamite. In 1945, Jaffa had a population of 94,310, of whom 50,880 were Muslims, 28,000 were Jews, 15,400 were Christians and 30 were classified as \\"other\\".Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 27 The Christians were mostly Greek Orthodox and about one-sixth of them were members of the Eastern Catholic Churches. One of the most prominent members of the Arab Christian community was the Greek Orthodox Issa El-Issa, publisher of the newspaper Falastin. In 1947, the UN Special Commission on Palestine recommended that Jaffa be included in the planned Jewish state. Due to the large Arab majority, however, it was instead designated as part of the Arab state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. Following the inter-communal violence which broke out following the passing of the UN partition resolution the mayors of Jaffa and Tel Aviv tried to calm their communities. One of the main concerns for the people of Jaffa was the protection of the citrus fruit export trade which had still not reached its pre-Second World War highs.'A survey of Palestine', printed 1946‚Äì1947. Reprinted ISP, Washington, 1991 . Page 474: Exports of citrus fruit total value in Palestine Pounds, 1938/39 = P¬£4,355,853. 1944/45 = P¬£1,474,854. Ironically, due to the Nazi conquest of the Netherlands, Tel Aviv's trade in polished diamonds had increased over three-fold to P¬£3,235,117. Page 476 Eventually the bilateral orange-picking and exporting of both sides continued although without a formal agreement. Lehi bomb attack Tel Aviv civilians trying to hide from Arab snipers shooting at the Carmel market from Hassan Bek Mosque on, 25 February 1948 At the beginning of 1948 Jaffa's defenders consisted of one company of around 400 men organised by the Muslim Brotherhood.Herbert Pritzke 'Bedouin Doctor ‚Äî The adventures of a German in the Middle East', Translated by Richard Graves. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London. 1957. Copyright Ullstein and Co, Vienna, 1956. Page 149: 'At that time the Arab Brigade in Jaffa consisted of seven Germans, one hundred and fifty Jugoslavs, thirty Egyptians and two hundred Lebanese and Syrians. There were very few Arabs among them as these preferred irregular warfare with the National Guard ...' As in Haifa, the irregulars intimidated the local population. On 4 January 1948 the Lehi detonated a truck bomb outside the 3-storey 'Serrani', Jaffa's Ottoman built town hall, killing 26 and injuring hundreds. The driver was reported to be wearing the uniform of the Royal Irish Fusiliers.The Scotsman newspaper, 6 January 1948Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed and dates the attack as occurring on 4 January. 'Before their Diaspora', 1984. p.316, picture p.325Morris, page 46. Attributes attack to 'LHI' (Lehi), doesn't indicate the number of casualties and gives date as 4 January. In February Jaffa's Mayor, Yussuf Haykal, contacted David Ben-Gurion through a British intermediary trying to secure a peace agreement with Tel Aviv, but the commander of the Arab militia in Jaffa opposed it.Benny Morris, 'The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947‚Äì1949', Cambridge University Press, 1987, . Page 47. On 25 April 1948, the Irgun launched an offensive on Jaffa. This began with a mortar bombardment which went on for three days during which twenty tons of high explosive were fired into the town.Morris, page 95.Menachem Begin, 'The Revolt ‚Äî story of the Irgun'. Translated by Samuel Katz. Hadar Publishing, Tel Aviv. 1964. pp. 355‚Äì371. On 27 April the British Government, fearing a repetition of the mass exodus from Haifa the week before, ordered the British Army to confront the Irgun and their offensive ended. Simultaneously the Haganah had launched Operation Hametz, which overran the villages east of Jaffa and cut the town off from the interior.Morris, page 100. The population of Jaffa on the eve of the attack was between 50,000 and 60,000, with some 20,000 people having already left the town. By 30 April, there were 15,000‚Äì25,000 remaining.Begin, page 363. In the following days a further 10,000‚Äì20,000 people fled by sea. When the Haganah took control of the town on 14 May around 4,000 people were left.Morris, page 101: 'On 18 May Ben-Gurion visited the conquered city for the first time and commented:\\"I couldn't understand: Why did the inhabitants of Jaffa leave?\\"' The town and harbour's warehouses were extensively looted.Jon Kimche, 'Seven Falen Pillars; The Middle East, 1915‚Äì1950'. Secker and Warburg, London. 1950. Page 224 :'the orgy of looting and wanton destruction which hangs like a black pall over almost all the Jewish military successes.' The city surrendered to the Haganah on 14 May 1948 and shortly after the British police and army left the city.Yoav Gelber, Independence Versus Nakba; Kinneret‚ÄìZmora-Bitan‚ÄìDvir Publishing, 2004, , p.104 The 3,800 Arabs who remained in Jaffa after the exodus were concentrated in the Ajami district and subject to strict martial law.

The former wished to incorporate only the northern Jewish suburbs of Jaffa, while the latter wanted a more complete unification. The issue also had international sensitivity, since the main part of Jaffa was in the Arab portion of the United Nations Partition Plan, whereas Tel Aviv was not, and no armistice agreements had yet been signed. On 10 December 1948, the government announced the annexation to Tel Aviv of Jaffa's Jewish suburbs, the Arab neighborhood of Abu Kabir, the Arab village of Salama and some of its agricultural land, and the working class Jewish area of Hatikva. On 25 February 1949, the depopulated Arab village of Sheikh Muanis, on the opposite (northeast) side of Tel Aviv from Jaffa, was also annexed to Tel Aviv. On 18 May 1949, the Arab neighborhood of Manshiya and part of Jaffa's central zone were added, for the first time including land that had been in the Arab portion of the UN partition plan. The government decided on a permanent unification of Tel Aviv and Jaffa on 4 October 1949, but the actual unification was delayed until 24 April 1950 due to concerted opposition from Tel Aviv's mayor Israel Rokach. The name of the unified city was Tel Aviv until 19 August 1950, when it was renamed as Tel Aviv‚ÄìYafo in order to preserve the historical name Jaffa. Urban development From the 1990s onwards, efforts have been made to restore Arab and Islamic landmarks, such as the Mosque of the Sea and Hassan Bek Mosque, and document the history of Jaffa's Arab population. Parts of the Old City have been renovated, turning Jaffa into a tourist attraction featuring old restored buildings, art galleries, theaters, souvenir shops, restaurants, sidewalk cafes and promenades. Many artists have moved their studios from Tel Aviv to the Old City and its surroundings, such as the Jaffa port, the American‚ÄìGermany Colony and the flea market. Beyond the Old City and tourist sites, many neighborhoods of Jaffa are poor and underdeveloped. However, real-estate prices have risen sharply due to gentrification projects in Ajami, Noga, and Lev Yafo. The municipality of Tel Aviv‚ÄìYafo is currently working to beautify and modernize the port area. Economy In the 19th century, Jaffa was best known for its soap industry. Modern industry emerged in the late 1880s.Jaffa: A City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, pp. 256‚Äì257. The most successful enterprises were metalworking factories, among them the machine shop run by the Templers that employed over 100 workers in 1910. Other factories produced orange-crates, barrels, corks, noodles, ice, seltzer, candy, soap, olive oil, leather, alkali, wine, cosmetics and ink. Most of the newspapers and books printed in Ottoman Palestine were published in Jaffa. In 1859, a Jewish visitor, L.A. Frankl, found sixty-five Jewish families living in Jaffa, 'about 400 soul in all.' Of these four were shoemakers, three tailors, one silversmith and one watchmaker. There were also merchants and shopkeepers and 'many live by manual labour, porters, sailors, messengers, etc.'Dr Frankl, translated by P. Beaton, 'The Jews in the East'. Volume 1. Hurst and Blackett, London, 1859. Page 345. He adds 'The community is poor, and receives no alms from any quarter.' which resulted in some envy of the 'our bethren' in Jerusalem. Until the mid-19th century, Jaffa's orange groves were mainly owned by Arabs, who employed traditional methods of farming. The pioneers of modern agriculture in Jaffa were American settlers, who brought in farm machinery in the 1850s and 1860s, followed by the Templers and the Jews.Jaffa: A City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, pp. 244‚Äì246. From the 1880s, real estate became an important branch of the economy. A 'biarah' (a watered garden) cost 100,000 piastres and annually produced 15,000, of which the farming costs were 5,000: 'A very fair percentage return on the investment.' Water for the gardens was easily accessible with wells between ten and forty feet deep.Thompson, page 517.Jaffa: A City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, p.262. Jaffa's citrus industry began to flourish in the last quarter of the 19th century. E.C. Miller records that 'about ten million' oranges were being exported annually, and that the town was surrounded by 'three or four hundred orange gardens, each containing upwards of one thousand trees'.Miller, page 97: 'The orange gardens are the finest in the East; and during the late winter and early spring, little white sailed vessels from Greece, Constantinople and the islands of the Archipelago, lie in calm weather at a short distance from the coast, waiting to carry away the fruit'. Shamuti oranges were the major crop, but citrons, lemons and mandarin oranges were also grown.Jaffa: A City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, pp. 242. Jaffa had a reputation for producing the best pomegranates.Thomson p.517: Sidon has best bananas, Jaffa the best pomegranates, oranges of Sidon are more juicy and have richer flavour. Jaffa oranges hang on the trees much later, and will bear shipping to distant regions.' Demography Jaffa Port Modern Jaffa has a heterogeneous population of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Jaffa currently has 46,000 residents, of whom 30,000 are Jews and 16,000 are Arabs.Universal Jerusalem The 2010 film Port of Memory explores these themes. Tabeetha School in Jaffa was founded in 1863. It is owned by the Church of Scotland. The school provides education in English to children from Christian, Jewish and Muslim backgrounds. Socioeconomic and political problems Jaffa suffers from drug problems, high crime rates and violence. Some Arab residents have alleged that the Israeli authorities are attempting to Judaize Jaffa by evicting Arab residents from houses owned by the Amidar government-operated public housing company. Amidar representatives say the residents are illegal squatters. The 2010 film Port of Memory explores these themes. Landmarks Sights and museums Jaffa clock tower The Clock Square with its distinctive clocktower was built in 1906 in honor of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The Saraya (governor's palace) was built in the 1890s. Andromeda rock is the rock to which beautiful Andromeda was chained in Greek mythology. The Zodiac alleys are a maze of restored alleys leading to the harbor. Jaffa Hill is a center for archaeological finds, including restored Egyptian gates, about 3,500 years old. Jaffa Lighthouse is an inactive lighthouse located in the old port. The Jaffa Museum of Antiquities is located in an 18th-century Ottoman building constructed on the remains of a Crusader fortress. In 1811, Abu Nabout turned it into his seat of government. In the late 19th century, the governmental moved to the \\"New Saraya,\\" and the building was sold to a wealthy Greek- Orthodox family who established a soap factory there. Since 1961, it has housed an archaeological museum, which is currently closed to the general public. The Libyan Synagogue (Beit Zunana) was a synagogue built by a Jewish landlord, Zunana, in the 18th century. It was turned into a hotel and then a soap factory, and reopened as a synagogue for Libyan Jewish immigrants after 1948. In 1995, it became a museum. Other museums and galleries in the area include the Farkash Gallery collection. Churches and monasteries Easter parade in Jaffa, 2011 The Greek Orthodox Monastery of Archangel Michael (Patriarchate of Jerusalem) near Jaffa Port also has Romanian and Russian communities in its compound. Built in 1894, the Church of St. Peter and St. Tabitha serves the Russian Orthodox Christian community, with services in Russian and Hebrew; underneath the chapel nearby there is what is believed to be the tomb of St Tabitha. St. Peter's Church is a Franciscan Roman-Catholic basilica and hospice built in 1654 on the remains of a Crusader fortress, and commemorates St Peter, as he brought the disciple Tabitha back from the dead; Napoleon is believed to have stayed there. Immanuel Church, built 1904, serves today a Lutheran congregation with services in English and Hebrew. The Saint Nicholas Armenian Monastery was built in the 17th century. Mosques Jaffa, by Cornelis de Bruijn, c. 1675 Al-Bahr Mosque, lit. the Sea Mosque, overlooking the harbour, is depicted in a painting from 1675 by the Dutch painter Cornelis de Bruijn.Petersen, 2002, p. 166James Silk Buckingham, Travels in Palestine, Through the Countries of Bashan and Gilead, East of the River Jordan: Including a Visit to the Cities of Geraza and Gamala, in the Decapolis, Longman, 1821 mentions Lebrun's visit in 1675,(coinciding with the date the Sea Mosque is said to have been built) It may be Jaffa's oldest existing mosque. Built originally in 1675,Dan Mirkin, 'The Ottoman Port of Jaffa: A Port without a Harbour,' Aaron A. Burke, Katherine Strange Burke, Martin Peilstocker (eds.) The History and Archaeology of Jaffa 2, ISD LLC 2017, pp.121-155 p.152, n.16. changes to the structure have been made since then, such as the addition of a second floor and reconstruction of the upper part of the minaret. It was used by fishermen and sailors frequenting the port, and residents of the surrounding area. According to local legend, the wives of sailors living in Jaffa prayed there for the safe return of their husbands. The mosque was renovated in 1997. Mahmoudia Mosque was built in 1812 by Abu Nabbut, governor of Jaffa from 1810 to 1820. Outside the mosque is a water fountain (sabil) for pilgrims. Nouzha Mosque on Jerusalem Boulevard is Jaffa's main mosque today. Archaeology Jaffa flea market The majority of excavations in Jaffa are salvage in nature and are conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority since the 1990s. Excavations on Rabbi Pinchas Street, for example, in the flea market have revealed walls and water conduits dating to the Iron Age, Hellenistic, Early Islamic, Crusader and Ottoman periods. A limestone slab () engraved with a menorah discovered on Tanchum Street is believed to be the door of a tomb. Additional efforts to conduct research excavations at that site included those of B. J. Isserlin (1950), Ze'ev Herzog of Tel Aviv University (1997‚Äì1999), and most recently the Jaffa Cultural Heritage Project (since 2007), directed by Aaron A. Burke (UCLA) and Martin Peilstocker (Johannes Gutenberg University). Education Coll√®ge des Fr√®res de Jaffa Coll√®ge des Fr√®res de Jaffa, a French international school, is in Jaffa. Transportation Jaffa is served by the Dan Bus Company, which operates buses to various neighborhoods of Tel Aviv and Bat Yam. The Red Line of the planned Tel Aviv Light Rail will cross Jaffa north to south along Jerusalem Boulevard. Jaffa Railway Station was the first railway station in the Middle East. It served as the terminus for the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway. The station opened in 1891 and closed in 1948. In 2005‚Äì09, the station was restored and converted into an entertainment and leisure venue marketed as \\"HaTachana\\", Hebrew for \\"the station\\" (see homepage here:HaTachana official website). In popular culture The Knight Of Jaffa is the second episode of the Doctor Who story The Crusade, set in Palestine during the Third Crusade. Clash of the Titans is set in ancient Joppa.

McMahon is a surgeon specialising in upper gastrointestinal surgery, particularly the pancreas and biliary tract. Professor McMahon was a lecturer and senior registrar and subsequently a senior lecturer, reader and professor of surgery before becoming a consultant surgeon. He currently holds positions as a Consultant General and Laparoscopic Surgeon, a Senior Lecturer in Surgery, and Assistant Director of the Leeds University Department of Surgery. Education He qualified from Sheffield University in 1967, gaining a Master of Surgery (ChM), before training at the University of Birmingham, where he obtained a PhD. Career In the 1980s, McMahon carried out laparoscopy for diagnosis under local anaesthesia, realising that laparoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or keyhole surgery, had the potential to bring about a revolution in surgical practice. McMahon visited one of the pioneers of laparoscopy, Dr Joe Petelin, in Kansas City, USA, in spring 1990. Together, they organised the UK's first teaching course on laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery in Leeds in June 1990. There, Petelin demonstrated the operation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder). Since then, Leeds has become a major centre for advanced laparoscopic surgery. In 1999, McMahon started to undertake laparoscopic surgery for obesity, calling upon the experience of his colleagues who were performing the operations by traditional surgery; helping him to carry them out laparoscopically. Alongside Professor David Johnston, McMahon performed the first laparoscopic M&M; operation and this evolved into sleeve gastrectomy, which was first performed as a standalone operation in Leeds. It was carried out as the first stage of the operation of duodenal switch by Michel Gagnier, whom McMahon visited in New York. He then went on to perform the first laparoscopic gastric bypass in the UK, shortly followed by the first duodenal switch. McMahon worked with trainee, Simon Dexter, who has since become one of the leading obesity surgeons in the country. Training of the new techniques for obesity surgery was funded by grants from the Wolfson Foundation and the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. This enabled a state of the art training facility to be established in Leeds (the Leeds Institute for Minimally Invasive Therapy). Subsequently, much of the training techniques developed were incorporated into the Core Skills Course in Laparoscopic Surgery, run by the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Professor McMahon's philosophy for 'keyhole' surgery was \\"to carry out the operation using all the safeguards that had been built up over the generations of 'open' surgery, rather than by cutting corners to make things easier when employing laparoscopic techniques\\". Alongside Peter Moran (an engineer), Professor McMahon designed and built specialist instruments for laparoscopy surgery as the existing instruments made the job a challenge. They found it difficult to stimulate interest from established manufacturers so they founded Surgical Innovations PLC, which now has over 100 employees designing and building a large range of laparoscopical surgical instruments as well as inspection equipment for the airline industry. McMahon was also involved in the design of the Nuffield Hospital in Leeds, so that it could become a centre of excellence for all types of laparoscopic surgery, especially the surgical treatment of obesity. Achievements McMahon is a past president of both the Pancreatic Society of the UK and Ireland, and the Association of Laparoscopic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. He is the founder member of the society of Minimally Invasive General Surgeons, and was Chairman of the Education Committee of the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery. He also established the Leeds Institute for Minimally Invasive Therapy (LIMIT). In the past he was Education Officer and subsequently President of the Association of Endoscopic Surgeons of the UK and Ireland, and a Royal College of Surgeons tutor in Minimally Invasive Surgery. McMahon was the first surgeon in the UK to perform laparoscopic (minimally invasive) gastric bypass, duodenal switch, and sleeve gastrectomy. McMahon is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Szeged in Hungary. He is Clinical Director of Surgical Innovations PLC and is still actively involved in the design of new surgical instruments.

It was a rare double-by-election, caused when the 1868 general election of the borough's two Conservative MPs was nullified. Their sons won the by-election, but the result led to fighting in the town of Blackburn and was denounced by the Liberal Party candidates as a \\"farce\\".  The vacancy  On 16 March 1869, the result of the 1868 general election in borough of Blackburn was declared null and void, after an election petition had been lodged. The two Conservatives who had been elected, Joseph Feilden and William Henry Hornby, were unseated when Mr Justice Willes found that there had been widespread intimidation of voters. The candidates themselves were absolved of direct involvement in the intimidation, but their agents were held responsible for a document known as the \\"screw circular\\". The circular called on mill-owners, tradesmen, and other employers to secure the election of Conservatives at both the municipal and parliamentary elections, and led to the dismissal of many long-serving employees on the spurious grounds of trivial misconduct, long after the alleged misconduct had occurred.  Candidates  The nominations were made on 29 March 1869, before a gathering of 15,000 people in Blakey Moor, Blackburn. The Liberal Party nominated John Gerald Potter, who had contested Blackburn in 1865 and 1868, and John Morley, a barrister who had taken up journalism and become the editor of the Fortnightly Review. Potter told meeting that if the working classes of Blackburn were allowed to vote freely, he and Morley would both be returned, and that the longer he lived, the more he saw the need for voting to be conducted by secret ballot. He favoured the abolition of the ratepaying qualification for elections, a national system of education, a reduction in taxation and the legalisation of trade unions. Morley said that the Tories had no policy, no spirit and no temper, and that he supported the policies of the present government. The Conservatives also nominated two candidates: Edward Hornby and Henry Master Feilden, both sons of the ousted Conservatives MPs. Both Hornby and Fielden appealed for support as a tribute to their fathers, with Hornby asserting that he had \\"no vain idea\\" that his own merits were enough to qualify him as an MP.  Result  There was no secret ballot until 1872, so voting was conducted in public at the hustings, which were attended by a large number of police armed with cutlasses. A show of hands was taken and pronounced to be in favour of Fielden and Hornby, but a vote was demanded on behalf of the Liberal candidates. Polling took place the following day, 30 March, in 25 locations. Voting began at 8am, and there were no reports of any disturbances. The Times newspaper reported that \\"only three persons\\" were arrested for personation, one of whom had been released when it was acknowledged that a mistake had been made. The results were announced by the Mayor at 6.30pm, when Fielden and Hornby were declared the winners with a margin of over 700 votes. In their acceptance speeches, Fielden and Hornby both pronounced the result as being the true voice of Blackburn once the screw had been removed. Fielden said that he hoped that Potter would not dare challenge the result again, and then a fight broke out, which was speedily broken up the police. There were reports that shots had been fired, but The Times reported that the police had received no accounts of anyone wounded by gunfire. The Liberal candidates did not appear on the platform at the declaration, and issued a printed statement saying that they were unsurprised by the result. They asserted that the Conservative victory was the result of intimidation, and elections in Blackburn would remain \\"a farce\\" without a secret ballot. At about 7pm, stones were thrown at Conservative supporters in Penny Street. A policeman was shot in the arm, other shots were fired from windows, and there was serious fighting for a few minutes until 60 policemen came to guard the approaches to the street.  Aftermath  Edward Hornby never stood for Parliament again, and held the seat until the 1874 general election, when he retired from the House of Commons. Henry Master Feilden was re-elected in 1874, but died in office in 1875, triggering a by-election in October 1875. After three unsuccessful candidacies, J. G. Potter did not stand again. John Morley unsuccessfully contested the City of Westminster at the 1880 general election,Craig, page 21 and was elected as MP for Newcastle-upon- Tyne at a by-election in February 1883.Craig, page 220 He held a number of senior posts in the Cabinet, and was ennobled in 1908 as Viscount Morley of Blackburn.

After his death, he was recognized as the 15th Baron Cobham. Origins Reginald Gervase Alexander was the son of Dr. William Alexander of Blackwall Lodge, Halifax, West Yorkshire, Yorkshire (3 September 1806 ‚Äì 13 April 1888), Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London and Justice of the Peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and wife (married 4 October 1837) Emily Kirby (died 26 April 1862), daughter of Samuel Kirby of Grove House, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Yorkshire. He had an older brother, Arthur William Alexander (2 August 1843 ‚Äì 15 February 1895), who died unmarried and without issue. His uncle Gervase Alexander (30 September 1802 - 23 September 1871) married his aunt Eliza Kirby on 16 October 1838, while his aunt Ellen Alexander (10 December 1803 ‚Äì 27 September 1854) married John Clarke Prescott (died 16 May 1863) on 20 February 1839. Life In February 1857, he was admitted to Heath Grammar School, Halifax. In 1867, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated from the University of Cambridge, with a Master of Arts degree and from the University of Edinburgh, as a Doctor of Medicine, and became a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. The Committee for Privileges and Conduct of the House of Lords declared on 22 July 1912 that he was one of the co-heirs of the titles of Baron Burgh and Baron Cobham (of (Cobham, in) Kent) (except for the attainder), and on 11 May 1914 that he was one of the co-heirs of the title of Baron Strabolgi. He never had, however, the chance of succeeding in any of these titles, nominately to the Barony Cobham, since the attainder that had fallen on Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham in 1603, though finally removed in September 1916, was only lifted after his own death. Marriage and issue He married on 29 May 1879 Alicia Mary Greenwood (died 30 December 1913), daughter of John Greenwood of Castle Hall, Mytholmroyd, Calderdale, West Yorkshire, Yorkshire, and had four children: * Gervase Disney Alexander, 15th Baron Cobham (of Kent) (6 May 1880 ‚Äì 10 June 1933) * Hon.

John James Chalon (27 March 1778 ‚Äì 14 November 1854) was a Swiss painter active in England. He treated a wide range of subjects ‚Äî landscapes, marine scenes, animal life, and figure-pieces. Life He was born at Geneva, of an old French family who had taken refuge there after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He went to England when quite young, and entered the Schools of the Academy in 1796. His first picture, 'Banditti at their Repast,' appeared in 1800. In 1808, he, his brother Alfred Edward Chalon, and some friends, founded the Sketching Society, and in the same year he joined the Water-Colour Society, but in 1813 he seceded from it, and again devoted himself to painting pictures in oil for the Royal Academy. He was elected an Associate of that institution in 1827, and an Academician in 1841. In 1847 he was seized by an attack of paralysis, and, after a long and painful illness, died at Kensington in 1854. Works In 1820 Chalon published a series of Sketches from Parisian Manners. Napoleon on board the Bellerophon, 1816, now at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. He was fond of the scenery of Switzerland, the land of his father and mother, and some of his finest landscapes are faithful transcripts of its mountains and lakes. Among these, a very noble work is his 'Castle of Chillon,' its lonely white walls strongly contrasting with the dark mountains that rise behind them, and glittering in the ripple of the clear blue lake. Amongst his later productions were 'Gil Blas in the Robbers' Cave,' in 1843, and the 'Arrival of the Steamer at Folkestone,' in 1844. The Gallery of the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, possesses his 'Napoleon on board the Bellerophon,' painted in 1816, and in the Sheepshanks Collection at the South Kensington Museum are 'Village Gossips,' painted in 1815, and 'Hastings, Fishing Boat's making the Shore in a Breeze,' painted in 1819.

G. Grace is believed to have considered retirement from cricket before the 1878 season after he was seriously injured in a shooting accident the previous autumn which nearly cost him the sight of an eye. Having recovered, he reconsidered and in 1878 played in 33 matches, 24 of which are generally recognised as first-class. His main roles in the season were captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series. 1878 was a cold, wet summer and not one of Grace's better seasons as a batsman, but he was very effective in such conditions as a right arm medium pace roundarm bowler and completed a sixth successive \\"double\\" by scoring 1,151 runs and taking 152 wickets in the recognised first-class matches. Grace was always notorious for gamesmanship and moneymaking during his cricket career and he cut an especially controversial figure in 1878. After the season ended, he and his brother E. M. Grace were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership and a special enquiry was ordered to investigate their blatant \\"shamateurism\\". As amateur players, they should only have been claiming reasonable expenses for travel and accommodation but they were accused of claiming inflated expenses and appearance fees. The matter came to a head after Surrey County Cricket Club refused to meet their expense claims when Gloucestershire played at The Oval in June. Prior to the same match, Grace was accused of \\"kidnapping\\" the Australian player Billy Midwinter when he insisted that Midwinter was contractually bound to play for Gloucestershire and not the Australian touring team. A furious altercation between Grace and members of the Australian party took place in front of bystanders outside The Oval, but Grace got his way and Midwinter played for Gloucestershire. The season was notable for the MCC v Australians match at Lord's in May. Grace played for MCC in the match that, completed in a single day, is considered a milestone in cricket history. In July, Gloucestershire made their first visit to Old Trafford to play Lancashire and the match was immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem \\"At Lord's\\". On a personal level, Grace was still unqualified as a doctor and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor until the end of the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity. Background It is believed that Grace contemplated retirement from cricket in the winter of 1877‚Äì78.Darwin, p. 57. He had been seriously injured in a shooting accident in September 1877, which nearly cost him the sight of one eye, and this may have caused him to review his life.Rae, pp. 217‚Äì218. Still unqualified as a doctor and with a growing family to support, Grace had doubts about his long-term security even though he was making considerable profit from cricket by way of \\"grossly inflated\\" expense claims and appearance fees.Rae, p. 218. Unexpectedly, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) solved his financial problems by voting him a National Testimonial with a view to purchasing a medical practice out of the proceeds. It was hoped that a regular income would \\"end the embarrassment of his blatant shamateurism\\".Rae, pp. 217‚Äì219 One of Grace's biographers, Bernard Darwin, who knew him personally, wrote that the arrival of the first Australian touring team \\"tipped the beam in favour of cricket\\" but it was also the case that no one, especially Grace, took the Australian players too seriously. It is more likely that A. J. Webbe was right when he said: \\"W. G. never could have given up cricket\\". Grace was living in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was assigned to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education. They lived in an Earl's Court apartment until autumn 1877 when they returned to Gloucestershire and lived with Grace's elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner (GP) at Kingswood, near Bristol. The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878.Midwinter, p. 67. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study a backlog of medical theory and, after the season ended, he was assigned to Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved back to London and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.Midwinter, pp. 73‚Äì75. By the time Grace celebrated his 30th birthday in July 1878, he was arguably the most famous man in England; but he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking.Birley, p. 208. Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878. May: the season begins 1878 was a \\"chilly and wet summer\\" in which the bad wickets reduced \\"all (batsmen) to comparative impotence\\" but enabled bowlers to dominate and cause \\"havoc\\".Darwin, p. 58. This summed up Grace's season too, for he was outstanding in the field but he struggled with the bat, as his statistics plainly show. The season began in cold, wet conditions and Grace did not start well. He was conscious of his domestic and medical distractions, the most pressing of which was the birth of his daughter just before the famous match at Lord's between MCC and the Australians. Grace's first match was for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against Twenty of Rochdale from Thursday, 2 May to Saturday, 4 May at Butcher's Meadow in Rochdale. The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although they saved the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, it was not an auspicious performance by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. It was another odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley. On Thursday, 9 May, Grace was in Cambridge and played for an England XI against Cambridge University at Fenner's. This was a three-day match culminating on Saturday, 11 May and was the opening first-class fixture of the season. Cambridge had one of its strongest-ever teams in 1878 and won by 79 runs after having to follow on. Grace scored 45 and 11, and he was the outstanding bowler in the match with 10 wickets. Grace returned to London and played in his next match, starting on Monday, 13 May, for MCC against an England XI at Lord's. This was another first-class fixture, scheduled for three days but completed in two, the mostly professional England XI winning by 3 wickets. MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored by Grace himself with 47. England reached 75‚Äì6 at the close and were all out for 115 on Tuesday morning, but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, Grace having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. Grace was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was well supported by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. Grace bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3‚Äì43. Grace's 47 in the first innings was the top score in the game, the second highest being 30 by Arthur Shrewsbury for England. Grace sustained a thumb injury during the match which prevented him taking part in the England second innings.ACS, pp. 91‚Äì92. Grace was inactive for over a week after that match, partly because of his injury but also as his daughter was born in London, and his next appearance was in Ireland where he played for the USEE against 15 past and present players of the University of Dublin at its College Park venue. This match was played over three days, starting on Thursday, 23 May. A guest player in the USEE team was the Australian batsman Charles Bannerman. However, Grace and Bannerman scored just 11 and 1 respectively in the USEE first innings, while Fred Grace and Bannerman's fellow Australian Midwinter scored 46 and 64. The match was ruined by the weather and ended in a draw. On Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team caught the ferry back to England and Grace continued by train to London, probably in the company of Bannerman and Midwinter, as all three were due to take part in another match at Lord's the following day. They could not have guessed that the match would be remembered as, to quote Grace's biographer Simon Rae, \\"arguably the most momentous six hours in cricket history\\".Rae, p. 220. Monday, 27 May 1878 ‚Äì MCC v Australians at Lord's The 1878 Australians (without Midwinter). Standing: Spofforth, Conway, Allan. Centre: Bailey, Horan, Garrett, Gregory, A Bannerman, Boyle. Front: C Bannerman, Murdoch, Blackham. CricketArchive states without elaboration that: \\"the match was scheduled for three days but completed in one\\". Having won the toss, MCC were dismissed for 33 and then they bowled out the Australians for 41. MCC hoped for a better total in the afternoon but were skittled for a mere 19. The Australians needed 12 to win and were by no means sure of getting them, but they did, and won a sensational match by 9 wickets. With a match aggregate of 105 runs, it remains the lowest scoring first-class match on record.Rae, p. 222.Webber, Playfair, p. 30. In his ghost-written Reminiscences (1899), Grace recalled that there had been \\"only four and a half hours of actual cricket\\" net of the lunch interval and breaks between innings. With James Lillywhite acting as their agent, the first official Australian team to tour England was managed by John Conway and captained by Dave Gregory. As Billy Midwinter was already in England, he joined his compatriots ahead of their opening game. The other ten players in the party were Charles Bannerman, his brother Alec, future Test captain Billy Murdoch, wicket-keeper Jack Blackham, Frank Allan, George Bailey, Harry Boyle, Tom Garrett, Tom Horan and the original \\"Demon Bowler\\", Fred Spofforth.Rae, p. 220. Play started at three minutes past twelve on a \\"sticky wicket\\", a wet pitch drying out as the sun began to shine. Only a small crowd was present and it all began well enough for Grace as he hit the opening ball of the match from Allan for four. But another firm shot off his legs sent the second ball straight to Midwinter and Grace was \\"easily caught at square leg\\".Altham, p. 134. Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5‚Äì2 but, with Hornby and Arthur Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was \\"truly demonic\\". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6‚Äì4 in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of George Hearne, Alfred Shaw and George Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41 but Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6‚Äì3 and Spofforth 4‚Äì16. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and they \\"mobbed the Australians as they left the field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm\\".Rae, pp. 220‚Äì221. Around 500 had been present at the start but the number grew to 4,742 by the end; the receipts of ¬£119 7s were given to the Australians and MCC paid the expenses.Harte, p. 102.ACS, p. 98. So ended a \\"memorable day of cold and puddles and calamity\\". Afterwards, the match was seized upon by the media and widely reported by the press.Altham, pp. 134‚Äì135. The news \\"spread like wildfire and created a sensation in London and throughout England\\". The satirical magazine Punch responded to the event by publishing a parody of Byron's poem The Destruction of Sennacherib including a wry commentary on Grace's contribution:Altham, p. 135. > The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold, > The Mary'bone Cracks for a trifle were bowled; > Our Grace before dinner was very soon done, > And Grace after dinner did not get a run. No one in England had taken the Australians very seriously at first, even though they had beaten Lillywhite's team in the inaugural Test match, and no one was too surprised when they lost their tour opener by an innings to the strong Nottinghamshire attack of Shaw and Morley on a rain-affected wicket.Rae, pp. 219‚Äì220. This perception of Australian cricketers was immediately and permanently revised such that \\"henceforth a match between Australia and any representative English team would overshadow any of the 'great matches'\\".Rae, p. 221. Although the match did not mark the birth of international cricket, it was the point in time at which the English sporting public wholeheartedly embraced the concept. As Lord Hawke put it:Harte, p. 101. > (27 May 1878) this marked the commencement of the modern era of cricket. As for William Gilbert Grace, his whole approach to cricket was about what was needed to win the game in hand and he never took kindly to defeat. But, two decades later in his Reminiscences, he gave the Australians due credit for their \\"glorious victory\\". June: MCC v Derbyshire A whole week passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, starting with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl them out for a mere 36. His figures were 8‚Äì23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to give him his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81‚Äì5 to take the match. Despite Grace's presence, this match attracted few spectators as it coincided with the Surrey v Australians match at The Oval, which drew very large crowds. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack commented that \\"the Australians were attracting monster gatherings at The Oval on the days that this match was played, consequently very few visitors were at Lord's\\".ACS, p. 106. June: North v South There were three North v South fixtures in June. The first two were played at Prince's Cricket Ground and Lord's with the South as the \\"home\\" team; the third took place at the end of the month at Trent Bridge as a home game for the North. The match at Prince's began on Thursday, 6 June and was played over three days, ending in a draw after being impacted by the weather. The North won the toss and batted first, scoring 156 all out and 196‚Äì5. In their only innings, the South scored 197 all out. Grace opened the bowling for the South and took 4‚Äì73 and 2‚Äì59. Once more he failed with the bat and was caught and bowled for 4, again losing his wicket to the irrepressible Tom Emmett. The match raised about ¬£100 for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society.ACS, p. 109. The match at Lord's was the following Monday, 10 June, and this time a full match could take place over three days. The North won by 3 wickets after scoring 180 and 226‚Äì7 in reply to the South's 202 and 203. Although his team lost, Grace could take consolation from his best batting performance of the season so far, and his first half-century, as he scored 45 and 77. He had 9 wickets in the match with 5‚Äì60 and 4‚Äì89. The match was played for the benefit of the Marylebone Professional Cricketers' Fund and drew an attendance of 10,858 on the first day, which was Whit Monday.ACS, p. 110. Grace was directly involved in a controversial incident in this match when Dick Barlow was given out hit the ball twice. Barlow did something that is commonplace by knocking the ball away with his bat after he had \\"dead-batted\\" it (i.e., played a defensive stroke to stop the ball at his feet). The problem was that Barlow then \\"dashed a couple of yards down the pitch and back again\\" to tease the fielders and amuse the spectators. The joke backfired when Grace, fielding nearby, appealed on the grounds that Barlow had hit the ball twice and then \\"attempted a run\\". Barlow never had any intention of attempting a run but the Laws of cricket had to be observed and he was given out. It was just one in a catalogue of incidents that highlighted Grace's determination to \\"win at all costs\\". The third match in the series began on Thursday, 27 June at Trent Bridge and the South won by 10 wickets after forcing the North to follow on. The South won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 204 with Grace contributing 12 before again being dismissed by Emmett. Grace took 9 wickets (6‚Äì46 and 3‚Äì64) as the North were bowled out for 116 and 136 to leave the South needing 49 to win. Grace did not bat in the second innings, allowing his elder brother E. M. Grace and Richard Humphrey to secure the 10 wicket victory. The match was played for the benefit of George Parr, who received about ¬£250.ACS, p. 129. There was a fourth North v South match at The Oval in September but Grace did not play and the North won by an innings and 123 runs. In between the second and third North v South games, Grace played for the Gentlemen of England against the Australians at Prince's and then twice for Gloucestershire in away matches at The Oval against Surrey and Hove against Sussex. June: Gentlemen v Australians and first Gloucestershire matches Grace and his amateur colleagues took a measure of revenge at Prince's as they defeated the Australians by an innings and 1 run. The match began on Monday, 17 June and was completed within two days. The Australians won the toss and decided to bat, but were bowled out for only 75 with Grace and Allan Steel taking 4 wickets apiece. The Gentlemen scored 139 (Grace 25) and then dismissed the tourists for 63, Grace taking 2 wickets in support of Steel's 7‚Äì35. The County Championship was a semi-official competition in 1878 as it was not formally structured until December 1890, but the age-old ad hoc claims on behalf of a \\"Champion County\\" had been regulated somewhat by the introduction of residential criteria for players in 1873.Webber, County Championship, p. 14. Gloucestershire, who had been recognised as the champions in 1877, were expected to be in contention for the title again as the county fixtures began in 1878.Rae, p. 223. The first match began under a cloud of Grace-inspired controversy on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4‚Äì43) and 136 (Grace 6‚Äì70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though he would not have been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0‚Äì21) and 71 (Grace 4‚Äì13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53. June: the Midwinter incident Gloucestershire CCC in 1880. W. G. Grace (bearded) is seated front left centre with Billy Midwinter (fourth left in rear group) directly behind him. Fred Grace (hooped cap, next to Midwinter) is third left and E. M. Grace (bearded) is sixth left in rear group. Gloucestershire arrived shorthanded at The Oval on 20 June. Their regular players present were the three Grace brothers, their cousin Walter Gilbert, wicket-keeper James Bush and batsmen James Cranston and Thomas Matthews. They also had the inexperienced William Woof, Carleton Haynes and Edward Wright, all of whom made their first-class debuts against Surrey. That was ten, so another player had to be found and Grace decided to take action. The Australian Billy Midwinter had played for Gloucestershire in 1877 and, as luck or the fixture list would have it, he was at Lord's on 20 June to represent the Australians against Middlesex. Midwinter was at net practice when he saw W. G. and E. M. Grace, accompanied by James Bush, approaching. They argued that he was under contractual obligation to play for Gloucestershire if required and Grace demanded that he accompany them to The Oval at once. One source says that Midwinter was still under a contractual obligation to Gloucestershire and that the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked.Bowen, p. 130. Midwinter's reaction to Grace's demand is unknown but Tom Horan later wrote that Midwinter \\"did not seem to know his own mind for two minutes together\\".Rae, p. 224. Whether he was in agreement or not, Midwinter did go to The Oval with the Graces. They were pursued by Conway, Gregory and Boyle who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders.Harte, pp. 100‚Äì101 In another account, the incident is dismissed as \\"an amusing little quarrel\\". The argument was serious enough and was fuelled by a long-standing \\"antagonism\\" between Grace and Conway which dated back to Grace's 1873 visit to Australia.Allen, p. 19. At one point, Grace called the Australians \\"a damned lot of sneaks\\", though he later apologised in a letter to Gregory.Rae, p. 225. In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire for the rest of the season, although he did not play for the county against the Australians in September, due to a hand injury.Birley, pp. 111‚Äì112. Grace may have felt pleased that he had got his man but he did not get his expenses, for Surrey refused to pay them. There was a subscript the following winter when Grace and his brother E. M. were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership and a special enquiry was ordered.Birley, p. 127 July: Gentlemen v Players There were two Gentlemen v Players matches in 1878 and they took place consecutively in early July. The first was played at The Oval, starting on Thursday, 4 July, and the second at Lord's, starting on Monday, 8 July. A.N. Hornby captained the Gentlemen at The Oval and Grace at Lord's. The Gentlemen won both matches: by 55 runs at The Oval; and by 206 runs at Lord's. Grace's bad wicket batting skills were fully tested in the first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 in a total of only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each for the Players. The Players replied with 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2‚Äì37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6‚Äì60. The Gentlemen produced a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3‚Äì30 as the Players were bowled out for 101, the match ending on Friday afternoon. Under Grace's leadership at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted very well and totalled 310 on the first day before reducing the Players to 39‚Äì4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered on Tuesday morning, thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2‚Äì31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6‚Äì1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was well supported by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never in the hunt and, although Selby was defiant with another half- century, Grace took 4‚Äì55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory. July: USEE tour Most of July was taken up with USEE matches which were Grace's \\"bread and butter\\" at the time. The team travelled to Melton Mowbray, Holbeck (near Leeds), Newcastle upon Tyne, Bolton and Birmingham to play odds games against local opposition. Grace took 21 wickets in the match against the 22 men of Melton Mowbray in a three-day match starting on Monday, 1 July. He scored 42 and 57 not out in his two innings, the match ending in a draw. Grace caught the evening train to be in London ready for the first Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, starting on Thursday, 4 July. The next USEE match at Leeds Holbeck followed the second Gentlemen v Players fixture and began on Thursday, 11 July. The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole teetotaller in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted players in the USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off more than he could chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs. The USEE had a scare against Eighteen of Bolton in the three-day match starting on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly behind on first innings. Grace and Southerton bowled the Bolton team out but the difference was a second innings of 63 by Charlwood in a total of just 120. Grace scored 51 and 22 and took 20 wickets. The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 behind on first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144‚Äì5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory. July/August: Gloucestershire's northern tour Francis Thompson, Lancashire- born poet who was inspired by Grace's 1878 visit to Old Trafford. Gloucestershire made their first visit to Old Trafford Cricket Ground on Thursday, 25 July, to play Lancashire and this was the match immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem At Lord's:Midwinter, p. 73. > It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, > : Though my own red roses there may blow; It is little I repair to the > matches of the Southron folk, > : Though the red roses crest the caps, I know. For the field is full of > shades as I near a shadowy coast, > And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost, > And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host > : As the run stealers flicker to and fro, :: To and fro: : O my Hornby and > my Barlow long ago! > It's Glo'ster coming North, the irresistible, > : The Shire of the Graces, long ago! It's Gloucestershire up North, the > irresistible, > : And new-risen Lancashire the foe! A Shire so young that has scarce > impressed its traces, > Ah, how shall it stand before all-resistless Graces? > O, little red rose, their bats are as maces > : To beat thee down, this summer long ago! > This day of seventy-eight they are come up north against thee > : This day of seventy-eight long ago! The champion of the centuries, he > cometh up against thee, > : With his brethren, every one a famous foe! The long-whiskered Doctor, > that laugheth the rules to scorn, > While the bowler, pitched against him, bans the day he was born; > And G.F. with his science makes the fairest length forlorn; > : They are come from the West to work thee woe! > It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, > : Though my own red roses there may blow; It is little I repair to the > matches of the Southron folk, > : Though the red roses crest the caps, I know. For the field is full of > shades as I near a shadowy coast, > And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost, > And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host > : As the run stealers flicker to and fro, :: To and fro: : O my Hornby and > my Barlow long ago! Grace was not \\"the long-whiskered Doctor\\" for he was still unqualified in 1878: it was his elder brother E. M. (a coroner) \\"that laugheth the rules to scorn\\". Grace was of course \\"the champion of the centuries\\", although he had still not scored one in 1878. The opening (and closing) verse of the poem is the most famous stanza ever written about cricket and it eulogised two Lancashire players who were widely known as \\"Monkey\\" (AN Hornby) and \\"Stonewaller\\" (Dick Barlow).Birley, p. 132. The match was played over three days and culminated in a draw on Saturday, 27 July. Lancashire won the toss and decided to bat, but were dismissed for only 89 after rain shortened the first day's play. Grace took 3‚Äì44 and the left arm spinner Robert Miles took 7‚Äì38. Gloucestershire responded with 116, Grace making the top score of 32. At close of play on the second day, Lancashire had made 90‚Äì0 with Hornby on 68 and Barlow on 15; and the legend of the run stealers was born in the mind of the watching Francis Thompson. Hornby and Barlow put on 108 for the first wicket and then Barlow was out for 26. Hornby went on to score exactly 100 and Lancashire's total was 262 (Grace 1‚Äì65). Gloucestershire scored 125‚Äì5 in the last innings with Grace, batting at six, on 58 not out at the close. Gloucestershire went over the Pennines to Sheffield and began the next game against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane on Monday, 29 July. Gloucestershire were soundly beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2‚Äì48 and 4‚Äì128. They were undone by the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, including 7‚Äì38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings. The match was played for the benefit of Tom Emmett, who received ¬£616 13s 1d.ACS, p. 153. The final leg of Gloucestershire's northern tour was at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, to Saturday, 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (Grace 9) and 253 (Grace 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (Grace 2‚Äì91) and 10 for 1 (Grace (1‚Äì2). So Grace finally made his first (and only) century of the 1878 season, surprisingly against arguably the strongest bowling attack in the country. August: Canterbury Cricket Week The 1878 Canterbury Festival consisted of two first-class matches played between Monday, 5 August and Friday, 9 August. at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. The first match, between Thirteen of Kent and an England XI, finished early on the Wednesday. The second match, between Twelve of Kent and Twelve of MCC, began later the same afternoon and finished on Friday afternoon. Grace played in both games, representing England and MCC. The Kent XIII won the match against England by 8 wickets. Grace scored 21 and 14; with the ball, he took 5‚Äì72 and 1‚Äì21. Kent defeated MCC in the twelves game by 9 wickets after Grace was out for 0 and 1. He took 4‚Äì82 in Kent's first innings total of 216 but did not bowl in the second innings when Kent needed just 20 to win. August/September: Gloucestershire at home From Monday, 12 August to Friday, 6 September, Grace was entirely involved with Gloucestershire who played seven matches in less than four weeks. Six of these were at home and one, against an England XI, was at The Oval. Gloucestershire played its home games at the College Ground, Cheltenham and at the Clifton College Close Ground. Gloucestershire's return game against Nottinghamshire began on Monday, 12 August, at Clifton College. Gloucestershire won a low- scoring match by 109 runs after batting first. They totalled 127 (Grace 26) and 137 (Grace 6) which were modest scores, but Nottinghamshire's replies amounted only to 84 and 71. Grace produced another fine bowling performance with figures of 5‚Äì29 and 6‚Äì35 against one of the strongest batting sides in England. Alfred Shaw was unable to play for Nottinghamshire.ACS, p. 162. In a three-day match starting on Thursday, 15 August, the England XI defeated Gloucestershire at The Oval by 6 wickets after Grace had won the toss for his county and decided to bat. They scored 118 (Grace 25) and England replied with 163 (Grace 3‚Äì67). Rain prevented play for most of the Friday and Gloucestershire in their second innings had reached 27‚Äì1 at the end of the day. On the Saturday, England bowled them out for 118 (Grace 29) with Tom Emmett taking 8‚Äì51 (12‚Äì93 in the match). Grace took 3‚Äì39 in England's second innings as they made 7‚Äì44 to win by six wickets. Midwinter suffered a hand injury in the field when he attempted to stop a powerful drive played by George Ulyett; he was unable to play again in 1878.ACS, p. 163. Yorkshire CCC in 1875. Tom Emmett is seated first left with George Ulyett (standing second left) directly behind him. The Cheltenham Festival took place the following week with two matches on the College Ground: against Sussex starting on Monday, 19 August; and a return against Yorkshire starting on Thursday, 22 August. Gloucestershire made short work of Sussex, winning by an innings and 24 runs in less than two days. Grace made only 2 of Gloucestershire's total of 198 but he was again outstanding with the ball and took 13 wickets in the match (6‚Äì18 and 7‚Äì88). The Yorkshire match was drawn after being ruined by the weather. Yorkshire had claimed a first innings lead after Grace was yet again dismissed by Tom Emmett, this time for 10, but he compensated by having taken 6‚Äì77 to restrict the Yorkshire lead to 39. He captured a further two wickets in the second innings before the match was washed out. On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire again at the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star performer as he took 7‚Äì77 and 5‚Äì32, but this time he did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32‚Äì2 to win. A return match against Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were fortunate to get a draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1‚Äì86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84‚Äì9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again came to the rescue with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161‚Äì4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in his shirt and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.Birley, p. 111.ACS, p. 175. County Championship Gloucestershire played 10 matches against the other first-class county clubs and ended with a record of 4 wins, 4 draws and 2 defeats. This was not good enough for them to retain the title they had claimed in 1877, when they had won 7 and drew 1 of 8 matches played.Webber, County Championship, p. 19. The main claimant was unbeaten Middlesex but they had only played 6 matches and Roy Webber, deploying a \\"rationalisation\\" method based on a points system used by the official competition in the 20th century, argued that Nottinghamshire was the champion county in 1878.Webber, County Championship, pp. 16‚Äì20. September: Gloucestershire v Australians On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians arrived at Clifton for what promised to be an explosive encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7‚Äì49 and 5‚Äì41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1‚Äì90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who really did have a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It was the first time Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.ACS, p. 180. September: Essex v USEE Grace's final appearance in 1878 was for the USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played for the benefit of the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65‚Äì5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4. The expenses inquiry It was in November 1878 that MCC defined amateur status.Bowen,p.286. Their dictum was that \\"a gentleman ought not to make any profit from playing cricket\\".Bowen, p. 112. This was carefully worded so that an amateur was allowed to claim reasonable expenses, but controversy persisted about what were \\"reasonable expenses\\" and what were actually \\"fees\\". Fred Grace fell foul of this by claiming a fee for representing the USEE and was subsequently banned from representing the Gentlemen in matches at Lord's. W. G. Grace got around his USEE fee by having it classed as a salary for his work in organising the matches.Midwinter, p. 69. The controversy rumbled on and there was a long debate in the press through the winter of 1878‚Äì79 about the various payments received by the \\"amateurs\\" of Gloucestershire. The enquiry at Gloucestershire CCC took place in January 1879. W. G. and E. M. Grace were forced to answer charges that they had claimed \\"exorbitant expenses\\", one of the few times that their money-making activity was seriously challenged. The claim had been submitted to Surrey re the controversial 1878 match in which Billy Midwinter was brought in as a late replacement, but Surrey refused to pay it and this provoked the enquiry. The Graces managed to survive \\"a protracted and stormy meeting\\" with E. M. retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules. The incident served to highlight an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers. Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for travel and accommodation to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made rather more money by playing than their basic expenses would allow and W. G. in particular \\"made more than any professional\\".Birley, p. 108. The national testimonial voted for Grace by MCC was realised six months later in the form of a presentation to him by Lord Fitzhardinge at Lord's on 22 July 1879 in the form of a marble clock, two bronze ornaments and a cheque for ¬£1,458. Season summary Despite his troubles in 1878, it was another good season for Grace on the field as he completed a sixth successive double with 1,151 runs and 153 wickets.Rae, pp. 495‚Äì496. He made 24 first-class appearances, scoring 1,151 runs with a highest score of 116 at an average of 28.77. He completed one century and five half-centuries. In the field, he held 42 catches and took 153 wickets with a best analysis of 8‚Äì23. His bowling average was 14.43; he took five wickets in an innings 13 times and ten wickets in a match six times. Grace was seventh in the overall national batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace was one of only two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two. Grace's bowling average of 14.50 left him eighth among bowlers who took 100 wickets, the best of whom was Allan Steel with 164 wickets at 9.43. Grace's 153 wickets was the fourth highest tally behind Alfred Shaw (201), Fred Morley (197) and Allan Steel (164). Grace had an outstanding season as a fielder, holding 42 catches in just 24 appearances. His tally was higher than anyone else including wicket-keepers. The second highest was Alfred Shaw with 32 catches in 30 appearances. The best performance by a wicket-keeper was Ted Pooley of Surrey who held 25 catches and completed 31 stumpings. Footnote ‚Ä¢ a) As described in Grace's first- class career statistics, there are different versions of his first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians about the status of some matches he played in. Note that this is a statistical issue only and has little, if any, bearing on the historical aspects of Grace's career. In the infobox, the \\"traditional\\" first-class figures from Wisden 1916 (as reproduced by Rae, pp. 495‚Äì496), are given first and the \\"amended\\" figures from CricketArchive follow in parentheses. There is no dispute about Grace's Test career record and those statistics are universally recognised. See Variations in first-class cricket statistics for more information.

He completed his elementary studies in his hometown and made the school in State College, where he installed a weather station. In 1874 he moved to Mexico City, where he studied military engineering at the Military College of Chapultepec. On September 24, 1874 he graduated as an engineer surveyor, and later joined the National School of Engineers and in 1883 he obtained the title of geographer-engineer, being the first Mexican to get this title. Between 1878 and 1883 he worked as a surveyor on the International Commission to demarcate the boundary between Mexico and Guatemala. That year, and until 1885, he was the second astronomer at the National Observatory Tacubaya. From 1887 he was an honorary member of the Society Alzate, and in 1891 he made a trip to Europe to monitor the printing of his work table of logarithms to eight decimal places, written in French.The site http://locomat.loria.fr contains a reconstruction of Mendiz√°bal's table of logarithms. Since November 1891 he was the second chief engineer of the Boundary Commission in Guatemala, and he held this position until 1896. In May 1896, he found several objects of pottery in the archaeological zone of Palenque. His travels to Europe became very frequent, and he represented his country at scientific conferences, which discussed issues on mathematics, geodesy, physics, metrology and geography. In 1913 he traveled to Spain to study photography by airplane and balloon. His teaching career was also long: between 1888 and 1891 he taught calculus, astronomy and geodesy at the Colegio Militar de Chapultepec. From 1906 to 1920 he taught Mathematics in the National School of Agriculture. He taught cosmography between 1918 and 1924 at the Regional High School, and physics at the Naval Academy from 1918 to 1924. He belonged to numerous European and American societies. In his country, he chaired the Scientific Society \\"Antonio Alzate\\" and the Mexican Society of Geography and Statistics, and was a member of the Association of Engineers and Architects. On June 11, 1920 he was accepted member of the Royal Astronomical Society. He also belonged to the Astronomische Gesellschaft of Hamburg, and to the Soci√©t√© Math√©matique of Moscow, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Sciences et Math√©matiques de Cherbourg, to the Academy of Madrid, New York, Lisbon and Padua. Mendiz√°bal was the father of Concepci√≥n Mendiz√°bal Mendoza, the first woman in Mexico to earn a civil engineering degree.

It was created by Adriana Varella and Nilton Maltz and installed in 2005. Digital DNA addresses complicated themes of technology and public space in Silicon Valley. In 2018, the sculpture was removed from the plaza and was later installed outside of the i-Lab at Harvard Business School. Digital DNA recognizes Palo Alto (indeed, the HP garage) as the birthplace of the Silicon Valley and the computer revolution. At the same time, the sculpture poses challenging questions about what it means to live and work in the Silicon Valley where every day companies determine and produce new technologies and make decisions that profoundly change the DNA of both it and every other society on the globe. Commission The Palo Alto Public Arts Commission is primarily funded by the Palo Alto City Council and aims to beautify the city and support (often emerging) contemporary artists while contributing to the cultural life of the community.

Therefore, through phrases like: \\"Circuits of Power\\", \\"Ideological Circuits\\", \\"Warfare Circuits\\", \\"Borderless Circuits\\", \\"Sexual Circuits\\", \\"Colonizing Circuits\\", \\"Genetic Circuits, etc, trying to simplistically verify, even if it is a glimpse of consciousness, one of the main tools-objects of our contemporary world. The \\"egg\\" is meant to recognize Palo Alto as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. Linda Craighead, Palo Alto Arts Center Director, feels that the work represents \\"the power of technology to bring the world together.\\" Varella said of the design, \\"I don't want to preach truths, just trigger ideas. Lovers of Digital DNA say: \\"Digital DNA is the Identity of Palo Alto.\\" History and controversies Thrown out with trash Digital DNA was commissioned in 2000. In 2001, while moving from Palo Alto to San Francisco Varella used her shared garage to store unattached pieces of the artwork. Her neighbor mistook the unfinished work for junk, and threw it out. Varella lost six months of work. The installation of the piece was originally scheduled for May 8, 2004, but was delayed due to changes in city policy regarding the hiring of city vendors. By June an installer had been hired, and Digital DNA was ready to be installed; however, a conflicting plan for the complete redesign of the plaza had been made public. Former Palo Alto mayor Leland Levy and real estate developer Roxy Rapp proposed a $500,000 revitalization of Lytton plaza. The design featured a central fountain, but did not include Digital DNA. On June 17, the Palo Alto Public Art Commission held a meeting to discuss the future of Digital DNA in relation to the fountain plan. Levy and Rapp requested that the installation of the artwork be further delayed until their proposal was formally presented to the City Council. The Commission unanimously voted to study the fountain plan, but also reiterated their desire for the immediate installation of Digital DNA. Destroyed by fire Following the vote, Arts and Culture Director Leon Kaplan, the city employee overseeing the project, made a shocking announcement. About a month prior, on May 19, there had been a fire in the San Bruno warehouse where Digital DNA was being stored. 11 days after the original installation date, Digital DNA was completely destroyed. Because the fire occurred after the installation of Digital DNA had been delayed by city staff, some public officials blamed its loss on city employees. Varella hired an attorney to investigate the city's liability for the loss. Suspicions rose that the fire had been masterminded to allow the fountain plan to move forward. Insurance reimbursed the city for the cost of the lost sculpture. On August 19, 2004, the Commission voted to fund a second version of the artwork. In late April 2005 Digital DNA was again ready to be displayed, however, the installation was slightly delayed due to weather and other factors. Dedication June 2005 Plaque at the base of Digital DNA The second iteration of Digital DNA debuted in Lytton Plaza in May, and was officially unveiled June 9‚Äì10, 2005 with a reception and dedication. Vandalism Two weeks prior to the unveiling, Digital DNA was vandalized. Six circuit boards were removed from the sculpture and several wires were pulled out, but Varella was able to repair the damages before the event. An earlier plan to install surveillance equipment in the plaza was reconsidered as a result of the vandalism. Police speculated that the crime was committed by drunken patrons of local bars. In April 2008, a public-private partnership (including city staff, Levy, and Rapp) renewed the 2004 undertaking to revitalize Lytton Plaza with a large-scale redesign. The old proposal, which did not incorporate Digital DNA, was never approved, but will be revisited. Levy expressed the group's desire to present a plan to which everyone can agree. According to Sunny Dykwel, a leader of the advocacy effort, Digital DNA is a beautiful piece of art, which they intend to protect. Vote to remove In August 2017, the city staff issued a report recommending removal, because of the cost of maintenance. The staff was concerned about the continuing expense of maintaining a sculpture that does not hold up under outdoor weather conditions. The staff tried, but failed to find a suitable location within the city, for displaying the sculpture. In November 2017, the Arts Commission voted to remove the sculpture. In response, about 60 protesters gathered on December 7 at the sculpture. The artist wrapped the sculpture in a tarp labeled \\"CENSORED.\\" Removal and relocation to Harvard In 2018, the sculpture was purchased by an anonymous art collector, who is also a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and a Harvard University graduate. The sculpture was removed from Lytton Plaza in June 2018. The art collectors wanted to have the sculpture repaired and restored. , the Harvard Business School displays the restored work outside the i-Lab on Western Avenue.

Early life and education Konishi was born on 17 February 1933 in Kyoto, Japan, the only child of poor \\"Nishijin\\" weavers. As a child during the Second World War, he grew edible plants in his family's backyard and rooftop, and raised rabbits for food. In his spare time, he enjoyed playing with animals, including insects, fish, birds, rabbits, and dogs. He first studied at Hokkaido University, where he completed his Bachelor of Science in 1956 and Master of Science in 1958. He had initially planned to study agriculture, but changed his mind upon seeing the zoology subjects on offer. Despite finding most of these zoology lectures \\"quite boring\\", his interest was piqued by the neurophysiology course taught by Mitsuo Tamashige. His master's research examined brood parasitism of reed warbler nests by cuckoos. Konishi received a Fulbright travel scholarship to move to the United States for his doctoral research. In September 1958, he arrived at the University of California, Berkeley to undertake his PhD with Alden H. Miller, only to discover that Miller was on sabbatical in South America. Instead, he completed his PhD under ethologist Peter Marler, who had also recently arrived at the institution. Konishi's findings highlighted the important role of auditory feedback in songbird vocal learning, using white- crowned sparrows and other songbird species. His work, together with that of fellow PhD student Fernando Nottebohm, \\"laid the foundation for the discovery of the avian song control system by Nottebohm in the 1970s and the remarkable development of the field of birdsong neurobiology.\\"  Career  barn owls. Following his graduation in 1963, Konishi undertook two postdoctoral positions in Germany, at the University of Tubingen (1963‚Äì64) and in the Division of Experimental Neurophysiology at the Max-Planck Institute (1964‚Äì65). He then returned to the United States, working at the University of Wisconsin (1965‚Äì66) and later at Princeton University (1966‚Äì75). During this time, Konishi began research projects exploring owl and songbird behaviour. While based at Princeton, Konishi attempted to use neurophysiological methods to measure hearing in birds, by determining the threshold sensitivities of single neurons in the cochlear nuclei: all species tested could hear low frequencies, but species with high frequencies in their songs could also hear high frequencies. He also investigated the development of hearing in duck embryos. Konishi's research on owls began when he acquired three nestling barn owls from a local birdwatcher. Konishi was a Professor of Biology at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) from 1975‚Äì1980, and served as Bing Professor from 1980 until his retirement in 2013. In the 1980s, he and his collaborators raised white-crowned sparrows in isolation, and demonstrated that these birds still preferred their own species' song over heterospecific songs from the same geographic area. Konishi was a leader in the field of avian neuroethology and a foremost expert in avian auditory systems. Throughout his career, he advised dozens of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Among his Caltech students was Larry Katz, whom Konishi described as his \\"most adventurous and skillful\\" student. Katz introduced brain slice techniques into Konishi's lab. Work by students in the lab, including Katz, Mark Gurney and Jim McCasland, helped establish that neurons in the songbirds' HVC respond to sound and are selective for the bird's own song. Konishi was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1979) and the National Academy of Sciences (1985). He was a founding member of the International Society for Neuroethology, and served as the society's second President from 1986‚Äì1989.  Personal life and death  In his spare time, Konishi enjoyed working with animals, writing \\"I have been lucky, because I did not have to go far from my hobby to my scientific subjects.\\" In his later years, he began training border collies to herd sheep. In 1990, Konishi received the International Prize for Biology, which was established to honour Hirohito, the Sh≈çwa Emperor of Japan (1901‚Äì1989). When receiving the award, he met Akihito, son of Hirohito, and his wife Empress Michiko. Several years later, the imperial couple invited Konishi to dine at their palace. The couple did not say a word about the Japanese food he had chosen during the meal; nevertheless, Konishi found the Empress particularly \\"charming\\" and, later, sent her a reel of tape containing the song of European nightingales. She thanked him in a handwritten letter. Konishi retired from his position at Caltech in 2013, and died on 23 July 2020 at the age of 87.  Awards  * F. O.

GAZ-3101 prototype In 1976, the first prototypes were shown and under the new Soviet automobile numbering system, the car was christened as the GAZ-3101. Visually the vehicle included a completely new fascia, reminiscent of the more muscular fashion of North America, framed by East German built square headlights with water jet washers, a more angular chromed bumper with resin lining, fog lamps suspended below and the trademark \\"Baleen\\" grille. At the same time, conservative European influence can also be traced in the new rear panels, with a large tail-light cluster. As a measure of additional security, the fuel tank migrated behind the rear seat from its position under the boot, allowing the spare wheel to occupy its space. From the side, GAZ-24's profile remained, but doors now void of quarter glasses and featured sunken door handles in accordance to new standards of passive safety to pedestrians. Although the traditional chrome door mounted mirrors were retained, a provision was made for internal adjustment. Inside, the vehicle had a completely new interior, with headrests on all seats, a new polyurethane coated dashboard with integrated instrument clusters and steering column controls for windscreen wipers/washers and indicator/high beam lights, rear window heater and other features. Chassis-wise the vehicle featured a vacuum servo assisted split-contour braking system, front disc brakes, radial tyres and \\"aerodynamic\\" hub caps. The prototypes were powered by a 2990 cc GAZ-24-14 V6 with a cast iron cylinder block originally developed for the GAZ-24, and the identical GAZ-24-18, with an aluminium block. Both engines produced 136 hp, but the latter was much lighter in weight. The shown GAZ-3101 prototypes also featured automatic transmission, power steering, electric windows and air conditioning. Like its predecessors, the prototypes took part in much publicised tours of the USSR, and GAZ was ready to begin its pre-conveyor batches in 1978. The noticeable position of the fuel hatch is of the few indicators that this is an early production car, with the original stratified charge injection For the next two years GAZ was left with a car approved for production, but without the necessary go-ahead from Moscow. Several reasons played a role, but most of all was the same administration of USSR's planned economy that forced the third generation Volga into a GAZ-24-derived replacement. Polyakov, who was keen to see the VAZ giant producing newer cars secured a hefty investment sum for Porsche to assist in development the new front-wheel drive Lada Samara family. Other reasons included the inability for client producers, namely the Zavolzhye engine plant to begin production of the V6 unit. Autoexport was also cautious of such engine, as fuel economy became a major issue following the 1973 oil crisis in Europe, export to which was a source for much needed foreign currency. GAZ-3102 Technical details Faced with these constraints, GAZ continued to modify and alter (read simplify) the make-up of the car. One such result was the ZMZ-4022 motor with a stratified charge or in original terms‚Äî\\"prechambered‚Äîtorch ignition\\". Similar to Honda CVCC design, GAZ experimented with such technology in the early 1950s, and its patent dates to 1968. Now that it had time to spare, it was decided to introduce this novelty. To keep production costs low, the new engine retained all of ZMZ-24Ds key features: 4 cylinders, OHV, displacement etc. However the material of both cylinder block and head was now aluminium. The big novelty was four additional inlet valves that charged the combustion prechambers. Feeding this was a three barrel carburettor, where the draft from third barrel was directed into the four prechambers. The spark plugs were located inside these chambers, and lean fuel-air mixture in main cylinders was ignited by conical jets (the \\"torches\\") from these prechambers. Compared to the ZMZ-24D, power rose by 10 hp to 105 at 4750 rpm. Though the car was 50 kg heavier in weight, it could now do 0‚Äì100 km/h acceleration in 16.2 seconds (compared to the 22 on the GAZ-24) and the top speed also rose from 145 to 152 km/h. Whilst not exactly impressive dynamics by the turn of the decade, its fuel economy figures were: from 10.5 litres per 100 km on the GAZ-24 to 8.5. History With the new engine, and in simplified trim, the new car was re- christened as GAZ-3102. Still hoping to introduce the V6 powerplant at a later date, the GAZ-3101 designation was retained for it (and will used for the V8 \\"Chaser\\" models). Power steering and automatic gearbox were also removed from the make-up. The \\"new\\" Volga was re-submitted to Moscow for the go-ahead to production in early 1980 and was showcased at the Moscow Olympics to the wider public. Despite the general interest in the car, it would take a completely different route for the production order to finally come. Back in late 1976 GAZ launched its third-generation limousine, the GAZ-14 Chaika. Unlike the 3101, GAZ was able to secure the necessary go-ahead and funding for this limited vehicle. It also kept its original upsize design philosophy and compared to its predecessor, the GAZ-13 Chaika, the 14 turned out to be a much bigger and more prestigious car. Though the country's economy was stagnating at an alarming rate, its ageing ruling class (the nomenklatura) was increasing, as were its appetites, and in the semi-official hierarchy, not everyone was entitled to upgrade from the old Chaika to the new one. As a result, GAZ-13's assembly, a car developed largely from the 1956 Packard Patrician and built since 1959, was continued alongside the new Chaika, despite its obvious archaism for the time. Start of production It would take a tragedy to break this paradox situation. On 4 October 1980, outside the city of Minsk, a truck rammed the motorcade killing the First secretary of the Byelorussian Communist Party, Pyotr Masherov. It remains controversial if this was an \\"accident\\" given his political ambitions, but he died in a GAZ-13 Chaika (though his status not only allowed him the GAZ-14, but even the flagship ZIL-4104 limousine). In the aftermath, GAZ had to endure criticism that it was producing an archaic vehicle, and in 1981, the last 13th Chaika departed Gorky. Such turn of events left the Soviet third-ranking nomenklatura without a status car, for whom the standard GAZ-24 Volga was no longer acceptable. It was here that the GAZ-3102 finally found its role, never to be sold to the public or be available to it as taxi or ambulance. An estate version, though developed, never saw assembly. In April 1982 hand-assembly of this car began at the specialised unit on the factory that built the Chaikas, with an annual production of about 3000 cars. Despite its status and assembly quality, by the mid-1980s it was clearly an out-of-date automobile compared to its western counterparts (Mercedes-Benz W124, Volvo 760, Renault 25, Nissan Cedric etc.). It was planned that both the GAZ-3102 and GAZ-24 be retired by the end of the decade. With ascendancy of Mikhail Gorbachev, the start of perestroika and the appointment of Nikolay Pugin, former administrator of GAZ as Minister of Automobile Production, headway was made into development of their replacements by the new 3103/3104/3105 family. As a temporary measure, GAZ was able to use most of the mechanical upgrades of the 3102 and retrofit them to the GAZ-24 (see GAZ-24-10) in 1986. Later history However the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia's difficult entry into the market economy froze these ambitions permanently. In 1992, the stampings of the GAZ-24 would completely deteriorate, and using the 3102s press forms, the GAZ-31029 would result on the conveyor (effectively the anticipated end- result, more than a decade late). At the same time, hand assembly of the GAZ-3102 has all but ceased as the target market, the mid-level officials, now had access to foreign cars, with whom the GAZ-3102 could not compete. No longer tied to the state, in 1993 GAZ made the 3102 available to the public. Again this was a temporary measure, as the small-volume unit anticipated a new car (in the form of GAZ-3105 and GAZ-3111, see below), but \\"temporarily\\" lacking one would leave a sizeable workforce unemployed. Without a stablemate (the GAZ-14 Chaika was forcibly retired in 1988, again see GAZ-3105 section) GAZ now had the resources to increase volumes to ten thousand per annum (which it reached in 1996). Adoption for greater volume assembly would require several modifications (or simplifications) to be performed. The novel, but ultimately troublesome in maintenance stratified charge ignition was removed, replaced by a standard ZMZ-402 engine. Another change was the location of the fuel tank and spare wheel. The original GAZ-24 had its tank under the boot, and the wheel fixed inside it, occupying a generous cargo volume. For the GAZ-3102, the fuel tank was moved behind the rear seat, and the spare took its place. Not only did this increase safety, but also ease of access at the petrol station (the hatch was located just below and slightly behind the C-pillar). For economical reasons, the GAZ-31029 retained the original configuration and in unifying the stamping forms, the 3102 was fitted with the older layout. It is not hard to pinpoint production year for any GAZ-3102 just by visual examination. The lower location of the fuel hatch‚Äîafter 1993. Metallic paint‚Äîafter 2001. Original door handles‚Äîbefore 2005. Despite a higher price, the GAZ-3102 enjoyed relatively good sales, and remained in demand. Compared to the GAZ-31029, it had a notably higher reputation for build quality. When the former was to be retired, and replaced with the GAZ-3110, the 3102 was fitted with 3110 upgrades, but not upgraded externally, as its look had become classic. The upgrades included a 5-speed gearbox, fuel- injected ZMZ-406 engine, ventilated Lucas disc brakes, a single rear axle, power steering, new electric dashboard and trim. In fact, all these features would be first tested on the GAZ-3102, before being introduced to the mass- produced Volga. This final arrangement would enter into a pattern, that would hold until 2009. Any novelty would first be introduced in the 3102, would be then fitted to the 3110 (and 31105 after 2005). Changes would include body- coloured door handles, electronically regulated door mirrors with indicator lights and twin-torsion beam rear suspension, removal of the archaic kingpins from front suspension, and new engines such as the ZMZ-405 or licence built Chrysler DOHC and Steyr Diesels. In early 2009, after nearly 26 and a half years in assembly, the GAZ-3102 would be finally retired. A total of 155,850 cars were hand built over the period, including 27 thousand original Volgas with the ZMZ-4022 engines. Variants Like the GAZ-23 and the GAZ-24-24, specialised V8 \\"Chasers\\" also existed, and these retained the original GAZ-3101 designation. The GAZ-31011 carried the ZMZ 503.10, based on the Chaika's original engine, the ZMZ-13 with 195 hp. The GAZ-31013, on the other hand, had the more powerful twin carburettor 220 hp ZMZ 505.10 based on V8 from the newer Chaika 14. No more than 300 such cars were produced for the 9th Directorate and its successor, the Federal Protective Service until 1996.–í–æ–ª–≥–∞ 24 v8–î–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ó–ú–ó-24-24, –ó–ú–ó-503.10, –ó–ú–ó-505.10–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ì–ê–ó–æ–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≤–æ—Å—å–º–µ—Ä–æ–∫ –ó–ú–ó V8. -13, -53-66, -14, -505, -500 —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π.
