Many species have opalescent bands on the metasoma. Nomia species are moderate- sized bees that nest in the ground. Most species nest solitarily, but some species also nest communally where females share a nest but where there are no queen or worker castes. Nomia species are found Africa, tropical Asia, Australia, and in North America. There are about 130 species world wide. Nomia melanderi is an important pollinator of alfalfa. They prefer to nest in salty soils. The Walla Walla Valley farmers in Washington State not only sell alfalfa, but some farmers also raise and sell this species of bee.  Identification   Wings  The marginal cell is rounded with the second submarginal cell being shorter than the first and third (three submarginal cells total). The basal vein is not as curved as other members of the family Halictidae.  Face & Body  Nomia has a rounded face with the eyes melding into the lower margin of the clypeus. As a result, the clypeus doesn't appear to extend abruptly below the face. The abdomen has bands of pearl/ivory that can be tinged with blue or green.  Nesting  Some Nomia nests in large aggregations, with over 700 nests per square yard found at one site (the largest aggregation of bees found in the world).

Construction  Friendship was one of thirty cutters ordered to be purchased by the Royal Navy in a three-month period from December 1762 to February 1763 for coastal duties off English ports.Winfield 2007, pp. 325 The function of these purchased cutters included convoy and patrol, the carrying of messages between Navy vessels in port and assisting the press gang in the interception of merchant craft. Admiralty Orders for her purchase were issued on 16 February 1763 with the transaction completed at a price of ¬£316. She was a small craft, single-masted and with an overall length of including bowsprit, a keel, a beam of and measuring 60 tons burthen. At the time of purchase she had been at sea as a merchant vessel for three years. On 8 April 1763 the newly purchased cutter was sailed to Woolwich Dockyard for fitting out as a Navy craft.

The bluff was previously occupied by a railroad and switching yard, until 1989 when ground was broken on developing a residential neighborhood. The location of the neighborhood and the views of the Mississippi River have drawn Memphians, such as Pat Halloran and Henry Turley, to purchase homes within the neighborhood.  Development  In 1989, Henry Turley, a local real estate maverick, broke ground on developing the area. Shortly after, in 1990, homes were open for sale. The neighborhood was founded upon principles of \\"New Urbanism,\\" and lies on the southern loop of the historic Memphis trolley route. South Bluffs was modeled after neighborhoods in large cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and New Orleans. Shaded drives are also named after developments and plantation homes along the Mississippi River in Louisiana and Mississippi. While houses were being developed (approximately 150) on private streets such as Nottoway Boulevard and Monteigne Boulevard, 260 apartments were built in two intervals. The first consisted of the building of 200 of these and shortly after 60 more were added as the neighborhood attracted more attention.Bologna, Tony R. \\"Updated Fact Sheet.\\" Message to the author. 3 Dec. 2015.

Houses range from $150,000 to $2,000,000, providing views within the neighborhood or overlooking the Mississippi River. Beginning at the northern end the neighborhood, there lies a River Walk that takes residents or pedestrians out of the neighborhood and closer towards Downtown Memphis. This River Walk provides individuals with views of the Mississippi River and Tom Lee Park, where national festivals, such as Memphis in May, are held. South Bluffs also lies in close proximity to the South Main Art District, where numerous restaurants and galleries are located. Streets entering the neighborhood are paved with historic cobble-stones that lead to two large fountains located at central intersections within the neighborhood. Between private drives, large medians are lined with high cast iron lights that are capped with historic acorn style luminaries. These lights illuminate the tree- lined medians and flowered gardens. Aside from houses, there is a large amount of apartments within the residential neighborhood. Apartment sizes range from 1 to 2 bedroom styles, providing various living arrangements for different sized families. Apartments are pet friendly and the neighborhood offers multiple dog bag dispensing stations. Additionally, the neighborhood offers a residential fitness center, along with 2 large pools. Next to the pools lies tennis courts for which equipment can be rented from offices within the neighborhood apartment complex.  Citations  *\\"Our History Henry Turley Company\\".

At the age of 48, during the period of changes that led, formally in 1990, to German reunification, Fikentscher switched to politics. As a member of the Social Democratic Party he was elected to the East German Volkskammer in the country's first‚Äîand last‚Äîfree election. He has subsequently played a leading role in city and state politics in Saxony-Anhalt and in the Halle region. Biography Early years and medical career Fikentscher was born in Probsthain, a village in Lower Silesia roughly 90 km (55 miles) west of Breslau. When he was 4 war ended, in May 1945, and frontier changes mandated by the victorious powers involved the transfer of Silesia from Germany to Poland. Implementation of the changes was accompanied by a major programme of ethnic cleansing: Fikentscher's family was relocated to Zwickau where he grew up. He passed his School Finals exam (Abitur) in 1959 and then transferred to the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg where he studied between 1961 and 1967, the year in which he qualified as a medical doctor. He then trained for a specialty in Otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose and throat medicine), qualifying in 1972. A higher habilitation degree followed in 1974. Between 1972 and 1981 he worked as an Otorhinolaryngologist, employed as a senior doctor (\\"Oberarzt\\") till 1985 at the Halle University Clinic. Between 1985 and 1990 he worked as a university lecturer in his speciality at Halle. Prior to 1989 Fikentscher was not politically active. Politics Political changes in the Soviet Union and economic stagnation at home led to a loss in self-confidence by the East German ruling class during the 1980s, which towards the end of the decade was accompanied by an increasingly open and widespread growth in opposition to the political status quo. New Forum was founded in September 1989. New Forum was a form of independent political party in a country where traditionally the only political parties permitted to operate were those controlled by the ruling party. R√ºdiger Fikentscher joined New Forum in September 1989. While the country's leaders, no longer able to rely on Soviet support for a repeat of the violent but effective repression of the 1953 uprising, hesitated over how to deal with New Forum, November 1989 saw a re-emergence in East Germany of the Social Democratic Party, some forty years after it had been controversially merged out of (independent) existence. R√ºdiger Fikentscher joined the Social Democratic Party in November 1989. In February 1990 he was elected district chairman of the party's Halle branch. The regional tier of government had been abolished in East Germany in 1952 as part of a programme to centralise political power, but East German states (L√§nder) were reinstated in 1990, and in August 1990 R√ºdiger Fikentscher became the SPD party chairman for Saxony-Anhalt. The next month, in September 1990, the East German SPD and what at that point was seen as the West German SPD were reintegrated: Fikentscher continued to serve as SPD party chairman for Saxony-Anhalt till 2002. He also served, between 1990 and 2010, as a member of the SPD National Council (SPD-Bundesparteirats) and, between 1995 and 2006, as its chairman. Through most of the country's existence, parliamentary elections in East Germany took place according to a \\"Single List\\" system. Voters were given a single list of candidates nominated by the party and invited to vote for it or against it. Voting against The List involved placing your voting slip in a separate ballot box while election officials looked on. The voting system was effective in ensuring that the party's list of candidates was endorsed by more than 99% the electorate, but it was not without its critics. For the 1990 General Election a new system was adopted, apparently inspired by the West German approach, whereby voters could choose between a number of different party lists. The 1990 election is generally reported as East Germany's first free general election (Die erste freie Volkskammerwahl). The SPD received 21.9% of the votes cast, which entitled it to 88 seats in the new 400 seat \\"Volkskammer\\" (National parliament). Although this was regarded as a disappointing result for the party, the name at the top of the list from the Halle district was that of R√ºdiger Fikentscher, who was duly elected and took his seat. The coalition government that resulted was dominated by the centre-right CDU party, but the SPD also took part in the coalition, the number of its seats swollen from 88 to 91 through the defection of three members elected on the list of the Democratic Farmers' Party. Following reunification, on 3 October 1990, Fikentscher was not one of the SPD Assembly members to join the short-lived enlarged Bundestag for a unified Germany, pursuing instead a career in the regional legislative assembly, based in Magdeburg. R√ºdiger Fikentscher sat as a member of the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag (legislative assembly) between 1990 and 2011, representing the Halle 3 electoral district. From 1990 till 1994, and again between 2002 and 2011 he was one of the Assembly's two vice-presidents. During the intervening period, between 1994 and 2002, he was the leader of the SPD group in the chamber. Since 2004 he has been a member of the Halle city council. Personal life Fikentscher is married, and has two children.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in Britain and Ireland in 1988, when she won four races including the Debutante Stakes and the Cheveley Park Stakes. After winning the Fred Darling Stakes on her three-year-old debut she failed to win again, although she was placed in both the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Sun Chariot Stakes. She later became a successful broodmare. Background Pass the Peace was a bay mare bred in Ireland by John Kent. She was sired by Alzao, a son of Lyphard who never won above Group Three level, but became a successful breeding stallion, his progeny including Alborada, Second Set and Shahtoush. Pass the Peace's dam Lover's Rose, was a minor winner in Ireland and a half-sister of the Geoffrey Freer Stakes winner Swell Fellow. She was descendant of the broodmare Grace Dalrymple, the female-line ancestor of the Australian champion Manikato. As a yearling, Pass the Peace was offered for sale and bought by Brian Bell. The filly was initially sent into training with Paul Cole at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire. She was ridden in all but one of her races by Richard Quinn. Racing career 1988: two-year-old season Pass the Peace made her racecourse debut in a five furlong maiden race at Salisbury Racecourse on 24 May. She started the 9/4 favourite, led for most of the way and won by a length from Whisper the Wind. She started favourite again in the Acorn Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 4 June but was beaten four lengths into second place by Waki Rainbow. On her next appearance she won a minor event at Windsor Racecourse in July beating Memphis Blues by a length, with a six length gap back to the rest of the nine runners. Pass the Peace was then moved up in class and sent to Ireland for the Group Three Debutante Stakes over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 20 August and started the 8/1 third favourite behind her fellow British challengers Miss Secreto and Shyoushka. She recorded her first major success as she won by two lengths from Blasted Heath with Miss Secreto a length away in third. On 28 September Pass the Peace ended her season in the Cheveley Park Stakes (then the only British Group One race restricted to two-year-old fillies) over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. The undefeated Dancing Tribute started the odds-on favourite with Pass the Peace the 5/1 second choice in the betting, whilst the other five runners were Jaljuli, Mrs Jenney, Gloriella (Queen Mary Stakes), Konbola and Bocas Rose (St Hugh's Stakes). Quinn settled the filly before overtaking the front-running Gloriella in the last quarter mile. She stayed on well in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Dancing Tribute with Jaljuli a length and a half away in third place. 1989: three-year-old season For the 1989 season, Brian Bell removed Pass the Peace from Cole's stable and sent her to be trained by his son Michael Bell, who had just begun training at Newmarket. Michael Bell had worked as an assistant to Cole who once told him \\"all you're going to do is pick my brains and pinch my owners\\". Bell had not trained a winner before Pass the Peace appeared in the Fred Darling Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 14 April. Starting the 11/8 favourite against nine opponents, she took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from Russian Royal with five lengths and a short head back to Spring Sparkle and the Waterford Candelabra Stakes winner Life at the Top in third and fourth. In an unusually small field of seven for the 1000 Guineas on 4 May, she started the joint second favourite at odds of 7/2. She raced in second place for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Musical Bliss. Ten days after her defeat at Newmarket, Pass the Peace was sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She was amongst the leaders from the start and kept on well in the straight and finished second of the sixteen runners, three quarters of a length behind Pearl Braceclet and the same distance ahead of Golden Opinion. The filly returned to France for the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 11 June. She was in fourth place entering the straight but then faded and finished twelfth of the fourteen runners behind Lady in Silver. After a break of almost four months, Pass the Peace returned in the Sun Chariot Stakes (then a Group Two race over ten furlongs) at Newmarket on 7 October. Ridden for the first and only time by George Duffield she finished third of the nine runners behind Braiswick and Life at the Top. On her final racecourse appearance, the filly was sent to Italy three weeks later to contest the Group Three Premio Bagutta over 1600 metres at the San Siro Racecourse in Milan. She was reunited with Quinn and finished second, one and a half lengths behind the locally trained Rosa de Caerleon. Breeding record Pass the Peace was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She produced at least ten foals and six winners between 1992 and 2007: *Puck's Castle, a bay filly, foaled in 1992, sired by Shirley Heights. Won one race. *Nanshan, bay filly, 1993, sired by Nashwan. Failed to win in two races. Grand-dam of Atlantic Jewel. *Embassy, bay filly, 1995, by Cadeaux Genereux. Won three races including the Princess Margaret Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. Grand-dam of King's Apostle (Prix Maurice de Gheest). *Areen Alasad, bay colt, 1996, by Cadeaux Genereux. Failed to win in eight races. *Tarfshi, bay filly, 1998, by Mtoto. Won five races including the Hoppings Stakes, Dahlia Stakes and Pretty Polly Stakes. *Bayhirr, bay colt, 2001, by Selkirk. Won one race. *Andorra, filly, 2003, by Cadeaux Genereux. Unraced. *Malyana, bay filly, 2004, by Mtoto. Won three races. *Two Pass, bay filly, 2005, by Mtoto.

It is a not-for-profit organization, learned society catering to the Chemical Sciences as well as a professional, qualifying and examination body looking after and responsible for the maintenance and enhancement of the profession of Chemistry in Sri Lanka. It is the oldest such body in any branch of the basic sciences in Sri Lanka. The Golden Jubilee of the Institute was held in 1991 & the Diamond Jubilee in 2001. The Institute of Chemistry Ceylon was incorporated by Act of Parliament No. 15 of 1972.  History  Chemistry was taught as a pre-medical subject at Ceylon as early as 1900 in Ceylon. Later it was taught at the Ceylon Technical College for medical students and students taking the external general degree examination of the University of London. The University College in Ceylon was established in January 1921. With the establishment of the University College as an institution for graduate studies, chemistry was one of the science departments, set up under the Headship of Mr. W. Rae. With Mr. L. P. C. Chandrasena joining Mr. Rae, courses for the London External Degree Examination in B.Sc. (General) and B.Sc. (Special) were started. At that period of time, there were the three Research Institutes set up by the colonial regime; Tea Research Institute, Rubber Research Institute and Coconut Research Institute. Besides, there were the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Research Institute and the Government Analyst's Department. Except for the University College and the Government Analyst's Department, the organisations were not in Colombo. Mr. D. H. Balfour with chemistry as a subject in his Tripos from Cambridge University, joined the Ceylon Civil Service. He felt that there were possibilities of starting chemical industries in Ceylon. He convinced the Minister of Industries, Mr. C. G. S Corea and obtained a Treasury Grant to carry out research. He set up the Industrial Research Laboratory where chemistry graduates initially worked before they found suitable employment. During the Second World War, when many of the essential items were scarce or were not available, Ceylon decided to produce some of these essential items. The factories were set up not in the main city but at a fair distance from the city. Chemists were appointed to these factories and these chemists would not have personal contacts. In 1940, the chemists engaged in different chemical fields such as university teaching, chemical research, analytical chemistry and forensic chemistry. Those working in these factories felt the need to have a Society of their own, to meet and exchange views and discuss current problems. There was a need for professional interaction. Dr. N. G. Baptist and Dr. A. A. Hoover approached Prof. A. Kandiah, Professor of Chemistry, University College in Ceylon, with a proposal to start an Association. Prof. Kandiah showed some reluctance at first but later realising the importance of having an association agreed to the proposal. May be, he was cautious as Ceylon was still a colony under the British rule. The government employed many of the chemists and permission had to be obtained from the Government for these chemists to be members of such an Association. Dr. Hoover addressed a letter to the Chief Secretary on 19 December 1940, seeking permission for the formation of the Chemical Society. The letter gave the objectives of the society and names of likely office bearers. The Chief Secretary by his letter No. HB 4/41 of 23 January 1941, informed the Registrar, Medical College through whom the application was sent, that there was no objection to Dr. Hoover or any Public Officer becoming a member or holding office in such a society provided the objectives were purely scientific and did not involve them in any breach of Public Service Regulations. As a result of these activities, a meeting of all interested in the formation of the Chemical Society, comprising about 35 chemists working in different fields, met on 25 January 1941, in the Chemistry Lecture Theater of University College and the Chemical Society was inaugurated. This was indeed a historic event and arguably marks the first ever beginning of the organisation within the basic sciences in this country. The conveners sought the help and cooperation of the senior chemists from the Agricultural Department (Dr. A. W. R. Joachim), the Tea Research Institute (Dr. A. Norris), the Rubber Research Institute (Mr. T. O'Brien), the Coconut Research Institute (Dr. R. Child), the Department of Industries (Mr. D. H. Balfour), The Government Analyst's Department (Mr. W. R. Chanmugam) and the Salt Department (Mr. C. E. Foenander).  Chemical Society Ceylon  The group photograph of the members who were present at the first meeting The design of the Rs. 1 postage stamp issued by the Post Master General on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Institute on 25-01-91 incorporates the structure of CALABAXANTHONE which is the first natural product to be isolated in Sri Lanka. The production of Graduate Chemists by the Institute was also highlighted in the design of this stamp. The first Meeting of the Ceylon Chemical Society was held on 7 June 1941, when members were elected as office bearers of the Society. Prof. A. Kandiah was elected as the President and Dr. A. A. Hoover and Dr. M. L. M. Salgado as Honorary Secretaries. Five members were elected as Vice Presidents namely, Dr. R. Child, Dr. A. W. R. Joachim, Dr. E. L. Fonseka, Mr. D. H. Balfour and Mr. T. E. H. O'Brien. The objectives of the Chemical Society, Ceylon were cultivate and promote the cause of chemical sciences by all practical means and raise the status and advance the interests of the Profession of Chemistry in Ceylon.  Formation of the Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon  The formation of a professional body of chemists was first discussed at the Annual General Meeting of the Chemical Society on December 13, 1968. A committee was given the task of preparing the constitution for formation of Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon based on the Constitution of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, UK and the Institution of Engineers, Ceylon in August 1970. The draft constitution for the formation of the Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon was finalised. At a Special General Meeting held on July 5, 1971, the following resolution was passed. ‚ÄúThe Chemical Society of Ceylon resolves to reconstitute itself into a body here-in-after called and known as the Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon\\". Dr. M. A. V. Devanathan was elected as the first President of the Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon. The Incorporation Bill was presented by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, M. P. for Beliatta and Mr. Wilfred Sennanayake, M. P. for Homagama for adaption by Parliament. The Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon was then incorporated by the Act of Parliament No.15 of 1972, the effective date of assent being April 28, 1972. The objectives of the Institute are given in several clauses in the Act. The Institute is to be a Professional and Academic Institution with the purpose to promote and advance the science of chemistry and to promote the education of chemistry at all levels and assist the Private Sector and the Public Sector in all aspects and look after the interests of chemists in general. The Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon is now a professional qualifying body and a learned society. The Institute has been established for the general advancement of the science and practice of chemistry and the enhancement of the status of the profession of chemistry in Sri Lanka. The Institute represents all branches of the profession and its membership is recognized by the government and its qualification, particularly the Graduateship Certificate (GIC) is accepted by the private and public sector organisations. The Royal Society of Chemistry, UK and the Royal Australian Chemical Institute have accepted the GIC qualification for admission to their societies. Besides, many universities in Sri Lanka and in foreign countries have accepted the qualification for the students to continue their postgraduate studies in their universities. The Institute reached the above recognition by planned series of activities.  The Laboratory Technicians Training Course  There was a great need to have Middle level personnel like laboratory technician in many laboratories involved in teaching, research, services and quality assurance activities. In 1973, trained personnel available laboratory technician were the Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLT). MLT were recruited by the Health Department and they were trained for a period of two years and then they were attached to hospitals and other medical institutions. The Institute started a training course with a syllabus in basic chemistry and subjects in some specialised areas so that these technicians could fit into any laboratory. The syllabus was revised periodically. Then in 1998, the Laboratory Technicians Certificate course was upgraded to a Diploma Course (DLTC). By then, there were about 600 technicians trained. Those who underwent this training could apply to follow the GIC course. Some have done that and now they are graduate chemists. Up to 2015 the number of qualified chemical technicians the Institute has produced is 1,026. Eighty qualified as chemical technicians in 2015.  Graduateship Course in Chemistry  The need for a course in chemistry equivalent to a four-year special degree in chemistry provided by the universities was considered by the Institute Council. 1970s were a period, when admissions to the universities in Sri Lanka were becoming more and more competitive. Many students with good grades at the G.C.E (Advanced) level examination failed to enter the universities because of the system of admissions. There were also students, who entered the universities but were unable to do a special four-year course in chemistry because the number of places available for such course was limited in the university. There were also many in the industry who wanted to follow a course in chemistry to enhance their career. The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) had several courses that helped many who wanted to qualify while working. With the decision to start this Graduate course, the Council successfully negotiated with Aquinas College of Higher Studies (ACHS), where the Institutes Licentiate Technician Training Course (LTTC) was already functioning, to conduct the Graduate in Chemistry Course PART I on Friday evenings, full day on Saturday and Sunday morning. Based on the request, ACHS advertised the Part 1 course with the course fees fixed by them. Out of 175 applications received, 72 were selected by the Institute appointed selection committee. With permission obtained from the universities, the lecturers from the universities conducted these classes. The management was with ACHS. Part I course proceeded without any problem. The time to start the Part II and the chemistry practicals, the Institute approached ACHS with the proposals. For some unexplained reasons, in 1980 ACHS agreed to complete the two-year Part I course but refused to continue the Part II and the practicals. The council did not understand the reason behind this refusal and the council was in serious trouble. They could not let the first batch of 72 students down. There were members in the council who were very critical of the officials for starting a programme of this nature without a detailed study. But a programme of this nature may never have commenced if every possible problem had to be cleared. Now it was not a time to find faults but jointly find a solution. Many members decided to find a suitable solution. Looking for another avenue for conducting the course was the easier way of solving the problem. The office bearers in the council visited schools and teaching establishments with laboratory facilities. They visited Zahira College, Visaka Vidalaya, Stafford Ladies College, Pembroke Academy and St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. Institute decided to discuss the subject of starting the courses with St. Thomas College (STC). The Board of Governors of this college agreed to allow the use of the new science building and the laboratory to conduct our classes. The Council of the Institute of Chemistry was grateful to the Warden Mr. l. C. Illangovan, Bishop Swinthin Fernando, Chairman of the Board of Governors, Mr. G. A. C. Sirimanne, Secretary to the Board and other members of St. Thomas Board of Governors. Finding a suitable, good avenue was a great success to the Institute. STC provided the Institute the necessary infrastructure and resources but the college was not agreeable to run the programme in a manner similar to that at ACHS. The Institute had to manage programme like taking over the administration and financial arrangement. STC provided a Coordinator (a science teacher) and staff for laboratory and classrooms. All the staff had to be remunerated by the Institute. Having been able to get a venue to run the programme, the Institute had to plan various other activities like management of the course, to see everything went according to a set plan.  Educational Committee  The Institute took over the complete management of the Graduate programme from January 1981. In order to place the programme in sound footing, the Council created an Educational Committee that would specifically promote education and academic affairs on behalf of the Council. The Educational Committee took over the duties to promote education, training and other academic affairs in addition to other management needs. The Educational Committee received the fees and deposited it as a separate account with the approval of the council. Once there was a misunderstanding about the utilisation of this fund, whether the fund could be used by council activities such as holding of international conferences or seminars. It was decided by the council in July 1981, \\"Educational fund and Graduate courses money must be utilised as decided by the Educational Committee\\". However, a part of the Registration fees was given to the General Institute account for the management by the Institute. The Educational Committee functioned well and courses were managed by the appointment of Coordinators to each course. The committee looked into the course content and made necessary changes and introduced several optional courses. In January 2001, the Diamond Jubilee year of the Chemical Society and its successor the Institute of Chemistry, the College of Chemical Sciences was inaugurated with the view to increasing the activities and obtaining recognition as an Educational Institution. At the Council meeting of June 1, 2001, the rules of the College Chemical Sciences were approved and adopted at the subsequent Annual General Meeting of the Institute.  The New Building  The new building of the InstituteChemical Society and then the Institute of Chemistry until 1977 had no office or staff. All the activities were looked after by the Chairman and officials. The need for building to conduct the activities was felt badly and various efforts were made to have a building. In the meantime, in 1981, the Sri Lanka Association for Advancement of Science (SLAAS) agreed to rent a small room in their building. The Institute for the first time employed a full-time clerk typist and a retired store keeper as Office and Course Assistant. Later, they were able to get a larger space to accommodate increased staff and greater activities. Finally after great efforts, the Institute obtained a land in Rajagiriya and built a Headquarters building and named it as Adamantane House. The building with about 20,000 square foot of floor space has an auditorium, lecture theatres, large library space, laboratories, instrument room, Board room and staff rooms. All lectures and practicals of the courses are conducted in the building.  Logo  Institute of Chemistry LogoThe Logo of the Institute contains the structure of Adamantane, which is a stable molecule that was synthesized in 1941, the founding year of the Institute's predecessor, the Chemical Society of Ceylon.  Grades of Membership of the Institute   Corporate Membership  Full membership of the Institute is referred to as Corporate Membership and consists of two grades, i.e. FELLOW (F.I.Chem.C.) and MEMBER (M.I.Chem.C.).  Non‚ÄìCorporate membership  Non‚ÄìCorporate membership consists of four grades, (two of which are transitional form of membership), which are open for application by individuals. These are ASSOCIATE (A.I.Chem.C.) & LICENTIATE (L.I.Chem.C.). The third grade of non corporate membership is called AFFILIATE and is open to any one who shows a genuine interest in the Chemical Sciences. The fourth non ‚Äì corporate grade of membership is referred to as Honorary Fellow (Hon.F.I.Chem.C.). It is the responsibility of the Council to elect Honorary Fellows after considering nominations made by Fellows of the Institute. In November 2001, the Institute conferred Honorary Fellowships on Datuk Dr Mohinder Singh (Malaysia), Mr C P de Silva and Prof P P G L Siriwardene. Also Dr A.G. Ashmore (RSC, UK), Prof A P de Silva, Dr R O B Wijesekara, Professor Arjuna Aluwihare, Professor Dayantha Wijeyesekera, Dr. Kingsley de Silva & Professor Atta-ur-Rahman were conferred Honorary Fellowships in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2007, 2009, 2013 & 2014 respectively. The grades of Fellow, Member and Associate have been recognised and accepted by the Government of Sri Lanka as alternate qualifications to the parallel grades of Fellow (FRSC), Member (MRSC) and Associate (AMRSC) respectively of the Royal Society of Chemistry, UK for the purposes of recruitment and promotion of Chemists (Vide Establishment Circular No. 234 of 9-3-77)  Chartered Chemist (C. Chem.)  A Member or Fellow or an experienced practicing Chemist seeking the award of the designation of Chartered Chemist shall need to demonstrate a high level of competence and professionalism in the practice of chemistry and show their commitment to maintain their expertise. They will need to have at least five years of professional experience subsequent to a good enhanced first degree or can demonstrate an equivalent level of attainment.  International Relations  At an international level, the Institute is a founder member of the Federation of Asian Chemical Societies (FACS, established 1979). Two Executive Committee meetings of FACS have been held in Sri Lanka in 2004 & 2014\\\\. It is since 2009 a full member of the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry, (IUPAC). Regular contact is maintained with the Royal Society of Chemistry, UK, the Royal Australian Chemical Institute, the American Chemical Society and parallel professional bodies in other countries. The Royal Society of Chemistry, UK co-ordinates the external moderation/ examination of question papers/scripts of the Graduateship Examinations. The Australian National Chemistry Quiz conducted in Sri Lanka by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute for successive years. Students in the Senior Division who answer all questions correctly are annually awarded scholarships to follow the entire Graduateship Programmes free of charge.  Annual Sessions  Annual sessions are a principal annual activity of the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon which is conducted every June and enables members to present their research papers at technical sessions. The Annual Session commences with a formal Ceremonial Inauguration, during which the out going President delivers a Presidential Address and the Annual Awards of the Institute are presented. The Annual General Meeting of the Institute, at which the Council for the next year is elected, is also held after the Ceremonial Inauguration. Award Addresses and Memorial Lectures are also delivered during the Annual Session. Each Annual Session usually has a Theme designated by the President. A Theme Seminar based on the theme is usually conducted to emphasize the areas covered by the theme. More recently it has become the practice to invite a number of foreign scientists to participate in the theme seminar which has tended in recent years to become a bigger event than a mere theme seminar as in the past. In line with these developments regional /international seminars have been conducted from 2005. This activity reached a peak with the conduct of a fully organized international conference called CHEMTECH in 2007 as part of its 36th Annual Sessions. Another International Conference on the theme ‚ÄúRole of Chemistry Research in National Development‚Äù was held in June 2012 as part of the 41st Annual Sessions. The Annual Dinner of the Institute is conducted jointly with the Sri Lanka Section of the Royal Society of Chemistry at the end of every annual session. The new President of the Institute is formally inducted into his office by the out going President during the Annual Dinner.  Other Activities  The Institute of Chemistry Ceylon conducts various professional academic and dissemination activities every year. These include Quiz competitions and Titration Competition amongst school children, Lectures, Orations, Training Seminars, Exhibitions, Industrial visits & Social activities.  CHEMEX exhibitions  CHEMEX I was held with the global recognition given to Chemistry by the United Nations Organization in 2011 when the year was declared as the International Year of Chemistry. A grand exhibition CHEMEX 2011 and trade fair was organized by the Institute under the theme ‚ÄúWonders of Chemistry‚Äù. The exhibition was held from 27th ‚Äì 30 January 2011 at the BMICH. The as a continuation of the project the Institute conducted CHEMEX II in the year 2012 followed by CHEMEX III in the year 2014 both within the Institute premises at Rajagiriya both of which were huge successes.  The all Island Chemistry Quiz  The all Island Chemistry quiz is for G.C.E (Advance Level) Students. On the basis of the Preliminary written paper the best school in each Province is selected. The best individual performer is selected. The selected schools then contest for the Challenge Shield.  The Australian National Chemistry Quiz  The Australian National Chemistry Quiz is conducted annually in July by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute in a number of countries especially in Asian Pacific Region. The Australian Organisation provides the question paper, the multiple choice answer sheets and other materials in English. The Sri Lankan organisation took the additional responsibility of translating the question paper to Sinhala and Tamil. Over the years number of districts and number of students have participated in this competition.  Inter-school Titration Competition  The Institute of Chemistry Ceylon conducts Inter school Titration Competition annually since 2011 with a view to increasing enthusiasm and interest in Chemistry among young generation which is one of the major objective of the International Year of Chemistry (IYC 2011). Another objective is to enhancing the laboratory skills of A/L Science students. The institute provides chemicals, equipments and other laboratory facilities at its Adamantane House as well as the services of well qualified chemists to conduct the above programme. The First National Titration Competition was held from 15 ‚Äì 21 November 2011 with the participation of 42 schools. The Second National Titration Competition was held from 26 ‚Äì 30 November 2012 with the participation of 21 schools. The Third National Titration Competition was held from 30 September to 1 October 2013 with the participation of 18 schools. An additional titration competition was held at the University of Jaffna on 22 March 2013 in which about 180 students from the schools in the Northern Province participated. The National Titration Competition is held with the consent of the Ministry of Education, and therefore, all the relevant Government schools in the island are able to participate.

It was formed by the singer- songwriter Henri Gonzo in late 2011 in Budapest, Hungary. The band‚Äôs music and style are characterized by different genres, mostly by indie, rock and roll, afro pop and even by Mediterranean vibes. The unique and original soundscape requires a bigger band on the stage. The specialty of the band comes not just from mixing different instruments, but from the diverse origin of the members. They have a vivid inherited cultural background such as Cuban, Spanish, Greek and Hungarian. By now Fran Palermo has become one of Budapest‚Äôs main concert bands, owning numerous loyal fans. History The band released their first EP called Arizona at the end of 2011. Their next records, both EPs, are called Museum of Clouds (2012), produced by Zolt√°n Tak√°cs and recorded at Abnormal Studios, and Natural Cash (2013). In 2013, Henri Gonzo moved to England for one and a half years, thus during this period the band only gave occasional concerts. After the ‚Äògap-year‚Äô and a dynamic come back, the band released a new EP called Sun in Splendour, as the herald of the first full-length album. In 2015, the first Self Titled album brought a new, tropical jungle-rock sound to the Hungarian music scene. The real recognition and popularity followed the release. Ever since then, the band performed at each famous Hungarian music festival and was also finalist in a prestigious song competition. After their performance in the talent show called Nagy-Sz√≠n-Pad, where they received the highest votes from the jury, Fran Palermo was chosen the ‚ÄúDiscovery of the Year‚Äù at Pet≈ëfi Music Awards and a year later already nominated as the \\"Best Hungarian Act‚Äù. Only a year after their debut album, in May 2016 they released Razzle Dazzle, which is the band‚Äôs most vivid, colorful and diverse album yet and finished on every Hungarian album top list of the year. In 2017 the group released their latest EP called Bonerider which‚Äôs debut concert took place at the Big Hall of Budapest‚Äôs Akv√°rium club in front of a 1000+ audience. The album was later claimed as one of Hungary‚Äôs best releases of the year. Fran Palermo is a returning guest to each great festival, such as Sziget Festival, VOLT Festival, but they also performed at Telekom Electronic Beast Festival, Budapest Showcase Hub and at the Dutch Eurosonic Norderslag Showcase 2017 in Groningen. Electric Castle and Awake Festival in Romania. Lately the band was as well selected to perform at one of the biggest showcase festivals of the region to MENT in Ljubljana and Waves in Vienna in Austria.

G. L. Swamy. This book won him the Kendra Sahitya Academy award given by the Government of India. As a result, Gundappa and Swamy became the first father and son duo to win this award. Hasuru honnu is a treatise on some familiar and unfamiliar botanical specimens, but it is also a travelogue enlivened by human drama and humor. Students of Advanced Botany undertake scientific tours in the company of their teachers for the identification and collection of botanical specimens. Swamy was deeply interested in history and the fine arts such as music, painting and architecture. Thus, as an artist and a scientist, he could explore and explain the world of botany in the light of a wider understanding. He describes the externals of a specimen with vivid precision and technical detail but his account of the genus and species is only a prelude to a livelier non-technical account of its appearance, its locations and practical uses. Sometimes the reader is treated to an excursion into the past to discover how the specimen claimed attention by figuring in well-known literary works of antiquity. The book thus unfolds before the reader the abundant riches and the endless variety of the botanical world and the hundred ways in which it helps humans. The human variety and the different characters all memorably visualized provide ample scope for portraying dramatic situations of all kinds, from the comic to the romantic. The book primarily deals with the world of plants but it deals also with the world of humans. Hasiru honnu is as informative as it is delightful. It won him the 'Sahitya Akademi Award' in 1978.

It is a shrub, formerly known as Eremophila inflata but unlike eremophilas, this species has twisted stamens and an urn-shaped petal tube which remains attached to the fruits after flowering.  Description  Calamphoreus inflatus is a shrub sometimes growing to a height of and spreading to wide with branches that are slightly sticky when young. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, thick, sticky and elliptic or narrow lance-shaped. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to 5 in the axils of leaves on a stalk long. There are 5 oblong sepals which are hairy, and after flowering develop a network of distinct veins. There are also 5 petals joined at their bases, forming an expanded bell-shaped tube. The petal tube is purple except inside the tube where it is white, spotted with purple. The tube is long with lobes that are rounded and of unequal lengths. There are 4 short stamens with twisted or curved filaments. Flowering occurs mainly in summer and is followed by densely hairy, oval-shaped fruits about long with the dried petal tube remaining on the outside. Taxonomy and naming Calamphoreus inflatus was first formally described in 1942 by Charles Gardner in Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia as Eremophila inflata from a specimen collected in the Coolgardie district near Mount Holland and Lake Cronin. The genus name (Calamphoreus) is from the Ancient Greek words kalos meaning \\"beautiful\\" and amphoreus meaning \\"two-handled vase\\", \\"pitcher\\", \\"jar\\", \\"jug\\" or \\"cinerary urn\\" referring to the shape of the flowers. The specific epithet (inflatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"puffed up\\" or \\"swollen\\".  Distribution and habitat Calamphoreus inflatus occurs from Lake King to Mount Holland and in nearby areas in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. It has also been recorded east of Hyden. It grows in gravelly loam on flats and disturbed sites. Conservation Calamphoreus inflatus is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture Commonly cultivated as Eremophila inflata, this species grows well in most soils provided it is well drained and in a sunny position. It is most easily propagated from cuttings.

The examination is organized by the Association of Teachers in Biological Sciences in association with Indian Association of Physics Teachers and Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE). Each year over 30,000 students of 12th Standard or below , sit for this examination. Eligibility The examination is intended for students in 12th standard, though 11th standard students are also allowed to give the examination. Usually, the qualifying students are from 12th standard. Qualification There is a designated statewise quota according to which the students are selected for the next stage i.e. INBO. Further all students scoring greater than 80% of the average of the top ten scores at national level(called as Merit Index Score) get automatically selected irrespective of the statewise quota. Usually the top 1% students from this examination are selected to sit for the Indian National Biology Olympiad. Format The NSEB comprises only multiple choice questions. The questions include plant physiology, genetics and human physiology. The stress on biochemistry is more in the NSEB than in the typical school syllabi. Fee As per new revised norms the fee for the NSEB is about Rs. 150. Application for this examination is typically handled through the school/college to which the student is affiliated.  Indian National Biology Olympiad  It's held in January, and consists of objective as well as subjective questions. The top 35 performers here, are selected for the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Biology , where they're trained and tested in theory and experiment.

Overview   Background  The Indian Navy is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces and is led by the President of India as Commander-in-Chief. The Chola Emperor, Rajendrar of the Early South India is considered as \\"Father of the Indian Navy\\". The Indian Navy has an important role in securing the marine borders of the country as well as enhancing the international relations of India through seaport visits, joint exercises, humanitarian calamity relief and so on. The modern Indian Navy has as undergone speedy renovation in order to improve its position in the Indian Ocean region. The strength of the Indian Navy includes over 67,000 personnel and about 150 ships and submarines.  Reason for celebrating Navy Day  Navy Day in India originally coincided with the Royal Navy's Trafalgar Day. In 1944, the Royal Indian Navy celebrated Navy Day in October, the month of its commissioning in 1944. In 1945, after World War 2, Navy Day was celebrated on 1 December. On the night of 30 November 1945, on the eve of the Navy Day celebrations, Indian ratings painted the slogans such as Inqualab Zindabad. But the old traditions of the British Navy gave way to new reasons to celebrate the day. Navy Day in India is now celebrated to commemorate Operation Trident, which was the attack on the Karachi harbor during the Indo-Pakistan war (on 4 December 1971) by the Indian Naval Missile boats as well in to reverence all the martyrs of that war. During the attack, Indian sailors communicated in Russian to avoid detection. No Indian sailors were killed in the attack.

It is currently based in Kapchagay. The brigade traces its history back to the Soviet Union as the 111th Guards Airborne Regiment, formed in 1948 as part of the 11th Guards Airborne Division. After the 11th Guards Airborne Division was disbanded in April 1955, the regiment became part of the 105th Guards Vienna Airborne Division. The 105th Guards Airborne Division was broken up in the fall of 1979 and the regiment became the 35th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the brigade became part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan and was renamed to the 35th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade.  History  military unit number is 32363. The brigade was formed on 1 October 1948 in Ryazan of the 111th Guards Airborne Regiment from elements of the 347th Guards Airlanding Regiment, part of the 11th Guards Airborne Division. In April 1955, the division was disbanded and the regiment transferred to the 105th Guards Vienna Airborne Division. In October 1956, the regiment was relocated to Rybinsk. The division was transferred to the Turkestan Military District in August 1960 and the regiment was relocated to Osh. In 1968, the regiment held joint exercises with the 351st Guards Airborne Regiment. The regiment reportedly showed solid skills for action in the mountain wilderness and was praised by higher command. In 1969, the regiment participated in tactical exercises with the troops of the Central Asian Military District and received a good evaluation. Its performance in exercises with the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment and the 351st Guards Airborne Regiment were also evaluated as good. In 1973, it conducted exercises with the troops of the Central Asian Military District. The regiment was to \\"destroy\\" a separate missile battalion of a tank division. The regiment parachuted into four landing areas, which allowed them to immediately encircle the battalion's positions. Army General Nikolay Lyashchenko observed the exercises and thanked the paratroopers for their actions. The personnel of the regiment were systemically prepared for mountain warfare. The brigade conducted airdropping exercises to seize the dominant mountain heights and passes in event of a war. In 1967, the regiment's 1st Airborne Battalion was dropped on a plateau with an altitude of 3600 meters. Soviet battle flag of the brigade The difficulty of mountain training can be judged by the fact that only 15 out of the 200 soldiers in the 100th Separate Guards Reconnaissance Company and the 1st Airborne Company of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment reached the summit of Peak Harvest in the Alay Mountains at an altitude of 4000 meters. On 27 July 1968, paratroopers were landed on the slopes of Lenin Peak at an altitude of 7100 meters. This group included ten men from the regiment. Before this dropping, a landing on the foot of Lenin Peak took place at an altitude of 6100 meters by 36 conscripts of the regiment under the command of Captain George Taynasa. According to the military authorities, the 111th was to land in Xinjiang and capture Urumqi in the event of large-scale conflict with China. Brigade organization in 1987 In July 1979, its 2nd Battalion was deployed to Bagram to perform security tasks. After the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, the battalion became part of the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment. In the fall, the division was broken up into three separate air assault brigades and the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment. The 111th became the 35th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade in October. The 104th Separate Guards Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion was also included in the new brigade. It was relocated to Cottbus in East Germany and subordinated to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. The official brigade formation day is considered to be 20 November, when its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolai Shvets, issued his first order. In East Germany, the brigade was composed of as many as 3,000 soldiers. In April 1991 it was moved from its garrison at Cottbus in the former East Germany to Kapchagay in the Kazakh SSR due to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany. On 28 May, the brigade arrived in Kapchagay in the Almaty Region of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. According to the plan of Soviet military leadership, the 35th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade, 56th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade and the 387th Separate Airborne Regiment would be used to reconstitute the 105th Guards Airborne Division. The brigade was ordered to begin the reformation of the 111th Guards Airborne Regiment, which was to be completed by 1 October 1992. The regiment was to be based in Kapchagay. In preparation for the reformation of the 111th, the brigade was renamed the 35th Guards Separate Airborne Brigade and transferred to the Soviet airborne. Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the 105th was not reformed and the brigade was withdrawn from the incomplete 105th Guards Airborne Division on 24 April 1992. It was taken over by Kazakh authorities on 13 May 1992. Soldiers of the brigade in an An-12 preparing for an airborne drop, 1996 From the summer of 1992 to July 1994 elements of the brigade formed a consolidated battalion with other Kazakh units and fought in the Tajikistani Civil War. The combined battalion suffered total casualties of 54 killed and missing. However, the brigade's elements in the combined battalion suffered none of these casualties. Between 1993 and 1996, the brigade was commanded by Ouali Yelamanov, who went on to command the Kazakh airmobile forces. On 20 April 1993 it was renamed the 35th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade. Due to the outflow of Russian personnel and funding shortages due to the poor state of the Kazakh economy, there was a personnel shortage in the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan. The officer shortage forced Kazakh military leadership to reduce the size of units. The brigade was forced to disband the 4th Battalion, a reconnaissance company, and the airborne mortar batteries. It also reduced the size of the artillery battalions. By the summer of 1995, the brigade was composed of 1,500 soldiers. Soldiers of the brigade marching in honor of the Day of the Airborne Forces on 2 August 2007 in Kapchagay The Kazakh Mobile forces were created on 6 July 2000. On 11 August, the brigade was subordinated to the Southern Military District. The brigade became part of the mobile forces on 1 February 2001. The mobile forces were renamed the Airmobile Troops on 12 November 2003. With the growth of the Kazakh economy and increased funding, a partial reformation of the disbanded units began. The mortar batteries, the reconnaissance company, a heavy machine gun company armed with the NSV-12.7 and a reactive artillery battery equipped with the BM-21 Grad were formed. Brigade units tested new parachute systems and powered paragliding. Currently, there are around 1,000 soldiers in the brigade.

Replacing a dirt road that formerly covered the route, it opened in 2016; using open road tolling, it is considered to be the first privately built toll road to be constructed in the state of Florida. A multi-use trail parallels the road along the old dirt roadway. Route description The Orchard Pond Parkway covers a distance of roughly , and is a super two-style toll road, with two, undivided traffic lanes. The road follows an east‚Äìwest path in northern and northwestern Leon County, Florida, in the rural‚Äìurban fringe area of Tallahassee, the state's capital city. Connecting Meridian Road (CR 155) with Old Bainbridge Road (CR 0361), the eastern end of Orchard Pond Parkway routes into Bannerman Road (CR 0342), providing a connection to U.S. Route 319 (US 319) and providing a complete bypass route across the northern quadrant of Tallahassee. The speed limit on the route is set at . The parkway was built partially along the route of, and replaced, Orchard Pond Road, an unimproved dirt road which had, prior to the construction of the parkway, been the only route allowing access across the northwestern quadrant of Tallahassee north of Interstate 10 (I-10). It had long been considered an especially hazardous route due to its condition, with a rough surface, narrow lanes, and tight bends; drivers following the route often found it taking 30 minutes or more to traverse the short distance, which would become muddy during heavy rains and washboarded during dry spells. The road also was an environmental hazard, with mud, silt, and debris flowing off of the roadway into lakes along its route during major rainstorms. History Orchard Pond Parkway route marker The first privately built toll road to be constructed in Florida, and the first toll road built in Leon County, Florida, construction of the Orchard Pond Parkway was begun in January 2015. The projected completion date was January 2016, although the project was delayed by several months. Constructed by Jeff Phipps, owner of Orchard Pond Plantation, the route was handed over to the Leon County government upon completion, to be leased back to the constructor over a 99-year term with the lease fees acting as payment for the route. The cost of the project was approximately $17 million, $13.5 million of which was provided as a loan from the Florida Department of Transportation Infrastructure Bank; of recycled concrete was used during the construction of the roadway. The Orchard Pond Parkway opened on April 18, 2016; as an introductory measure to encourage local drivers to familiarize themselves with the route, tolls were not collected until May 1. Following that date, open road tolling using the Florida Department of Transportation's SunPass system was instituted, with toll-by-plate as an option for drivers without a SunPass transponder. Traffic volumes for the road were projected to rise to 2000 cars per day; the highest recorded daily traffic count in the first ten months of operation, following the imposition of tolls, was 1800 cars. The route is considered to be an example for potential future projects to follow, being described as the first step in \\"a new Capital Circle\\", providing a bypass for truck traffic to the north of Tallahassee to match the existing partial beltway to the south of the city, reducing traffic congestion and improving safety in the city's busy downtown area, through which a truck route currently passes. Recreational trail Following the opening of the Orchard Pond Parkway, the old dirt road route was converted into a recreational multi-use trail; the Orchard Pond Road Trail opened in August 2016. Two entrances, one on the parkway itself and another accessed from Old Bainbridge Road, provide access to the trail for equestrian, cycling, and hiking traffic.

In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in the plot of the 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Preparation and variations Clementine cake is prepared with clementines, ground almonds or almond meal, flour, sugar, butter and eggs. Optional ingredients include orange juice, orange muscat, milk, white dessert wine, or Riesling wine, orange oil or tangerine oil (or both), almond extract and vanilla extract. Some variations exist, such as being prepared without the use of flour. It can also be prepared as an upside-down cake. The cake can be prepared with clementines and/or clementine zest mixed in the batter, with them atop the cake, such as in slices, and in both ways. The seeds and membrane of the clementine can be removed as part of the preparation process, or seedless clementines can be used. Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or peeled clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before being used in the cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. Candied clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched. Clementine cake can be finished with a sweet topping such as a sugar or chocolate glaze, a fudge or chocolate sauce, powdered sugar or honey. Clementine cake may be dense and moist, and its flavor may improve a day or more after preparation, because the ingredients intermingle and coalesce to enhance its flavor as it ages. After being cooked, the cake may be delicate and can fall if it is wiggled too much. After preparation, it can be frozen to preserve it.

Nano neuro knitting: Peptide nanofiber scaffold for brain repair and axon regeneration with functional return of vision. PNAS. 2006, 103, 5054‚Äî5059. Currently being explored in numerous research endeavors, nano neuro knitting has been shown to allow partial reinnervation in damaged areas of the nervous system through the interactions between potentially regenerative axons and peptide scaffolds. This interaction has been shown to lead to sufficient axon density renewal to the point that functionality is restored. While nano neuro knitting shows promise, the uncertainty of the effects in human subjects warrants further investigation before clinical trials initiate.  Potential applications  Scaffolds produced using nanotechnology have enabled researchers to investigate clinically relevant applications that involve the promotion of tissue regeneration at sites of acute damage. In nano neuro knitting, these methods are applied specifically to the repair of tissues of the nervous system.Ellis-Behnke, R.; Jonas, J.B. Redefining tissue engineering for nanomedicine in ophthalmology. Acta Ophthalmol. 2011, 89, e108‚Äîe114.  Research and outlook   Ophthalmic applications  Nano neuro knitting has been researched for ophthalmic applications. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has tested a self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold (SAPNS) on hamsters to repair optic tract damage. Following injection, axon regeneration repaired the hamsters‚Äô transected superior colliculi and restored vision in the tested animals.Wilson, B. Nano Neuro-Knitting. http://www.dddmag.com/articles/2007/09/nano-neuro-knitting (accessed Oct, 2015) Drug Discovery & Development. 2007, 9, 56‚Äî60. The mechanism behind the regeneration observed in these hamster models has been proposed to involve local axons with the potential to regenerate, the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), and the peptides of the nano scaffold. It has been shown that nano scaffolds can be carefully constructed to promote axonal growth and prevent scar formation at lesion sites. Using alternating positive and negative L-amino acids to form Œ≤-sheet ionic self-complementary peptides, nanofibers of the SAPNSs mimic the environment of the ECM and have been shown to serve as effective scaffolds in both in vitro and in vivo studies‚Äîappearing to be immunologically inert, feasibly excreted, and nontoxic to biological systems. Whereas previous research has attempted to graft nerve tissue to the optic tract and resulted in complications (leg disabilities in the case of sciatic nerve grafts, for instance), nano neuro knitting has been shown to promote the regeneration of these tissues without such drawbacks. While more research is required in order to understand how this technology works, scientists propose that SAPNSs either facilitate this neuroregeneration by promoting cell migration into the lesion area or bringing the lesion areas in closer proximity via contraction.  Central nervous system obstacles  One obstacle for drug delivery to the brain is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The small size of nanomaterials, however, allows nanotechnologies to pass through. The scaffolds that enable nano neuro knitting, hence, are able to bypass this boundary without affecting the BBB that serves the essential role of managing what can and cannot enter and leave the central nervous system (CNS).Ellis- Behnke, R.G.; Teather, L.A.; Schneider, G.E.; So, K.F. Using Nanotechnology to Design Potential Therapies for CNS Regeneration. Current Pharmaceutical Design. 2007, 13, 2519‚Äî2528. While nano neuro knitting and other nanotechnologies may eventually replace procedures currently used to repair damage to the CNS through their improved biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, the toxicity and long-term impacts of nanomaterial exposure in humans has yet to be sufficiently assessed. While some studies demonstrate no immediate toxicity and immune responses, it has yet to be determined if this holds true for the human CNS (with particular concern for the retention of these materials in the brain and their capacity to form neurotoxic plaques) and the rest of the body‚Äôs systems over time. Fortunately, SAPNSs may breakdown naturally by peptidase activity. In addition, promising monitoring methods are being explored in order to monitor axon regeneration in vivo that would provide patients real-time feedback via manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). In this way, these potential therapies could be monitored efficiently.Liang, Y.X.; Cheung, S.W.H.; Chan, K.C.W.; Wu, E.X.; Tay, D.K.C.; Ellis-Behnke, R.G.

Spinal cord injury repair  Research has demonstrated that nano scaffolds may be an effective tool for repairing spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Such studies have utilized rat models to show that electrospun nanofibers and SAPNSs can effectively serve as guidance channels for regeneration of neural tissue lost at sites of SCI.Gelain, F.; Panseri, S.; Antonini, S.; Cunha, C.; Donega, M.; Lowery, J.; Taraballi, F.; Cerri, G.; Montagna, M.; Baldissera, F.; Vescovi, A. Transplantation of Nanostructured Composite Scaffolds Results in the Regeneration of Chronically Injured Spinal Cords. ACS Nano. 2011, 5, 227‚Äî236. Using these scaffolds with integrated, slowly-released proregenerative cytokines showed that SCI rat models could repair contused spinal cord tissue. After six months, the spinal cord cysts were shown to be replaced by bundles of myelinated axons, ECM, and vascularization. In addition, the rat models have been shown to regain motor control after this treatment. Studies also suggest that culturing Schwann cells (SCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in SAPNSs prior to transplantation can significantly improve SCI repair.Guo, J.; Su, H.; Zeng, Y.; Liang, Y.X.; Wong, W.M.; Ellis-Behnke, R.G.

It has, to date, never been professionally staged. History Welles first began writing Bright Lucifer in 1932, while he was writing the play Marching Song at a friend's summer home in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin. He was still developing the text in September 1934 (having moved to New York to play the part of Tybalt in Katharine Cornell's transferred production of Romeo and Juliet), telling John Houseman that he was working on a script ‚Äúabout the devil‚Äù when they first met in December. He had intended to premiere the play at a proposed theater festival at his old school in the summer of 1935 (though this never came about; due to difficulties with the 1934 summer festival the event was not repeated), and continued to work on the script with an eye to producing it as late as 1938.Naremore, James. The Magic World of Orson Welles, University of Illinois Press, 12 Jun 2015. pp.22-26 Though the play has never been performed professionally before 2016, an amateur presentation was given of the script by a community group in Wisconsin on September 27, 1997, 12 years after Welles's death, at the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center in Madison, Wisconsin.Wilmington, Michael.

Characters *Jack Flynn - a burned-out B-movie horror actor, suffering a nervous breakdown after the breakdown of his marriage - a cross between John Barrymore and Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi *Bill Flynn - a newspaper editor, his brother - a large, Falstaffian father-figure with a heart condition *Eldred Brand - Bill's teenage ward, an asthmatic orphan - a \\"bitch boy,\\" and the Lucifer of the plays title Plot After the disappearance of Jack's wife (in the wake of a sexual affair and drug abuse scandal), he has abandoned his career in Hollywood (where he specialised in \\"creature features\\" - playing the monster in B-movie horror films) and is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He has arranged for a retreat to recover in the family cabin (on a north woods Indian reservation) with his brother (Bill - a tabloid newspaper editor) and his brother's young ward (Eldred - a strange, young asthmatic), his brother's wife (Martha) due to arrive a few days later. As the play opens the three males have been fishing, and tensions are already high. Outside the cabin an American Indian funeral is ongoing, and \\"devil drums\\" ceaselessly beat throughout. The twisting story unfolds to encompass whisky, murder, God, the Devil, a monster costume, insanity, and the hysterical desecration of a corpse. The entire play taking place over two nights, and is set entirely in the cabin in the woods. Themes Gothicism The play is a lurid gothic horror, mixing high art with grand guignol; the Chicago Tribune referred to the play as a combination of Henrik Ibsen, Eugene O'Neill, Weird Tales and The Twilight Zone. Father-figures Welles was orphaned at the age of 15, and was adopted by Dr. Maurice Bernstein - a lover of his mothers'. This relationship directly reflects that of Eldred and Bill, and biographers have speculated on the autobiographical nature of the depiction.McGilligan, Patrick \\"Young Orson\\" HarperCollins 2015 Homoeroticism A notable aspect of the play, considering the era in which it was written, is the homoerotic undertone which runs throughout (not to mention the implied Hebephilia of the Bill/Eldred relationship).Callow, Simon \\"Orson Welles, Volume 1: The Road to Xanadu\\" Random House, 8 Jun 2011 As a precursor to other Welles works *The constant beat of the \\"devil drums\\" and the exoticised \\"magic\\" of the American Indian tribe outside the cabin reflect the staging of both Welles's 1936 Voodoo Macbeth and his 1937 Dr Faustus. *Jack's talk of wanting \\"to scare people in a big scale ...

It is most notable for its narrative device of a journalist piecing together a man's life through multiple, contradictory recollections‚Äîa framework that Welles would famously employ in his 1941 film, Citizen Kane. Although the play has never been professionally performed, an abridged version of Marching Song was presented in June 1950 at the Woodstock Opera House in Woodstock, Illinois, a world-premiere benefit production by the Todd School for Boys. Rowman & Littlefield will publish the play in August 2019. History In March 1932, two months shy of his 17th birthday, Orson Welles returned to Chicago from his post-graduation trip to Europe and his time with the Gate Theatre in Dublin. Finding that he had few prospects despite his success in Ireland, Welles persuaded Roger Hill, his former teacher and lifelong friend, to collaborate with him on a biographical play about abolitionist John Brown and his efforts to organize a slave revolt in 1859. In May, Welles visited Harper's Ferry and other historic sites with Hill, who was leading a two-week field trip for boys attending the Todd School. In August, Welles retreated to Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, and stayed at the summer home of James B. Meigs and his family while he wrote the play. Welles typed a cover page that credits the play as being by \\"Orson Welles and Roger Hill\\"; Hill said he wrote only a few scenes that Welles edited and reworked. \\"My own contribution to writing that play was a first draft of a first act,\\" Hill recalled. \\"In other words, just enough to start our tireless boy off and, more importantly, send him off. Out of my hair.\\" Production Though Welles's complete playscript for Marching Song has not been produced, the Todd School for Boys presented an abbreviated world premiere of the play June 7‚Äì8, 1950, at the Woodstock Opera House. Hascy Tarbox, Welles's Todd School classmate and Hill's son-in-law, trimmed the four-hour play to two hours and staged the two performances for the benefit of the Woodstock Hospital. Publication A copy of the typescript, including Welles's sketches and set design instructions, is held by the Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. On September 30, 1985, Hill told Welles that he had located his own copy of the play, which he planned to give him. \\"For my money it remains a compelling, if overly long, play. If that God-awful Hearts of Age ‚Ä¶ is worth saving, Marching Song, written two years earlier, should rate a Pulitzer. At least it's worth publication.\\" Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group of Maryland announced it will publish the play in August 2019 ‚Äì 87 years after it was written. It will be accompanied by two essays written by Hill's grandson, Todd Tarbox, which put the work in historical context and examine Welles's progressive politics.

It was first released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1987 for the United Kingdom. It was ported to Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST and Atari 8-bit home computers in both the United Kingdom and the United States the following year. The game is the tenth instalment in the Strategic Wargames series. In the game, the player can choose to control either the German battleship Bismarck or command the pursuing fleet of Royal Navy ships. The game is set during the Last battle of the battleship Bismarck of World War II and revolves around the Bismarck attempting to escape a pursuing fleet of Royal Navy ships, who desire to avenge the deaths of 1,412 men in the sinking of the flagship and \\"pride of the Royal Navy\\", HMS Hood. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised the graphics and presentation, though one reviewer found difficulty with the controls. Gameplay The Bismarck must evade the pursuing Royal Navy fleet by either heading to Iceland or Nazi occupied France. The game is a turn-based strategy and takes place during the Last battle of the battleship Bismarck on 27 May 1941. The battle is a sequel to the Battle of the Denmark Strait, in which the Kriegsmarine ships Bismarck and Prinz Eugen sank the Royal Navy flagship, HMS Hood, resulting in the deaths of 1,412 men. Incensed by the loss of the \\"pride of the Royal Navy\\", a large British force was dispatched in order to pursue and destroy the Bismarck and its support ship, the Prinz Eugen. The player has the option to choose which side they wish to command at the beginning of the game. If the German side is picked, the objective of the game is to evade the Royal Navy fleet by either sailing to Iceland or heading to the safety of Nazi occupied France. The player will only have the ability to control the Bismarck itself, and must defend themselves against Royal Navy and Royal Air Force attacks if compromised. If the British side is chosen, then the player must command the hunting Royal Navy fleet in order to search and destroy the Bismarck. To achieve both these ends, the player will be able to access an in- game command centre, which will give out alerts depending on the side chosen. If controlling the Bismarck, the player will be reported of hostile British U-boat sightings. If controlling the Royal Navy fleet, they will be told of radio intercepts, which will pinpoint the Bismarcks approximate location. A diagrammatic representation is displayed once any ship comes into contact with the enemy. If the Bismarck has been intercepted or compromised by Royal Navy ships, the game will automatically shift to an arcade sequence which will give the player an opportunity to defend the ship against a British attack, or alternatively, if playing as the British, the sequence is utilised in order to destroy the Bismarck. The feature can be displayed at any time, though it is automatically enabled if either side comes into conflict. The interface of the feature is split into three sections; the upper part of the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity. The middle section contains buttons and icons which are used to control ship movement and to fire weapons. The lower part of the screen displays a diagrammatic representation of the ship from the side chosen (Bismarck or Royal Navy ships); the diagram will change colours once the ship receives damage from shelling. Once a hostile ship is in range, the player will have the choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to withstand 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time. Reception The game received positive reviews upon release. Peter Berlin of Your Sinclair praised the presentation of the game, stating that it was \\"good to look at\\" and well organised. Philippa Irving of Crash asserted that the graphics and interface were \\"rather bland\\" but \\"pretty\\". Despite stating that the map of the game was \\"unexciting\\", Irving noted that it was offset by \\"pretty touches\\" and new graphical additions. A reviewer of Computer and Video Games stated that the game was \\"historically good\\". Their only criticism was the unsuitability of using a joystick for the game, which they deemed \\"virtually unusable\\". David Buckingham of Computer Gamer considered Bismarck the best game Personal Software Studios had released at the time, and added that the two genres of strategy and action work \\"very well\\". Gary Rook of Sinclair User heralded the gameplay as an \\"exciting\\" blend of strategy and arcade simulation. Berlin suggested that Bismarck was a good introduction for players who were \\"bored\\" with the arcade genre and preferred \\"something a little bit tougher\\". Irving praised the gameplay as smoothly-presented and \\"undemanding\\", stating that the type of game Personal Software Studios were creating was \\"successful\\". She also considered the rules of the game to be detailed in all important respects, well-presented and \\"helpful\\", albeit \\"not voluminous\\". Regarding the arcade aspect of the game, Rook noted that the level of action in it was sufficient, but was sceptical that it was a \\"true\\" wargame.

The line was opened in two stages between 1875 and 1876. The first section from Oldenburg to Quakenbr√ºck was built between 1870 and 1875 by the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways (GOE). The opening of the first section took place on 15 October 1875. The section from Quakenbr√ºck to Osnabr√ºck-Eversburg, then passing through Prussian territory, opened only a year later, on 30 June 1876. The official opening took place on 15 November 1876. Until the mid-1990s there was a modest long distance train connection over the line. There was a daily express train from Koblenz and Cologne to Wilhelmshaven and a train from M√∂nchengladbach to Wilhelmshaven. Since 2000, the infrastructure was expanded to introduce a train service with shorter journey times and better connections. Part of the development was to increase the maximum line speed to 120 km/h and the closure of little used stations. The travel time decreased as a result between Oldenburg and Osnabr√ºck by 22 minutes to 87 minutes. In Oldenburg good connections were created with the regional/Intercity trains on the line between Bremen and Emden. The travel time between Wilhelmshaven and Osnabr√ºck also fell by 45 minutes. The services on the line have been operated by NordWestBahn since November 2000. The current contract continues until December 2026.

The company has the stated goal of meeting 60% of Qatar's food demand. History Hassad Food was established in 2008 with the aim of attaining food self- sufficiency for Qatar. Investments It was announced in June 2013 that the company was planning on investing $500 million in India in order to secure the production of coffee, rice and cardamom. As part of this objective, the company acquired majority ownership of Indian food production company Bush Foods Overseas Ltd in April 2013. In December 2014, Hassad Food submitted a First Information Report against Bush Food Overseas Ltd on the basis that they had allegedly falsified their financial statements and inventory records. Hassad Food officially declared its intent to invest $400 million into Turkey's agriculture industry in October 2014. In April 2015, the company revealed its plans to invest $1 billion in Sudan. Subsidiaries Hassad Australia Established in November 2009, the company's Oceania-based subsidiary Hassad Australia represents its first significant overseas investment. In October 2013, Hassad Australia's annual production output was estimated to be 100,000 sheep and 150,000 tonnes of grain. As of June 2014, Hassad Australia owns thirteen farms measuring 750,000 ha. in Australia for the purposes of sheep and wheat production. The company's total investment in Australia's agriculture industry was valued at a reported $500 million as of 2015. Criticism has been leveled at the company's land grabbing activities within Australia. Up to 2017, Hassad Food had invested more than $500 million to buy prime agricultural land in Australia, to own 3,000 square kilometres, with five properties in New South Wales, one in Victoria, one in Queensland, three in South Australia and three in Western Australia. The company is proposing to invest another $500 million in Australia. Senator Bernardi has said, \\"We can have a debate and a discussion about the wisdom of foreign ownership of some of our strategic assets, but I do not know how anyone can justify a government that is recognised by its peers and our allies as the funder of terrorism owning such resources in our own country\\". Zulal Oasis Zulal Oasis was formed as a subsidiary of Hassad Food in 2013, as a joint venture with Oasis Agrotechnology, S.L, a Spanish company that is a consortium of four Spanish companies in Almer√≠a, Spain. Oasis and its constituent companies have more than 30,000 hectares under cultivation in Almer√≠a. Oasis was responsible for adapting the proprietary hydroponic technology of one of its members for use in the unique environmental conditions in the Gulf, i.e., very high summer temperatures together with high humidity. Zulal Oasis has achieved year round production of vegetables, which is unique in Qatar, by developing a dry air cooling system that uses no water, unlike commonly used evaporative cooling systems. As much as 87% of Zulal Oasis vegetable produce is classified in the top band of EU grading standards, and less than 1% of vegetable produce is rejected. Agricultural yield per unit of water used is highest using Zulal Oasis technology, compared to both other greenhouse technologies and open field cultivation. Because an aggregate of 98% of Qatar's fruit and vegetable imports is imported via one road from Saudi Arabia, Zulal Oasis has the primary goal of reaching 50 to 70 percent vegetable self-sufficiency for Qatar. The company's primary facility is a research and development greenhouse in Al-Shahaniya which uses a specially designed dry air cooling system and crop growing system. This system is intended to be more cost-effective while also broadening the scope of viable crop options. Around 200 hectares of land are allocated to the company.

Built in 1979, Friday services regularly attract over 1,000 worshipers. History The mosque is a member of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California network of mosques. The site, close to the University of California Riverside campus, was chosen to enable the mosque to serve university students as well as the wider community. Along with 23 other \\"Islamic Centers\\" in California, the mosque has held an annual open house offering Californians an opportunity to learn more about Islam in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The mosque is known for its \\"interfaith efforts and welcoming atmosphere.\\" The building, by architect Shakil Patel, was erected in 1979‚Äì80. The Islamic Center organizes an annual ceremony, held at the Riverside Convention Center. During the ceremony, all Muslims from the Inland Empire who are graduating from high schools or college are honored, and cash prizes are awarded to top students in several categories. Members filled 50 cartons with relief supplies and raised over $15,000 for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Mustafa H. Kuko became imam of the Center in 1998. At that time, only about 2% of those attending the Center were American-born; by 2012, about 15% were. In June 2014, Kuko told The Press-Enterprise that the Center has worked hard to prevent young people from connecting with terrorist propaganda. He said that the press \\"overlooked what we have been doing in our communities for many years... We have been talking to our communities. We have been talking to our families.\\" 2015 San Bernardino attack Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and neighbor Enrique Marquez, who is currently under investigation in relation to the attack, attended prayers at the Islamic Center of Riverside along with one of the victims of the shooting. Farook and the other shooter Tashfeen Malik, who were married abroad, held their wedding reception at the Islamic Center of Riverside. Farook abruptly stopped attending the center in 2014 following his marriage. The Center's director did not recall ever hearing extremist ideology from Farook, and stated that if such ideas were known, they would have tried to stop it, as Farook's actions betrayed the principles of Islam. The Islamic Center of Riverside held a prayer vigil on the Friday after the shooting, extending sympathy to the shooting victims and condemning the attack. 2017 Allegations of Anti-Semitism On July 21, 2017, Iman Mahmoud Harmoush delivered a speech at the Islamic Center of Riverside, which was later posted by the Center on YouTube. According to a translation by MEMRI, Harmoush stated: \\"Oh, Allah, liberate the Al-Aqsa mosque and all the Muslim lands from the unjust tyrants and the occupiers...Oh, Allah, destroy them; they are no match for you. Oh, Allah, disperse them and rend them asunder. Turn them into booty in the hands of the Muslims.‚Äù Harmoush also stated that the migration of Jews to Israel was part of a plot ‚Äúto take over that beautiful land in the way that we all know, with killing, crime and massacres.‚Äù He further claimed that Israel intends not only to take control of Palestine but also seeks to capture the cities of Mecca and Medina.

The by-election was won by Kantilal Bhuria of the Indian National Congress (INC) by 88,800 votes. BJP had won the seat, which is reserved for electoral candidates from the Scheduled Tribes, for the first time in the 2014 general election. Before then, the Lok Sabha constituency had been won by INC candidates, except in the 1977 general election when it went to a Praja Socialist Party representative. The constituency covers the districts of Jhabua, Alirajpur and Ratlam. INC sent Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia, among others, to campaign in the constituency. Among the BJP campaigners were the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, and several Government of India cabinet ministers. Due to the significant tribal presence in the constituency, BJP also sent campaigners from that community. During the campaign, in August 2015, the BJP announced that party workers would recite the Hindu devotional hymn Hanuman Chalisa near the polling booths. This caused opposition leaders to accuse the BJP of inciting religious polarisation but the BJP said it was just promoting cultural nationalism. The BJP candidate was Nirmala Bhuria, the daughter of the deceased MP and herself a Member of the State Legislative Assembly for the Petlawad constituency in Madhya Pradesh. Vijay Haari was the candidate of Janata Dal (United). The Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Gondwana Ganatantra Party, Rashtriya Samanta Dal and Bahujan Sangharsh Dal extended their support to his candidature.

The Team  SquadraCorse Logo The SquadraCorse, Italian for race team, consist of students from the Politecnico di Torino. The team consists of around 30 students from different faculties. They work together for a year, during this time, they create a race car, which is both fast and economical. By working on this project the students are exposed to a more practical form of learning, as they have to deal with the design of the car, manufacturing companies and public relation for the team.  Cars   Combustion   SC05  SquadraCorse was born in October 2003, the objective of the 9 original team members was to compete in the Formula SAE championship of 2005. The first car had a steel framework, which made it quite heavy, weighing in at 300 kg. It was powered by a V2 Guzzi engine, given it 61 hp. The students opted for a 5-speed sequential gearbox. In 2005 the SC05 competed in two events, namely the formula student UK and at the Balocco circuit in Italy. During second event it won the award for best Tiberna frame.  SC06  During the 2006 season a reorganisation was initiated on the experiences of the previous year. The next car became lighter (250 kg) and the Guzzi V2 Engine was abandoned in favour of a 4-cylinder engine designed by Honda, which increased the power of the car to 71Hp. Other changes included a reduction of design time and the development of internal electronics. The SC06 to date is the only SquadraCorse one seater build without any red, as it raced with an unpainted green Kevlar body. During the Italian formula SAE event a ninth place was obtained by the team  SC07  SC07 The SC07 was improved by lessening the weight and increasing both power and torque. It had 85Hp thanks to its 4-cylinder Honda engine, and weighted 240 kg. Due to the increase of power and decrease of weight it had a power to weight ratio of 2.82Hp/Kg. During the 2007 season the team competed in three races Silverstone, Fiorano and the new addition of the Formula Student Germany at the Hockenheim circuit. The car was painted once again in red, although with the addition of black. The SC07 became the first car of the team to reach a podium position, with a second place in the Formula SAE Italy. At the formula UK the car reached an eighteenth position.  SC08  The most notable improvements of the SC08 were the introduction of carbon in the cockpit, custom magnesium wheels and gearbox controls on the steering wheel. The first event of the 2008 season was Silverstone were the Car was not ready yet to compete with the race leaders. The German circuit saw the improved version of the car, until the team has been forced to retire the car due to mechanical problems. The last event, Formula Student Italy, ended with a positive result, as the car finished in second place. Including receiving the Tiberina Best Chassis Award FSAE Italy.  SC09  SC09 Due to changes in the safety regulations, most Europeans teams chose to change their framework, the designers chose to maintain the same frame as the previous years. Instead opting to create a complete carbon fibre cockpit for the first time. The SC09, a carbon car with painted red lines, had its first race at the German event. Unfortunately during the driver change the car did not restart. The Italian race, held at the Riccardo Paletti circuit, had a better result as the car finished fifth overall. SCX  SCX  The 2010 season saw the emergence of the SCX, which was changed mainly due to the introduction of a pneumatic clutch. That allowed the team to develop an automatic transmission, an electronically controlled anti-slip differential. Another new feature was the complete carbon fibre impact attenuator. The first event resulted in the first top ten finish at an event outside of Italy, the Formula Student UK. The second race of the season saw an improvement of the position as the car reached a sixth overall position in the German event. The last course of the season was the Formula SAE Varano. There the SCX repeated the performance of the 2007 and 2008,finishing in second position.  SCXX  This season saw the arrival of the last car powered by a combustion engine, the SCXX, a direct evolution of the previous car. Notable changes were made on the electronics as on the process of collecting data both during and after the race. The car competed in the same events as the previous year. The best result was achieved in the Italian event with a fourth place. During the race in Germany the SCXX reached a sixteenth overall position.  Electric   SC12e  SquadraCorse decided to switch from the traditional combustion engine to a completely electric powered car. Two Magneti Marelli TMG was used as the electric engine. The car reached a top speed of 180 km per hour and 0-100 acceleration of 2.9 seconds. The car was the first of its kind in Italy, the change was made out of the interest of automotive companies in electric cars. Being the first of its kind the project received a lot of media attention in Italy, and it competed in two events in 2012. These were the formula SAE in Hungary and Varano, Italy, it reached a fifth position in Hungary and improved to a third position in Varano. It managed a 7th world ranking at the end of the season.  SCR  The SCR was created in 2013, it competed during both the 2013 and 2014 season. By designing a complete carbon fibre body, the team saved on weight and increased the stiffness of the car. The most visible change in design was the addition aerodynamic surface, which were designed in order to give the most down force against a certain amount of power. During the 2014 season it competed in events of UK, Czech republic and Varano.  SCXV  The team presented the SCXV, a new car using four outboard engines instead of the previous years in which two engines were used. Not only are the engines are completely outboard, also the gear change for each individual engine. In 2015 the car competed in the races of Austria, Spain and Varano. With the best result obtained a fifth place in Verano Italy. The SCXV will be improved in the 2016 season, the focus of the improvements will be on the creation of a drag reduction system left  SC17  As usually, the team presented the latest car, the SC17, during the Rollout which is an event organized by Politecnico of Torino in order to launch the car of the current year before Formula SAE races. The SC17 has four outboard engine of 30kWp electric in wheel motors, a carbon fibre monocoque, Power to weight ratio of 1.47 kg/Hp, 0-100 acceleration of 2.9s and it's capable to reach more than 2g of lateral acceleration. In 2017 the car competed in the races of Italy, Czech Republic and Spain, gaining a third places in Italy. In 2018 the car will be re-made completely.  Hybrid   SC08H  In 2009 the SquadraCorse debuted in the Formula EHI with a modified version of the SC8 called the SC08H. This modified version was a hybrid car, having a 2-cylinder Kawasaki engine working in combination with a Perm pms electric engine. The first event the SC08H competed in was the Formula EHI or Electric and Hybrid Italy. In this event the SC08H achieved for the first time in the history of SquadraCorse the highest position on the podium. The following year the car competed in two more events, the Formula Hybrid USA and the Formula EHI 2010. In both races the obtained results remained the same as the previous year, a first position.

The daughter of Charles Fitzbach, a native of Luxembourg, and Genevi√®ve Nadeau, she was born in St-Vallier de Bellechasse, Lower Canada. She did not go to school as a child and left home at the age of 13 to become a housekeeper in Quebec City to support her family. Three years later, she began working for Fran√ßois-Xavier Roy, a merchant. At the same time, she paid a student to teach her how to read and write and basic accounting. Following the death of her employer's wife, she married Mr. Roy in 1828 at Cap-Sant√©; he had two children and the couple had three more daughters. After her husband died in 1833, the two older children were put in the care of grandparents and she was left to raise her three daughters. One daughter died in 1846. In 1849, her two daughters joined the Sisters of Charity of Quebec. She moved to the Sisters' hospice to be closer to her daughters. In December 1849, at the request of bishop Pierre-Flavien Turgeon, she established St. Magdalen's Refuge, a home for women released from prison. In February 1856, as Mother Mary of the Sacred Heart, she became the first mother superior for the Good Shepherds of Quebec. She was the first person born in Quebec to found a religious order. Her portrait was painted by painter Marie-Elmina Anger, a member of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd in Quebec who also painted the portraits of other Quebec religious figures. She was declared venerable in June 2012. Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary-Good Shepherd Sisters The Community developed from the St. Vincent de Paul Society of Quebec. In 1849, upon visiting the city jail, lawyer George Manly Muir was moved to create a women's shelter. Muir was president of the SVP and persuaded the other members to undertake a house of refuge. The Society rented a house, but needed someone to manage it.

It was preceded by the 1964 election and followed by the 1970 election. Overview of the result The politics of the county had been transformed following the victory of Gwynfor Evans at the Carmarthen by-election in the previous year. This led to an increased number of Plaid Cymru candidates although they had limited success. The party polled well in several Llanelli wards. Another feature was the appearance of Liberal candidates for the first time for many years. After a series of elections where Labour strengthened their majority on the Council the party suffered a number of losses and a majority of the elected councillors were Independents. The Labour losses included Douglas Hughes, leader of the Council and a member since 1928. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Retiring aldermen A number of retiring Labour councillors stood down to allow retiring aldermen to be returned unopposed. Unopposed returns A number of members were again returned unopposed, but these were fewer in number than at most post-war elections. Contested elections Of the contests that took place, the most notable were in Llanelli town where the leader of the authority, Alderman Douglas Hughes ( a member since 1928) and his wife Alderman Loti Rhys Hughes (a member since 1946) were both defeated. Another long-serving member. Alderman Emrys Aubrey, only narrowly held his seat at Westfa. Labour lost seats at Burry Port to the Independents and at Kidwelly and Pembrey to Plaid Cymru. Within the Carmarthen parliamentary constituency, Plaid Cymru won no seats but stood for the first time at Quarter Bach and both Llandybie seats, polling well in each instance.

Work Geum Hee's birth in China is why most of the setting or theme in her story stories set with Joseonjok or refugees from North Korea who have crossed over to China and/or Korea. She first started writing in 2006 where she wrote novels, and her first book Syuroedinggeoui sangja was published in 2007. She mainly writes her book to express what she feels and sees beyond a person's ethnicity and race. The writer has also mentioned that she wanted herself to feel free through writing her books. The episodes of her books are influenced by the people around her who were refugee families from North Korea, a Joseonjok who married a South Korean exchange student and similar themes. Her first book was published in China but her stories regarding refugees were refused by the Chinese publications because this problem is also a sensitive matter in China. Instead, she sent the copy to a South Korean publisher which gladly accepted to print her story. This story is \\"Ok-hwa.\\" In her book Sesange eomneun naui jip, she writes in the dialect spoken by Koreans in China, which is different from the South Korean standard. This is why there are some expressions that came straight from the Chinese language and South Korean readers are unable to interpret. The author says that this is an inevitable due to the gap between cultural differences. Moreover, she says that she not only wants to focus on a specific group of people but want to write a book where everyone can relate to the characters. Geum Hee's sole translation into English is Ok-hwa, translated by Jeon Seung-hee, which was a nominee for the prestigious Ku Sang Literary Award.  Themes  Geum Hee is said to have expanded the scope of Korean diaspora literature. While many South Korean works of fiction feature North Korean defectors or Koreans living in China, Geum Hee's work is different as they tell the stories of women who defected from North Korea before they settle down in the South.Kim, Hak-soon ‚ÄúTales of Two Koreas: From the Periphery, Korean-Chinese Author Geum Hee Beholds Those on the Margins,‚Äù Koreana, Autumn 2016. https://koreana.or.kr/user/0003/nd19204.do?View&boardNo;=00000444&zineInfoNo;=0003&pubYear;=2016&pubMonth;=AUTUMN&pubLang;=Korean Considered a third-generation ethnic Korean living in China, Geum Hee believes that the ethnic Korean communities in China have disintegrated due to migration and links it to China's industrialization and urbanization. Furthermore, she also differs from the first- and second-generation ethnic Korean writers living in China, such as Heo Ryeon-sun and Kim Hak-cheol, as she specifically describes women's migration and paints multifaceted pictures of the identity of North Korean defectors who cannot be simply described as good or evil.Choi, Hyo-ye, ‚ÄúA Study of Fiction by Geum Hee ‚Äì Focusing on the Migration of Ethnic Koreans in China and the Change in Their Identity,‚Äù Master‚Äôs thesis, Graduate and Professional School, Pusan National University, 2019, 5. In particular, she vividly describes the diaspora experience of people who choose to migrate for survival through a strong narrative and provides a detailed description of their psychological state. In this way, she shows that the reality of migration is not specific to the community of ethnic Koreans living in China but rather universal and links it to migration on a broader, transnational level.Choi, Byeong Woo, ‚ÄúThe Understanding of the Migration of Ethnic Koreans Living in China in Kim Geum Hee‚Äôs Fiction,‚Äù Studies of Chinese and Korean Humanities Vol. 61, 2018, 160 In Sesange eomnun naui jip (2015), her first short story collection published in Korea, Geum Hee depicts not only the experience of moving to South Korea but also the identity conflicts of ethnic Koreans living in China as minorities and the issue of North Korean defectors as seen from the community of ethnic Koreans living in China.

It tells the story of a woman, who escapes from North Korea and goes to China and then to Korea from the perspective of a character named Hong. When she meets a woman asking to borrow some money, Hong is reminded of Ok-hwa and thus the relationship between Hong and Ok-hwa-Woman continues.Hwang, Jung A, ‚Äú‚ÄôUnification in Advance‚Äô in Fiction about North Korean Defectors: Reading Rogiwaneul mannatda (Î°úÍ∏∞ÏôÑÏùÑ ÎßåÎÇ¨Îã§ I Met Roh Gi-wan) and ‚ÄòOk-hwa,‚Äô‚Äù Sooncheonhyang University Journal of Humanities and Science Vol. 34 No. 2, The Institute of Humanities at Soonchunhyang University, 2015, 67. In addition, rather than the simple dynamics of Hong showing compassion to the North Korean defectors and the North Korean defectors becoming their beneficiaries, the story addresses the dilemma and confusion about North Korean defectors.So, Young-hyun, ‚ÄúWomen/Hatred (Misogyny) as a Symptom and the Geometry of Diaspora Gender ‚Äì Feminization of Migration and Housewification of Immigrant Labor,‚Äù Daejung seosa yeongu (Journal of Popular Narrative) Vol. 42, The Association of Popular Narrative, 2017, 104. ‚ÄúNomad‚Äù (ÎÖ∏ÎßàÎìú Nomad) depicts the reality of transnational migration through Park Cheol, as well as Su-mi, an ethnic Korean living in China, North Korean defector Seon-a, and a Korean woman who set up a hair salon in China.

He had French nationality and was of R√©unionnais origin. Personal background Clain converted to Islam in the 1990s. He appears to have been radicalized in the first half of the 2000s, with his younger brother Jean-Michel Clain. After living in the Netherlands from 2003, in 2004, the Clain brothers went to Egypt with their wives to study the Koran in the suburbs of Cairo. Clain and friends found themselves in a village to the south of Toulouse, Artigat, around a \\"guru\\", Olivier Corel, of Syrian origin. Corel, known as the 'white Emir', served as a \\"scholar in religion\\" for the group who met at his home. Clain reportedly had influence on the group that included brothers, Abdelkader and Mohammed Merah, and Sabri Essid. He created a prayer room in his home and preached hatred against Jews and Americans and urged jihad. On 12 December 2006, two of his followers, Essid and Bala, were intercepted by the Syrian Army on the way to fight American troops in Iraq. After a few months of detention in Syria, they were handed over to the French. Terrorist involvement 2009 conviction Members of this group were charged with terrorist offenses in 2009. Clain was presented as an \\"organizer\\" of a group and sentenced to five years in jail. Group members Essid and Bala were also convicted, but Olivier Corel and Abdelkader Merah were acquitted. Clain is banned from twenty-two French departments. Toulouse and Montauban shootings Before the Toulouse and Montauban shootings, Clain was still in French prison in March 2012 when Mohammed Merah killed three soldiers as well as a professor and three children in a Jewish school. The two men corresponded by mail while in prison and Clain was accused of conspiracy in the scooter attack. Clain appears to have gone to Syria after being released from French prison in 2014. In April 2015, Clain's name came up in the investigation of a planned attack on a church in Villejuif outside Paris. The attack failed when the terrorist shot himself in the leg. At some point before November 2015 Clain uttered threats against Bataclan due to the alleged Zionism of its [former] owners. Clain released an audio recording on the day before the November 2015 Paris attacks in which he personally claimed responsibility for the attacks. This \\"is only the beginning of the storm and a warning for those who want to meditate and remove their lessons\\" (translation of the recording). The voice recording intonation is reported to be not aggressive but soft, rejoicing in the deaths of the 'idolatrous' at the concert hall and other locations.

The Lyttelton family (sometimes spelled Littleton) is a British aristocratic family. Over time, several members of the Lyttelton family were made knights, baronets and peers. Hereditary titles held by the Lyttelton family include the viscountcies of Cobham (since 1889) and Chandos (since 1954), as well as the Lyttelton barony (since 1794) and Lyttelton baronetcy (since 1618). Several other members of the family have also risen to prominence, particularly in the field of cricket. History Branches of the Littleton/Lyttelton family  Sir Thomas Littleton (c. 1407‚Äì1481), the distinguished judge and writer, ancestor of three branches of the family The Littleton/Lyttelton family had its origins in South Lyttleton, near Evesham, Worcestershire. With the marriage of Elizabeth Littleton, sole daughter and heiress of Thomas de Littleton, Lord of Frankley, to Thomas Westcote, esquire, two of their sons, Sir Thomas and Edmund, took the surname Lyttleton or Littleton while two others, Nicholas and Guy, retained the surname of Westcote; Nicholas Westcote later married Agnes Vernon, the daughter and heiress of Edmund Vernon, and was ancestor of the Westcotes of Staffordshire, while Guy married the daughter of one Greenevill of Gloucestershire, and was ancestor of the Westcotes of Devon and Somerset. Edmund Littleton died unmarried. Sir Thomas Littleton (c. 1407‚Äì1481), became a distinguished judge and legal writer, referred to as 'one of the great law luminaries of his country, and is immortalized by one work alone, his celebrated Treatise on Tenures.. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1464, and inherited the Frankley estates from his mother. He was survived by three sons, William, Richard and Thomas, from whom originated three lines of Littleton/Lyttelton landed gentry in the West Midlands, all of which acquired baronetcies in the 17th century: * Thomas, the third son, is recorded as Thomas Litleton of Speechly and incumbent of Spetchley, Worcestershire. His descendant Adam Littleton received the Littleton Baronetcy, of Stoke Milburgh, in 1642. Pillaton Old Hall. The original moated manor house became ruinous, but the Gatehouse and Chapel were restored in the 1880s. * Richard, the second son, married the heiress of Pillaton Hall in Staffordshire. His descendant Edward Littleton received the Littleton Baronetcy, of Pillaton Hall, in 1627. The title became extinct in 1812 on the death of the 4th Baronet. The lands then passed to a nephew, Edward John Walhouse, who adopted the surname of Littleton and was created Baron Hatherton in 1835. Hagley Hall, rebuilt between 1754 and 1760 in Neo-Palladian style. Most owners of Hagley Hall are buried at the adjacent parish church of St John the Baptist. * William (1450‚Äì1507), the eldest son, inherited the lands at Frankley, and was knighted after the Battle of Stoke (1487), one of the last major engagements of the Wars of the Roses. He was succeeded by his son John Littleton (c. 1500‚Äì1533), who was succeeded by his son John Lyttelton (1520‚Äì1590). He was made constable of Dudley Castle and keeper of the old and new parks there in 1553. In 1565 he bought the manor of Hagley from John St. Leger. . Together with Frankley and Upper Arley, which he inherited, this formed the core of the Lyttelton family estate. He was knighted by Elizabeth I at Kenilworth in 1566. He was succeeded by his son Gilbert (c.1570‚Äì1599), the High Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1584, who was the father of John (‚Ä† 1601) and Humphrey (‚Ä† 1606). Humphrey was executed for his part in the Gunpowder Plot. John Lyttelton served as a Member of Parliament but was concerned in the rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex in 1601. He was tried for high treason, but was reprieved from execution. His estates in Frankley, Halesowen, Hagley and Upper Arley were forfeited to the Crown, but were restored to his widow Meriel (daughter of Sir Thomas Bromley, Lord Chancellor of England) on the accession of James I. She survived him 28 years and cleared the estates of debt, bringing up her children as Anglicans. The eldest son, Thomas Lyttelton (1593‚Äì1650) received the Lyttelton Baronetcy, of Frankley in the County of Worcester, in the Baronetage of England, in 1618.

His son, the 2nd Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Lichfield. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the 3rd Baronet, who represented Bewdley in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the 4th Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for Worcester and Camelford. In 1708, the 4th Baronet married Christian Temple, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet of Stowe. In 1718, her brother was created Baron Cobham, of Cobham in the County of Kent, and Viscount Cobham, with special remainder (in default of his own heirs male) to his sister Christian and her heirs male and in default of them to the heirs male of Christian. This latter remainder took effect in 1889 when her descendant Charles Lyttelton, 5th Baron Lyttelton succeeded as 8th Viscount Cobham. St John the Baptist Church, Hagley Garter banners of the 1st Viscount Chandos and the 10th Viscount Cobham . In 1751, the 4th Baronet was succeeded by his eldest son, the 5th Baronet, who was a prominent politician. In 1755 he was created Baron Lyttelton, of Frankley in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded in his titles by his son, the 2nd Baron, who briefly represented Bewdley in the House of Commons. The 2nd Baron had no legitimate issue and on his death in 1779, the Lyttelton barony (created in 1755) became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Lyttelton baronetcy (created in 1618) by his uncle, the 7th Baronet. He also represented Bewdley in Parliament and served as Governor of South Carolina and of Jamaica. In 1776, three years before he succeeded in the baronetcy, he was created Baron Westcote, of Balamere in the County of Longford, in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1794 he was further created Baron Lyttelton, of Frankley in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest son, who later succeeded as the 2nd Baron, also sat as Member of Parliament for Bewdley. His half-brother, the 3rd Baron, represented Worcestershire in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. His son, the 4th Baron, was briefly Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1846 under Sir Robert Peel and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son, the 5th Baron, who had previously represented East Worcestershire in Parliament as a Liberal. In 1889 he also succeeded his distant relative, the late 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, as 8th Viscount Cobham. His son, the 9th Viscount Cobham, was Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire from 1923 to 1949. He was succeeded by his son, the 10th Viscount. He served as Governor-General of New Zealand from 1957 to 1962 and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1964 and also served as Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. His nephew, Oliver Lyttelton, was made Viscount Chandos, of Aldershot in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1954 and a Knight of the Garter in 1970. The 3rd Viscount Chandos was given a life peerage as Baron Lyttelton of Aldershot, of Aldershot in the County of Hampshire, in 2000.

Hagley Park, the largest urban open space in Christchurch, takes its name from Lord Lyttelton's country estate in Worcestershire. The first newspaper established by the Canterbury Association in Canterbury Settlement, New Zealand, named the Lyttelton Times, started in the port settlement of Lyttelton, New Zealand, in 1851. The settlement of Lyttelton, established in 1850, was named after the family; from this Lyttelton district took its name. A railway line in New Zealand was named Lyttelton Line, and Christchurch's port has borne the name Lyttelton Harbour since 1858. Lord Lyttelton's great-grandson, the 10th Viscount Cobham, (1909‚Äì1977) served as the ninth Governor-General of New Zealand (in office: 1957-1962) and also had a successful cricketing career.

Once called the \\"most dangerous man in the country\\" by federal law enforcement agents, Morrison's underworld r√©sum√© includes running a multimillion-dollar heroin ring, enforcing, pimping, extortion, and engaging in shootouts with rivals like Bumpy Johnson. A Robin Hood like figure in the Harlem community, Morrison's exploits with crime, women, and music are legendary. Though he would spend decades behind bars over the course of his life, Morrison was never convicted of murder. Biography Early life Morrison was born in Alabama in 1919. He gained notoriety early for the use of violence while beating up bigger bullies of friends as a school child. He picked up his nickname when he accidentally turned his hair red while trying to straighten it. Migrated to New York by way of South Carolina as a teen in 1937, to live with mother who had come years before. While not being particularly impressed by the big city, Morrison was distressed by the odd jobs he had to undertake to help provide for the household. He was quick to acquaint himself with boys who knew ways of hustling extra money in the city. As was their habit, leisure hours were spent in a popular Seventh Ave. bar, ogling at the \\"big shots\\" of vice, gambling, prostitution, shoplifting, narcotics and the like. Dillard rose quick through the ranks of the neighborhood as he showed his natural leadership skills, charisma, and qualities that may have brought him legitimate fame and fortune, had it been guided in the right channels. Criminal career After deciding menial labor was not for him, Morrison quickly earned underworld credibility by robbing craps players and numbers runners in Harlem, growing into a bona fide gangster in the late 1930s. Before long, Morrison became a major force within the Harlem criminal world. His early criminal enterprises showed no shortage of ambition: disappointed with the take of one heist at Woolworth's, he immediately robbed a check-cashing shop. Even more than his appetite for illegal activity, it was Morrison's toughness that would become the stuff of legend. In one case, he was ambushed by a pair of assailants who shot him in the leg, but he turned around and chased the gunmen all the way back to their getaway car. Although he was always conservatively dressed, unobtrusive, and soft-spoken, Red had gained a fabled reputation of a man \\"not to be messed with.\\" Morrison came to the attention of the shot callers of that time, Women like \\"Mae,\\" who ran the biggest brothel in town, and had a dozen shoplifters on her payroll. Men like \\"Big\\" Joe Richards, undisputed boss of the seaboard negro rackets. \\"Big Joe\\" ruled varied crime \\"Kingdoms\\" with an iron hand, yet succeeded by remaining an anonymity to all but his \\"lieutenants\\" and a few select friends. He ran an efficient enterprise, with every man and woman trained and chosen to do a particular job. Eventually when Morrison was asked to become the right-hand man for Big Joe, he agreed. Due to his violent ways, Morrison was arrested for the first time and on April 29, 1940; he appeared in Special Sessions on the charge of 3rd degree assault, but the maimed, bandaged man who had filed the charges refused to testify. The court had no choice but to discharge Morrison on his own recognizance. The beaten man's reluctance to testify was the first indication of the \\"reign of terror' which was to follow. On May 4, 1940, in Babylon, Long Island, Morrison received a suspended sentence on a 3rd degree assault charge. On June 4, 1940, in a Manhattan court, Morrison again drew a suspended sentence on a 3rd degree assault charge. In the mid-1940s, Morrison split with Big Joe and began buying heroin wholesale from Italian mobster Lucky Luciano, who imported it from Turkey via Sicily. Morrison then handed off the product to drug runners who resold it in points further south and west of New York. Morrison also worked as a pimp and earned a reputation as both a dashing ladies' man and a philanderer. Then for three years he had no problems with the law. He learned to intimidate victims so well that many of the assaults credited to him never reached the police. He learned a lot of other things too, as the record will show. * On October 6, 1943, a charge of armed robbery was dismissed against him in Felony Court. * On July 24, 1944, he drew his first \\"time\\", a 1-year sentence and costs for the possession of narcotics (marijuana) in North Bergen, New Jersey. He served 'six months on the County Farm. * On July 2, 1945, a felonious assault charge was dismissed against him in Felony Court. * On March 31. 1946, Morrison drew \\"$35 or 20 days\\" for disorderly conduct (shooting dice). He paid the fine. * On April 5, 1946 Dillard Morrison, 26, was charged with driving after his license had been revoked. A fine of $50 was imposed. * On April 29, 1946, a felonious assault charge against him was discharged in Felony Court * On November 18, 1946, a gambling charge drew a $100 fine. * On January 18, 1947 a charge of grand larceny was dismissed against him in Felony Court . * On April 11, 1947 a new charge of compulsory prostitution was added to the familiar felonious assault charges which had been filed against him but all charges were dismissed in Felony Court. * On December 3, 1947, two minor raps cost him 20 days when he was convicted on two charges of reckless driving in Traffic Court. * On Dec. 21st, 1948, he was arrested, and released on bail, on a felonious assault charge (knife). Although an assistant district attorney called him \\"notorious\\" and a magistrate refused him bail because of his record, Morrison was released again when he appeared in court to face two charges. The assistant DA's charge that Morrison was a \\"pimp\\" was given somewhat credence when, as he left the hearing, Morrison was immediately followed from the premises by some 15 women. Morrison was already due in Felony Court along with Louis (Fees) Taylor and (Bumpy) Johnson for a hearing on felonious charges filed against all three for an earlier stabbing. \\"This man has had many cases in this court, where the witnesses or complainants fail to appear. It is felt that if he is released he may intimidate other witnesses\\", Assistant District Attorney Paul Reilly said. Magistrate Samuel Orr then refused bail but Morrison's attorney, Matthew H. Brandenberg, went before General Sessions Judge Jacob G. Schurman and asked for bail. The latter released Morrison on $2,500 bail. \\"Red Gets Bail\\" was an expected headline in the 1940s & 1950s, the release of the dangerous redhead would regularly electrify Harlem. This pattern of arrests and subsequent dismissals is typical of the early days of any prominent mobster. Few Negroes, however, ever achieved the \\"distinction\\" of being identified in that class. At all times Morrison's hands were clean, and had it not been for his code of violence, he would have remained as unobtrusive as the many who have grown fat and respectable from the profits of the lucrative dope trade. His exploits put him in the spotlight, in the eyes of the people, and because of this his most secret operations became public property also. 1950 drug conviction As Morrison's business grew, so too did his profile. His name began to turn up in local newspapers, both for the opulent parties he threw‚Äìand for his criminal activities. On April 10, 1949 Morrison was arrested after he allegedly fired four shots through the door and window of Sheps Bar and Grill, 303 W. 146th St. It has never been established at whom he was shooting. In their last ditch effort to capture the elusive Morrison, the authorities imported a young wise agent from the midwest to work himself into the web of Harlem narcotics operations. On May 4, 1950, Morrison was arrested by federal officers along with Robert \\"Gator\\" Lee and a white woman on charges of possession and sale of narcotics. Morrison was sentenced to five years in prison. The arrests came after Morrison allegedly delivered a half ounce package of heroin to Lee. Morrison and Lee both pleaded not guilty in Federal Court to three counts of \\"unlawful sale of heroin\\" and was said to be the Harlem contact source for heroin which was being smuggled into the United States from Turkey. At the time Garland H. Williams, district supervisor of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, said \\"they are probably the most notorious narcotics dealers in this part of the United States. They have supplied a large percentage of dope distributed from Boston to Chicago.\\" The amount of narcotics found in possession was relatively small. \\"However,\\" he charged that \\"the men have been selling huge amounts for a long time\\". Bail was made at $10,000.  Release from prison  Morrison returned in 1955 with promises of going straight. Paralyzed in both legs due to prison fight in 1953, it was obvious right away that he didn't lose a step. When two mafiosos showed up at his house with a brand-new red Cadillac El Dorado for him‚Äìa token of gratitude for not \\"snitching\\" on them in prison, he respectfully declined. He eyed the real estate business and considered opening a dry cleaning shop. But months after his return, another event shook him from his path: the sudden death of his wife at age 33 of an allergic reaction to a penicillin injection. Trying to cope with the death of his wife, he spent his nights at clubs like Birdland, Savoy, and Minton's . During this time, Morrison grew increasingly fond of cocaine, and his behavior became erratic. There were more shootouts, bar brawls, and a drug deal set up by a federal agent that landed him back in jail for ten more years. Once again, his musical friends stood by him. Billy Eckstein and Sarah Vaughan even visited and performed for him at Otisville. Released in 1974, Morrison moved to Los Angeles and continued his life as a drug dealer even as he approached his 60th birthday. Still, he maintained his support for musicians.

John P. Nichols House is a historic house at 121 East Main Street (United States Route 1) in Searsport, Maine. Built in 1865 for a ship's captain from a prominent local family, it is one of Waldo County's finest examples of Italianate architecture, with a particularly elaborate cupola. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is now the Homeport Inn. Description and history The Nichols House stands east of the Searsport town center, at the southeast corner of East Main Street and Summer Street. It is one of a cluster of fine 19th-century houses that make up the East Main Street Historic District. It is a roughly cubic wood frame structure, capped by a hip roof with deep eaves that are decorated with dentil moulding and paired brackets. The roof is topped by an elaborate square cupola, with corner pilasters, grouped round-arch windows on each side, and a bracketed and dentillated cornice similar to that of the main roof. The front facade is three bays wide, with an early 20th-century Colonial Revival portico sheltering its main entrance. First-floor windows are capped by bracketed and dentillated lintels. The central second-floor bay houses a pair of round-arch windows, while the flanking bays house segmented-arch sash windows. The house was built in 1865 for John P. Nichols, one of Searsport's most successful ship captains of the period. The Searsport Nicholses were prominent in the shipping industry of Searsport, producing at least twenty-seven ship captains. Nichols was also related indirectly by marriage to the McGilverys, whose mansions stand across the street. A later resident of this house, Carleton Bryant, was an admiral of the United States Navy during World War II.

It opened on January 6, 1853, and by the end of the year had expanded to 1,000 rooms. The St.Nicholas raised the bar for a new standard of lavish appointments for a luxury hotel. It was the first New York City building to cost over . The hotel was said to have ended the Astor House's preeminence in New York hostelry.  Description  The hotel was at 507‚Äì527 Broadway in the neighborhood of SoHo in Manhattan. The main central plan and design of the white marble-fa√ßade hotel was prepared by the owner D.H. Haight and a well- known hotelier, Mr.Treadwell. The architects involved were J. B. Snook and Griffith Thomas. The hotel building fronted 275 feet on Broadway, 200 feet on Spring Street, and 275 feet on Mercer Street. In progress at the time the hotel opened was an extension that was completed by the end of the year. The expanded hotel had 1,000 guest rooms. The hotel building then took up the full city block between Spring Street and Broome Street. The six-story hotel was of Italian architecture with modified Corinthian elements. The entrance was between four grooved white marble columns.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. \\"NYCLPC SoHo ‚Äì Cast-Iron Historic District Designation Report\\" (August 14, 1873) p. 40 File:St. Nicholas Hotel 1853.jpg|St Nicholas Hotel in 1853 File:St Nicholas Hotel saloon 1853.jpg|Barbershop File:Attributed to Silas A.

Dennis collection crop.jpg|Broadway looking south  Interior  The hotel cost $1.2 million to build and accommodated one thousand guests weekly. Another $700,000 was spent to furnish the hotel completely. It had several dining rooms; on the second floor was the main dining room that could accommodate 400 guests. An elaborate men's hair-cutting salon illustrated by a gilded domed skylight catered to about a dozen guests at a time. File:St Nicholas dining room.jpg|Dining Room File:St Nicholas Hotel 1866 menu.jpg|1866 menu File:St Nicholas Hotel 1858 register.jpg|1858 register The main lobby had a white oak staircase leading to the upper floors. The first landing was illuminated by a $1,100 chandelier, one of many expensive and elaborate lighting fixtures found throughout the hotel. On the wall above this landing was a painting of the Dutch mythical gift-giving figure Sinterklaas (aka St.Nicholas) placing presents into Christmas stockings. The hotel's public rooms were paneled in mahogany and walnut and lit with gas lights. There was much use of gold paint throughout the hotel. The hotel had window curtains that cost $700 apiece and gold embroidered draperies at $1,000 per pair. Bathrooms featured bathtubs encased in carved walnut and there were many mirrors everywhere. The public hallways on all floors were heated with steam heat, and guestrooms on the sleeping floors each had stoves. The beds had springs. The hotel had a $1,500 grand piano and a bridal chamber that was outfitted with the finest damask. The hotel developed something of a reputation for having a \\"fast crowd\\", such that an agreement to an assignation there was reputed to be an admission of loss of chastityunless it happened to be a bride in the bridal suite. On the second floor an ornately carved \\"exquisite rosewood Aeolion piano\\" produced by Boston's T.Gilbert & Co. featured mother of pearl keys, rather than the then- customary ivory. The hotel's \\"ingenious call system\\" connected guest rooms to the main office; bells could be remotely rung using electrical current. Significant events The evening of November 25, 1864, the hotel was involved in a terrorist attack by the so-called Confederate Army of Manhattan, that is, Confederate saboteurs who thought they would set fire to New York City. The St.Nicholas was one of more than a dozen of the finest New York hotels that were infested by them with a purpose to set them afire. Other hotels included Astor House and the Metropolitan Hotel. The attempt was ill- conceived and badly executed. The fires largely self-extinguished due to a lack of oxygen; they were set in locked rooms, the technology was not well- developed, and the terrorists were intent on making their own escape.  Demise  521 and 523 By the later part of the nineteenth century, the hotel had declined in popularity, most New York City tourists preferring to stay farther uptown. Beginning in the mid 1870s, certain parts of the hotel building were converted to other uses. The Snook-designed Loubat store (No. 503‚Äì5ll) took the southern wing in 1878. The central portion (No.513‚Äì519) became Samuel Warner's store and warehouse in 1884. The hotel permanently closed then. A sliver of the original building was saved when the hotel was demolished in the twentieth century. This is now the luxury condos of 521 and 523 Broadway. The upper stories of No.521 have most of their original ornamented moldings on the windows. Although the hotel once occupied the entire block adjacent to Broome Street, the building has more or less disappeared; only Lady Footlocker and The Puma Store now occupy the first (ground) floor of the remaining sliver. The opulent exterior was the subject of an 1855 lithograph by artist Frederick Heppenheimer, which is now part of the collection of the Museum of the City of New York, being artifact No.39.253.6.

On 25 June 1961, aged 17, she became the first person to complete the Thames Estuary two-way swim, which she did in 6 hours and 40 minutes She was accompanied on that swim by official observers from Leigh Swimming Club and the historic fishing boat The Endeavour. Also in 1961, she became the youngest person to swim the English Channel, swimming from France to England in 15 hours 8 minutes. Early life Margaret White was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, England. Her parents were Vera Doreen Smith and William Henry White, a WW2 veteran Army Air Corps who won a Military Medal for participation in the invasion of Sicily. She had one brother, John White, career military (deceased 2017). Margaret White attended Leigh North Street Primary School, Belfairs High School, and then The Southend Municipal College. Studied nursing at the Southend and Rochford Hospitals Group Essex, and Queen Charlottes Maternity Hospital Chiswick London. At age 5, White joined the Leigh-on-Sea Swimming Club. She swam under the guidance of Melville Chadwick and his wife Doris. She participated in swim meets up to county levels, and excelled in middle distance swimming. White got many medals and trophies and at age 11 became very interested in the possibility of swimming the English Channel. She started training with her sights set on becoming the youngest person on record. Marilyn Bell from Canada was the record holder at the time.  Training swims  Other swims were achieved before the Channel; all White's training was done in the Thames Estuary, despite the fact that the waters of the Estuary were considered extremely polluted at that time. Swimming was a way of life for young children who lived along the shores of the Thames particularly after the war when many families had fled during the blitz in London. The training involved participating in events organized by the British Long Distance Swimming Association, and other swims organized with the help of others who had already swum the Channel, notably June Gilbert and Michael Jennings. On 16 August 1959, White undertook the swim from Solent Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight. She succeeded in 3 hrs. 20 mins, and at the time was the youngest, aged just 15, to have achieved it. She also had accompanied Channel Swimmer Dennis Pearson from Rhodesia on his successful Channel crossing with Captain Len Hutchison piloting. In those days of no GPS, her coach had come to trust this famous Dover pilot.  Swimming the Estuary  On 7 August 1960 she swam the Thames Estuary from Southend to Kent in 3hrs.5mins. She was the first woman to have done it, and was aged just 16. She was accompanied on that swim by the famous 'Endeavour' fishing boat. On 10 June 1925 Norman Derham had completed a one way swim across the Estuary. On 27 August 1960 White swam Windermere in 7 hours 26 minutes. It was a British Long Distance Swimming Association (BLDSA) race, and age 16, she came second, finding the lake quite a challenge. For a salt water swimmer, the lack of buoyancy was difficult to overcome. On 25 June 1961 White completed the Thames Estuary two-way swim. Southend to Kent and return, in 6 hours 40 minutes. She was the first person to accomplish this, at the age of 17. She was accompanied by official observers from Leigh Swimming Club and the historic fishing boat ‚ÄòThe Endeavour‚Äô. As White says, ‚ÄòSwimming across the Thames Estuary two ways is difficult as one has to contemplate the tides. The outgoing tide is difficult to swim against and one had to swim fast enough to time getting there and back on the one tide otherwise there is a danger of being stranded on the return. My swim found me walking across the mud flats approx. 100 yards from the Leigh tow path, which runs along the shoreline.‚Äô At the time this swim was recognized by the BLDSA, when the organization was in its infancy. Author Caitlin Davies has included information on the swim on her blog for the Museum of London, including photos of White. The swim was accomplished without any aids using the Channel Swimming Association and the BLDSA rules. The port of London Authorities was notified in advance.  Swimming The Channel  On 2 September 1961, she became the youngest person to swim the English Channel from France to England in 15hrs 8mins.Margaret White dover.uk.com  Other life  In January 1962 White started SRN and Midwifery training at the Southend Rochford Hospital Group. In August 1965 she commenced a one-year contract with the Zambian Government working as a nursing sister in the non- fee paying Lusaka Central Hospital in Zambia. She then travelled extensively through Africa during and after this tour of duty. Rhodesia, South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Kenya, Congo and Ethiopia. White joined the Zambian Flying Doctor Service headed and founded by Dr.James Lawless and his wife Margaret, working with a group of nurses and doctors to establish clinics in the remote areas of Zambia. The service still in existence. Dr. Lawless moved on to Australia where he set up another Flying Doctor Service. White went to Montreal in November 1969, and stayed for 15 years, working first at the Montreal General and Jewish General Hospitals as an Emergency Room nurse, until changing careers. Between 1975 and 1986 she worked for Prudential Assurance Company, Life, disability, pension and group sales. She became a Member of The Million Dollar Round Table club in 1977.

The riot then further escalated and spread all the way through Kampung Gandhi, Kampung Lindungan , Kampung Datuk Harun, Taman Desa Ria and the surrounding of Jalan Klang Lama. The racial crisis then spread all the way through Petaling Jaya, Jalan Gasing, Kelana Jaya, Sungai Way, Bandar Sunway and Puchong. The riot started from 4 March until 13 March 2001. Photographs in Malaysiakini's possession are gruesome evidence of the extensive hurt, both physical and emotional, inflicted by the clashes. The three weeks of tension resulted in the deaths of 6 people, and left over a hundred people with severe wounds, ranging from head injuries, broken bones, to slashes and hacked off limbs. Four hundred people were detained. Background The residents of Kampung Medan are 70% Malay, 20% Indian and 10% Chinese. The Malays live in low-cost flats and houses. The Chinese are scattered, while the Indians live in longhouses and squatter settlements. Police have admitted they neglected the areas, which had achieved notoriety for gangster activity, drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, fights and even incest. Violence has been a way of life and over the last three years, there have been no fewer than 40 cases of violence involving the squatters and those living in the vicinity. In incidents over the past few days, the villagers have blamed outsiders for the violence. The riot between the two groups initiated in Kampung Medan from a wedding and funeral. The wedding ceremony was held by a Malay family in their house, at the same time, their Indian neighbours were having their funeral ceremony. Rioting Early Event An Indian security guard on the way back from work at 3 a.m. on March 4. He found a tent erected in the middle of the narrow road in Kampung Medan, of Jalan Klang Lama, for a wedding. He became agitated and started kicking the tables and chairs. His action angered the Malay family that was preparing for the wedding, and they rushed out to beat him up. The security guard fled and returned later with a parang and five other cohorts. A fight broke out. He ran towards an Indian house, a few hundred metres away, presumably for refuge where a wake was being held, contrary to earlier reports that the fight started because the funeral procession was blocked by the tent. The group of Malays, who thought he was a member of the household, then set fire to a car and two motorcycles. But the spark came four days later when fights broke out after Indian children playing with catapults broke a van windscreen. The agitated van owner, an Indian, sought compensation from the children's parents. He was joined by his driver, a Malay, but some villagers who saw the commotion thought that a Malay was threatening the Indians. By then, the rumours were flying of an Indian-Malay fight. As with all rumours, more versions followed, resulting in mounting tension among the Malays and Indians in the area. Retaliations and armed response A six-member team representing a network of NGOs for a Violence Free Community took upon themselves to record the names and injuries of the victims. Below are some of the details: On 8 March 2001, a 26-year-old Indian construction worker and his friend were returning to their homes in Kampung Semarak off Jalan Klang Lama on a motorcycle at 10.30pm. They were attacked by about 50 Malay youths carrying iron rods, wooden sticks and hockey sticks. His friend escaped, but the construction worker ended up with a broken right leg. Suresh, 19, sustained head injuries when he was assaulted by five Malay people at about 10.30pm. The college student from Taman Medan was returning home when five to six Malay youths obstructed his way. They asked him about his ethnic origin. When he told them, Suresh was attacked with sharp instruments and wooden sticks. He passed out. He suffered multiple slash wounds on the head and abdomen. He also suffered a deep slash which almost severed the wrist from his left hand. On 9 March 2001, Mathavan was assaulted by a gang of Malay youths when he was returning home on a motorcycle. He suffered a leg fracture and injuries on his hands. His motorcycle was torched. Annadurai was carrying goods in his van when Malay youths attacked him near the Shell petrol station in Sri Manja, located near Taman Medan. He suffered injuries on his head and hands. Security guard Kanan was assaulted in Kampung Medan while returning home from work. He had head injuries, a fractured leg and suffered a hemorrhage in his kidney. Rajathurai was on drips and on a resuscitation machine. Naharul Hisham sustained injuries on his hands and his fingers were almost severed. On 10 March 2001, a Form 5 student from Kampung Gandhi who was in Taman Medan with his brother at 3 p.m. were chased by about 100 Malay men on motorcycles, armed with samurai swords, wooden sticks and iron rods. The two were caught and assaulted. His brother's hands were almost severed. Norhashihadi was returning to Kampung Medan after work when he was attacked by 10 Indian men. He suffered head injuries. In Sungei Way, Indonesian worker Sujari was attacked by six men while Yong So Lin was attacked by three. Muthukumar, from Bidor, Perak, was delivering fruits when he and his co-worker were attacked by Malay youths in Kampung Datuk Harun. He sustained head injuries.

He had injuries on his head and back. Bakhshish Elahi, a Pakistani, and his partner were assaulted in a lorry by about 100 youths armed with pipes, swords and parangs. He had injuries on his head, legs and hand. On 13 March 2001, A lorry driver and a factory supervisor were attacked by racist Malay youths with parangs. Four fingers on the supervisor's right hand were almost severed. He also had two slash wounds across his shoulders. The lorry driver's fingers on his left hand were almost severed. He also suffered a slash wound to the back of the head. Aftermath Reaction The Menteri Besar of Selangor, Datuk Seri Dr Mohamed Khir Toyo, acted by securing the Hindu temple in Kampung Medan to prevent any further violence from the Malay community. He advised the Malay residence to act but abide the laws of the country. Security forces also seized almost 100 weapons including home-made bombs, machetes, knives, samurai swords, catapults, chains, steel pipes, batons and axes from Malay youths. Kampung Medan is a classic case of the urban poor working for crumbs,\\" the Star newspaper said in an analysis. Mohammad Agus Yusoff, political science lecturer at the National University, told AFP that poor infrastructure and a host of socio-economic ills bred frustration. Social activist, Dr. Kua Kia Soong, criticized the security forces failed to protect the people or act without bias in the incidents similarly with the May 13 Incident. The then- president of Malaysian Indian Congress, Samy Vellu visited the corpse of K. Muneiretham in University Hospital. V. Segar, 34 dan A. Ganeson, 28 are few of the death by the riot. Casualties The incident in the squatter area has left six people dead and 24 hospitalised. Police said 183 people comprising 100 Malays, 14 Indonesians including two women, and 69 Indians have been arrested. Cause of Problem The main cause of the racial conflict that occurred in Kampung Medan on March 13, 2001 is poverty due to the government's negligence, as stated by Associate Professor Dr Mansor Mohd Noor. \\"If you are poor, you have the same problems. This is our problem, not a Malay or Indian problem,\\" he added. According to Michael (1997), the causes of ethnic conflict can be categorised as state, structural, political, socio-economic and cultural factors (p. 5).Michael, EB 1997. The Causes of Internal Conflict: An Overview. In Michael E. Brown et al, Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict: An International Security Reader, MIT Press, Massachusetts. It is stated by Dr Mansor Mohd Noor that the poverty and marginalisation has broken down the community and is unrelated to the government. The negligence of Kampung Medan by the government has led to an improper education system, lack of social activities, and the lack of resources to sustain a healthy community. Controversies In 2003, Yayasan Strategik Sosial (YSS) executive director Datuk Dr Denison Jayasooria's research paper was accused of pointing out that the Indian Youth was the outbreak in Kampung Medan by former Higher Education Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamad. Misinterpretation in Ethnic Relations guidebook used his point without his consultation. ‚ÄúNowhere in my articles on Kg Medan did I state that Indian youths were the sole cause of the Kg Medan tragedy. My position is clear that there are a multiplicity of factors and these have to be read in relation to one another,‚Äù he said, adding that it was of utmost importance that politicians read the full text. K. Devamany (BN ‚Äì Cameron Highlands) stated that his( Datuk Dr Denison Jayasooria) statement is not associated with MIC and not an opinion by MIC too. MPs saw red during the debate on the Ethnic Relations guidebook at the Dewan Rakyat, with parliamentarians from both sides of the House questioning the merit of the controversial teaching guide. The reply by Higher Education Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed, especially on the Kampung Medan riots, irked not only Opposition MPs but also several from the Barisan Nasional., The Star Online, 20 July 2006 Mostly the culprits in Kampung Medan were youths but was not specifically stated any ethnic group. Tempromental Solution They introduce society activities such as the Rukun Tetangga. The members of Rukun Tetangga are the residents of the place they are patrolling because who else are better than the ones know those roads. The Rukun Tetangga art of the National Unity and Integration Action Plan, has been up since June 2007.

Plot Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is a popular college student with over 800 friends on Facebook. She lives with Olivia (Brit Morgan), Isabelle, and Gustavo (Sean Marquette), Isabelle's boyfriend. She is close friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo) and is dating Tyler (William Moseley). Laura receives a friend request from her classmate Marina. Noticing she has no friends, she accepts and the two begin hanging out, but she is uncomfortable with Marina's obsessive behavior and sees that her Facebook profile is full of disturbing posts. Marina wants to attend Laura's birthday dinner but Laura lies and says only she and Tyler are going out. That night, Marina sees pictures of Laura and her friends on Facebook, and angrily confronts her the next day. During their quarrel, Laura accidentally reveals Marina's bald spot, a result of hair pulling disorder. She then unfriends Marina on Facebook. The next morning, it is announced that Marina committed suicide. Laura feels responsible but tries to forget about it until Marina uploads a video showing her burning a sketch of Laura before hanging herself. The video is somehow posted on Laura's own page and she is unable to remove it or delete her account. Marina adds Gustavo as a friend. He is then terrorized by a demonic spirit and has his face smashed by an invisible entity. Isabelle discovers him and is sent to the hospital. A video of Gustavo's apparent suicide is posted on Laura's page and once again, she is unable to delete it. Laura's friends and family begin to turn against her. Kobe and Laura break into Marina's dorm room and find an old class photograph from an orphanage. Laura visits the orphanage and discovers Marina's real last name is Nedifar, and she was tormented by two boys when she was younger. The boys were murdered, with their faces mutilated and swarmed by black wasps, the same way Gustavo died. Her mother had been part of a commune, rumored to be a demonic cult, until someone set it on fire. Her mother, then pregnant, was horribly burned and doctors did a C-section to get Marina out of her burnt body. Kobe does research on black mirrors, which they keep seeing, and learns that they were mostly used by witches. Isabella becomes Marina's next victim. A video of her killing herself is posted on Laura's page. Olivia is attacked and killed next. Laura and Kobe go in search of the place where Marina committed suicide to destroy the black mirror she died in front of, as that is what she used to become an evil spirit to torment Laura. Kobe, realizing he is the next victim, becomes deranged, and stabs Laura, hoping to kill her and save himself. She escapes and learns that Marina killed herself in a nearby factory. Tyler finds Laura, but Kobe kills him. Before he can kill Laura, Kobe is killed by the swarm of wasps. Laura sees an apparition of the two mutilated men (the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage) and yells at Marina, asking what she wants. The spirit of a younger Marina appears and says that she just wanted to be friends. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina. In the epilogue, Laura, now possessed by Marina, looks at a few girls the same way that Marina looked at Laura in the beginning.

In Germany, the film is titled Unfriend, since Unfriended was released as Unknown User in Germany. Filming The film was shot in Cape Town at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Though the film was produced by German director Simon Verhoeven and German production companies, the largely English-speaking cast required the film to be shot in English. Filming ended in March 2014. Release The film was released in Germany on 7 January 2016, 20 April 2016 in the United Kingdom and in the United States on 22 September 2017. Reception Box office , Friend Request has grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada and $7.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $11.3 million, against a production budget of $9.9 million. In North America, the film was released alongside Kingsman: The Golden Circle and The Lego Ninjago Movie, and was initially projected to gross around $5 million from 2,569 theatres in its opening weekend. However, after grossing just $750,000 on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $1.5‚Äì2 million. It ended up grossing $2 million, finishing 7th at the box office, and passing Victor Frankenstein for the worst opening gross for a film playing in over 2,500 theatres. Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 16% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 3.42/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Friend Requests attempts to update old-school teen horror for the digital age do not, sadly, include memorable characters, fresh scares, or novel storytelling twists.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being \\"visually stylish and imaginative\\" but criticised it for becoming less interesting as the film went on. Jessica Kiang of Variety was impressed by the practical effects, but criticised the way the film had little to do with the \\"technology that it ostensibly exists to critique\\". Ally Wybrew of Empire gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Debnam-Carey, who \\"[stood] out [amongst] otherwise mediocre performances\\" in contrast to the poorly written character of Marina. Wybrew went on to criticise the clunky lines, overenthusiastic score, and the protracted final act.

History The creation of the International Institute of Ligurian Studies is credited to the partnership between Margaret Berry and Nino Lamboglia. In 1888, Clarence Bicknell built the Bicknell Museum at Via Romana 39, and when he died in 1918, he left the museum to the municipality of Bordighera, which planned to relocate it. Bicknell's grandson Edward Elhanan Berry, together with his wife Margaret, fought to keep the museum intact, and after five years, the municipality withdrew its plans to rehouse it. Thus, in 1924, the museum was transformed into an independent institution and its collections, at the time essentially linked to botany and prehistory, were expanded to include local art, history, and traditions. In 1932, the first historical association of the Italian Riviera, the Societ√† Storico-Archeologica Ingauna e Intemelia (Ingauna and Intemelia Historico-Archaeological Society), was formed in Albenga. Margaret Berry, whose husband Edward had died in Rome in 1931, was one of the first members of the society, and in agreement with Professor Nino Lamboglia, she established the headquarters of the association at the Bicknell Museum. The transformation of the Ingauna and Intemelia Historico-Archaeological Society into the Institute of Ligurian Studies took place in 1937, and Lamboglia became its manager. In 1947, the \\"international\\" epithet was added to the name, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between scholars on the Italo-French coast. The institute currently has twenty-one sections, of which sixteen are in Italy, three in France, and two in Spain. In Italy, it is particularly active in Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy, and northwestern Tuscany ‚Äî these being the regions closely corresponding with the territories formerly populated by the Ligurians. In France, the institute is particularly active in the Rhone Valley and in general in the south of the country, within the borders of ancient Gallia Narbonensis.

The Seltzbach near Seltz  Geography   Course  The Seltzbach rises at a height of about in the For√™t de G≈ìrsdorf northeast of Mitschdorf in the North Vosges It initially flows for about 700 metres through woods in a southerly direction. Thereafter its course runs along the boundary between the municipalities of Mitschdorf and Lampertsloch, past the fields and meadows of the field system known as In der Heimelsstraengen to its right and the woods of Liebwald to its left. The river is now heding south-southwest. Near the mill of Brehmm√ºhle southeast of Mitschdorf and north of the Rue de Voyageurs (D677) it bends sharply, almost at right angles, to bear east-southeast. This now becomes its main direction of flow from here to its mouth. It now reaches the western edge of Preuschdorf and its volume is increased by the arrival of a headstream from the left, from the Liebwald to the north. Somewhat later it is joined by a stream on the right from the hill of Kalmersberg, which on many mapsG√©oportail is also seen as the main headstream of the same name. East of the village it is fed from the right by the Kinderlochgraben, which comes from the southwest. Its course is now accompanied for a long stretch by the D28. It flows now through a landscape of fields and meadows. Just before it reaches Merkwiller- P√©chelbronn, it picks up the waters of the Augraben from the left and, a little later, the Willenbachgraben on the right. After the Seltzersbach has left the village, it collects the Bruchgraben from the right, south of Wingertsfeld. The Seltzersbach now passes through the municipality of Kutzenhausen. At the spot where it is joined from the right by the Sumpfgraben, the Seltzersbach swings northeast and reaches Soultz-sous-For√™ts- Wolfsgarten shortly thereafter. It now changes direction to head west, flows through grassland and crosses under the Rue du Docteur Michel Deutsch (D264). Shortly afterwards on its left side its water volume it boosted by the Froeschwillerbach, also called the Froeschwillerbaechel. The Seltzersbach now passes under a railway of the SNCF and flows through more fields and meadows, passing under theD263 northeast of Hohwiller. It arrives in Hoffen where it crosses the D52 near the mill of Bostaetter M√ºhle. Near the sawmill (Saegmuehle), northeast of Leiterswiller, it collects Haussauerbach on the left. There the Eichelgraben ditch splits off and then, south of Oberroedern on its northern bank, the Eilgraben. The Seltzersbach passes under the D245 and is rejoined shortly thereafter by the Eichelgraben. Immediately afterwards another ditch branches of the Seltzersbach to the south. Southwest of Buhl the Eilgraben to the north rejoins the Seltzersbach. Soon afterwards the Seebach, also called the Seebaechel, empties into the river from the left. Near the mill of Gerittsm√ºhle the Warsbach discharges into the Seltzersbach on the left, coming from the north. It now reaches Niederr≈ìdern and is fed there by the Reissergraben from the right. It leaves this village and snakes its way along the northern perimeter of the Hesselbusch woods, passes under the N363 and reaches the northern edge of Seltz, where it picks up the Eberbach from the left.

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Willi Herrmann and Heinrich Weidemann. It was shot at the Spandau Studios and on location in Rosenheim in Bavaria. Plot Vinzenz Heller, the priest of Kirchfeld, is highly esteemed by his congregation. The Kriegerwitwe Stricker lives with the railwayman Franz Wagner in the concubinage. This sin is condemned by Heller, but nevertheless, Knight's ten-year-old boy may serve as a ministrant to the priest. It is not the case, however, that Karli Stricker suffers a serious conscience of conscience, which the priest can not overcome. The only reason why the railroad does not want to marry the knights is that they would lose their pension. The Concordat provides, under certain circumstances before a secret marriage without a civil marriage must precede. For this reason Heller speaks to the Ordinariat. However, his request is denied because no social emergency is apparent. In the parsonage the refugee girl Anna Birkmaier has been living for some time. This is supported by the old parishioner Brigitte. But the longer Anna stays in the parsonage, the more she feels attracted to the priest. He too begins to desire the girl, but he knows how to restrain his lust. Brigitte observes this development with great concern because she knows the gossip about the village. There is also one in the place, which is not well-disposed towards the priest: the rich innkeeper Josef Riedl. It can not be that the pastor once condemned the alcohol from the pulpit, whereupon fewer guests visited his place. Anna is always more and more courted by the village smith Michl Ambacher. The girl, however, gives him a discharge. She never wants to marry, but always stay in the parsonage. One day, she reveals to her boss that she is the mother of a little boy. He was in a neighboring place in nursing. His father had not been able to marry her because he died before all the documents were together. She had only applied for a position in Kirchfeld in order to be near her son. One day Karli Stricker disappeared. His mother had left the news that he would never return. When he is found after a few days, the pastor is plagued by the bad conscience. Now he resists the prohibition of the church authorities and secretly distrusts the boy's mother with the railwayman. Someone in the village got wind of it and makes sure that the news spreads into wind cables. To the parishioner, he was together with Anna with her son and then went to a concert with her in the city. They missed the last train and had to spend the night in the waiting room. When they return to Kirchfeld in the morning, they are watched by the innkeeper Riedl, whereupon he spreads the rumor, the priest had a relationship with his employees. Gradually more and more villagers turn away from the priest. When Anna realizes what the priest is at stake, she agrees to marry the village smith, although she does not feel love for him. To the priest's attempt to expel her plan, the girl meets with the demand that he may give up his priesthood to enter into marriage with her.

He was the fourth son of George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham. As the eldest son still living when his father died in 1830, he succeeded as Earl of Ashburnham, Viscount St. Asaph and Baron of Ashburnham. He married Katherine Charlotte Baillie in 1840. They had four daughters and seven sons, including Bertram, the 5th Earl of Ashburnham, who succeeded his father in 1878, and Thomas, the 6th Earl, who succeeded his brother in 1913 when the latter died without a son. The Ashburnham library The 4th Earl of Ashburnham was a bibliophile who amassed an important collection of printed books and manuscripts and was known as \\"one of the great collectors of the nineteenth century\\". His incunabula included two copies of the Gutenberg Bible and approximately thirty volumes that had been printed by William Caxton. Ashburnham's heir, the 5th Earl, sold off the book collection in a series of auctions in 1897 and 1898, realising a total of ¬£62,712 for the 4075 lots sold. Most of Ashburnham's manuscripts were acquired through three large purchases in the 1840s. In 1847 he bought 1923 manuscripts from Count Guglielmo Libri. Libri was a collector and dealer who had stolen a large number of items from French public libraries while he was employed to create a union catalogue of manuscripts in the library collections. In 1845 Libri offered to sell his collection of manuscripts to the British Museum. Frederic Madden, head of the Museum's manuscript department, recommended the purchase but the Treasury would not grant the necessary funds. Libri then offered the collection to Lord Ashburnham, who purchased it in March 1847 for ¬£8,000. Notable among the manuscripts was a 7th-century illuminated manuscript of the Pentateuch which Libri had stolen from the library at Tours, where it was known as the Tours Pentateuch. Since its acquisition by Lord Ashburnham it has been called the Ashburnham Pentateuch. The collection also included manuscripts of Dante and Napoleon's correspondence . In 1850 Libri, who had fled to England, was convicted in absentia of theft by a French court. The French government asked Ashburnham to return the Libri manuscripts, offering to reimburse the amount he had paid, but he refused on the grounds that he believed Libri was innocent and had not received a fair trial. In May 1849 Ashburnham purchased a collection of 702 manuscripts from the French collector Joseph Barrois for ¬£6000. A visit by Paul Meyer of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France to the library at Ashburnham Place in 1865 led to the discovery that 64 of the Barrois manuscripts consisted of 33 items that had been stolen from the Biblioth√®que nationale, divided and rebound. Ashburnham was not accused or suspected of knowingly purchasing stolen goods. He eventually conceded, based on evidence put forward by Paul Meyer and L√©opold Delisle of the Biblioth√®que nationale, that some of the Libri and Barrois manuscripts had been stolen but he declined to return them to their rightful owners. In 1849 Ashburnham purchased a collection of 996 manuscripts from the library of Stowe House. He paid ¬£8,000 for the collection, which had been catalogued in preparation for sale by public auction after the bankruptcy of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. The remaining manuscripts in Ashburnham's collection were acquired individually and were identified as the \\"Appendix\\" collection. After the 4th Earl's death in 1878, the 5th Earl sold off the manuscript collections over the course of more than twenty years, ending in 1901 with the sale of the last of the Barrois collection.

In 2002 Claridge graduated from the University of Reading with a degree in Fine Art before working at an art gallery in Windsor, United Kingdom whilst he developed his artistic practice. In 2005 Birmingham-based art publishers Washington Green Fine Art offered Claridge a contract, in which his limited edition artwork would be sold in galleries across the United Kingdom. Collectors of Claridge's work include musician Rod Stewart, celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe and Formula One racing driver David Coulthard. Simon Claridge lives in Reading, United Kingdom, with his business partner and wife, Ruth.  Style  Claridge is known for his black and white portraits of iconic women of stage and screen, though in 2015 Claridge exhibited a collection which also featured Elvis Presley and John Lennon. Typically employing the silkscreen technique, Claridge also frequently uses diamond dust, a form of glitter derived from diamonds.  Notable projects  Henry Holland for Cancer Research UK (2011) Claridge created a portrait of model Kate Moss, which was included in Henry Holland's debut exhibition and auction in aid of Cancer Research UK. The painting, signed by artist and model fetched over ¬£3,000 for the cause. Alfa Romeo (2013) Car brand Alfa Romeo commissioned Claridge to create murals across car parking spaces near Oxford Street, London. The murals featured portraits of Kate Moss, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and David Bowie in Claridge's signature style. Twentieth Century Fox (2013‚Äì2015) In a project which reportedly took two years to complete, Claridge was given unprecedented access to the film archives of Twentieth Century Fox in a partnership which saw him create Marilyn six original paintings of Marilyn Monroe based on stills and photographs owned by Twentieth Century Fox. The six were manufactured as signed limited edition artworks and displayed in galleries around the United Kingdom. Playboy (2014‚Äì2016) This art collection from Claridge launched at the Playboy Club in Mayfair on Thursday 14 January 2016. It follows Playboy‚Äôs diamond anniversary in 2013 and is a collection of six vintage magazine covers spanning three decades of the iconic magazine. Claridge was, again, given unprecedented access to the archives, finally selecting six images from around seven hundred covers, dating from 1967 to 1982, including Playboy Bunnies, Karen Christy and Kaya Christian. All of the images are painted in Claridge's signature monochrome style and are embellished with diamond dust. Brigitte Bardot (2016) The Brigitte Bardot collection represents his continued celebration of iconic female beauty. Claridge states that, to him, Bardot \\"defines beauty\\" and, indeed, was one of the first females to make an impression on him. Bardot's look and style is still current today and is emulated by some of the biggest names in fashion. These limited edition pieces segue beautifully from both his previous collections and, displayed alongside each other, form a visual homage to the greatest female trailblazers in popular culture. Terry O'Neill (2017) In his latest collection of limited edition diamond dust silkscreen prints, Simon Claridge has taken iconic images from the hallowed archives of legendary English photographer Terry O‚ÄôNeill. In a career spanning more than half a century, O‚ÄôNeill pioneered the iconic celebrity portrait and became famed for his instinct and ability to capture his subjects in candid, and sometimes unorthodox, poses and locations. Also an accomplished photographer himself, Claridge has long admired the work of Terry O‚ÄôNeill. For that admiration now to be mutual is a source of great pride for him. Putting paid to the common misconception that one must never meet their heroes for fear of them not living up to expectations, Claridge describes the collaboration as ‚Äúa meeting of minds‚Äù between two fellow artists, each with an appreciation for the other‚Äôs style.

Together, they work to improve social programs and policies for citizens, specifically those facing social exclusion. CRECS was founded in Ottawa, Ontario and continues to operate at the University of Ottawa.  History  CRECS was founded by professors Tim Aubry and Robert Flynn as the Community Services Research Unit (CSRU). The CSRU aimed to provide a point of contact between University of Ottawa faculty and students with community organizations, with the intention of collaborating on research projects that would develop and further success in health and social services. The CRSU also established a summer program offering training to practitioners in the non-profit sector. The research unit began over 20 studies with organizations and government agencies in the Ottawa area. They worked in several areas, including child welfare, homelessness, community mental health, and developmental disabilities. Continuing its success, CRSU received official status as a research centre and became the Centre for Research on Community Services (CRCS) within the Faculty of Social Sciences. The Centre continued to grow with the addition of new collaborators and researchers, including Professors Brad Cousins, Doug Angus and Marie Drolet. As more staff members and both graduate and undergraduate students began to work at CRCS, the Centre increased its presence in the community through various externally funded projects and continued to work with many graduate students at the university. In 2006, the Centre was established as a bi-faculty research centre, the first of its kind, at the University of Ottawa. Along with the sponsorship came a name change, with the Centre being renamed to its current title, the Centre for Research on Educational and Community Services. Several other important changes were implemented, notably the creation of a Graduate Certificate Program in Program Evaluation, designed to train individuals in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors so that they are able to conduct their own program evaluations. Since then, the Centre has continued to grow and continue its success. Visibility for the Centre continually increases with initiatives such as regular noon hour colloquiums and creating a web-based video series known as the Ten Minute Window. CRECS has also organized research and training forums in collaboration with community organizations and providing funding and support for students. With a growing roster of researchers and collaborators, CRECS continues to develop and work towards new directions.  Strategic goals  CRECS is guided by the four strategic goals set by the University of Ottawa in its activities. The Centre aims to provide and enhance student experience, as well as achieve excellence in research. CRECS has offered hundreds of opportunities to undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, from working to publish their efforts on applied research or evaluation projects, to fostering an environment where professors and students harmoniously work together. The Centre also contributes to the research community, with several peer-reviewed articles, conference presentations and book chapters produced in the past year alone. The promotion of bilingualism through the university has enabled CRECS to educate a wider audience, as it offers core course on evaluation in both English and French. Additionally, the Centre worked towards developing leaders through internationalization by participating in several international collaborations and research networks.

It was built in 1798 to commemorate the locality's status as a city, which had been granted by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan- Polduc on 21 June 1777. History Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, attended the feast of the village of ≈ªebbuƒ° on 12 May 1776. The parish priest Dun Feliƒã Borg sent a petition to the Grand Master, requesting that the village be elevated to the status of a city. Borg promised to construct two triumphal arches if the request was accepted. De Rohan agreed and gave ≈ªebbuƒ° the title Citt√† Rohan by a decree dated 21 June 1777. De Rohan Arch as viewed from the back The niche of the Ecce Homo, installed on the arch Although city status was granted, the two arches were not built due to several difficulties. De Rohan died on 14 July 1797, and the people decided to build a single arch at the entrance to the city, partially fulfilling the promise they had made twenty years earlier. The arch cost about 1000 scudi to build, and funds were raised through fundraising by the population of ≈ªebbuƒ°, as well as a donation by the parish church. The arch was designed by the mason Giuseppe Xerri, who also supervised its construction. It was inaugurated on 12 May 1798 by the new Grand Master, Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. The gate was one of the last examples of Hospitaller-era architecture in Malta, since a month after its inauguration the French invaded the islands and brought the Order's rule to an end. Between 1905 and 1929, the Malta tramway used to pass near the arch. In the 1950s, Freedom Avenue () was opened to give better access to the ≈ªebbuƒ° centre, and this reduced the amount of traffic passing through the arch. Later on, vehicles were not allowed to pass through the arch in order to preserve it. The arch was restored by the ≈ªebbuƒ° Local Council in 1995. It was restored again in 2016. The De Rohan Arch was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and it is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument. Architecture De Rohan Arch is built in the neoclassical style. The archway is flanked by rusticated Doric pilasters set on a plain pedestal. The arch is topped by a triangular pediment having moulded edges. A Gothic designed niche, containing a portrait of the Ecce homo, is located within the arch. The niche, painted in red and white, is listed on National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

History Marie Tuck was born at Mount Torrens, South Australia, one of eight children of Edward Starkey Tuck (13 March 1827 ‚Äì 9 August 1898) and his wife Amy Harriet Tuck, n√©e Tayler (29 April 1827 ‚Äì 13 January 1901), on 5 September 1866, though she later claimed 1872 as her birth year. Her father was a schoolteacher at Mount Torrens. From 1886 she received arts training at night classes with James Ashton at his Norwood studio, then in the late 1880s at his Adelaide Academy of Arts, working at a Payneham plant nursery and assisting Ashton as a way of paying for her tuition while saving for her big ambition ‚Äì to study in Paris. She was an early member of the Adelaide Easel Club, In 1896 she moved to Perth, Western Australia, where she gave private tuition and worked at a photographer's studio, perhaps as a photo colorist. It took ten years, but in 1906, by then Principal of the Perth Art School, she sailed by the Runic to Paris, and there studied under expatriate Australian Rupert Bunny, developing a great love of French people and culture. She exhibited at the \\"Old Salon\\" (salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais), receiving an honorable mention for her painting Toilette for the Bride. She returned to Australia in 1914, departing from Liverpool on 27 June on the 'Medic' a White Star line Steamship, bound for the Cape and Australia. On 3 August Germany declared war on her beloved France. Arriving back in Adelaide on 7 August 1914, she declared that if she had known about the outbreak of war, she would have stayed in France. After her 1914 arrival back in South Australia, she exhibited in Adelaide and rejoined the local artistic community. She started teaching at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. This obituary gives her middle name as \\"Annelate\\", not seen elsewhere. She held many exhibitions of her own work in Adelaide; impressionistic landscapes, figures and portraits in oils. Her many students included Ivor Hele, Dora Cecil Chapman and Noel Wood. She never married; her last address was Jane Street, Frewville, where she had her studio in the front room.

Her surname also appears as Maillet or Maill√©. Biography Marie was born to Vital Mallet and Marguerite Sarrazin in Montreal, Lower Canada. Her father died when she was five and she spent the rest of her childhood living with an aunt and uncle in Lachine and in boarding with the Congregation of Notre Dame. Mallet joined the Sisters of Charity of the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral of Montreal as a novice in 1824 and became a nun in 1826. During the 1847 typhus epidemic in Montreal, she assumed full responsibility of the hospital. In 1849, she was chosen to be the founder and mother superior for a new congregation at Quebec City. Mallet established a relief service for needy children. The Sisters also provided a home for orphan children, as well as aged and infirm people. They also operated boarding schools for girls and an out-patient service for the poor. As well, the Sisters of Charity took in new immigrants who had no place else to stay and people who lost their homes to fire. The congregation went through a change in philosophy after adopting a new framework based on Jesuit order, replacing the earlier rule based on the Sulpician school. Mallet was not re-elected as mother superior in an election held in 1866 and returned to live life as a simple nun. She died in Quebec City on Easter Sunday at the age of 66 after suffering from cancer for two years. She was declared venerable in January 2014. The former convent of the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, known as the Maison M√®re-Mallet, has been designated a Quebec heritage building. The Institut Mallet has been established with the aim of promoting a culture of philanthropy in Quebec.

The hotel is situated on the west side of the Las Vegas Strip between Bellagio and The Mirage. It is one of Las Vegas's largest and best known landmarks. Caesars Palace was founded in 1966 by Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin, who sought to create an opulent facility that gave guests a sense of life during the Roman Empire. It contains many statues, columns and iconography typical of Hollywood Roman period productions including a statue of Augustus Caesar near the entrance. Caesars Palace is now owned by Vici Properties and operated by Caesars Entertainment. As of July 2016, the hotel has 3,960 rooms and suites in six towers and a convention facility of over . The hotel has a large range of restaurants. Among them are several which serve authentic Chinese cuisine to cater to wealthy East Asian gamblers. From the outset, Caesars Palace has been oriented towards attracting high rollers. The modern casino facilities include table games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, baccarat, Spanish 21, mini-baccarat, Pai Gow and Pai Gow poker. The casino also features a 24-hour poker room; and many slot machines and video poker machines. The hotel has operated as a host venue for live music and sports entertainment. In addition to holding boxing matches since the late 1970s, Caesars also hosted the Caesars Palace Grand Prix from 1981 to 1982. Notable entertainers who have performed at Caesars Palace include Frank Sinatra, Reba McEntire and Brooks & Dunn, Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Dean Martin, Rod Stewart, Stevie Nicks, The Moody Blues, Celine Dion, Ike & Tina Turner, Shania Twain, Bette Midler, Cher, Elton John, Liberace, Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Julio Iglesias, Ann-Margret, Tony Bennett, Harry Belafonte, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, Gloria Estefan, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Matt Goss and Deana Martin.

After departing in 2007, Dion returned to the Colosseum with her new show entitled \\"Celine\\" on March 15, 2011, which was under contract through June 9, 2018 for 65 shows per year. History Early history Caesars Palace fountains in 1970 In 1962, cabana motel owners Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin applied for a $10.6 million loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. He began plans to build a hotel on land owned by Kirk Kerkorian. Sarno would later act as designer of the hotel he planned to construct. His vision was to emulate life under the Roman Empire. The objective of the palace was to ensure an atmosphere in which everybody staying at the hotel would feel like a Caesar; this is why the name \\"Caesars Palace\\" lacks an apostrophe, making \\"Caesars\\" a plural instead of possessive noun. Caesars Palace was instrumental in beginning a new era of lavish casinos from the late 1960s onward. Architectural writer, Alan Hess, stated: \\"Caesars Palace needed only a sumptuous array of Classical statuary and a host of marble-white columns to establish its theme. The visitor's imagination, in league with well-placed publicity, filled in the opulence\\". Jefferson Graham wrote that the result was \\"the gaudiest, weirdest, most elaborate, and most talked about resort Vegas had ever seen. [Its] emblem was a chesty female dipping grapes into the waiting mouth of a recumbent Roman, fitted out in toga, laurel wreath, and phallic dagger\\". The inauguration ceremony was held on August 5, 1966. Sarno and his partner, Nate Jacobsen, spent one million dollars on the event. The cost included \\"the largest order of Ukrainian caviar ever placed by a private organization\\", two tons of filet mignon, of Maryland crabmeat and 50,000 glasses of champagne. Cocktail waitresses in Greco-Roman wigs would greet guests and say \\"Welcome to Caesars Palace, I am your slave\\". Among the performers at the opening were Andy Williams and Phil Richards. According to author Ovid Demaris, Caesars Palace was \\"a mob-controlled casino from the day it opened its doors\\". By the time it opened, the significant publicity of the new hotel had generated $42 million in advanced bookings. On December 31, 1967, stunt performer Evel Knievel arrived at the hotel to watch a boxing match and convinced Sarno that he could jump over the distance of over the fountains. ABC came in to film the jump, in which Knievel hit the top of the safety ramp after the jump and flew over his handlebars into the parking lot of neighbouring Dunes. Fracturing his pelvis, several bones and suffering a concussion, he lay in a hospital unconscious for 29 days in a coma before recovering. On April 14, 1989, Knievel's son Robbie successfully completed the jump. The first casino at the hotel was named Circus Circus. It was intended to be the world's liveliest and most expensive casino, attracting elite gamblers from around the world. In 1969, a Federal Organized Crime Task Force accused the casino's financial manager, Jerome Zarowitz, of having ties with organized-crime figures in New York and New England. Although Zarowitz was never tried, the task force pressured Sarno and his other investors to sell the casino, which led to it being acquired by Lum's restaurant chain owners Stuart and Clifford S. Perlman for $60 million. The company soon shed its restaurant operations and changed its name to Caesars World. On July 15 of that year, executives lay ground on an expansion area of the hotel, and they buried a time capsule in the area. Caesars Palace in 1970 Frank Sinatra began performing at Caesars Palace in 1967, after a fallout with Howard Hughes and Carl Cohen at The Sands. He signed a three-year contract. In the early morning hours of September 6, 1970, Sinatra was playing a high stakes baccarat at the casino, where he was performing at the time. Normal limits for the game are US$2,000 per hand; Sinatra had been playing for US$8,000 and wanted the stakes to be raised to US$16,000. When Sinatra began shouting after his request was denied, hotel executive Sanford Waterman came to talk with him. Witnesses to the incident said the two men both made threats, with Waterman producing a gun and pointing it at Sinatra. Sinatra walked out of the casino and returned to his Palm Springs home without fulfilling the rest of his three-week engagement there. Waterman was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, but was released without bail. The local district attorney's office declined to file charges against Waterman for pulling the gun, stating that Sinatra had refused to make a statement regarding the incident. Despite swearing to never perform at Caesars again, Sinatra returned after his retirement in January 1974, and became a frequent performer at Caesars Palace throughout the decade. He was performing at Caesars when his mother Dolly died in a plane crash in January 1977, and in 1979 he was awarded the Grammy Trustees Award in a party at the hotel, while celebrating 40 years in show business and his 64th birthday. When Sinatra was given back his gaming license by the Nevada Gaming Commission in 1981, he became an entertainment-public relations consultant at the casino for $20,000 a week. In 1971, some 1,500 African American rights activists stormed the hotel in a protest. The National Welfare Rights Organization was involved with a \\"coalition of welfare mothers, Legal Services lawyers, radical priests and nuns, civil rights leaders, movie stars and housewives\\". Five years later in the spring of 1976, hundreds of African American workers went on strike at the hotel in the first major strike in Las Vegas history. The entrances to the hotel and casino were blocked, and the hotel lost several million dollars from the strike, including one cancellation worth $500,000. In 1973, the Del Webb corporation was contracted to build a $8 million 16-story building adjacent to the Palace. In 1981, a fire broke out at the hotel, hospitalizing 16 people. The Perlmans sold their shares in Caesars World that year after trying to get a gaming license for a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission accused the brothers of doing business with people who had organized-crime connections. Later history Lobby in 2008View from Flamingo Road in 2012In 1986, the annual Teamsters convention was held at Caesars with a $650,000 party. The lavish feast included caviar, crab claws, roast beef and a range of 15 different desserts. In 1991, Sheila King won a $250,000 jackpot in the casino at Caesars Palace on a $500 machine and won $50,000 twice soon afterward. Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time over the next four years in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning. In the 1990s, the hotel's management sought to create more elaborate features to compete with the other modern Las Vegas developments. The Forum Shops at Caesars opened in 1992; it was one of the first venues in the city where shopping, particularly at high-end fashion house stores, was an attraction in itself. A new redevelopment opened on October 22, 2004. In June 2005, Harrah's Entertainment acquired Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and became the owner of Caesars Palace. Harrah's changed its own name to Caesars Entertainment in 2010, to capitalize on the prestige of the Caesars brand. In 2010, Caesars Palace was fined $250,000 by the Nevada Gaming Commission for permitting a high-limit baccarat player to dance on the card table while the game was underway. In September 2015, Caesars Palace agreed to pay the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network an $8 million civil money penalty for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. In October 2017, ownership of Caesars Palace was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off; Vici leased the property back to Caesars Entertainment at an initial annual rent of $165 million. Architecture The front of Caesars Palace in 2008Jeff Campbell of Lonely Planet refers to the hotel as \\"quintessentially Las Vegas\\", a \\"Greco-Roman fantasyland featuring marble reproductions of classical statuary\\". The art deco style fused with clear influences from Hollywood epic productions dominate. Construction of the 14-story Caesars Palace hotel on the site began in 1962, and it opened in 1966. It lay next to Dunes Hotel and opposite the Desert Inn. The original hotel featured lanes of cypresses and marble columns as part of a frontage, with the hotel set back . The car park could accommodate up to 1300 cars. Water is heavily used for at least 18 fountains throughout‚Äîthe casino resort uses over 240 million gallons a year. A high statue of Julius Caesar hailing a taxi lies in the driveway leading to the entrance, and there are replicas of Rape of the Sabine Women and statues of Venus and David which greet guests as they arrive. Near the entrance is a four-faced, eight-handed Brahma shrine which weighs four tons, It was made in Bangkok, Thailand, with a casting ceremony on November 25, 1983, according to the inscription on it. Exterior Augustus Tower in 2015A $75 million renovation of the hotel's original Roman Tower, built in 1966 and extended in 1974, was completed in January 2016. The 14-story Tower, last renovated in 2001, will have 20 rooms added for a total of 587 rooms and suites, and will be renamed the Julius Tower. Entertainment Close-Up wrote that the Julius Tower is the \\"latest piece of a $1 billion investment to cement Caesars Palace as the premier resort at the center of the Las Vegas Strip\\". Nobu Tower (formerly Centurion Tower) is a 14-story tower that was completed in 1970 at a cost of $4.2 million. In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. Rooms in the Forum Tower opened in 1979. The Palace Tower opened in 1998 and mirrors the Greco-Roman theme of the hotel with fluted columns and Corinthian columns and pediments on its facade and fountains and statues scattered around its interior space. Plans for the Augustus Tower began in 2003 and were consolidated in 2004 with the architects Bergman Walls Associates. The expansion at a cost of $289 million US included a 26-story, 345-foot-tall tower, as well as an addition of new convention and meeting facilities at the resort. The Augustus opened in 2005 with 949 rooms, which were designed for more upscale luxury and service than the other parts of the resort. The Octavius Tower opened in January 2012. The 668-room tower was added as part of a $860-million expansion. The tower shares a lobby with the Augustus Tower. The pools at Caesars Palace are modeled after the Roman baths. The Forum Shops The Forum Shops in 2011 The Forum Shops at Caesars, also known as \\"The Forum\\" is a shopping mall, built as an extension wing of the main hotel and casino in 1992. The spiral escalators in 2008 The mall's spiral staircase consists of spiral escalators. The mall also contains many replicas of famous fountains. The Fall of Atlantis fountain uses special effects and animated figures to tell the story of the Myth of Atlantis. With many high-end boutiques including Cartier, Chanel, Calvin Klein, Dior, Emporio Armani, Gucci, Ted Baker, Tiffany and Co, Valentino and Versace, it is the highest grossing mall in the United States, with higher sales per square foot than Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California. The mall, which was 280,000 square feet at its 1992 opening, was expanded by 500,000 square feet in 1997. A third expansion, which began in 2002, added another 200,000 square feet to the property. The Forum Shops property is considered to be the most valuable real estate in Las Vegas. Interior The hallway between the casino and The Forum Shops in 2015 The original hotel tower had 680 rooms, and each featured a room with one wall which was fully mirrored from floor to ceiling. The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, rosewood from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place. As of 2015, the hotel has 3,960 rooms and suites in six towers. In addition to its regular rooms and suites, Caesars Palace offers penthouse suites, and 14 villa suites named after notable Romans. A number of Roman statues were imported from Florence, Italy, valued at over $150,000. Statues of Julius Caesar and emperors such as Augustus and Nero are particularly common at the Palace. There are many variations of Augustus throughout, including two copies of the Prima Porta Augustus. Author Margaret Malamud notes the contrast between his \\"sober and pious figure\\" in the Olympic Lounge and the \\"statue of Nero and his lyre with which it is paired\\". There is a statue of the goddess Fortuna. One statue of David in the interior is an exact replica of an early 16th-century Michelangelo masterpiece, standing high and weighing over nine tons. Caesars Forum and gambling facilities Looking towards the Race & Sports Book in 2009 Caesars Forum is the original casino of the hotel which opened in 1966 with 30 gaming tables and 250 slot machines. It contains 20 black Italian marble columns with white marble and gold leaf trimmings. Friezes and statues depict Roman conquests, and women motifs are prevalent. In the centre is a flat ornate dome with an \\"enormous chandelier in the shape of a Roman medallion, made of 100,000 handmade and handpolished crystals\\" on the ceiling. It reportedly held the world record at the time for the world's largest crystal ceiling fixture. The cocktail waitresses, as of 2005, still wear the same uniform which was designed by Jay Sarno: white, off-the-shoulder mini-tunics with high-heeled Roman sandals. The modern casino facilities include table games such as Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat, Spanish 21, Mini-Baccarat, Pai Gow and Pai Gow poker. Caesars Palace's 24-hour poker room currently lies in heart of the gaming floor between The Colosseum and the Race & Sports Book, where racing and sports bets are put on. It moved there in June 2014, when Pure Nightclub underwent an expansion and annexed its space. As of December 2015 it contains 16 tables with free Wi-Fi and USB charging ports. There are many traditional reel-type slot machines, video reels machine, video poker games, video blackjack or keno, in which participants can play from 1¬¢ to $500. One author noted that due to the combination of darkness and enclosure of the gambling room, never being lit with light from the outside, it \\"disorients the occupant in space and time\\", and one \\"loses track of where he is and when it is\\". Entertainment Music and showmanship Outside of the theatre in 2008Many international performers such as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Rod Stewart, Celine Dion, Cher, Bette Midler, Liberace, Liza Minnelli, Elton John, George Burns, Pat Cooper, Diana Ross, Paul Anka, Julio Iglesias, Judy Garland, David Copperfield, Stevie Nicks, Dolly Parton, Tony Bennett, Gloria Estefan, Phyllis Diller, Luis Miguel, Ike & Tina Turner, Janet Jackson, Shania Twain, Jerry Seinfeld, Harry Belafonte, Louie Anderson, Ricky Martin, Mariah Carey, Deana Martin, B.B. King, The Moody Blues, Pilita Corrales and Matt Goss have performed at the hotel. left In mid-1996, a new venue known as \\"Caesars Magical Empire\\" was created on the property, showcasing magicians such as Michael Ammar, Jon Armstrong, Lee Asher, Whit Haydn, Jeff \\"Magnus\\" McBride, and Alain Nu. The \\"Empire\\" was closed on November 30, 2002, after which the structure was razed to make room for a large concert hall created for singer Celine Dion. The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is a 4,296-seat entertainment venue with a stage, which was originally built at a cost of $95-million for Celine Dion's show, A New Day..., in 2003. A success, the Colosseum show earned almost $175,000 on average per night and grossed $500 million in four years. The venue has since hosted performances by numerous other artists. Gloria Estefan performed a special seven-day concert in October 2003 for the launch of her album Unwrapped, titled Live & Unwrapped. In May 2007, Bette Midler was announced as Dion's formal replacement, performing 100 shows a year, with Elton John continuing to perform his popular Red Piano show 50 nights a year while Midler was on hiatus. After taking a three-year hiatus, Cher, following her Farewell Tour, returned to Caesars Palace with a three- year contract, performing 200 shows beginning May 6, 2008. On May 26, 2009, U.S President Barack Obama performed in the Colosseum in the one-night show A Good Fight alongside Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler and Rita Rudner to fundraise for Nevada's senator Harry Reid re-election campaign. Several streets were closed and the Augustus tower was blocked as security precautions by the Secret Service during the visit. In March 2011, Celine Dion returned to The Colosseum with her new show entitled \\"Celine\\", which is under contract for 70 shows per year, through 2017. In 2015, Reba McEntire and Brooks & Dunn began a concert residency at the Colosseum titled Together in Vegas. Absinthe is a live show that premiered on April 1, 2011 on the forecourt of the hotel. The show is hosted by The Gazillionaire, played by actor and former Cirque du Soleil clown Voki Kalfayan and his assistant, Penny Pibbets, portrayed by actress Anais Thomassian. The show is performed outside in a Spiegeltent on a diameter stage. The tent accommodates 600 persons who are seated on folding chairs circled around the stage.The Pussycat Dolls Casino in 2007 The Pussycat Dolls Lounge, an adjunct of the Pure Nightclub, opened at Caesars Palace in 2005. The lounge was patterned after a vintage strip club. The club's center was a stage where dancers called the Pussycat Girls clad in fishnet hose and corsets, began a new dance show every half hour. Celebrities like Paris Hilton and Christina Aguilera occasionally danced as \\"guest pussycats\\". In 2007, Caesars Palace opened a Pussycat Dolls Casino directly across from the Pussycat Dolls Lounge. It had an oval pit at the casino's center, where two go-go dancers in cages performed in response to the music.Caesars Palace Loosens Its Buttons With New Pussycat Dolls Casino (January 17, 2007), PR Newswire. Retrieved December 11, 2015. At the end of February 2010, the Pussycat Dolls left the Pure nightclub for a new lounge at the Chateau nightclub, which is part of Paris Las Vegas. The Omnia (Latin for \\"[the sum of] all things\\") nightclub, opened in March 2015, replacing the Pure nightclub which operated there for over a decade. The $107 million expansion and redesign incorporates both the Pure facility and the adjacent World of Poker tournament room to create a space that can accommodate 3,500 people. Designed by the Rockwell Group, the club is outfitted with theatrical lighting, sound, and climate-control systems, along with rigging and catwalks for aerial performers. It is operated by the Hakkasan Group. The replica of Cleopatra's Barge houses a bar and lounge that opened at Caesars Palace in 1970. Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin often visited the Barge, with Sinatra occasionally singing there after his own shows. Sports The New Yorker writes that Caesars Palace was \\"dubbed the Home of Champions after hosting decades of events like boxing matches, auto races, and volleyball tournaments\\". The Caesars Palace Grand Prix car race (a Formula One World Championship event) was held at the car park of Caesars Palace in 1981 and 1982. The new race proved to be a financial disaster, and was not popular among the drivers, primarily because of the desert heat and its counter- clockwise direction, which put a tremendous strain on the drivers' necks. When Nelson Piquet clinched his first World Championship by finishing fifth in 1981, it took him fifteen minutes to recover from heat exhaustion. The 1982 race was won by Michele Alboreto in a Tyrrell, but the race was not renewed for the following season due to poor attendance. The following two years a CART (IndyCar) event was run, with Mario Andretti and Tom Sneva winning, before the open-wheel event was permanently dropped. In 2013 it hosted a round of the Stadium Super Trucks.Sugar Ray Leonard in 1984 Many boxing matches have been held in Caesars Outdoor Arena since the late 1970s. It hosted fights between George Foreman and Ron Lyle in January 1976, Roberto Dur√°n and Esteban de Jes√∫s in January 1978, Larry Holmes and Muhammad Ali in October 1980, Holmes and Gerry Cooney in June 1982 as well as Wilfredo Gomez versus Juan Antonio Lopez at the same date; Gomez's bout with Salvador Sanchez on August 21, 1981 and an amateur fight between Shane Mosley and Shannan Taylor in March 1984 In April 1987, the 15,356-seat arena at Caesars Palace hosted \\"The Super Fight\\" boxing match between Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler. Two bouts between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe were contested here, including Evander Holyfield vs. Riddick Bowe in November 1992, and a revenge match a year later in which Holyfield took the title, and he fought with Michael Moorer at Caesars Palace, including Evander Holyfield vs. Michael Moorer in April 1994 for the WBA, IBF and Lineal Heavyweight Championships. In 2004 boxing returned to the Palace, when Wladimir Klitschko and former Olympian Jeff Lacy headlined a card televised on Showtime at the Palace's new outdoor amphitheatre. Caesars Palace has played host to a number of professional wrestling events throughout the 1990s, the most notable of which is WWE's WrestleMania IX in April 1993 which capitalized on the Roman theme of the venue. Billed as the \\"Worlds Largest Toga Party\\" it remains to this day the only WrestleMania with a particular theme. World Championship Wrestling also held a series of events at Caesars Palace, including Clash of the Champions XXX in January 1995 as well as Clash of the Champions XXXII and an episode of WCW Monday Nitro, each in January 1996. On September 27, 1991, a National Hockey League preseason game between the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers was held on an outdoor rink built in the Caesars Palace parking lot. Behind a goal from Wayne Gretzky, the Kings came back from a 2‚Äì0 deficit to win 5‚Äì2. The game served as a prelude to \\"Frozen Fury\\", an annual series of preseason games in Las Vegas played primarily against the Colorado Avalanche at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and eventually the establishment of an expansion team in Las Vegas, the Vegas Golden Knights, for the 2017‚Äì18 NHL season. Restaurants leftThe exterior of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill from the casino floor in 2011The casino houses multiple restaurants. Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill is an English pub, a type of restaurant Ramsay felt was \\"missing on the strip\\". The Nobu Restaurant is an Asian restaurant. The Old Homestead Steakhouse is the first west-coast location of a New York restaurant chain. Rao's opened in 2006, the second branch of the restaurant after New York City to open. Flay's first restaurant venture outside New York, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill was opened at Caesars in 2004 and features southwestern cuisine. Chef Brian Malarkey opened Searsucker Las Vegas ‚Äì the fourth branch of the restaurant after San Diego, Del Mar, California, and Austin, Texas ‚Äì in March 2015. The dining area has a \\"retro Americana\\" theme, with \\"cowboy culture\\" motifs reflected throughout the furnishings and paintings designed by Thomas Schoos. Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a Chinese restaurant with an overhead metal- cut white screen and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all backlit by LED bulbs. Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, featuring burgers, fries and ice cream delicacies. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was a branch of the New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in the dining area and counter seating, there was a patio with views of the Strip and the Caesars Palace fountains. It closed on January 2, 2017. Hell's Kitchen opened in its place in January 2018 and will be used as the studio for the filming of the American television show Hell's Kitchen in 2019 and 2020. The major restaurant of the Augustus Tower is the Guy Savoy, namesake of the three-star Michelin chef. When Savoy was approached to open a second restaurant in Vegas, he initially said no, until Caesars told him they wanted him to recreate what he had done in Paris. His request was that to maintain quality, the restaurant must be limited to service five days a week, to which the management agreed. The restaurant opened in 2006 and in 2008, Savoy brought his executive chef from the Paris restaurant to Vegas. Interior of Payard P√¢tisserie & Bistro with chocolate clock in foreground in 2013 Under the direction of pastry chef and chocolatier Fran√ßois Payard, Payard P√¢tisserie & Bistro at Caesars Palace encompasses a pastry shop, chocolate shop, and restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The interior of the 46-seat bistro was designed by the Rockwell Group. In 2008 the bistro installed a high \\"chocolate clock\\" that releases three chocolate truffles every quarter-hour. In 1992 Wolfgang Puck was the first celebrity chef to open an upscale restaurant in a Las Vegas gambling resort with Spago at Caesars Palace. Located in The Forum Shops arcade, the restaurant is divided into a cafe facing the shopping mall serving lighter, lower-cost dishes, and a more formal dining room to the rear. Central Michel Richard was a 24-hour restaurant situated in the hotel lobby from 2011 to 2014. In addition to a bar, it featured indoor and outdoor dining, with menu offerings varying by the time of day. Established in 2011, it cost US$4.5 million to build-out and measured in size. Todd Harrington, executive chef, was chosen by Michel Richard, himself a James Beard Foundation Award-winning chef, to run the kitchen. Harrington had been the executive chef of Augustus Caf√©, the restaurant which had previously operated in that location. Harrington left in December 2013, and in July 2014, the restaurant filed for bankruptcy protection. The restaurant closed in late 2014. Caf√© Americano occupies the former premises of Central Michel Richard. It was in May 2015, in partnership with the V&E; Restaurant Group of Miami. The restaurant and bar in the hotel lobby serves pizza, soups, sandwiches, burgers. A Mr. Chow restaurant opened at the hotel in 2015. The 277-seat Chinese fine dining establishment occupies the second floor of the hotel and has a view of the Garden of the Gods pool area.

Merrick's diaries show that he had come to Amherst College -- which in that era focused on training ministers -- already intent on serving as a missionary to Persia.J. L. Merrick, Diaries, 5 vols, MS Amherst, Mass‚Äì Amherst College Archives, Alumni Class Shelves, Class of 1930 [vol. 1 1830, vol. 2 Mar.-Jul. 1834, vol. 3 Oct.1855-1856, vol. 4 Apr. ‚ÄìJun. 1856, vol. 5 Jun.-Aug. 1856] Missionary works After graduating from Amherst in 1830, Merrick began theological studies at Princeton, then completed his education at the newly formed theological seminary in Columbia, South Carolina. In 1834 he was appointed by the American Board to pioneer missionary work among Persian Muslims. That summer, he left from Boston for Istanbul, where he studied Turkish and prepared for his Persian mission under the supervision of veteran missionaries William Gottlieb Schauffler and William Goodell. In August 1835, Merrick moved to Tabriz, Iran, where he joined a group of German missionaries and began Persian studies. The following summer, he travelled to Tehran, then to Isfahan, accompanied by two of the German missionaries. Violent opposition arose in Isfahan in response to the Germans' distribution of Persian New Testaments. The incident seems to have reinforced Merrick's conviction that open evangelism would be unfruitful among Persians. Thereafter he would consistently advocate a patient, nonconfrontational approach toward mission to Muslims. The Germans abandoned their plans and returned to Tabriz, while Merrick continued on to Persepolis and Shiraz. In Shiraz, Merrick studied Persian and Arabic under the tutelage of a Sufi scholar, MullƒÅ Muhammad. He was befriended by Mƒ´rzƒÅ Sayyid Alƒ´, who had assisted Henry Martyn in translating the New Testament into Persian. By the end of his stay in Shiraz, Merrick was optimistic, and convinced that he could work as a missionary in any city in Persia.James Lyman Merrick Papers, 1832-1863. Chapin Library, Williams College.Missionary Herald 30 (1834) 237, 251, 402-405, 31 (1835) 366-8, 32 (1836) 9-10, 165-6 In March 1837 he returned to Tabriz, but because of ill health left to spend a year with the Nestorian mission in Urumia. There he met Malik QƒÅsim Mƒ´rzƒÅ, an uncle of the Shah, and spent three months in his residence teaching English, learning Persian and discussing religion.Persian Royal Order granted to James L. Merrick, MS Washington DC‚ÄìLibrary of Congress, African and Middle Eastern Division, Qajar Firman (1839) Finally in August 1838 he settled in Tabriz, intending to make it his permanent base, and the following year he married Eunice Taylor, the sister of an English army officer stationed in Persia. Merrick was joined in Tabriz by William Glen, a Scottish missionary who, during the next four years would translate the Old Testament into Persian. In Tabriz he wrote A Friendly Tract,J. L. Merrick, A Friendly Tract, MS Amherst, Mass‚ÄìAmherst College Archives, Alumni Class Shelves, Class of 1830 (1841-42) worked on a translation of Mu·∏•ammad BƒÅqir al-Majlisƒ´'s HayƒÅt al-Qul≈´b, and adapted and translated a work on astronomy into Persian. In November 1839, the executive committee of the American Board, which had already expressed doubts about the viability of Merrick's mission, withdrew its support for his work among Muslims. He wa instructed to join the ABCFM mission to Nestorian Christians in Urumia. Merrick resisted, but in 1942 he received a letter from the Board's secretary, Rufus Anderson, ordering him to leave Tabriz. In Urumia, Merrick completed a Persian translation of Alexander Keith's Evidence of ProphecyA. Keith and J. L. Merrick, The Evidence of Prophecy Derived from the Fulfilment of the Predictions of the Hebrew Prophets and Apostles. Translated at Ooroomiah in Persia, from the English original into the Persian language by J. L. Merrick, Edinburgh: London Religious Tract Society, 1846 and began learning Syriac. Conflict with his missionary colleagues over mission policies led to further deterioration in relations with the American Board executive, culminating in his recall in 1845. After his return to the United States, stung by criticism of his mission, Merrick published a caustic appeal to the American Board in which he sought to vindicate his record and accused the board of betraying the cause of missions to Muslims.J. L. Merrick, An Appeal to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Springfield, 1847 In 1849 Merrick became pastor of the South Amherst Congregational Church and was Professor of Oriental Literature at Amherst College from 1852 to 1857.J.

Merrick, Letter addressed to the Amherst College Class of 1830, MS Amherst, Mass.‚ÄìAmherst College Archives, Alumni Class Shelves, Class of 1830 (1853) In 1850 he published The Life and Religion of Mohammed, his translation of al-Majlisƒ´'s HayƒÅt al-Qul≈´b, calling attention in his preface to the need to correct \\"imperfect views of the Mohammedan system\\", and especially of Shiite Muslim beliefs, held in Christian nations.

Hu in 2003 to measure the authority power of players in a well-contracted organization. The index generates the Shapley-Shubik power index and can be used in ranking, planning and organizational choice. Definition The organization contracts each individual by boss and approval relation with others. So each individual has its own authority structure, called command game. The Shapley-Shubik power index for these command games are collectively denoted by a power transit matrix Œ°. The authority distribution œÄ is defined as the solution to the counterbalance equation œÄ=œÄŒ°. The basic idea for the counterbalance equation is that a person's power comes from his critical roles in others' command game; on the other hand, his power could also be redistributed to those who sit in his command game as vital players. For a simple legislative body, œÄ is simply the Shapley-Shubik power index, based on a probabilistic argument (). Applications Example 1. College ranking by applicants‚Äô acceptance Suppose that there are large numbers of college applicants to apply the colleges Each applicant files multiple applications. Each college then offers some of its applicants admissions and rejects all others. Now some applicants may get no offer from any college; the other then get one offer or multiple offers. An applicant with multiple offers will decide which college to go to and reject all other colleges which make offers to him. Of all applicants who apply to and receive offers from College i, we let P(i,j) be the proportion of those applicants who decide to go to college j. Such applicants of course apply to and receive offers from College j as well. To rank the colleges by the acceptance rates of the applicants to whom offers were made, we can apply the authority distribution associated with the matrix P. The so-called ‚Äúauthority distribution‚Äù can be regarded as the measure of relative attractiveness of the colleges from the applicants‚Äô point of view. Example 2. Journal rankings by citations Assume there are n journals in a scientific field. For any Journal i, each issue contains many papers, and each paper has its list of references or citations. A paper in journal j can be cited in another paper in Journal i as a reference. Of all papers cited by Journal i (repetition counted), we let P(i,j) be the proportion of those papers which are published on Journal j. So P measures the direct impact between any two journals and P(i, i) is the self-citation rate for Journal i . The authority distribution for œÄ = œÄP would quantify the long-term influence of each journal in the group of journals and can be used to rank these journals. Example 3. Planning of a freeway system A few small towns believe that building a freeway system would be to their common benefit. Say, they plan to build freeways F1, F2, ..., Fn‚àí1. We let Fn be the existing traffic channels of car, truck and bus. We assume that all the potential freeways have the same length. Otherwise we can make up the assumption by dividing long freeways into smaller segments and rename them all. The freeways with higher traffic intensity should be built with more driving lanes and so receive more investments. Of all the traffic flow on Fi, we let P(i,j) be the (estimated) proportion of the traffic flowing into Fj. Then the authority distribution œÄ satisfying œÄ = œÄP will measure the relative traffic intensity on each Fi and can be used in the investment allocation. A similar issue can be found in designing an Internet or Intranet system. Example 4. Real Effective Exchange Rates Weights Assume there are n countries. Let P(i,j) be country j's weights of consumption of country's total production. The associated œÄ measures the weights in the trading system of n countries. Example 5. Sort Big Data Objects by Revealed Preference When ranking big data observations, diverse consumers reveal heterogeneous preferences; but any revealed preference is a ranking between two observations, derived from a consumer‚Äôs rational consideration of many factors. Previous researchers have applied exogenous weighting and multivariate regression approaches, and spatial, network, or multidimensional analyses to sort complicated objects, ignoring the variety and variability of the objects. By recognizing the diversity and heterogeneity among both the observations and the consumers, Hu (2000) instead applies endogenous weighting to these contradictory revealed preferences. The outcome is a consistent steady-state solution to the counterbalance equilibrium within these contradictions. The solution takes into consideration the spillover effects of multiple-step interactions among the observations. When information from data is efficiently revealed in preferences, the revealed preferences greatly reduce the volume of the required data in the sorting process.

Both Cerro Ba√∫l and the adjacent Cerro Mejia were under Wari control. The Wari had introduced the agricultural technology of terracing the mountainside and digging long canals across the land. A 6.2 mile canal was built from the Torata River through the El Paso Divide between Cerro Ba√∫l and Cerro Mejia, where it split to irrigate the terraces that flanked both hills.Nash, D. J. and Williams, P. R. (2004), \\"Architecture and Power on the Wari‚ÄìTiwanaku Frontier. Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association, 14: 151‚Äì174. doi:10.1525/ap3a.2004.14.151 Also along the terraced slopes we find the homes of the majority of the center's citizens.Williams, Patrick, Michael Moseley, and Donna Nash. \\"Empires of the Andes.\\". Cerro Ba√∫l. Accessed December 5, 2015. At the top of the mountain we find the public and elite living spaces. There are two D-shaped temples, in the Wari style, on the eastern and middle sections of the site. Also along the eastern side are one-story domiciles similar to the ones along the terraces. These are considered to be the artisan residence area by archaeologists. The central sector seems to be the ceremonial core, while the western sector comprises the two story dwellings of the elite.Williams, Patrick Ryan. 2001. \\"Cerro Ba√∫l: A Wari Center on the Tiwanaku Frontier.\\" Latin American Antiquity 12 (1): 67-83. Sprinkled throughout this city we find the most common architectural form used by the Wari civilization, which is an enclosed plaza flanked by impressive stone halls. The halls included residences of governors and wealthy citizens, government offices, and beer houses for state-held parties. example of terracing  Asociaci√≥n Contisuyo  Asociaci√≥n Contisuyo (in Quechua: Kunti Suyu), literally translated to Association \\"Bias West or West Region\\", is an assemblage of Peruvian and American scholars with interests in the mapping and excavation of Cerro Ba√∫l. Founded in 1981 directors Robert Pritzker and Dr. Michael Moseley, then of The Field Museum of Natural History combined their resources with the Southern Peru Copper Corporation to further their research at Cerro Ba√∫l.\\"Proyecto Arqueol√≥gico Cerro Ba√∫l.\\" The Field Museum. February 2, 2011. Accessed December 5, 2015. Prior to the first excavations it was believed that the Wari civilization had obtained the area subsequent to Tiwanaku control; however, it is now known from archaeological artifacts found in the area, such as kero (a ceremonial cup), in the hybrid styles of both Wari and Tiwanaku, that they had occupied the areas at the same time. It is believed that the two cultures employed the close space rather peacefully, as there is no evidence of warfare and evidence of shared culture and styles from about A.D. 600 to 1020. The scholars, armed with the annals of a Spanish chronicler and two seasons of excavations, were able to find evidence that supported the Inca siege and capture of the Wari political outpost.  Wari political outpost and ceremonial center  The Wari () culture of Peru in the Middle Horizon period (400 AD-1000 AD) was one of several Andean cultures before the rise of the Inca that can be termed \\"empires.\\" They were not just city states, but actually exerted their influence over neighboring groups (or subjugated them). The Wari area of influence lay in what is now the central highlands of Peru and their area of influence overlapped that of another culture, the Tiwanaku. The Wari made their bold thrust into the Tiwanaku area of control by seizing both Cerro Ba√∫l and the adjacent Cerro Mejia. By terracing and irrigating the areas for the sustainment of the city's populace, they managed to make the Tiwanaku at least partially dependent on their society as the water streaming from the mountain rainstorms had to pass by a Wari canal before it reached Tiwanaku fields. The relationship, however, seemed to be some positive interaction between the two peoples as seen in the Tiwanaku-style drinking vessel used in ceremonies that was among the Wari's most sacred ceremonial offerings found at the site. With the demise of the Wari and Tiwanaku civilizations, the people of the Chiribaya culture lived in the area until they were conquered or colonized by the Inca.  Inca siege and conquest  What we know of the Inca siege comes from Spanish chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega and is supported by excavations by the Programa Contisuyo.Owen, Bruce D.. 2005. ‚ÄúDistant Colonies and Explosive Collapse: The Two Stages of the Tiwanaku Diaspora in the Osmore Drainage‚Äù. Latin American Antiquity 16 (1). Society for American Archaeology: 45‚Äì80. doi:10.2307/30042486. The Wari people were blockaded within their city by the surrounding Inca army for 54 days. During this time their people were without water and little food; finally in despair they sent their children down to the Inca in hopes for mercy. The Inca were reported to have received the children with kindness, fed them, and sent them back up the mountains with some supplies for their people. The final evacuation of the center enclave was accompanied by elaborate ceremonies with brewing, drinking, feasting vessel smashing and building burning.Moseley, Michael E., Ana Miranda, Mario Ruales, Donna J. Nash, Patrick Ryan Williams, and Susan D. deFrance. 2005. \\"Burning Down the Brewery: Establishing and Evacuating an Ancient Imperial Colony at Cerro Ba√∫l, Peru.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 102 (48): 17264-17271. The Wari surrendered unconditionally to the Inca around A.D. 1475.  Today  In current times, Cerro Ba√∫l is a place of worship for the local Moqueguanos (inhabitants of Moquegua [/moÀàke…£wa/], a city founded by the Spanish colonists in southern Peru, located in the Moquegua Region, of which it is the capital) to offer pagapus (payment) to the Andean deities in the form of coca, candles and chicha, to list a few.

He continued weaving but also received some education at the local Unitarian chapel.Duncan Bythell, \\"Holmes, David\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Early in the 1860s, Holmes married and the couple moved to Burnley. There, he was a leading founder member of the Burnley Weavers' Association. In 1871, he was elected as its president and served until his death. He focused his activities on promoting collective bargaining for wages; he opposed the eight-hour day and supported child labour, as he believed that they contributed to the weavers' comparative advantage over workers elsewhere. Despite his moderation, he was blacklisted by employers and instead took work as a rag-and-bone man to support his family, alongside his union role. In 1878, he led the union in part of a major but unsuccessful county-wide strike. That led, in 1884, to the creation of the Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, with Holmes as president. Holmes was a member of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), where he opposed the new unions, which organised unskilled labour, and attended various international conferences representing the organisation. Politically, Holmes was a support of the Liberal Party, and he served on Burnley Town Council. He was an opponent of socialism and of the Labour Party when it emerged. However, his prot√©g√© and designated successor, David Shackleton, would join the Labour Party. Holmes stood down from the TUC in 1902 and became less active elsewhere.

It was created as a way of celebrating and raising awareness of Greater Manchester's musical heritage and protecting collections of material held by individuals and institutions relating to the subject. Towards the end of 2015 it became a registered charity.  Beginnings  The archive, originally named Manchester District Music Archive, came about in 2003 after Surtees and Norman had the idea of making a documentary about the Greater Manchester music scene, loosely based on CP Lee‚Äôs book ‚ÄòShake, Rattle and Rain‚Äô. Realising the subject was too vast to be contained within a documentary, Surtees and Norman, alongside Dave Rofe and CP Lee, decided to launch a campaign to create a Greater Manchester music museum. Abigail Ward joined the team shortly afterwards and began to develop an online presence for the project. Lee's book covered the history of Manchester music from 1955 - 1995 and contained an extensive band list at the end of the book, which was used a starting point when populating the band list on the Manchester Digital Music Archive website. A seminar was held at Urbis in 2004 to officially launch the newly constituted organisation with a panel featuring Jon Savage, CP Lee, Guy Garvey, Mark Radcliffe and Jan Hargreaves. Hundreds attended the event and it was announced that the intention was to set up a museum where people could donate items of music ephemera to the collection. The co-founders then spent a number of years trying to create a physical space for the archive but after years of struggling to find something suitable, a website was set up in 2006, which allowed users to upload images of their own personal artefacts, along with associated memories, relating to Greater Manchester music, musicians, DJs and venues. This online archive was developed by Abigail Ward with web designer Ashley Kennerley (Go Bang! Design). In 2007 and 2014, Manchester Digital Music Archive won the Big Chip best not-for-profit project award. Dave Rofe left the organisation in 2017. As of September 2020 the site has in excess of 3600 members who have uploaded material relating to more than 3680 bands, 735 DJs and 1350 venues. Users are encouraged to provide memories and anecdotes along with their artefacts and the only stipulation is that items need to be linked to acts or venues from Greater Manchester. All genres of music are covered and as well as an extensive collection of pop memorabilia, the archive includes material relating to the history of the Royal Northern College of Music and the Halle Orchestra. Users can comment on and discuss items uploaded by others or curate online themed exhibitions using material from the site. The site has a number of these exhibitions on various subjects including Moss Side and Hulme club culture, City Fun fanzine, Manchester's LGBT music and club culture and Royal Northern College of Music students who served in World War I.  Charitable status  In November 2015, the organisation became a registered charity and in June 2017 changed its name to Manchester Digital Music Archive. The board of trustees are Dave Carter, Cathy Brooks, Aidan O'Rourke and Sarah Feinstein.  Physical Presence  The archive exists online but has held numerous events and exhibitions at venues around Greater Manchester. In 2008 it held an event at Islington Mill which explored the city's 1980s electro-funk scene, curated by DJ Greg Wilson. The event included music and discussion and also showed the premiere of the Tim Forde documentary 'Birth of The British B-Boy', which tells the story of breakdancing in Manchester.  Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester  In 2013, following investment from Heritage Lottery Fund, MDMarchive held an exhibition, Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester ,at The Lowry, a 5-month show co-curated by members of MDMarchive's online community. The exhibition attracted a 32,000 visitors. There were a number of spin-off events featuring Greater Manchester music luminaries in conversation, including Barry Adamson, Kevin Cummins and Richard Boon. In 2014 the project ended with a community concert at Band on the Wall featuring British rave pioneer Graham Massey in collaboration with The Prospectors, a collective of disabled musicians from Stockport.  Louder Than Words  The archive also has a regular presence in the Louder Than Words festival - an annual event focused on literature within the music industry. In 2014 MDMarchive hosted a panel discussion which saw Elbow's Guy Garvey, Jaheda Choudhury-Potter of Ajah UK and Everything Everything's Jon Higgs talk about Greater Manchester lyricism in music . The following year it hosted another session, this time focusing on the work of virtual archives and included panellists from MDMarchive as well as writer Anita Sethi and Jez Collins from the Birmingham Music Archive.  Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester  In 2017 Manchester Digital Music Archive won further investment from Heritage Lottery Fund for Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester, a project exploring the intertwined histories of music and political activism across the ten boroughs of the Greater Manchester. The project focused in particular on the musical achievements of women and the LGBT+ community. Throughout the project, MDMarchive worked with teams of volunteers from two chosen communities (women and LGBT+ people) to co-produce a programme of events, two physical pop-up exhibitions, a series of digital exhibitions, six short films and three guided heritage walks. Volunteers also accessed training on how to preserve and share their own musical heritage. The first physical exhibition, Queer Noise: The History of LGBT+ Music & Club Culture in Manchester, was held at the People's History Museum from July‚ÄìSeptember 2017 as part of Never Going Underground 2017, a major exhibition marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. The second exhibition, Suffragette City took place in March 2018 at The Refuge, Manchester and coincided with 100 Years of Women's Suffrage.  We Are Dynamite! Northern Carnival Against the Nazis 40th Anniversary  In 2018 Manchester Digital Music Archive received funding from Heritage Lottery Fund and Futura Recruitment for a physical and digital project celebrating the Northern Carnival Against the Nazis, a march and concert held in Moss Side, Manchester in 1978 that is regarded by many as a defining moment in establishing anti- racism in the city and beyond. The project comprised a physical exhibition held at NIAMOS (formerly the Nia Centre), Hulme; a digital community exhibition; and two large launch events.  The Lapsed Clubber Audio Map  In 2017, Manchester Digital Music Archive launched the Lapsed Clubber Audio Map in partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University and Heritage Lottery Fund.

History The party was formed in Budapest by former FKGP leader Tivadar P√°rtay with the agreement of Prime Minister J√≥zsef Antall. Prior that, P√°rtay strongly criticized FKGP president J√≥zsef Torgy√°n's step who decided to left Antall's conservative government in February 1992, as a result several entire branches left FKGP to continue to support the cabinet. P√°rtay intended to unite the anti-Torgy√°n smallholder groups and parties into a sole umbrella organization. When the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Torgy√°n on the issue of FKGP leadership, the establishment of a new party remained the only option for the pro-government factions. On 11 February 1993, the FKGP's Historic Division joined the TFKGP. On 28 June 1993, sixteen members of the so-called pro-government ex-FKGP Group of 36 MPs formed the TFKGP's parliamentary work group led by Istv√°n Prepeliczay and also involving e.g. Ferenc J√≥zsef Nagy. By autumn 1993, the conflicts among the anti-Torgy√°n forces emerged as P√°rtay wanted to keep his party's monopolist status. As a result, the United Smallholders' Party (EKGP) established without the participation of the TFKGP and Compromise Independent Smallholders' Party (KFKGP), while the Historic Division and the National Smallholders' and Civic Party (NKPP) joined the alliance. P√°rtay considered the step as a betrayal. Several members left his party, but two MPs, Ferenc J√≥zsef Nagy and Lajos Szab√≥ remained supporters of P√°rtay. The TFKGP was able to nominee only two individual candidates in the 1994 parliamentary election. They received 0.03 percent of the votes, gaining no seats.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. Following that the party activity gradually declined. Due to his poor health, P√°rtay resigned from his position of party chairman and retired from politics on 23 March 1997. He died on 9 August 1999, aged 91.

The game, which was broadcast on television nationally on Thursday Night Football, was played at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan during the 2015 NFL season. On the final play of regulation, with no time remaining on the game clock, Packers quarterback (QB) Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass into the end-zone that was caught by tight end (TE) Richard Rodgers for the game-winning touchdown after defensive end (DE) Devin Taylor was called for a face mask on Rodgers which resulted in one additional play. The play resulted in a dramatic 27-23 come-from-behind victory for the Packers, who had trailed 20-0 in the second half. The victory was the Packers fourth-largest comeback in franchise history. It was also the start of a 3-game winning streak that would help the Packers clinch their seventh consecutive postseason berth. The Lions would end the season with a record of 7-9 and fail to reach the playoffs. Background Before the game on December 3, 2015, the Green Bay Packers had struggled in their previous games, while the Detroit Lions had found their form since winning against the Packers on the road at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. The Packers had lost four of their last five games after a 6‚Äì0 start for the season and were in dire need of a change of fortune to reach the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions came to the game with a three-game winning streak, and they still had a chance to earn a playoff spot despite starting the season with a 1-7 record. Eighteen days earlier, the Lions had ended a 24-year winless streak against the Packers in a road game by beating them 18‚Äì16 at Lambeau Field. If they had also defeated the Packers at their second meeting of the season, the Lions would have swept the season series with Green Bay for the first time since 1991. Before the Packers started their comeback from the 20‚Äì0 deficit in the second half of the game, the Lions had snapped a 56-game streak during which the Packers had scored in the first half. Counting the previous game against the Chicago Bears and the greater part of the Lions game, Packers went nearly 70 game-minutes without scoring a point. Events of the play With six seconds left on the game clock, Green Bay was on 3rd-and-10 at its own 21-yard line. After one forward pass and one backward pass, Packers tight end Richard Rodgers lateraled the ball to quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was quickly tackled at his 24-yard line by Detroit Lions defender Devin Taylor, with the game clock having gone to zero during the play. However, the official standing behind the play called a 15-yard penalty on Taylor for a face mask foul on the tackle, and so, because NFL rules state that a game cannot end on a defensive penalty, the Packers were given an untimed play at their own 39-yard line. After the snap, all Packers receivers ran towards the end zone and Aaron Rodgers broke right, escaping the Detroit defenders before throwing a Hail Mary pass into the end zone. Tight end Richard Rodgers, who was the last player to reach the end zone, leapt high in front of all defenders, caught the ball at full extension, and came down nearly unchallenged for the catch, resulting in the Packers winning 27-23 (the Packers chose to omit the extra-point attempt). According to a number of estimations, Aaron Rodgers' pass traveled before reaching the hands of Richard Rodgers. The throw was also high enough to nearly hit the rafters at Ford Field. The comeback victory was the fourth- largest in franchise history.  Players involved  Quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tight end Richard Rodgers are not related, but both attended University of California, Berkeley and played for the California Golden Bears, graduating in 2005 and 2014, respectively. The play was Aaron Rodgers' first ever completed Hail Mary pass of his career, just one day after his 32nd birthday. The Packers tight end Richard Rodgers is the son of Richard Rodgers Sr., who was involved in one of the most famous plays in American football, \\"The Play\\", that ended the game between Cal and Stanford in 1982. Richard Rodgers Sr. contended after the game that his son's role in the play rivaled his involvement in the famous play which he called and in which he threw two of the five laterals in 1982: Penalty controversy Like most significant calls by officials, the face mask penalty against Detroit that led to the winning play by Green Bay generated controversy. Dean Blandino, NFL Vice President of Officiating, responded to the call on Twitter moments after the game: During a visit by NFL officials to a Lions training camp in 2016, Carl Cheffers, the official who threw the flag, was asked about the penalty; he said \\"I think it was an illegal tackle. Horse-collar, facemask, I think it was an illegal tackle. I‚Äôm very comfortable with it.\\" Naming the play The nickname for the play, \\"Miracle in Motown\\", was first used by Jim Nantz during the nationally broadcast Thursday Night Football postgame show. Broadcast calls of the final play TV Radio Records * Aaron Rodgers's pass is the longest game-winning Hail Mary play in NFL history. * The touchdown-throw distance of from the line of scrimmage is the most air-yards on a touchdown in the previous 10 NFL seasons, and it was the second-longest offensive game- winning touchdown on the final play of regulation in NFL history. It came short of Earl Morrall and Jim Gibbons combining for a game-winning play for the Detroit Lions in a 20‚Äì15 win over the Johnny Unitas-led Baltimore Colts in 1960. * Overcoming a 20-point deficit represented the fourth-biggest comeback win in Packers franchise history. It rates behind a 23-point deficit in a 35‚Äì23 win over the Los Angeles Rams in 1982, a 23-point deficit in a 37‚Äì36 win over the Dallas Cowboys in 2013 (with Matt Flynn as a QB) and a 21-point deficit in a 35‚Äì34 win over the New Orleans Saints in 1989. This 20-point deficit was later tied in 2018 when the Packers overcame a 20-point third quarter deficit to beat the Chicago Bears 24‚Äì23. * Before the final game- winning play, the Green Bay Packers had gone the full 60 minutes of the game without leading. * The play was named the \\"Bridgestone Performance Play of the Year\\" at the 5th Annual NFL Honors ceremony the night before Super Bowl 50. * The play won the award for Best Play at the 2016 ESPY Awards.

Middle Innings: A Documentary History of Baseball, 1900‚Äì1948. University of Nebraska Press. Back to 1901, the recent formed American League signed contracts with players who were dissatisfied with the pay and terms of their deals with the National League. This led to a conflict that increased enough to concern Powers, by then president of the Eastern League. As a result, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues was formed on September 5, 1901, from a meeting held by Minor League executives at the Leland Hotel in Chicago. Powers was elected as the first president of the NAPBL, whose offices were established in Auburn, New York. Overall, fourteen leagues and 96 clubs were members during the first season in 1902. The purpose of the organization at the time was to maintain the independence of the leagues involved. Several executives did not sign the agreement and continued to work independently. MiLB.com. Retrieved on December 4, 2015. Consequently, Powers and his successor Sexton have been considered the fathers of Minor League Baseball, as they thought alike and acted alike, and were in agreement on the path that the NAPBL should take. Powers remained as president of the Eastern League, which would become the International League. But there were more conflicts ahead for Sexton to confront. The first occurred in 1914, when the outlaw Federal League challenged the established National and American Leagues by raiding their rosters and territories in an effort to become a third Major League circuit. As expected, the incursion took their toll on the top Minor Leagues, as the Federal League also raided top NAPBL teams. Then some radical delegates at the Winter Meetings in 1914 tried to push the NAPBL to desert organized baseball and align with the Federal League. In a clever tactical move, Sexton led the group to take a stand, and passed a strong resolution backing the existing NAPBL agreements with the National and American Leagues. It was a critical time in his presidency, and established his firm command of the organization, leading to an unprecedented five-year contract a year later. The Federal League folded in 1916, but by then there was another conflict facing Sexton and the organization. In 1917, ballplayers along with other large segments of the population went marching off to the World War I. It put a tremendous strain on Sexton and the NAPBL, as the season of this year opened with 21 leagues, but 10 of them were no longer active by the month of July. Things got worse in 1918, when just 10 leagues opened the season and the International League was the only one to finish. The others NAPBL members closed down early. When peace returned after the war, many leagues began to re-emerge, but Sexton and the NAPBL had yet another battle to fight. At the Winter Meetings in 1919, members voted to abort the National Agreement subscribed with Major League Baseball over issues related to territorial rights, player limits and salary structure, among others. By then, Major League Baseball had been governed by a three-man National Commission, consisting of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left office at the request of other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game. The appointment in 1920 of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis as baseball's first commissioner has been described as the turning point for Major League Baseball, but it had a profound impact on the NAPBL, as well. By January 1921, Judge Landis had the two sides back together with a new National Agreement, and the NAPBL were on their way to a period of peace, growth and prosperity throughout the 1920s. The organization completed its 25th season in 1926 as a sound, stable, well-organized group with 28 leagues and nearly 200 clubs. But the peace remained until the historical Wall Street Crash of 1929, because only 25 NAPBL circuits were able to finish the regular season that year. That number dwindled to 21 in 1930 and 16 in 1932. From there, the administrative duties were put in the hands of an Executive Committee for a period of one year, with orders to survey conditions and report back with recommendations and specific requests for changes. The committee established a promotional department to organize new leagues and new business, including the advocacy of night baseball, and it created a press bureau to organize records and promote the game. Sexton then realized that he had served his time, and agreed to retire at the Winter Meetings in 1932. Sexton resigned to a position that he held for 24 years, the longest tenure of any Minor League president to this day. Judge William G. Bramham was elected as his replacement. Michael Sexton died in 1937 at his home in Rock Island, Illinois at the age of 73. His death was caused by a myocardial infarction while he was recovering from influenza.Obituary.

Modest Stein (1871‚Äì1958), born Modest Aronstam, was a Russian-born American illustrator and close associate of the anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman. He was Berkman's cousin and intended replacement in the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick, an industrialist and union buster, in 1892. Later Stein abandoned active anarchism and became a successful newspaper, pulp magazine, and book illustrator, while continuing to support Berkman and Goldman financially.  Early life  Stein was born Modest Aronstam in Kovno, Russian Empire, on February 22, 1871, and was nicknamed \\"Modska\\". His father, Lazar Aronstam, was a pharmacist who moved to Kovno from Vilna. Stein was the cousin of Alexander Berkman (Stein's father and Berkman's mother were siblings), and attended the same gymnasium. The two were similar both physically, being short though muscular, and politically, supporting militant anarchism. Stein was driven to a career in art, which Lazar disapproved of, forcing Stein to sneak downstairs at night to practice drawing or painting when his parents were asleep. At the age of 17, in 1888, Stein left Russia for the United States to be able to pursue his art career; this was soon after Berkman had also left for the US.\\"Luba Stein Benenson\\", interviewed by Paul Avrich, in Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, AK Press, 2005, pp 55‚Äì56. Avrich (2012), p. 29 Stein arrived in New York City on August 4, 1888,\\"United States Russians to America Index, 1834‚Äì1897,\\" database, FamilySearch, accessed 17 January 2016, Modest Aronstam, 04 Aug 1888; citing Russians to America Passenger Data File, 1834‚Äì1897, Ship Marsala, departed from Hamburg, arrived in New York, New York, New York, United States, NAID identifier 1746337, National Archives at College Park, Maryland. and met up with Berkman soon after arriving. He joined the same Jewish anarchist group, the Pioneers of Liberty. The two accompanied each other everywhere, their friends calling them \\"the Twins\\", and considering them \\"shining lights of the organization\\". The cousins shared an East Broadway apartment with a third Pioneer named Michelman, when their money allowed, or a park bench when it didn't. In 1889, the two moved into a four-room apartment on 42nd Street with Berkman's lover Emma Goldman, and her friend Helene MinkinAvrich (2012), pp. 32‚Äì34 (who would later marry German-American anarchist Johann Most). They formed a commune inspired by Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?, trying to actualize their shared ideals of women's equality and cooperative living. While the other three worked making clothing in factories or at home, Stein continued trying to become a professional artist, occasionally selling pictures, but mostly funded by the other roommates, or by money sent by his parents in Russia. When he did sell one of his paintings, Stein would sometimes spend the money on \\"beautiful\\" luxuries, such as flowers, or fashionable clothes, which made Berkman fume. On one occasion when Stein overspent on a meal, Berkman actually struck him, calling this theft from the revolution. Emma Goldman began to resent Berkman's strictness, and to be attracted to Stein's more relaxed and artistic character. One day, after posing nude for him, she and Stein became lovers. Goldman did not want to leave Berkman, though, and told him that she could care equally for both men. Though Berkman admitted to possessive tendencies, he attributed them to his \\"bourgeois background\\", and worked to overcome them, as the three formed a successful m√©nage √† trois. Minkin was apparently not involved. Their romantic closeness brought the three closer as revolutionaries. Stein, strong enough to be nicknamed \\"Hercules\\", despite his shortness, became a strongman for the anarchist movement, and at least once beat up a movement member who had tried to embezzle funds.Avrich (2012), pp. 37‚Äì38 For the next years, the group moved their commune several times, while the members worked at different jobs. In late 1890, the three lived in New Haven, Connecticut, with Helene and her sister Anna Minkin, while Berkman worked as a printer's apprentice, the women made dresses, while Stein continued drawing, but also tried making shirts, and his father's trade as a night clerk in a drug store, before all returned to New York. In 1891, Stein moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he drew crayon portraits from photos in a photographer's shop. This was relatively successful, so he invited Goldman to take orders, and in 1892, moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, to open the \\"French Art Studio\\", where Berkman also joined them to frame. The three continued to live together, passing Berkman and Goldman as a married couple and Stein as Goldman's brother. As their art studio gradually failed, they opened a luncheonette based around Goldman's cooking, which was more successful.Avrich (2012), pp. 41‚Äì50 In late June 1892, the three read about the start of the Homestead Strike, an industrial lockout and strike at the Homestead Steel Works in the Pittsburgh area town of Homestead, Pennsylvania. They saw this as a matchless opportunity to spread their anarchist philosophy. Goldman and Berkman quickly shut down the luncheonette, left Stein behind to shut down the art studio, and returned to New York to plan with their fellow anarchists. Initially intending merely to give speeches and spread pamphlets, news of the July 6 riverbank battle between strikers and Pinkerton agents inspired them to more decisive action, to serve as propaganda of the deed, namely to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, main company representative. Berkman made some dynamite bombs, but testing showed them unreliable, so went to Pittsburgh intending to use a pistol and a knife. The dynamite was left behind in Worcester with Stein, \\"the twin\\", as a backup plan.Avrich (2012), pp. 57‚Äì60 Berkman's attempt, on July 23, failed, and he was captured, though Frick was wounded. On July 25, Stein followed to Pittsburgh to finish the job. However a conspirator among the New York anarchists was an informer for the Austrian consul, who informed the Pittsburgh police about the plot, which also leaked to the press in distorted form. So on his way to blow up Frick's house with pockets full of dynamite, Stein--then still called Aronstam--saw a newspaper with a headline warning against \\"Aaron Stamm\\" as a Berkman conspirator. He became frightened, dumped the explosives in an outhouse, and returned to New York.Avrich (2012), pp. 73‚Äì74. \\"Years later,\\" said his grandson, \\"he told me that if I should ever visit Pittsburgh, I should watch out where I took a shit, because somewhere there was twenty pounds of dynamite under a toilet.\\" To avoid police, Stein spent several months in Detroit with anarchists including Robert Reitzel, where he worked with an engraving firm, but returned to the New York in the fall of 1892, when prosecutors determined they did not have enough evidence to charge either Stein or Goldman.Avrich (2012), p. 83  Artistic success  Berkman did not reveal his co-conspirators, and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment. Even so, Goldman continued to give speeches advocating anarchism, and was imprisoned for a year in 1893. During this time, Stein turned away from active anarchism, though he regularly sent parcels to his friends in jail. Instead he became a successful pen and ink artist for the New York World, New York Sun, and other New York newspapers.Avrich (2012), pp. 119‚Äì121 After Goldman was released in 1894, Stein moved in with her and her most recent lover, Austrian anarchist Edward Brady, for over a year, but did not resume his sexual relationship with her. In 1895, Stein was earning enough as an artist to be able to pay for Goldman's trip to Austria to become a nurse, send her regular money there, and pay for her ticket back. When she returned in 1896, he had completely stopped attending anarchist meetings, and only rarely wrote to Berkman in prison.Avrich (2012), p. 141 His interests had become artistic rather than political; he spent all his leisure time at art auctions, and every few months would furnish a new studio with hangings, vases, canvases, or carpets, only to lose interest in another few months.

Both siblings became interested in the new art of photography, with Herman eventually becoming the official photographer for the Metropolitan Opera from 1905 to 1932. (In 1907, Herman Mishkin became father of the Steins' nephew Leo Mishkin, who became a renowned theater, film, and television critic.) Marcia began work as a commercial portrait photographer in the mid 1890s, before marrying Stein. Her career significantly expanded in 1919, when she was hired by the French government to publicize a season of New York art and theater. Magazines such as Theatre and Vanity Fair then began publishing her photos of stage performers. The Steins' only child, a daughter, Luba, was born in 1902. In 1904, the three of them traveled to Kovno to visit Stein's family; the same year, the New York World sent Stein to East Asia as an illustrator to cover the Russo-Japanese War. Though he hosted Berkman at his home regularly from his release in 1906, in 1907, Stein changed his and his family's last name to Stein, to protect them from association with the attempt on Frick's life. To similarly protect Stein and his family, both Goldman and Berkman referred to him as \\"Fedya\\" in their memoirs, though Stein would try to dissuade Goldman from mentioning him even this way. Goldman would write that by 1908, \\"Fedya\\" \\"had married, had a child, and disappeared from [her] ken\\". In the 1910s, Stein found even greater success as an illustrator for periodicals such as Argosy, and drew numerous covers for other pulp magazines including The Cavalier, All-Story Weekly, and People's Favorite Magazine.

In 1929, with his wife dead, and his daughter grown, Stein traveled to visit Berkman in Paris, and Goldman in St. Tropez, for her sixtieth birthday. In 1930, though, he refused to attend Berkman's symbolic sixtieth birthday celebration in New York (Berkman was legally barred from attending).Avrich (2012), pp. 355‚Äì356 In 1931, Stein visited the Soviet Union, which made him less sympathetic to the Bolshevik Revolution. Also in 1931 and 1932, Stein made multiple visits to southern France bringing large sums of money as gifts for Berkman and Goldman, essentially supporting them as their incomes decreased.Avrich (2012), pp. 362‚Äì363 From 1933 to 1934, Berkman refused Stein's support, but in 1935, Stein visited again, and Berkman was persuaded to accept a monthly stipend.Avrich (2012), p. 373 When Berkman committed suicide in 1936, Stein continued supporting Berkman's last lover Emmy Eckstein.Avrich (2012), p. 387 When Goldman died in 1940, Stein drew a likeness of her for the bronze plaque on her monument,Avrich (2012), p. 400 which was eventually sculpted by Jo Davidson. Stein continued to be a successful artist, of portraits and magazine covers for Street and Smith magazines, including Doc Savage, through the 1940s. He even spent a few years in Hollywood as a graphic artist. He died in Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing, Queens, New York City, on February 26, 1958.

The reference about him as teacher appears a bit less early ‚Äì already in the same year. There is a note in the documents of the Russian secret-service about Zamenhof that describes denunciation letters to the Cara officers. One of the denunciations, anonymous, concerned the arrival to Bialystok from Warsaw of a Hebrew teacher ‚Äì Bernard Wildenbaum, who was charged due to usage of Polish national dresses. The police in the investigation suspected that the anonymous letter was written by Zamenhof, because he led that time aschool for girls and had previously written various denunciation letters. At that time Zamenhof was a joint owner of a school for Jewish girls. In 1866 it had 63 pupils enrolled. Several Polish biographers write that Mark Zamenhof was teacher of the Bialystok high school (actual school).ƒúis nun Zbigniew Romaniuk ne sukcesis trovi konfirmon de tiu ƒâi informo en la konservitaj dokumentoj. If he instructed in that high school, probably that was only for a short episode, that probably happened after the January Uprising (so in 1864). The possible hire of Zamenhof would possibly be connected with the dismissal of many Polish teachers, that occurred after 1863. By 1837 the Zamenhof family emigrated to Warsaw, where Zamenhof advanced as a teacher of the German language in the Veterinary Institute and in the actual school, being that time only one from between three Jews that were employed in the Warsaw state schools .Jevrejskaja Enciklopedija, vol. Later he became state cencurist of the texts in the languages Hebrew and Jidda. According to Z. Weinstein Mark Zamenhof was a secret adviser .Reflektor, 1931, ‚Ññ 29, paƒùo 3 Probably Weinstein erred, because the secret adviser was very high, third rank in the officiant ranks, that matched to the rank of general in the army. Zamenhof probably had the 9th rank \\"title adviser\\", that matches to the officer rank in Polish army. Zamenhof reported about the censorship of the Jewish newspaper Ha-Tsfira. When in 1888 he allowed in the newspaper an article about wine-testing, Hayyim Selig Slonimski reported on Zamenhof's censorship. In the Ha-Tsfira newspaper one wrote that the censor Zamenhof was very strict and severe in the execution of his duties. The censorship \\"mistake\\" of Zamenhof was presented as important cause of the financial problems of the family, that prompted his migration to Grodno in October 1893. But that happened 5 years after the penalty of Zamenhof. It seems that the reasons of the financial problems of the family were a bit more complex. In the 1890s three of his sons started their costly university education: Fabian ‚Äî pharmacology, Grzegorz (Henriko) and Leon ‚Äî medicine. Funds were probably also required for Gitla's dowry.  Mark and Esperanto  Grave of Mark Zamenhof in Warsaw His son L. L. Zamenhof, when he started his university studies in 1879, handed over his Esperanto language work to Mark Zamenhof so that he could preserve it until he finished his studies. However, not understanding the ideas of his son and reckoning the draft be a silly work, burned the book. After many years he became convinced in the value of Esperanto and asked that his son L. L. Zamenhof translate his book Frazeologio Russian-Polish-French-German to Esperanto; the Proverbaro Esperanta arose from this endeavor.

Representation and working conditions United States The American Bar Association reported that in 2014, women made up 34% of the legal profession and men made up 66%. In private practice law firms, women make up 20.2% of partners, 17% of equity partners and 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms. At the junior level of the profession, women make up 44.8% of associates and 45.3% of summer associates. In 2014 in Fortune 500 corporations, 21% of the general counsels were women and 79% were men. Of these 21% of women general counsels, 81.9% were Caucasian, 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian- American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern. In 2009, women were 21.6% of law school Deans, 45.7% of Associate, Vice-Deans or Deputy Deans and 66.2% of Assistant Deans. Women have better representation on law school Law Reviews.

In 2012, women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions, while men held 73.9%. In 2014, three of nine Supreme Court justices were women (33%), 33% of Circuit Court of Appeals judges and 24% of federal court judges. Women held 27% of all state judge positions. During the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year, women made up 47% of Juris Doctor (JD) students, people of color made up 25.8% of JD students. In 2009 in the US, women made up 20.6% of law school deans.

In the US, while women made up 34% of the legal profession in 2014, women are underrepresented in senior positions in all areas of the profession. There has been an increase in women in the law field from the 1970s to 2010, but the increase has been seen in entry level jobs. In 2020, 37% of lawyers were female.https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/news/2020/07/potlp2020.pdf Women of color are even more underrepresented in the legal profession. In private practice law firms, women make up just 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms. In 2014 in Fortune 500 corporations, 21% of the general counsels were women, of which only 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern. In 2009, 21.6% of law school Deans were women. Women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions in 2012. In the US, \\"[w]omen of color were more likely than any other group to experience exclusion from other employees, racial and gender stereotyping.\\" There are few women law school deans; the list includes Joan Mahoney, Barbara Aronstein Black at Columbia Law School, Elena Kagan at Harvard Law School, Kathleen Sullivan at Stanford Law School, and the Hon. Kristin Booth Glenn and Michelle J. Anderson at the City University of New York School of Law. Women of color = Representation = The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) found that every year since 2009 there has been a decline of African-American associates‚Äî‚Äúfrom 4.66 percent to 3.95 percent.\\" According to a November 2015 NALP press release, at just 2.55 percent of partners, minority women remain the most underrepresented group at partnership level. = Treatment = In a 2008 survey, by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), the report found that women of color view their workplace as racially/ethnically stereotypical and exclusionary as a result. Women of color also felt that law firms were not taking enough action to increase diversity and when actions were taken they were not executed effectively. The America Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession released a report which was a culmination of a study meant to address the decline of women of color in the legal profession. In the study, women of color were given the opportunity to express concern over the negative effects they faced in the workplace and how those effects carried into their personal life. Women of color reported feelings of exclusion, isolation, and as though they were receiving more unwanted critical attention than their counterparts. The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession when looking at reports on the treatment of women of color in the legal profession were disappointed with the patterns they noticed which led the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession to undertake their own research in 2003, the Women of Color Research Initiative. In both law firms and corporate legal departments the findings were that women of color \\"receive less compensation than men and white women; are denied equal access to significant assignments, mentoring and sponsorship opportunities; receive fewer promotions; and have the highest rate of attrition.\\" There is a ripple effect within the treatment of women of color. Women of color are put at a disadvantage early on making \\"the ultimate result that women of color miss opportunities to get better work assignments, more client contact, and more billable hours.\\" Women of color's treatment within the legal profession and their feelings about this treatment have affected the retention of women of color in the legal profession. Women of color leave law firms at a high rate, \\"nearly 75 percent leave by their fifth year, and nearly 86 percent leave before their seventh year.\\" These women are leaving because they feel the only way to escape exclusion in the workplace is to leave the workplace. = Strategy = ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession released a report aimed at identifying challenges faced by women of color in law firms and found that ‚Äúto overcome systemic discrimination against women of color, firms must recognize that the experiences of women of color are different from those of other groups; implementing changes to reflect this difference is necessary for retention. Firms and corporations must initiate active mentorship programs and encourage organization-wide discussions about issues concerning women of color, and constructive feedback is required.‚Äù After the release of this report, several law firms have attempted the recommendations set forth by the report. Law firms began initiatives that focus on recruiting women of color as well as ensuring the retention of women of color as well. Recruiting of minority women has been increased through law firms finding summer associates by doing interviews ‚Äúat the Southeast Minority Career Fair, MCCA/Vault Career Fair, Specialty Bar Association, Lavender Law Career Fair, and at schools such as Howard University School of Law and North Carolina Central School of Law.‚Äù Canada In 2010 in Canada, \\"there were 22,261 practicing women lawyers and 37,617 practicing men lawyers.\\" Canadian studies show that \\"50% of lawyers said they felt their firms were doing \\"poorly\\" or \\"very poorly\\" in their provision of flexible work arrangements.\\" More women lawyers found it \\"difficult to manage the demands of work and personal/family life\\" than men, with 75% of women reporting these challenges versus 66% of men associates. A 2010 report about Ontario lawyers from 1971 to 2006 indicates that \\"...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30, compared to 5% of lawyers 30 and older in 2006. Visible minority lawyers accounted for 11.5% of all lawyers in 2006. Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1.0% of all lawyers in 2006. As well, \\"...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30\\" in 2006 in Ontario and women Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1%.  Middle East and North Africa (MENA)  In 2010, a study found the estimated proportion of female lawyers in 210 countries. The study included Algeria (28%), Bahrain (27%), Egypt (26%), Iran (30%), Iraq (28%), Israel (43%), Jordan (33%), Kuwait (30%), Lebanon (29%), Morocco (22%), Oman (25%), Palestine (26%), Qatar (29%), Saudi Arabia (31%), Syria (25%), Turkey (35%), United Arab Emirates (28%), and Yemen (22%). Lawyers and law professors in the Middle East believe the beginning of the 21st century allowed for an increased interest in the field of law, whereas some researchers believe part of the increase is due to the 2011 Arab Spring revolts. Researcher Rania Maktabi noticed that compared to other nations in MENA, women's issues in Morocco, Lebanon and Kuwait have been addressed less violently and also have the highest rates of female employment in the region. Female lawyers in these three nations tackle the patriarchal legal system by introducing reforms in family law, criminal law, and nationality law. Maktabi argues in her research that the increased number of female lawyers involved in women's legal issues in Morocco, Lebanon, and Kuwait has a direct impact on the strengthening of women's rights in those states. Organizations Center for Women in Law (US) The Center for Women in Law is a US organization set up and funded by women, says it is \\"devoted to the success of the entire spectrum of women in law ... serves as a national resource to convene leaders, generate ideas, and lead change\\". It combines theory with practice, addressing issues facing individuals and the profession as a whole. The Center is a Vision 2020 National Ally.Drexel University, College of Medicine, Vision 2020: national Allies - Center for Women in Law. \\"Vision 2020 is a national coalition of organizations and individuals united in the commitment to achieve women‚Äôs economic and social equality. It was founded and administered by the Institute for Women's Health and Leadership at Drexel University College of Medicine.\\" The Center was founded in 2008 by a group of women, many of whom were alumnae of The University of Texas School of Law, and many of whom graduated from law school in earlier decades when it was not common for women to pursue law as a career. The group began discussing the issues faced by women lawyers and became determined to understand fully and address effectively the underlying causes of the barriers to advancement faced by women lawyers. The Austin Manifesto calls for specific, concrete steps to tackle the obstacles facing women in the legal profession today. The center holds summits and meetings on issues affecting women in the legal profession. National Women's Law Center (US) The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) is a United States non-profit organization founded in 1972 and based in Washington, D.C. The Center advocates for women's rights through litigation and policy initiatives. It began when female administrative staff and law students at the Center for Law and Social Policy demanded that their pay be improved, that the center hire female lawyers, that they no longer be expected to serve coffee, and that the center create a women's program. Marcia Greenberger was hired in 1972 to start the program and Nancy Duff Campbell joined her in 1978. In 1981, the two decided to turn the program into the separate National Women's Law Center. Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (Canada) Women's Legal Education and Action Fund, referred to by the acronym LEAF, is the \\"...only national organization in Canada that exists to ensure the equality rights of women and girls under the law.\\". Established on April 19, 1985, LEAF was formed in response to the enactment of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to ensure that there was fair and unbiased interpretation of women's Charter rights by the courts. LEAF performs legal research and intervenes in appellate and Supreme Court of Canada cases on women's issues . LEAF has been an intervener in many significant decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, particularly cases involving section 15 Charter challenges. In addition to its legal work, LEAF also organizes speaking engagements and projects that allow lawyers interested in women's rights to educate one another, to educate the public, and to create collective responses to legal issues related to women's equality. LEAF was created by founding mother Doris Anderson and other women. Women in Law and Litigation (India) Women in Law and Litigation (WILL) was formed in India in 2014 by women lawyers, judges and legal professionals to deal with gender discrimination faced by women in the field of law. The litigating public prefers to deal with male lawyers. The society was formed under the supervision of Supreme Court of India and the justice of Supreme Court of India, Ranjana Desai. WILL was formed to provide professional support, advocacy skills, and a platform for discussion on ways for development of women lawyers. Justice Hima Kohli of the High Court (Delhi) defined WILL as the society would be a \\"way to give back to the system for senior lawyers and legal practitioners who have \\"reached high positions\\". Feminist perspectives Feminist legal theory, also known as feminist jurisprudence, is based on the belief that the law has been fundamental in women's historical subordination. The project of feminist legal theory is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women's former subordinate status. Second, it is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender. In 1984 Martha Fineman founded the Feminism and Legal Theory Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School to explore the relationships between feminist theory, practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory. The liberal model of equality under the law operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice. The difference model emphasizes the significance of gender differences and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. The dominance model views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. Feminists from the postmodern camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated. See equality feminism, difference feminism, radical feminism, and postmodern feminism for context. Notable scholars include: *Ruth Bader Ginsburg *Catharine MacKinnon *Martha Fineman *Mari Matsuda Feminist philosophy of law Feminist philosophy of law \\"...identifies the pervasive influence of patriarchy on legal structures, demonstrates its effects on the material condition of women and girls, and develops reforms to correct gender injustice, exploitation, or restriction.\\" Feminist philosophy of law uses approaches drawn from \\"...feminist epistemology, relational metaphysics, feminist political theory, and other developments in feminist philosophy to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant masculinist norms.\\" In the contemporary era, feminist philosophy of law also takes account of approaches such as \\"...human rights theory, postcolonial theory, critical legal studies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability studies.\\" As with feminism in general, there are many subtypes of feminist philosophy of law, including \\"...radical, socialist and Marxist, relational, cultural, postmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, and liberal approaches.\\" Feminist philosophers of law argue that \\"... law makes systemic bias (as opposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible, normal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose.\\" Feminist philosophers of law view laws as \\"...patriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of gender inequality.\\" Some of the legal issues analyzed by feminist philosophers of law include marriage, reproductive rights (e.g., pertaining to laws on abortion), the \\"commodification of the body\\" (as in sex work) and violence against women.  History   United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, the first woman to pass a law degree was Eliza Orme, who graduated from University College London in 1888. She was not allowed to qualify to practice as either a solicitor or a barrister. It was not until 1919, with the passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 that women could enter the legal profession. This had been challenged in 1914 in a case known as Bebb v Law Society, in which the Court of Appeal found that women did not fall within the legal definition of \\"persons\\" and so could not become lawyers. The 1919 Act also allowed women to serve on juries for the first time.  Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia, along with several other Gulf countries, has decided to put an emphasis on promoting jobs rather than oil production to help their economy.Alselaimi, Raneem, and Alawiya Allui. \\"Female Employment in Saudi Arabia: Legislative Encouragements and Socio-cultural Support.\\" In Int‚Äôl Conference Proceedings, p. 88. 2018. The Saudi government took initiatives to boost female participation in the labor force. Historically, women were not encouraged to participate in professional academic concentrations, including law. However, in 2004, the government allowed law degree programs to be studied in women's universities. Four years later, the first female students graduated with law degrees, but could not practice in courts, which consisted of an all-male judiciary. Women with law degrees could only work as \\"legal consultants,\\" which barred them from representing clients. In 2011, amongst the political uprising climate in the Middle East, female lawyers pushed a social media campaign called I am a female lawyer.\\" The campaign brought attention to the discriminatory treatment of women who were not allowed to practice law in their own countries, despite their degrees. In October 2012, King Abdullah announced his acceptance of a petition by a group of female law graduates. The 3,000 signatures permitted the registration by women for law licenses. However, the Ministry of Justice acted otherwise and refused to process registration applications from female law graduates. In April 2013, the Justice Ministry allowed a King Abdulaziz University graduate from Jeddah, Arwa al-Hujaili, to become the first female legal trainee in Saudi Arabia. As a trainee, she was allowed to practice law, similar to a \\"legal consultant,\\" but given a full license after three years of apprenticeship. In October 2013, a new policy passed allowing all women to seek a legal license to practice law after receiving a university degree in law and three years of apprenticeship. On October 6, 2013, Bayan Mahmoud Al-Zahran received the first license from the Justice Ministry, thus becoming the first licensed female lawyer in Saudi Arabia. Zahran began her legal career with dedication to domestic violence issues, then focused on criminal law. The following month, Zahran represented a client, the first time for a Saudi woman, amongst the General Court in Jidda. In January 2014, Zahran opened the first female law firm. Her firm focuses on women's issues. As of November 2015, thousands of Saudi women have degrees in law, but only sixty-seven are licensed to practice. In 2017, Saudi female students attended universities at a gross enrollment rate higher than Saudi male students, at 97.5% and 41.6%, respectively.

Canada Canadian Clara Brett Martin became the first woman lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy dispute with the Law Society of Upper Canada, which argued‚Äìunsuccessfully‚Äìthat only men could become lawyers. At the end of the nineteenth century, Canadian women were barred from participation in, let alone any influence on or control over, the legal system‚Äìwomen could not become lawyers, magistrates, judges, jurors, voters or legislators. Clara Brett Martin (1874 - 1923) became the first female lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy debate in which the Law Society of Upper Canada tried to prevent her from joining the legal profession. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1891, Martin submitted a petition to the Law Society to become a member. Her petition was rejected by the Society after contentious debate, with the Society ruling that only men could be admitted to the practice of law, because the Society's statute stated that only a \\"person\\" could become a lawyer. At that time, women were not considered to be \\"persons\\" in Canada, from a legal perspective. W.D. Balfour sponsored a bill that provided that the word \\"person\\" in the Law Society's statute should be interpreted to include females as well as males. Martin's cause was also supported by prominent women of the day including Emily Stowe and Lady Aberdeen. With the support of the Premier, Oliver Mowat, legislation was passed on April 13, 1892, which permitted the admission of women as solicitors.

During that period she employed a nanny to care for her children, and deducted the wages paid to the nanny as a business expense on her personal income tax return. Revenue Canada initially allowed these deductions, but later disallowed them. Symes objected to the re-assessment, but CRA denied the objection. Symes appealed to the Federal Court, which ruled that the expenses were valid and legitimate business expenses. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), which ruled in Symes v. Canada [1993] that her childcare expenses were not deductible as business expenses. Jody Wilson-Raybould is Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada.

She gains the confidence of her parents, who have lived separately for the past 28 years but are not yet divorced, and wishes to raise the child alone. On learning from Sanjana that it is his child that Athira is carrying, Ananth decides to marry her, solely to lend his surname to the child and ensure the child will not be termed fatherless.

In 1940 it was transferred to Wembley Studios (the 20th Century Fox Studios requisitioned for the war) to continue its activities. In August 1941 it was absorbed and expanded into the AKS. Thorold Dickinson was Head of Production (a role acquired partly through his involvement in the making of the highly successful The Next of Kin in early 1942, a film requested by the War Office and made at Ealing Studios), and he was initially instrumental in recruiting many of those who had been involved in the film industry. The result has been described as \\"a roll call of many of the finest film technicians whose skills were reflected in the quality of AKS training films\\" and some fairly well-known names contributed, others developing skills that assisted their post-war eminence; Eric Ambler, Roy Ward Baker, Thorold Dickinson, Freddie Francis, Carol Reed, Peter Ustinov and Freddie Young to name but a few.Langley, Brian. Spring 2003. \\"The AKS\\". The Veteran Issue 98. pp.12-16 The Directorate of Kinematography (DAK) started in April 1941 with only two branches. In October 1941, it moved to Curzon Street House, London W1 where it was based for the duration of World War II. In November 1941 it requisitioned the Curzon Cinema partly to meet its own screening needs, but also as a showpiece cinema for the services and for those of other government departments. By mid-1942 DAK had increased to five branches to deal with the growing demands of the war, covering such areas as policy, planning and production, finance, distribution and exhibition. In 1944 it assumed full responsibility for cinema facilities in North Africa, the Mediterranean area, the Far East and in 1945 it took over the cinema activities of NAAFI and ENSA. The centralisation of activities under DAK meant an increasingly efficient supply of cinema facilities to the Army at war, worldwide. With the establishment of the AKS and its much improved production resources, the Army's increased needs could be more efficiently met; production units could be ordered out on location, at home and abroad; there was greater security when making films on subjects that were deemed secret; high-priority films could be rushed through as necessary. What became an enormous output of films gave opportunities to young and relatively inexperienced film personnel which they were unlikely to have received in peacetime, at least over such a short period. For example, Freddie Francis entered as a camera assistant and subsequently covered everything from writing to directing, Roy Ward Baker entered as a production manager and spent most of his time directing,Ward Baker, Roy.

Sound Archives ref 17284, Imperial War Museum. This was all in the space of a little more than three years. The films produced covered a broad range of topics and were delivered in a wide variety of styles; from straightforward technical films on a subject such as a 6 pounder gun through to specialised medical films, \\"careless talk\\", street fighting, post-war jobs, food in the mess (The Soldier's Food, 1942), and problems faced by new recruits. The last topic was dealt with in a film called The New Lot. Made in 1943 for the Directorate of Army Psychiatry, directed by Carol Reed and scripted by Eric Ambler (who in 1944 became the Head of Production at the AKS) and Peter Ustinov ‚Äì both of whom appear in the film ‚Äì it detailed the many different problems facing new recruits and the way they coped. Though at the time it did not have the wider impact of something like The Next of Kin, it is now considered a minor classic. Its influence was sufficient for it to be used as the basis for the 1944 feature film The Way Ahead.Smither, Roger.

Between 1944-1946 a series of morale-boosting films were made on location in the Far East called Calling Blighty. These were filmed messages home from members of the \\"Forgotten Army\\" and provided a much-needed link between the UK and personnel stationed (and fighting) in places such as Burma, India and Ceylon.Sargent, Paul. November 1992, \\"'Keep Smiling. Keep those chins up and God bless': filmed messages home from service personnel in the Far East during the Second World War.\\" Imperial War Museum Review No. 7. By 1943 there were over a hundred mobile cinema units in the UK and approximately four hundred 16mm ones, but only one overseas, in North Africa. After the Allied landings in Italy and Normandy this expanded enormously, with a consequent demand on personnel and equipment. Projectionists were trained at the Regent Street and Northern Polytechnics in central and east London, males at the former and females (who were part of the ATS) at the latter. The course was rigorous, lasting six weeks and ending with a trade test after which those qualifying had to undergo a further two weeks' training on petrol generators. Those who were deemed able were sent on a driving course and then on to a cine section.Sellars, T H. File ref LOC 703, AKS. Imperial War Museum Film Archive; Burrows, Ruby Winifred. \\"Experiences of a Young Woman in the Army Kinematograph Service (ATS)\\" 2005. Retrieved 24 January 2016 A mobile cine section typically comprised around seven 16mm units and two 35mm units. The 16mm units operated out of 15-cwt Bedford trucks, carrying two projectors, a generator and a portable screen. The 35mm units used 3-ton Bedford trucks, as the equipment and film were much bulkier and heavier; additionally, the 35mm units had to carry their own collapsible fireproof projection box, owing to the high flammability of nitrate film. The two crew ‚Äì a corporal and private ‚Äì endured a nomadic life, going almost daily to different venues and being \\"in the field\\" for up to a month at a time. During this period they not only had to make do with what they found to show their films ‚Äì damaged buildings, barns and sometimes just the open air ‚Äì but also depended on their location for food and billet. This sometimes meant going without and on occasions coming under fire. Always distinct from other filmmaking sections of the armed forces ‚Äì the Directorate of Public Relations retained control over this area ‚Äì the AKS continued to provide much-needed cinema and production facilities up to the end of the war and beyond. Post-war it went through several name and organisational changes; in 1946 it became the Army Kinema Corporation (AKC); in 1969 the Services Kinema Corporation (SKC), reflecting its then relationship with all three services; in 1982 the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), responsible for all audio-visual services to the Forces.Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC) file.

Etymology The species name annamensis is derived from \\"Annam,\\" the name given to the French protectorate in central Vietnam, prior to that country's independence, where the holotype was collected. Phylogeny Oligodon annamensis is a member of the genus Oligodon, a genus common throughout central and tropical Asia. The genus belongs to the snake family Colubridae, the largest snake family, with member species being found on every continent except Antarctica. Description The head of the snake is short and rounded, with the snout being slightly longer than it was broad. The eyes are moderately large, with round pupils. A holotype for the species was 24.9 cm in total length, with a 2.9 cm tail. The back and head of the snake are light brown, with white blotches that are edged in black. The underside is white. Habitat and ecology The habitat and ecology of this species is poorly known. Based on data for other members of Oligodon, O. annamensis is thought to be oviparous, or egg-laying, and terrestrial in its habits. Distribution The species is known only from two specimens, and so its distribution is poorly understood. The holotype was collected from central Vietnam, and the other from Lam Dang province. The species is thought to be endemic to Vietnam. Conservation The conservation threats to O. annamensis are not known, because the species is only known from two specimens. The area from which these are collected is not under any sort of protection, and is threatened by deforestation.

It contains the remains of a glacier that used to cover almost the entire summit plateau; in 1888 around 5.5 km¬≤ of the plateau was covered by an ice sheet. Since then the glacial surface has melted until it now covers just 1.5 km¬≤ and the glacier has split into three, small crevasse-free areas. The name of the glacier goes back to a local legend.  High plateau and its perimeter mountains  The Hochk√∂nig is the southernmost and highest mountain block in the Berchtesgaden Alps. Unlike the Watzmann massif about 20 kilometres to the north, it has a plateau that tilts gently towards the north and covers about 15 km¬≤. Only in the south does it fall steeply away in rock faces up to 1,000 metres high (the Mandlw√§nde). The edge of the plateau is formed by several high two-thousanders in the shape of a giant oval. Apart from the main summit, the most prominent of the remaining peaks (in clockwise order) are the: Gro√üer and Kleiner Bratschenkopf, Kummetstein, Lamkopf and Hochseiler (all over 2,850 m) and to the north/east to Tenneck, Flo√ükogel and the Schoberk√∂pfe (2,435 to 2,710 m). To the east of the last-named is the imposing Tors√§ule, which the climb from the Arthurhaus hut runs past; the Tors√§ule marks the end of the plateau above the side valleys of the River Salzach.

It is a rare rhizomatous perennial, from the mountains of Italy. It is medium-sized, with purple flowers and white beards. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It has had a confusing history, once thought as a variety of Iris germanica, then as a separate species with a name shared with another bearded iris. It has only been sorted out since 1996. Description It is similar in form to Iris germanica. It is classed as a medium-sized bearded iris, and grows up to between tall. It has a branched stem. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The flowers come in shades of purple, from red-purple, to blue-purple. In the centre of the falls is a 'beard', or line of white hairs. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, that has not been described. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count of 2n=40. It was counted by Colasante & Sauer in 1993 and by Colasante in 1996. It is the same as Iris setina, Iris bicapitata, Iris lutescens and Iris revoluta. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet relicta refers to a remnant, primitive, left behind and relict.D. Gledhill This name was chosen due to the diminishing size of the population of irises found on the mountains in Italy. It was first published and described by Nicola Terracciano (1837‚Äì1921) as Iris germanica var. suaveolens in 'Atti dell' Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e' Matematiche (Atti Accad. Sci. Fis.) series 4, (Appendix 2) on page 7 in 1890, as a variety of Iris germanica. It was then published as Iris suaveolens by (N. Terracc.) N. Terracc. ex A. Terracc in 'Nuovo Giorn. Bot. Ital.', series. 2, on page182 in 1894. But this name was rejected by other authors and iris authorities as it was already used by another iris species, since 1853. Later it was re- classified as a separate species by Prof. Maretta Colasante in Giornale Botanico Italiano ('Giorn. Bot. Ital.') Vol.123 Supplement 1 on page 112 in 1989, and then called Iris relicta by Colasante in (Fl. Medit.) Vol.6 page 214 in 1996. Based on specimens found on 'Monte delle Fate' in Lazio, Italy. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 7 April 2003, and the updated on 3 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life, it is listed as Iris relicta and notes that Iris germanica var. suaveolens is a synonym. Distribution and habitat It is native to Europe. Range It is found in Italy, within the central and southern regions. It is found in the region of Lazio on 'Monte della Fate', within the Ausoni Mountains.. and near Lago di Fondi. It is listed as endemic of Italy, with Iris bicapitata, 'Iris italica var. cengialti' (a synonym of Iris pallida subsp. cengialti), Iris marsica, Iris revoluta, Iris sabina and Iris setina. Habitat It grows on the rocky mountain-sides with other small shrubs. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Synecology Part of the Ausoni Mountains are protected by Wilderness Area, (covering 4,230 hectares and was established in 1999), forests (made of oak, cork oak and maple), cover most of the mountain valleys. Under the forest trees are rare and endemic flora, including Crocus imperati subsp imperati, Narcissus poeticus, Asphodeline lutea (Asfodelina), Daphne oleoides (spatula Daphne) and Iris relicta. Conservation It is listed as 'very rare', and is protected in the 'Wilderness Area' in Italy. Cultivation It is hardy to USDA Zone 7, tolerating dry Mediterranean-like summers. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C.

He is known primarily for his nine murals and paintings. He was awarded a full scholarship to attend the Chicago Institute of Art and received his BFA in drawing/painting and illustration in 1957. Jones' initial 17-year career was in advertising. He was Hallmark Cards' first African American Art Director and worked for the first black-owned ad agency, Vince Cullers Advertising (founded in 1956). Additionally, Jones worked with his own company, Sales Graphics Advertising. Jones left advertising in 1970 and became the co-director of the avant garde AFAM Gallery Studio and Cultural Center in Chicago with Alfred Tyler. Beginning in 1976, he became a community mural leader in Chicago and collaborated with Mitchell Caton on six Chicago murals. Additionally, Jones' mural portfolio includes a mural in Detroit and Atlanta. Personal life In the 1950s, Jones married Irene Tabron. They had a son, Byron Jones in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Jones developed keratoconus, a corneal condition that causes vision distortion. The condition left him legally blind for much of his life. He stated that it caused him \\"to see light like a kaleidoscope, eight times.\\" Faheem Majeed, South Side Community Arts Center Executive Director and curator, posited that it was debatable if he created what he saw or if he was purposefully creating abstracted imagery. Jones received cornea transplants in the 1980s which restored his eyesight. Jones kidney condition worsened while in California visiting his partner Cynthia Ross. He declined dialysis. His ashes are split between California's redwood forest and his surviving family.25 He is survived by his son Byron and his sister Alletta Jumper. His papers are held at the Chicago Public Library Fine art paintings Jones' paintings were exhibited internationally (Senegal and Nigeria). His work was included in the Art in Chicago, 1945-1995 exhibition. The artwork of his early fine art career incorporated African American figures set against patterns reminiscent of African textiles. Jones' later artwork became abstract in the 1980s and used dramatic and textural compositions with intense colors, often incorporating objects onto the paintings such as bark, ceramic kiln furniture, feathers, dyed fabric and paper-mache. When he was a freelancer, he was commissioned by Seagram Company and the Hiram Walker Foundation to paint what became the Beefeater set of limited edition prints \\"The Art of Good Taste\\". \\"The set comprises the seven original paintings which traveled across the U.S. throughout 1992, as part of a major program sponsored by Beefeater to celebrate African American culture through art. In its first year, \\"The Art of Good Taste\\" program generated 89.5 million impressions nationally through advertising, promotion, events, publicity and consumer offers. It was also acclaimed as \\"one of the most dramatic and well executed marketing promotional campaigns ever seen in the beverage industry.\\"Personal papers of Calvin B. Jones from Beefeater issued Press Release issued by The Morgan Group, Chicago, IL, Sharon Morgan, 312/769-5101 The program earned five awards from Beverage Dynamics, along with the PRAME Award for best ethnic campaign from the National Association of Market Developers and the National Black Public Relations Society.*\\" Murals Jones and Caton's influenced the murals of Chicago, with their identifiable aesthetic of patterns and realistic figures which can still be seen with the murals \\"A Time to Unite (with Justine DeVan), \\"Another Time's Voice Remembers My Passions Humanity\\", and \\"Memories of the Future\\". Jones and Mitchell Caton were part of the Chicago Mural Group. Their 1981 mural, Builders of the Cultural Present, used a segmented format in canted parallelograms for the mural composition. Olivia Guide and Jeff Hueber credit Jones and Caton for their innovated nonuniform mural contours which create a dynamic sense of vibrancy and movement as the composition was not confined by the paint and the building's surface. Jones and Caton's murals used strong colors and were technically finely executed because of their strong draftsmanship. Jones stated in 1994 that he did not use preliminary drawings or the grid method for his murals. He felt that it was a waste of his time. Jones would use African patterns in his mural designs to symbolize the progressive relationship between the past and the present. \\"We, as people, all have our idiosyncrasies, prejudices and stereotypes concerning art and culture. The only way this gap can be bridged is through exposure and education. My challenge and obligation is to document, sensitize and relate to the Black experience of the societies and cultures in which we live and to be a responsible communicator in the projection and relation of my heritage -- the mirror of my spiritual center.\\" Calvin B.

It is owned by The Land Trust and is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Buglife as a nature reserve, who are working to bring more of the area under management and to improve public access. Description Canvey Wick is in the southwest corner of Canvey Island, it is an open area situated between Holehaven Creek to the south and the grazing marshes of West Canvey Marsh to the north. It used to be an area of grazing marsh like nearby West Canvey but for many years it was used to dump dredging waste on and this raised the land by smothering the old meadows in a mixture of sand, gravel, chalk and shells. The site was earmarked for the construction of an oil refinery for Occidental Petroleum, but the oil price crisis of 1973 meant that the refinery never opened. The entrance to the reserve is on Northwick Road. As a result of the poor quality soil created by the dredging waste and the variable ground water conditions, a complex mix of habitat types had developed and continues to develop. The main habitat is dry grassland while there are significant areas of wetland too and these give home to a nationally significant community of invertebrates, mainly species of herb-rich grassland, bare ground, open grassland, scrubby edges and brackish wetlands. The site has been described as \\"a brownfield rainforest\\" by former Natural England officer Chris Gibson. Wildlife Over 1,300 species of invertebrate have been recorded at Canvey Wick, these include no less than 30 species which are on the UK's red list of endangered species. Examples of nationally important insects found in the area include the Canvey Island ground beetle (Scybalicus oblongiculus), the five-banded weevil hunting wasp (Cercersis quinquefascinata), the shrill carder bee (Bombus sylvarum), the brown-banded carder bee (Bombus humilis) and the scarce emerald damselfly (Lestes dryas). Other insects recorded here include the hairy-legged mining bee or pantaloon bee (Dasypoda hirtipes), the silver y moth (Autographa gamma), marbled white (Melanargia galathea and the wall brown (Lasiommata megera). The birdlife on site includes green woodpecker, European stonechat, Western yellow wagtail and Eurasian reed warbler. The site is also important for orchids and surveys have found 1,700 common spotted orchids (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), 500 pyramidal orchids (Anacamptis pyramidalis) and 25 of the much less common bee orchid (Ophrys apifera). Developments In 2016 the supermarket company Morrisons transferred of land to The Land Trust, and established an endowment fund to fund its management. This new area connected the existing reserves of Canvey Wick with neighbouring nature reserves such as the RSPB reserve at West Canvey Marshes. In 2018 a sculpture of a dragonfly created from recycled materials was unveiled at the site.

She was the founder of the Catholic order of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the only order indigenous to the Archdiocese of Rijeka in Croatia, and the first prioress of the order. Her beatification began in 2008 and her confirmation process started in 2013. Biography Maria Nicolina Cosulich was born in Rijeka, Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia, on 20 September 1852 to a wealthy family from the nearby island of Lo≈°inj. Her parents were Caterina (n√©e Sopraniƒá or Soprani) from Veli Lo≈°inj and Giovanni Matteo Cosulich from Mali Lo≈°inj. The area was at that time ethnically mixed, with fluid ethnic borders between Istrian Italians and Slavs. Maria Cosulich had eleven siblings and she was the eldest of the five who survived. She began her education in Rijeka and later studied in the multicultural milieu of Gorizia (the seat of an archdiocese and of the Habsburg Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca at that time), learning Italian (her first language), Croatian, French, German, and Hungarian. She was highly educated and became a kindergarten and music teacher. She was initially enthusiastic about harpsichord and later learned piano. She was also skillful in knitting and stitching. She and her family were highly spiritual and dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, setting up an altar to him in their house. Cosulich spent her early years staying at home and helping her mother, teaching her brothers and sisters. Her sister Irene became a physics and mathematics teacher in the school in Rijeka. Her brother Giuseppe Nicol√≤ died in 1885 at age 22, while still pursuing his studies. Her sister Emilia worked as private tutor and one sister became a nun. After a shipwrecking on a voyage from New York to Odessa in 1874, his father's company went bankrupt, forcing the family to relocate. In 1879, they settled in nearby Trieste. Here she joined the Pious Union of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart and worked as a Catholic layperson among the poor. She was particularly focused on abandoned girls, teaching them faith and devotion, as well as providing shelter and clothing. Maria Nicolina Cosulich at a young ageShe spent a decade in Trieste before returning to Rijeka, where she resumed her charitable works. In 1895 she founded the Institute of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to provide a kindergarten for poor children and education for girls, without regard for their religious affiliation or ethnic background. Four years later, she took her vows and changed her name to Maria Crocifissa (Marija Krucifiksa in Croatian). In 1899, she established the congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She wrote and prepared the Constitution for the order under the model of the Capuchin Friar Arcangelo da Camerino, who had organized the Daughters of the Sacred Heart in Trieste and became the first prioress of the congregation. Her vocation was to work among the poor and bridge the gap between the Slavic and Italian communities living in Rijeka in a period of mounting nationalism. Cosulich died on 29 September 1922 in Rijeka The order that she founded has spread to include six dioceses in Croatia and one in Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro, Italy, as well as operating two kindergartens and a girls' boarding school. In 2008, the process of her beatification was begun when an arterial street connecting the avenue of John Paul II and Pomerio Streets was dedicated. She has been the subject of a documentary film by Bernardin Modriƒá, had a staircase in the city center of Rijeka dedicated to her, had a plaque affixed to the home of her birth, and had a hospice named in her honor. Her body was exhumed and identified in 2012 to be consecrated and in February 2013, a decree was signed by Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for the confirmation process to officially begin. The date of starting the beatification process was on 20 October 2013, the anniversary of the date she had taken the oath to join the Pious Union of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1879.

It was first described in 1968 by British zoologist David Harrison who named it Felis silvestris gordoni in honour of Major A.C. Gordon who collected the type specimen in Oman.  Taxonomy  The Arabian wildcat's taxonomic status has been debated since the 1990s: *In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, it was recognised as a Felis silvestris subspecies with the name Felis silvestris gordoni. *In 2007, following phylogenetic research, it was subsumed to F. s. lybica, the Near Eastern wildcat. *Since 2017, Felis lybica is recognised as a wildcat species distinct from Felis silvestris, and the Arabian wildcat is now recognised as the nominate lybica subspecies F. l. lybica. Characteristics The Arabian wildcat is quite similar to a domestic cat in size and appearance. Its fur is short and dense, greyish-brown, ash grey or buff, with dark markings on the head and dark banding on the body, limbs and near the tip of the tail. The underparts are whitish, and there are black hairs between the black pads on the soles of the feet. Distribution and habitat This cat is endemic to northern Oman and parts of the United Arab Emirates. Its typical habitat is semidesert areas with rock and scrub where males maintain a territory which may measure several square km, and females a rather smaller territory. Ecology The Arabian wildcat is nocturnal; it is a solitary animal and has several dens, rock crevices, hollow trees or empty fox burrows, into which it can retreat in different parts of its territory. It feeds on jerboas, jirds and other small rodents, small birds, reptiles and large insects, obtaining most of its fluid needs from its food. It is fierce and agile. Breeding takes place at most times of year. The male is drawn to the female by the pheromones she produces when she is sexually receptive. The gestation period is about sixty-five days and the litter size is usually three or four kittens. The young have spotted coats at first and are weaned after two or three months, but stay with their mother for several months more to learn hunting and survival skills. Status The range of the Arabian wildcat is small and it is one of the most threatened subspecies of wildcat. Historically persecuted by the Bedouin, its habitat is now increasingly being degraded for agricultural purposes. The most serious threat it faces may be that it hybridises with feral domestic cats, and there may be few purebred Arabian wildcats remaining in the wild. With this in mind, a captive breeding program was started in 1986 in Abu Dhabi, and other cats have been relocated to California and Germany, with an international studbook being kept at Cologne Zoological Garden.

He has received both fellowships and artist's residencies in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and Wales, as well as various awards, including the Living Legend Award of the Black Alumni Society of the University of Pennsylvania. From 2012 to 2014, Dupree Studios in the Mantua community of West Philadelphia was the subject of an eminent domain takeover attempt by the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA), which ended with Dupree keeping his studio. Education James Dupree was born in 1950 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and spent parts of his childhood in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Bridgeville, Pennsylvania. As a child, he attended free classes at the Fleisher Art Memorial in Philadelphia. Dupree received a full scholarship to Columbus College of Art and Design, where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1972. He then attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the University of Pennsylvania, becoming one of the first African Americans to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania's Master of Fine Arts program, in 1977. Works  Dupree has displayed his works in both group and solo shows, most recently Works From The Stolen Dreams And Forbidden Fruit Series at the Art Sanctuary in Philadelphia (March 2015); and Stolen Dreams in the Promise Zone at Stockton University (July‚ÄìAugust 2015). He is known for his exploration of mixed media including glass, wood, and other materials, and his vibrant use of color. Dupree's works are included in the permanent collections of the Columbus Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the African American Museum in Philadelphia; the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York; and the National Museum of Art in Cardiff, Wales, among others. His works are held by private collectors including LeRoi Moore of the Dave Matthews Band and Patti LaBelle. He has been active in the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, and was the artist for the mural in honor of poet and teacher Sonia Sanchez near Temple University. His mural \\"Evolving Elements\\" was displayed at the Philadelphia International Airport through its Exhibitions program. He has also created sets for the Shooting Stars, one of Philadelphia's Mummers Fancy Brigades. The Shooting Stars used Dupree's sets when they won first place in 2008, with the theme \\"India Land of the Tiger\\", and 2009, with \\"Mythic Knights, Defenders of the Realm\\". They gave Dupree the nickname of \\"King James\\". Awards Dupree has received a number of awards and fellowships, and has been an artist-in-residence at the Contemporary Arts Center, North Adams, MA; the African American Museum, Philadelphia, PA; the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, Wales; the Brandywine Graphics Studio, Philadelphia, PA; and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY. In 2010, James Dupree received the Living Legend Award of the Black Alumni Society of the University of Pennsylvania. Eminent Domain dispute Dupree Studios is located in the Mantua community of West Philadelphia. In 2005, Dupree bought a dilapidated warehouse at 3617‚Äì19 Haverford Avenue for $183,000, and spent as much again on renovating, furnishing, and transforming the property. It has since been appraised by Prudential at a value of $2.2 million. The 8,646-square-foot space is used for living, teaching and studio space as well as for storing and displaying artworks. The studio is estimated to house more than 5,000 pieces of Dupree's work. On December 27, 2012, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) seized the deed to Dupree's studio under Pennsylvania's soon- to-expire Eminent Domain Code. In their redevelopment plan, the PRA proposed razing the studio and replacing it with a grocery store and parking lot. The city initially offered to pay Dupree the nominal sum of $600,000 for the property. The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas supported the PRA's attempt to condemn the property on November 13, 2013, and re-affirmed that decision on June 26, 2014. The actions of the PRA were condemned as \\"unfair\\", \\"unjust\\", and \\"un-American\\". Dupree contested the seizure, with the help of the Institute for Justice. He received vocal support from a variety of arts and rights groups, including the ACLU, Americans for Prosperity, the Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, and the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program. On December 11, 2014, the Redevelopment Authority announced that it was ending condemnation proceedings, returning Dupree full right to his land and studio. Dupree himself emphasizes the importance of the final decision, not just for himself, but for others: \\"I didn't just win. We all won. America wins with this.\\" Feature Documentary From 2011 to 2014; two American filmmakers, Tyrone Brown and Joe Sapienza II, merged their two documentaries on Dupree titled: Broken Dreams \\"The Man I Always Wanted to Be\\",http://www.savedupreestudios.org/blog/james-dupree-documentary-official- trailer and released the feature film on November 2015 in Philadelphia. The documentary features Dupree's Art series, his music, lifestyle, his fight against Philadelphia with Eminent Domain, and interviews with Mantua residents and their views on the massive takeover of land by Penn & Drexel, the surrounding Universities. Joe Sapienza was filming when James Dupree was battling city hall and filmed the Eminent Domain procedures. He also filmed a one on one interview with Dupree, the \\"Save Dupree Studios\\" event in April 2014, the Courthouse Art bid- which was cut from the film for time but can be seen in older DVD versions, the RDA building exchange for Dupree's property, and the final winning deed portion. His original title was \\"Fighting Iridescence\\" with focus on the Eminent Domain procedures and approached Tyrone Brown to merge the two stories into one feature after meeting Brown at an event with James. Brown's documentary focused on Dupree's Art and the beginning of the art studio's assessments by the RDA and was titled, \\"The Man I Always Wanted to Be\\" which was a direct quote from Dupree to district councilwoman Blackwell. The original ending of the documentary showed a bitter and darker cut of Dupree in the back of his studio among the trash and vacant lots followed by the credits. An alternate ending suggested by Sapienza was shot in the spring of 2015 and re-cut to show Dupree in happier times after he won his deed back from the city, especially after Dupree and his family were not thrilled by the original ending of the film. Tyrone Brown filmed portions of Dupree's documentary first with a one on one interview with Dupree, Dupree's Art series, the Mantua studio, interviews with Dupree's students, the Florida Art Basal event, and the Dupree gallery on 6th & Bainbridge Streets, along with an emotional Dupree at his daughter's wedding, which was cut from the film. Over 18 hours of footage exists between the two filmmakers on Dupree, all cut down to an 80-minute film. The documentary also features bassist and songwriter Jamal Tacuma in the credits which was filmed in Atlantic City for their music video. Drexel University declined Sapienza's request for rights to footage that featured president John Fry talking about the Promised Zone and the future of Mantua, where James Dupree's studio currently resides, and declined two interview requests even though Sapienza is an accredited alumni of Drexel University in the Film & Television program. Jannie Blackwell, district councilwoman for the Mantua section in West Philadelphia declined Sapienza's request for an interview as well. According to the IMDb.com website, many people who worked on the film were credited under alternate names with Sapienza & Brown being the only real names credited.

He also painted several versions and derivatives in his later career. The painting shows a woman with long flame-red hair kissing a man on the neck, as the couple embrace. Although others have seen in it \\"a man locked in a vampire's tortured embrace ‚Äì her molten-red hair running along his soft bare skin,\\" Munch himself always claimed it showed nothing more than \\"just a woman kissing a man on the neck\\". The painting was first called Vampire by Munch's friend, the critic Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski. Przybyszewski saw the painting on exhibition and described it as \\"a man who has become submissive, and on his neck a biting vampire's face.\\" A version of the painting was stolen from the Munch Museum on 23 February 1988. It was recovered later the same year, when the thief contacted the police. In 2008, at a Sotheby's auction, an 1894 version of the painting sold for 38.2 million dollars (24.3 million pounds) and set the world record for the auction of a Munch painting.

It operated form 1862 to 23 March 1998. In 1862, it was constructed by the Singapore Gas Company and occupied an area of about 3.14ha. It was built to supply piped gas in Singapore, and was the first in the country. It had a daily production capacity of 1,000,000m3. It was the largest gas works in Southeast Asia at the time. Today, the site is listed as a Historic Site by the National Heritage Board. The area is bounded by Kallang Road, Crawford Street, Kampong Bugis and the Rochor River. At that time, gas was produced using coal and Kallang Gasworks was ideally located by the bank of the Rochor River. It made the delivery of coal supplies shipped from neighbouring countries convenient. The Kallang Basin site formed part of Singapore's southern coastline, before major land reclamation transformed the area into what it is today.  History   Tanks  There were a total of four tanks used for operation at the plant. Tanks 1 and 2 were constructed with the plant in 1862 and were used till 1957, when they were demolished. Tank number 3 was added before 1900, and Tank number 4 was the last addition. It was built between 1908 and 1909.  Plant operations  Gas production continued uninterruptedly for 137 years at the Kallang Gasworks, except for short breaks during the world wars. The plant was initially built to supply the piped gas for the street lighting. Its original function of servicing gas lighting soon faded as electricity took over street lights in 1906.. However, piped gas continued to grow in demand despite street lighting converting to electricity. This was due to the need for gas as fuel for cooking and water heating, especially with the rapid housing developments during the period of the 1960s and 1970s. When operations were handed over to the municipal commissioners, coal carbonising plants were installed. It happened over a few decades, from 1901 to 1930. These plants were used till 1958. when the gas works were converted to oil gasification. After the last gas street lamp disappearing in 1956, the use of fuel oil replaced coal. New oil gasification plants were installed to replaced the coal carbonising plants in 1958. In July 1997, the Kallang Gasworks piped gas production was relocated to Senoko Gasworks, which had a higher daily production capacity of 1,600,000m3. On 23 March 1998, Kallang Gasworks was officially decommissioned. Then on 26 March 1998, three days later, for the first and only time, public access to the plant was granted before it was returned to the government.

Pacru has much in common with Chess (piece movement with sharp tactical exchanges and long-term positional considerations) and Go (game) (strategic concepts such as area control must be considered). Pacru can be played by 2,3 or 4 people, each controlling a single colour. Commercial versions will usually come with the rules for two other games that can be played with the same equipment, Azacru and Shacru. The game was feature at the Mind Sports Olympiad.  Overview and terminology  Pacru is played on a 9x9 grid where each point in the grid is called a \\"field\\". The grid is divided into nine borderlands, each consisting of nine fields. Each player starts with 3 pieces (in the 3- or 4-player version) or 4 pieces (in the 2-player version. During play, each player will attempt to place markers of their colour on the board with the eventual goal of dominating the board. A field with neither a piece or marker on it is called unoccupied.

Early life  Ginchev was born in Pavlikeni to Stela Chudomirova Gincheva, a teacher and Milko Georgiev Ginchev, a doctor. Also, they both were professional athletes: His mother was a handball player, while his father was a football referee. He has an elder brother, Georgi, who is currently a referee. When he is not on the field, he is a very family oriented person. Growing up, when he was about to choose football as his career, he said that it was very difficult for him as that would mean less time with his family, who he says play a major role in his life.  Club career  The city of Pavlikeni was also the place where Ginchev first learned to master his skills as a footballer. He spent his early years playing for his local team and by the time he turned thirteen years old, he had already made a name for himself as one of Bulgaria's top footballers. In 2007, Ginchev became one of the regional winners in the national Children and Football programme in Bulgaria. He was given an award by the Bulgarian football stars Dimitar Berbatov and Martin Petrov on a special ceremony in Sofia. He was then spotted by Vidima-Rakovski and moved to the club of Sevlievo at the age of fourteen. From 2008 to 2012 he played for the youth teams and showed some very good skills. It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Bulgarian clubs. He eventually chose to stay with the club and stressed to the public that he had no intentions of leaving. In 2010, Ginchev signed a contract with the American sportswear manufacturer Nike. The brand unveiled a marketing exercise in Bulgaria, aiming to make young athletes look like the biggest stars in the business. He was the first youngster to be equipped under that scheme. In May 2012, he made his professional debut in First Professional Football League in a game against Botev Vratsa.

Oblivious Data Structures. Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security In most conditions, even if the data is encrypted, the access pattern can be achieved, and this pattern can leak some important information such as encryption keys. And in the outsourcing of cloud data, this leakage of access pattern is still very serious. An access pattern is a specification of an access mode for every attribute of a relation schema. For example, the sequences of user read or write the data in the cloud are access patterns. We say if a machine is oblivious if the sequence in which it accesses is equivalent for any two input with the same running time. So the data access pattern is independent from the input. Applications: *Cloud data outsourcing: When writing or reading data from a cloud server, oblivious data structures are useful. And modern database rely on data structure heavily, so oblivious data structure come in handy. *Secure processor: Tamper-resilient secure processors are used for defense against physical attacks or the malicious intruders access the users‚Äô computer platforms. The existing secure processors designed in academia and industry include AEGIS and Intel SGX encrypt. But the memory addresses are still transferred in the clear on the memory bus. So the research finds that this memory buses can give out the information about encryption keys. With the Oblivious data structure comes in practical, the secure processor can obfuscate memory access pattern in a provably secure manner. *Secure computation: Traditionally people used circuit-model to do the secure computation, but the model is not enough for the security when the amount of data is getting big. RAM-model secure computation was proposed as an alternative to the traditional circuit model, and oblivious data structure is used to prevent information access behavioral being stolen.  Oblivious Data Structures   Oblivious RAM  Goldreich and Ostrovsky proposed this term on software protection. The memory access of oblivious RAM is probabilistic and the probabilistic distribution is independent of the input. In the paper composed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky have theorem to oblivious RAM: Let denote a RAM with m memory locations and access to a random oracle machine. Then t steps of an arbitrary program can be simulated by less than steps of an oblivious . Every oblivious simulation of must make at least \\\\max\\\\\\\\{m, (t-1)\\\\log_2 m\\\\\\\\} accesses in order to simulate t steps. Now we have the square-root algorithm to simulate the oblivious ram working. # For each \\\\sqrt maccesses, randomly permute first m + \\\\sqrt m memory. # Check the shelter words first if we want to access a word. # If the word is there, access one of the dummy words. And if the word is not there, find the permuted location. To access original RAM in t steps we need to simulate it with t + \\\\sqrt m steps for the oblivious RAM. For each access, the cost would be O(\\\\sqrt m \\\\cdot \\\\log m). Another way to simulate is hierarchical algorithm. The basic idea is to consider the shelter memory as a buffer, and extend it to the multiple levels of buffers. For level , there are buckets and for each bucket has log t items. For each level there is a random selected hash function. The operation is like the following: At first load program to the last level, which can be say has buckets. For reading, check the bucket from each level, If (V,X) is already found, pick a bucket randomly to access, and if it is not found, check the bucket , there is only one real match and remaining are dummy entries . For writing, put (V,X) to the first level, and if the first I levels are full, move all I levels to levels and empty the first I levels. The time cost for each level cost O(log t); cost for every access is ; The cost of Hashing is .  Oblivious Tree  An Oblivious Tree is a rooted tree with the following property: *All the leaves are in the same level. *All the internal nodes have degree at most 3. *Only the nodes along the rightmost path in the tree may have degree of one. The oblivious tree is a data structure similar to 2-3 Tree, but with the additional property of being oblivious. The rightmost path may have degree one and this can help to describe the update algorithms. Oblivious tree requires randomization to achieve a running time for the update operations. And for two sequences of operations M and N acting to the tree, the output of the tree has the same output probability distributions. For the tree, there are three operations: ;:build a new tree storing the sequence of values L at its leaves. ;: insert a new leaf node storing the value b as the ith leaf of the tree T. ;: remove the ith leaf from T. Step of Create: The list of nodes at the ithlevel is obtained traversing the list of nodes at level i+1 from left to right and repeatedly doing the following: # Choose d {2, 3} uniformly at random. # If there are less than d nodes left at level i+1, set d equal to the number of nodes left. # Create a new node n at level I with the next d nodes at level i+1 as children and compute the size of n as the sum of the sizes of its children.oblivious tree For example, if the coin tosses of d {2, 3} has an outcome of: 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3 stores the string ‚ÄúOBLIVION‚Äù as follow oblivious tree. Both the and have the O(log n) expected running time. And for and we have: INSERT (b, I, CREATE (L)) = CREATE (L [1] + ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.., L[ i], b, L[i+1]‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..) DELETE (I, CREATE (L)) = CREATE (L[1]+ ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶L[I - 1], L[i+1], ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..) For example, if the or is run, it yields the same probabilities of out come between these two operations.

On the southwest borders the walled Old City, specifically the defenses of San Lucas and Santa Catalina and the northeast, with the district of Marbella.  History  The curious name of this neighborhood comes from the first centuries of the city, when there was here, a drove of goats that were reproduced copiously naming not only the neighborhood but also the geographical features of their environment as the lagoon, the mountain or swamp. This name appears in Cartagena de Indias planes in the 18th century. At the entrance of the neighborhood was a small fortification called Revell√≠n which was reached by a wooden bridge built over a wide ditch that communicated the sea waters with those of the swamp. When neighborhood grew, the Revell√≠n was destroyed and was completely sealed the pit so now there is no trace of its presence. Only since nineteenth century when ended naval attacks from the sea, city began to fill the space outside the walls and this district was one of the firsts because of its proximity and its coastal position. The big push to the definitive consolidation and beautification of neighborhood arrived in the late nineteenth century when lived here Rafael N√∫√±ez, twice president of the United States of Colombia and another twice, of the Colombian Republic. He lived here with his wife Soledad Rom√°n.  Urban development  Vista del barrio desde el Edificio Altamar del Cabrero It has traditionally been a neighborhood of individual houses inhabited by fishermen. Progressively they have been constructed apartment buildings with residential and tourism uses for its high altitude creates a strong contrast with traditional housing. At sea have been installed seawalls like \\"T\\"; thanks to waves they have favored the formation of new semicircular beaches gaining ground to the sea. Nowadays, the neighborhood has 3 streets: * Avenida Santander: it runs all the coast line. * Calle Real de El Cabrero: it is the central street in the neighborhood. * Carrera 3¬™ also called \\"Soledad Rom√°n\\": it borders the lagoon by lands populated by mangroves. There is a cycling infrastructure along this street.

It is a mansion built entirely of wood. The building has guided visits and is equipped within the original period furniture. It also has a beautiful courtyard with lush vegetation. Opposite the house across the street is the main entrance to the Apolo park and from there, statue of Rafael Nunez on his pedestal, watches his house. The Foundation called \\"Casa Museo de el Cabrero\\" founded by Eduardo Lemaitre Roman and Teresita Roman de Zurek with the Ministry of Culture of Colombia administers the historical assets of Rafael Nunez and Soledad Rom√°n.  El Cabrero Church  Iglesia del Cabrero It is located inside the Apollo Park. It was built by Rafael Nunez for his wife Soledad Rom√°n could pray quietly as in other churches did not allow entry or was subject to all sorts of criticism. The reason was that she had married a divorced man as was Rafael Nunez and this constituted a scandal in the nineteenth society of Cartagena. In the Chapel on both sides of the main altar lie the mortal remains of President Rafael Nunez and his wife Soledad Rom√°n two mausoleums.

He was born in Getxo, Basque Country Spain on March 19, 1938. His professional trajectory expands more than a half-century and across three continents. In his native Basque Country he is regarded as an outstanding advocate of the historical Avant Garde and is renowned globally as a master colorist across multiple mediums. Biography He attended El Colegio de los Hermanos De La Salle, Deusto, Biscay, Spain and the Escuela de Altos Estudio Mercantiles in Bilbao. He also studied at The Institute of Artes y Oficios, Academia Sindical de Bellas Artes, and Museo de Reproducciones Artisticas in Bilbao. Cundin traveled to Bogot√°, Colombia in 1956 shortly after his 18th birthday. He held his first solo exhibitions there in Bogota, Medellin and Baranquilla. He established residence in New York in 1958, before settling in New Orleans in 1964. He now resides in Folsom, Louisiana. Over the years he has also resided and exhibited in Bilbao, Miami, Paris, Bruges, Belgium, Annapolis, Maryland and in the 70's he spent long periods exhibiting and teaching in San Miguel de Allende and Mexico City, Mexico. Over the years he has held more than 40 solo shows and participated in numerous collective exhibitions. His works have been featured in many books, magazines and literary journals with the latest for the cover of The Southern Review. His works hang in the permanent collections of The Museum of Bellas Artes, Bilbao, ARTIUM, Vitoria, Basque Country, Spain, The New Orleans Museum of Art, Museum of Antioquia, Colombia, Johnson & Wales University His work is in numerous private and corporate collections including in the Basque Country, Spain, France, England, Germany, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. He married Marion Gill from Dublin, Ireland on January 5, 1979 in Bilbao. They have one son, Ignacio, and Jos√©-Maria has three more sons, Fernando, Luisiana, and Gorriaran Cundin. Art Cundin‚Äôs art has gone through a number of constantly shifting styles throughout his extensive career. His early work espoused representation art, depicting people through portraits. He shifted from this style around 1989, entering two new streams: plastic art (e.g., ‚ÄúCharity Hospital‚Äù) and abstract art. In the latter style, he toyed with the concept of his old portraits, using abstract, colorful blocks to create what he called ‚ÄúPortraits, Self- portraits, Anti-portraits, and Pseudo-portraits.‚Äù Perhaps his most well-known work is a limited edition engraving of the Declaration of Independence, which he designed, directed, and produced in 1991. The work was hand-engraved on a brass plate and printed on hand-made paper from the Basque Country. Cundin gathered a team of Basque specialists to complete the engraving, which at the time was the first of its kind in 150 years. After living under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain, the proclamation of freedom in the Declaration greatly appealed to Cundin. He chose it for its permanence, calling it ‚Äúthe national tattoo.‚Äù George Bush, president of the U.S. at the time, received the first copy of Cundin‚Äôs engraving. The second went to King Juan Carlos of Spain. The work is now displayed in many prestigious collections, including that of the United States Congress, the Society Daughters of the American Revolution, and the University of Virginia.

Early years Fernand Jean-Baptiste Dubief was born on 14 October 1850 in Varennes-l√®s-M√¢con, Sa√¥ne- et-Loire. His father was a Republican and was deported after the 2 December 1851 coup by Napoleon III. Dubief received his secondary education in M√¢con. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he served in the Arm√©e de la Loire. He obtained a diploma as a doctor in 1875. Dubief was medical director of the lunatic asylum of Saint-Pierre in Marseille from 1886 to 1893, and later was superintendent of the Rhone asylum in Lyon. He became a Freemason, and sat on the Council of the Grand Orient, the central Freemasonry authority in France. Political career In 1893 Dubief was elected mayor of Roman√®che-Thorins and was also elected to the Sa√¥ne-et-Loire departmental general council. In the general elections of 20 August 1893 he was elected in the first round as deputy for the first district of M√¢con. He sat with the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist group. Dubief supported strong measures against strikers. When a private bill was introduced in 1897 to grant amnesty to arrested strikers, Dubief wrote that the bill \\"would have no other result than to undermine the workings of justice, to the great damage of respect for the laws.\\" Dubief was reelected in the general election of 8 May 1898. He was secretary of the assembly from 1898 to 1900. On 27 April 1902 he was reelected in a landslide. In 1905 Dubief was chairman of the Radical Socialist group, president of the Commission du Travail, and regarded as an expert of labor issues. Under Maurice Rouvier he was Minister of Commerce, Industry, Posts and Telegraphs from 24 January 1905 to 12 November 1905. On 13 July 1905 Dubief presented a bill requiring ongoing vocational education in the workplace for young workers. This bill was eventually passed in 1919 under the name of Placide Astier. Dubief was responsible for a law that was approved on 8 October 1905 which established a special tariff of medical fees for accidents to working men. After a cabinet reshuffle Dubief was Minister of the Interior from 12 November 1905 to 14 March 1906 under Rouvier and then Armand Falli√®res. During his ministry the separation of the church and state was adopted in December 1905 despite the strong opposition of Pope Pius X. He was succeeded as Minister of the Interior by Georges Clemenceau, the prime minister for the next three years. In 1906 Dubief was elected mayor of the commune of Priss√©. Dubief tried to make the point that the mentally ill were suffering from a disease, and should therefore be helped and protected by the state. Some of his statements reflected the poor state of understanding of the time. Thus he said in 1907 that epileptics should be isolated because people who were vulnerable to the disease might be infected by their cries. However, he also thought that an epileptic might not be mentally ill. Dubief lost his seat as deputy in the general elections of 1910 to a Radical Socialist opponent, but was reelected in the first round on 26 April 1914. Ferdand Dubief died at the age of 65 on 4 June 1916 in Asni√®res-sur-Seine, Seine.

It premiered on Eleven on 1 September 2015. The episode was written by series producer Jason Herbison and directed by Declan Eames. It is Neighbours first three-hander in its thirty-year history. Typically episodes of the show feature the ensemble cast and multiple on-going storylines. \\"Episode 7202\\" focuses on the conclusion to a long-running love triangle between Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) and Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). Herbison hoped the episode would be memorable for viewers, while Gamblin was grateful that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall were trusted enough with it. Kendall thought the love-triangle was the perfect storyline to use the three-hander style and Elmaloglou said the consequences would be felt for a long time within the show. The episode was filmed in early June 2015. It is set in just two of the six houses on Ramsay Street. The actors described the filming schedule as \\"pretty busy\\" and a \\"collaborative effort\\". The episode was preceded by an online bonus scene titled \\"Before Dawn\\". \\"Episode 7202\\" received a positive reception from television critics, with one calling it \\"an ambitious move\\" and another dubbing it a \\"landmark episode\\" for the show. For his work on the episode, Herbison earned an AWGIE Award for Best Script for a Television Serial. Plot After spending the night together, Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall) and Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) discuss how things have changed between them. At Number 22, Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) wakes up on the sofa alone and stares at an empty wine glass. Lauren asks Brad what he and Terese argued about and he tells her that Terese has not been attending her AA meetings. Lauren then tells him that their night together does not have to go any further, but they agree to tell Terese, even though it could spell the end of the Willis's marriage. As he returns home, Brad finds Terese pouring a bottle of wine down the sink. She admits that she has a drinking problem and is willing to change. Terese then visits Lauren to ask for phone numbers of counsellors. Lauren calls Brad to tell him they can not reveal their affair to Terese. However, Terese receives an email containing aerial photos of the neighbourhood and she sees a picture of Brad and Lauren kissing. Realising that her husband has begun an affair, a devastated Terese returns to Number 32. Terese baits Lauren with questions about Brad until Lauren realises that Terese knows. Brad sees the email and returns to Lauren's home where Terese throws a jam jar at him. In the garden, Terese forces Lauren to admit that she has had feelings for Brad since they were reunited two years ago. Terese believes the affair has been going on for a while, and tries to find proof on Lauren's phone. She pushes Lauren into the swimming pool during the struggle. Brad goes after Terese and tries to explain that he and Lauren were going to tell her. Brad begs Terese to keep her appointment with the councillor, while she tells him to leave. Brad goes back to Lauren and asks if she meant what she said about having feelings for him for all that time. She says yes and gives him an ultimatum ‚Äì try to work out a relationship with her or save his marriage to Terese. After leaving a sketch of Brad that Lauren drew on the lawn of Number 32, Terese calls her son and asks him to bring everyone home. Production Conception and development Kip Gamblin was grateful for the chance to be a part of the show's first three-hander. On 18 August 2015, David Knox of TV Tonight reported that Neighbours would be airing their first three-hander ‚Äì an episode that features just three characters ‚Äì on 1 September. The show's episodes usually feature an ensemble cast with multiple on-going storylines. While Knox observed that it is uncommon for an Australian drama to focus on so few actors. \\"Episode 7202\\" centres on the conclusion to a love-triangle storyline that has been running since 2013, with Brad Willis finally choosing Lauren Turner over his wife Terese. The episode is set in just two houses on opposite sides of Ramsay Street, and the scenes deal with three of the five stages of grief: denial, anger and bargaining. The show's series producer Jason Herbison wrote the episode, and he hoped that it would be memorable for viewers in the future. He admitted to being worried about how the actors would react to the script, explaining \\"I was a bit nervous when I broke the news of the episode to Kate, Kip and Rebekah. Filming an entire episode with no other cast is a big call in fast-moving serial television. However, all three embraced the challenge and delivered some of their best performances ever.\\" Gamblin was grateful to the producers for trusting that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall could carry such an important episode. He told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap \\"Usually we get three or four scenes, so to have a whole episode to ourselves was good ‚Äì even though there were a lot of lines to learn!\\" Kendall expressed her amazement that a three-hander had not been done before, but believed the love triangle was the perfect storyline to use the style. She felt excited about the script when she received it and branded the plot \\"really interesting\\". Kendall told Carena Crawford of All About Soap that it was a challenge to find the much needed depth and subtlety for the scenes. \\"Episode 7202\\" was preceded by an online bonus scene called \\"Before Dawn\\", which featured Brad and Lauren discussing their feelings for each other after they had sex. Gamblin admitted that he was not surprised to learn Brad and Lauren would finally give into their feelings for one another. He believed many fans of the show had wanted Brad and Lauren to get together from the moment the Turner and Willis families arrived in 2013. Ellis observed that it was \\"inevitable\\" that they would reunite at some point. Brad and Terese's marriage was tested multiple times, but things came to a head when Terese's alcoholism and Brad's lack of sensitivity to her feelings began affecting their children. After Brad and Lauren's one-night stand, Gamblin said Brad felt guilty, but he also wanted to be honest and tell Terese to \\"minimise the damage\\". Elmaloglou thought the consequences of the episode would be felt for a long time afterwards, and that some \\"interesting dynamics\\" would also develop between the families. Filming The episode was filmed in early June 2015. Gamblin described the filming schedule as \\"pretty busy\\", while Elmaloglou called it \\"a real collaborative effort\\". For the scene in which Terese throws a jam jar at Brad, Elmaloglou was told to aim for Gamblin's head and he would get out of the way. Gamblin said that if he had failed to duck in time, she would have hit him across the face. The actors had two chances to get the take right as there were only two jam jars available for the scene. Kendall told an Inside Soap columnist that the stunt where Terese pushes Lauren in the pool could only be shot once, as it would take too long to dry out their hair and clothes. She explained \\"so we knew what the money shot was, and worked everything else up towards that.\\" Kendall and Elmaloglou were unable to hear Eames call out \\"cut\\", so they continued \\"really going at it\\" resulting in the final take. Reception \\"Episode 7202\\" was watched by 222,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making Neighbours the tenth highest rated show on digital multi-channels that night. This was an increase of 25,000 viewers from the previous nights episode. Upon its broadcast in the UK on 15 September, the episode was seen by 764,000 viewers at 1.45pm and 597,000 at 5.30pm, an increase on the previous days episode. Herbison received the Best Script for a Television Serial accolade at the 2016 AWGIE Awards. Television critic Melinda Houston of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the episode, saying \\"it's an ambitious move for both the writer and actors ‚Äì and it really works.\\" She gave it three and a half stars out of five. A reporter for the same publication branded the episode \\"special\\" and observed that \\"both the script and the performers are tested when the whole half-hour is given over to one storyline and three players\\". They singled out Kendall's performance as being particularity good, saying she \\"delivers scenes that transcend the genre.\\" Knox (TV Tonight) noted that the actor's \\"commitment together with the unique approach is what separates this from other episodes. Fans will doubtless look back on this as one of the more memorable stories.\\" Katie Baillie from the Metro branded the episode \\"dark and tense\\". Michael Cregan of Inside Soap included the episode in his \\"5 top soap moments\\" feature when it aired in the UK. Carena Crawford of All About Soap dubbed it a \\"landmark episode\\". While a Soap World reporter named it \\"Best Special Episode\\" during their feature on the highs and lows of soap operas in 2015. The reporter wrote that the \\"tense and gripping scenes\\" kept viewers watching.

Hagel (born December 20, 1933) is an American realist and impressionist painter and sculptor. His artwork depicts Native Americans, trappers, and wildlife of the western American frontier. For the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial, he completed a corporate commission of a dozen paintings, three of which appeared in Smithsonian magazine's coverage of the Expedition. His paintings, known for their authenticity, are found in private as well as corporate art collections across the country and some have been selected for display by the U.S. State Department in American embassies abroad. Early life Hagel was born on December 20, 1933 in Kalispell, Montana, the son of Frederick A. Hagel and Winona Hagel (n√©e Popham). Hagel's father, who was originally from Salmon, Idaho, worked as a sawyer in the white pine forests of Montana and Idaho and later worked for the U.S. Forest Service and opened up a tanning business specializing in white buckskins in Kalispell in 1929. The tannery‚Äîwhich is still in operation today‚Äîhas been operated by Hagel's son Michael since 1976. As a young man Frank worked in the tannery and also engaged in ranching, logging, and construction. After serving in the U.S. Navy (1952‚Äì55) during the Korean War, Hagel used the G.I. Bill and attended the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, California, graduating in 1959 after studying illustration. In May 1954, Hagel married Kalispell native Ethel Irene Houston who would die young at age 31 on November 28, 1967 in Ferndale, Michigan, due to a brain tumor. Born to the couple were three sons: Scott, Michael, and Jack. Career After college graduation Hagel moved to Detroit, Michigan, where from 1959‚Äì70 he worked as a commercial artist for three Detroit art studios and produced illustrations for all major Detroit ad agencies and the big three auto manufacturers. From 1959‚Äì61 he worked for Allied Artists, was at Lebeau Studios, Inc. from 1962‚Äì64, and thereafter worked for Graphic Productions, Inc., all of Detroit.

Hartzog, Jr., director of the National Park Service, awarded a contract to the Kalispell firm of Roche Jaune Inc. to produce a series of 37 medals, called the ‚ÄúNational Parks Centennial Series‚Äù, that depict a scene in each of America's national parks. The medals were struck by the Medallic Art Company of New York City. At the time, Hagel was serving as the vice president of Roche Jaune Inc. In 1974‚Äì75 he completed a series of five medals for the Montana Bicentennial and in 1989 completed a Montana statehood centennial medal. Painting While involved in sculpting medals early in his career, the bulk of his lifetime work has been in painting where he specializes in works depicting genre scenes of American Indians‚Äîparticularly those from the Pacific Northwest‚Äîas well as trappers and wildlife. A large number of his paintings feature the Piegan Blackfeet tribe. His Trapper with Bull Boat (2010), a 30x40 inch oil on canvas, sold in 2010 for $14,040 at the Coeur d'Alene Art Auction.

Thebaud (October 24, 1859 ‚Äì April 2, 1939) was an American businessman, sportsman and philanthropist in the Gilded Age. After working for C. H. Raymond & Co., a contractor of the Mutual Life Insurance Company, for a dozen years, he was caught in a corporate scandal and sued alongside other members of his family. In his retirement, he sponsored sailing races and supported the First World War effort as well as a hospital in New Jersey. Additionally, he introduced Britanny spaniels, a breed of hunting dogs, to the United States, and he was the founding president of the American Brittany Club. Early life Louis A. Thebaud was born on October 24, 1859, in Orange, New Jersey. His parents were Paul Louis Th√©baud and his first wife, born Mathilde Louisa Pillot. He was of French descent. The Th√©baud family, who were members of the French nobility, had emigrated to the United States in the wake of the French Revolution, where they ran an import-export business. His great grandfather was Joseph Thebaud and his grandfather Edward Thebaud. Business career Thebaud worked for C. H. Raymond & Co. from 1893 to 1906. The firm, headed by Charles H. Raymond, was a contractor for the Mutual Life Insurance Company, whose president was his father-in-law. In 1906, Thebaud was sued by the company alongside his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and Raymond, over a corporate scandal. As early as 1905, the press revealed he was paid between $920,113 and $932,831 in commissions by Mutual life. The scandal was described by The Washington Post as a prime example of nepotism. Thebaud served on the Board of Directors of the Morristown Trust Company. Philanthropy Thebaud and his wife made charitable contributions to the American Field Service in France during the First World War. They also supported an all girls' school in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, Brittany, France. Additionally, they donated US$200,000 to the All Souls Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, US$100,000 of which were donated specifically by his wife. They also donated an ambulance in 1930. Boating and hunting Thebaud sponsored the Gertrude L. Thebaud, an American schooner named in honor of his wife, in 1930. It won the Lipton Trophy in 1930. Thebaud first imported griffons, a breed of hunting dogs, to the United States. Later, he introduced the Britanny spaniel, another breed of hunting dogs, to the United States. Thebaud used Britanny spaniels on his quail hunts in Florida. Meanwhile, two of his dogs, Franche de Cosqueron and Genette du Mesnil, were recorded in the Field Dog Stud Book. Additionally, his dogs competed in field trials and dog shows. Thebaud and Louis de la Fleche co- founded the Brittany Spaniel Club of North America (later known as the American Brittany Club) in 1936. Thebaud served as its first president. Personal life In November 1886, Thebaud married Gertrude Lee McCurdy, the daughter of Richard Aldrich McCurdy, president of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. The couple resided at Idlewild, a mansion in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1905, McCurdy acquired a 300-acre estate in Morristown, New Jersey from B.O. Canfield in 1905, tore it down, and commissioned the construction of a new mansion called Beauregard. Gertrude died on November 24, 1930, and Th√©baud married Andr√©e des Etangs on April 26, 1933. There were no children of either marriage. Thebaud was a co-founder of the Whippany River Club, a millionaire's club in Morristown, alongside Robert McCurdy, R.H. Williams, Rudolph Kissel, Gordon McDonald, Benjamin Nicoll, Robert D. Foote, Norman Henderson, Arthur R. Whitney, Frederick O. Spedden, W. DeLancy Kountze, Francis H. Kinnicutt.

Immuno-oncology, part of the broader field of cancer immunotherapy, involves agents which harness the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Traditionally, patient responses to new cancer treatments have been evaluated using two sets of criteria, the WHO criteria and the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). The immune-related response criteria, first published in 2009, arose out of observations that immuno-oncology drugs would fail in clinical trials that measured responses using the WHO or RECIST Criteria, because these criteria could not account for the time gap in many patients between initial treatment and the apparent action of the immune system to reduce the tumor burden.  Background  Part of the process of determining the effectiveness of anti- cancer agents in clinical trials involves measuring the amount of tumor shrinkage such agents can generate. The WHO Criteria, developed in the 1970s by the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization, represented the first generally agreed specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. These criteria were first published in 1981. The RECIST criteria, first published in 2000, revised the WHO criteria primarily to clarify differences that remained between research groups. Under RECIST tumour size was measured unidimensionally rather than bidimensionally, fewer lesions were measured, and the definition of 'progression' was changed so that it was no longer based on the isolated increase of a single lesion. RECIST also adopted a different shrinkage threshold for definitions of tumour response and progression. For the WHO Criteria it had been >50% tumour shrinkage for a Partial Response and >25% tumour increase for Progressive Disease. For RECIST it was >30% shrinkage for a Partial Response and >20% increase for Progressive Disease. One outcome of all these revisions was that more patients who would have been considered 'progressors' under the old criteria became 'responders' or 'stable' under the new criteria. RECIST and its successor, RECIST 1.1 from 2009, is now the standard measurement protocol for measuring response in cancer trials. The key driver in the development of the irRC was the observation that, in studies of various cancer therapies derived from the immune system such as cytokines and monoclonal antibodies, the looked-for Complete and Partial Responses as well as Stable Disease only occurred after an increase in tumor burden that the conventional RECIST Criteria would have dubbed 'Progressive Disease'. Basically, RECIST failed to take account of the delay between dosing and an observed anti-tumour T cell response, so that otherwise 'successful' drugs - that is, drugs which ultimately prolonged life - failed in clinical trials. This led various researchers and drug developers interested in cancer immunotherapy such as Axel Hoos at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) to start discussing whether a new set of response criteria ought to be developed specifically for immmuno-oncology drugs. Their ideas, first flagged in a key 2007 paper in the Journal of Immunotherapy, evolved into the immune-related response criteria (irRC), which was published in late 2009 in the journal Clinical Cancer Research.  The criteria  The developers of the irRC based their criteria on the WHO Criteria but modified it: * Measurement of tumour burden. In the irRC, tumour burden is measured by combining 'index' lesions with new lesions. Ordinarily tumour burden would be measured simply with a limited number of 'index' lesions (that is, the largest identifiable lesions) at baseline, with new lesions identified at subsequent timepoints counting as 'Progressive Disease'. In the irRC, by contrast, new lesions are simply a change in tumour burden. The irRC retained the bidirectional measurement of lesions that had originally been laid down in the WHO Criteria. * Assessment of immune-related response. In the irRC, an immune-related Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all lesions, measured or unmeasured, and no new lesions; an immune-related Partial Response (irPR) is a 50% drop in tumour burden from baseline as defined by the irRC; and immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) is a 25% increase in tumour burden from the lowest level recorded. Everything else is considered immune-related Stable Disease (irSD). The thinking here is that even if tumour burden is rising, the immune system is likely to 'kick in' some months after first dosing and lead to an eventual decline in tumour burden for many patients. The 25% threshold allows this apparent delay to be accounted for.  Evidence of usefulness  The initial evidence cited by the creators of the irRC that their criteria were useful lay in the two Phase II melanoma trials described in the Clinical Cancer Research paper. The drug being trialled was a monoclonal antibody called ipilimumab, then under development at BMS with Axel Hoos as the medical lead. The drug targeted an immune checkpoint called CTLA-4, known as a key negative regulator of T cell activity. By blocking CTLA-4, ipilimumab was designed to potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. In the Phase IIs, which encompassed 227 treated patients and evaluated patients using the irRC, around 10% of these patients would have been deemed to have Progressive Disease by the WHO Criteria but actually experienced irPRs or irSDs, consistent with a response to ipilimumab. The Phase III clinical failure of Pfizer's tremelimumab anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, which competed with ipilimumab, provided the first large-scale evidence of the utility of the irRC. The Pfizer study used conventional response criteria, and an early interim analysis found no survival advantage for the treated patients, leading to the termination of the trial in April 2008. However within a year of this development, Pfizer's investigators were beginning to notice a separation of survival curves between treatment and control groups. Tremelimumab's competitor, ipilimumab, which was trialled in Phase III using the irRC, went on to gain FDA approval in 2011, indicated for unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, after a 676-patient study that compared ipilimumab plus an experimental vaccine called gp100 with the vaccine alone. The median overall survival for the ipilimumab+vaccine group was 10 months versus only 6.4 months for the vaccine. Marketed as Yervoy, ipilimumab subsequently became a blockbuster for BMS.  Key people  The 2009 paper which described the new irRC had twelve authors, all associated with the ipilimumab clinical trials used as examples - Jedd Wolchok of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Axel Hoos and Rachel Humphrey of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Steven O'Day and Omid Hamid of the Angeles Clinic in Santa Monica, Ca., Jeffrey Weber of the University of South Florida, Celeste Lebb√© of H√¥pital Saint-Louis in Paris, Michele Maio of University Hospital of Siena, Michael Binder of Medical University of Vienna, Oliver Bohnsack of a Berlin- based clinical informatics firm called Perceptive Informatics, Geoffrey Nichol of the antibody engineering company Medarex (which had originally developed ipilimumab) and Stephen Hodi of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

He has founded Solo Capital, a hedge fund firm which closed in 2016, and Autism Rocks, a charitable organization that raises awareness for autism. Shah is a prime suspect in a case regarding the Danish Government being allegedly defrauded of 12.7 billion DKK for (1.65 billion euros) between 2012 and 2015, part of the CumEx-Files involving multiple European nations and involves a number of the world's largest banks such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Macquarie Bank and Deutsche Bank. Shah has admitted his company legally enabled clients to legitimately reclaim around DKK 8 billion from the Ministry of Taxation. He claimed innocence, as the trade was legal and claimed that he was only using legal tax loopholes, where dividend income is taxed differently in various jurisdictions. Career Shah worked as a banker for Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Rabobank \\"over a period of almost 20 years and ‚Äì after finding himself unemployed in 2008 ‚Äì set up his own investment management, brokerage and principal trading business\\". He founded the hedge fund firm Solo Capital in London, which employed \\"more than 100 financial experts across offices in London and Dubai\\". Shah was investigated in regards to tax fraud and Solo Capital closed in 2016, amid the investigation by Danish authorities, while his London home and offices were raided by the British National Crime Agency, and Varengold Bank (co-owned by Shah) was raided by German authorities. Danish dividend tax fraud allegations In 2010, in an audit report, the Danish Ministry of Taxation was found to have ignored warnings on multiple occasions of a legal tax loophole concerning dividend tax. This was two years before Sanjay Shah's company Solo Capital enabled clients to be paid more than 8 billions of DKK in tax refunds. In June 2018, Denmark's Ministry of Taxation filed awikifiedinaim in the UK High Court of Justice, claiming it had been the victim of fraud, conspiracy, dishonesty and unjust enrichment. Since 2015, Shah has been the prime suspect in a case regarding the Danish Government being allegedly defrauded of 12.7 billion DKK (1.65 billion euros) which was exposed in the CumEx-Files. Shah was investigated in regards to the case in 2015. The alleged tax fraud took place between 2012 and 2015 and is the largest in the history of Denmark. Shah is also the prime suspect in similar alleged tax fraud cases involving more than 200 millawikifiedin Belgium and 65,000 euros (580,000 NOK) in Norway respectively. An additional 300 million euros in Belgium and 40 million euros (350 million NOK) in Norway were only stopped, because of warnings from the Danish authorities. In addition, he is being investigated since 2016 by Germany and the UK via Eurojust, and by the US Treasury Department, as it is suspected that some of the money were funneled through US pension funds. As of December 2016, about 300 million euros had been seized by the Danish police in cooperation with foreign police forces. In 2017, two suspected co-conspirators were also charged by the Danish authorities. In September 2018, a High Court of Justice judge in London entered a $1.3 billion default judgment against two UK companies, Solo Capital Limited and Elysium Global (UK) Limited, which were no longer in Shah's control, at the behest of the Danish tax agency SKAT. The claims against these companies were not defended, hence the default judgment. In the same month, finans.dk, a subsidiary of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, reported that assets in Elysium Global and Elysium Properties, two of Shah's companies, had been frozen.Advokater: Svindelmist√¶nkte Sanjay Shah er ved at l√∏be t√∏r for penge, finans.dk, 5 September 2018. and that Danish authorities have filed cases against him in the Dubai International Financial Centre Courts as well as the Commercial Court in London.

As of September 2019, the total number of Danish indictments against persons and companies involved in the tax fraud scheme has risen to 476 with projected legal costs of 2.4 billion Danish kroner. In May 2020, the Tax Minister Morten Bodskov announced that the fees paid to lawyers was USD350 million, and that 250 new employees had been added to the Tax Office to address massive failures in control. In September 2019, the authorities have so far found no evidence of fraud in the UK, Germany or Denmark. In November 2019, British and Danish authorities reached an agreement that the main prosecution against Shah should take place in a Danish court of law, and both countries support his extradition from Dubai to Denmark.Udbytteskandalen: Shah skal retsforf√∏lges i Danmark, DR News, 15 November 2019. Extradition of a suspect from the United Arab Emirates has been described by a Danish expert as 'almost impossible' due to reciprocity as UAE implements death sentence for certain crimes and Denmark can't do this due to human rights concerns. As of 2019, Shah has denied any wrongdoing. In papers lodged in London's High Court as part of a civil case brought by the Danish tax authority SKAT, Shah's lawyers rejected the allegations against him. A 204-page defence statement said: \\"Solo Capital Partners, Mr Shah's firm, provided clearing services for clients to engage in lawful and legitimate trading strategies that were conducted at all times in accordance with Danish law: doing so was neither dishonest nor unlawful. ‚ÄúThis case has caused significant embarrassment to SKAT and to the Danish government generally, particularly because dividend arbitrage trading is a widely known and wholly legitimate trading strategy. ‚ÄúOther European governments have taken steps to limit such trading activity. Skat is attempting retrospectively to amend Danish fiscal law and to cover up or remedy Skat's earlier failure to limit such trading activity and thereby attack the defendants, who have done nothing dishonest nor illegitimate.\\"Dubai resident fights Denmark over ¬£1.5 bn tax fraud allegations 12 June 2019 The National (Abu Dhabi) The Danish Prosecutor interrogated Shah in Abu Dhabi over three days in a voluntary interview in September 2019. As of February 2020, it was reported that Denmark had not brought any criminal charges against Shah. Personal life Shah is married and has 3 children. In 2009, he moved to Dubai \\"after falling in love with the city\\". His youngest son, Nikhil, was diagnosed with autism in 2011. After working with therapists and medical experts for 3 years, he decided to raise awareness about autism and in 2014 founded Autism Rocks in 2014.

He created a total of 127 public sculptures. On the occasion of his crafting more public sculptures than any other artist in Finland, the September 7, 1984 issue of Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat bore the headline \\"Sculptor Ensio Sepp√§nen, is a Finnish record man\\". Sepp√§nen was granted an artist's pension in 1985. He belonged to a small group of artists able to provide livelihoods for themselves and their families by their art without grants. He made his last public sculpture at the age of 81, in 2005. Sepp√§nen's parents were the carpenter Kaarlo Sepp√§nen, and Martta Sepp√§nen (n√©e J√§rvinen). He married Tyyne Sepp√§nen (n√©e Korhonen) in 1958. They have two children, Timo and Keijo. Production Sepp√§nen's sculptures are cast in bronze and granite, molded in various ways, and formatted with stainless steel welding. A characteristic feature of the sculptures is that the accessories and tools have a historically correct look. Most of the works are custom orders. In addition to public works, he had made a limited number of tomb sculptures, reliefs, memorial stone plans, portraits, medals, plaques and figurines for individuals, as well as designed sports and NGO flags and hand programs. Many of his sculptures are associated with war memorials and historic events. His memorial sculpture Kvenmonumentet (Immigrant's Monument) in Vads√∏, Norway, was unveiled in 1977 before three heads of state: the Norwegian and Swedish kings and the President of Finland. Most of Sepp√§nen's monuments are located in the north of Finland, Sweden and Norway. A multi-talented artist, he designed and drew 13 buildings, some of which are located in Sweden, and was involved in the design of the Dunder 2060 snowmobile.

He was the oldest surviving son of the Hon. Charles Law QC who had 10 children. Law succeeded to the title on the death of his uncle, Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough, in 1871. He was educated at Winchester College and joined the British Army in 1844. He reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the 6th Regiment of Foot. In 1885, Charles Law assumed, by royal licence, the additional surname of Towry. Family Law married four times: firstly in 1840 he married Lady Eleanor Cecil Howard (daughter of William Howard, 4th Earl of Wicklow, and Lady Cecil Hamilton), who died in 1852. Secondly in 1855, Anna Elizabeth Fitzgerald-Day, daughter of the Reverend John Robert Fitzgerald-Day of Beaufort, County Kerry, who died in 1860, leaving a son Charles. Thirdly, in 1863, Isabella Ogilby, daughter of Alexander Ogilby,; she died in 1874, and fourthly Beatrice Joanna Knatchbull, daughter of Sir Norton Knatchbull, 10th Baronet, in 1874; she died in 1931.Kidd, Charles (editor), Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage 2015, p. 419. Lord Ellenborough died in 1890, leaving his surviving wife and three children by former marriages--namely, Charles Towry-Law, 4th Baron Ellenborough, who succeeded to the title, and two daughters, Gertrude and Emily Law. All three became absolutely entitled to a considerable amount of property, but Charles and Gertrude were of unsound mind and in weak health. Emily Law came of age in 1893, and under the circumstances she was advised to make a voluntary settlement of her property and expectancies. Accordingly, on 22 December 1893, she executed a deed by which she declared trusts of a large sum of stock which she had previously transferred into the names of the trustees, and by the same deed she granted and assigned to them all the real and personal estate to which in the event of the death of her brother and sister respectively she might become entitled under his or her will of as heiress-at-law of next of kin. The trusts of the settlement were to pay a small annuity to her stepmother, and subject thereto for herself for life with usual remainders over. Gertrude Law died in 1895 intestate and a spinster, whereupon one half of her personal estate devolved upon her sister, and was in pursuance of the settlement handed over to the trustees. In 1902 Charles Towry, Lord Ellenborough, died intestate and a bachelor, and letters of administration to his estate were granted to his sister, Emily Law, who was his heiress-at-law and sole next of kin. Emily Law was not desirous of bringing any further property into the settlement, and she now applied by originating summons, in the matter of Lord Ellenborough's estate and in the matter of the settlement for the determination of the question whether her interest as heiress-at-law and sole next of kin was effectually assigned to the trustees, and whether she bound to assign or transfer such interest. The Chancery Division of the High Court considered the case in 1903 and held that the trustees of the settlement could not compel Emily to hand over the property to the trustees.

Description Zeugopterus punctatus is a small left-sided flatfish that is almost completely round in shape, with a broad body relative to its length. It is a mottled brown and white colour, a dark bar through the eyes, light wide fins all the way round its body and a very small tail. Unlike most other flatfish, the Zeugopterus punctatus does not seem to change colour for camouflage but relies on immobility to avoid detection. Zeugopterus punctatus grows to a maximum length of about 25 cm. It is sometimes confused with the lemon sole Microstomus kitti which can be found on rocky substrates too but has a noticeable pattern on its back, does not have such long fins and is a more pointed shape. The eyed side is covered in small ctenoid scales while the blind side has cycloid scales, the many small ctenoid scales feel downy to the touch. Distribution The eastern Atlantic Ocean including the North Sea, Baltic Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay south to the coast of Portugal. Biology This species lives along coastlines. It is unusual among European flatfish in that it prefers a rocky substrate. It has the ability to remain immobile in the most surprising sites, holding on to vertical rocks or even upside down under overhangs. This is achieved by using its broad fringing fins to fit itself into the substrate. Spawning takes place between February and June.

Its margin is entire and it differs from Fucus serratus in not having a serrated edge and unlike Fucus vesiculosus it does not have air vesicles, however irregular swellings gives it a resemblance to F. vesiculosus. Fucus spiralis has spirally twisted fronds.Newton, L. 1931. A Handbook of the British Seaweeds. British Museum, LondonHardy, F.G. and Guiry, M.D. 2003. A Check-list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. British Phycological Society Distribution Fucoids have no planktonic dispersal stages, restricting gamete dispersal. They can be found on the shores of Ireland and Great Britain including the Isle of Man and Shetland. Habitat Fucus ceranoides is restricted to estuarine intertidal habitats under fluctuating salinities. The modern distribution of Fucus ceranoides ranges from Portugal to Norway and Iceland. This includes the rocky shores in the littoral generally where fresh water flows into the sea, brackish water in sheltered bays.

He played basketball for the Kilsyth Cobras and the Sherbroke Suns before suffering a serious accident in 2011. He began playing wheelchair basketball in 2013, and was selected for the national team (the Rollers) in 2014. That year he was part of the team that won the 2014 Incheon World Wheelchair Basketball Championship. In 2016, he represented Australia the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Biography  Joshua Allison was born on 27 March 1986. He has a Certificate III in bricklaying from the Holmesglen Institute of TAFE in Moorabbin, Victoria, and has three children named Keeley(11),Willow(8),Hudson(3). Some tall, he played basketball for the Kilsyth Cobras in the Victorian League from 2004 to 2006, and in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) from 2006 to 2007, and for the Sherbrooke Suns in the Big V league from 2008 to 2010. On 1 October 2011, he fell through a hand rail at his home in Croydon, Victoria. He suffered severe injuries, including fractures in his neck and back, and crushing his spinal cord, rendering him paraplegic. The news came as a profound shock to his fellow players, who played a fund-raiser game for him on 5 February 2012. During his rehabilitation, Allison took up wheelchair basketball in 2013, taking to the court to play for the Kilsyth Cobras once more, this time in the National Wheelchair Basketball League (NWBL) as a 1.0 point player. Wrist bands were sold, and a boot camp and an online auction held to raise money for an $8,000 basketball wheelchair. The Cobraswent on to win the NWBL championships in 2015 and 2016. He made his international debut with the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team (known as the Rollers) in April 2014 in a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium. Later that year he was part of the Rollers team that won gold at the 2014 Incheon World Wheelchair Basketball Championship. In June 2016, he toured Great Britain for the 2016 Continental Clash against Canada, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States. The Rollers were defeated by the United States, and won silver. In 2016, he was selected for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. He was one of five Rollers selected for their first Paralympics where they finished sixth.

She teaches Women's Intellectual History and is one of world's foremost scholars on eighteenth-century feminist intellectual Mary Hays and her circle. Walker's core focus is recovering the lost contributions of historical women. In 2015 Walker partnered with the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum to direct Project Continua, a website devoted to female biographies. Her latest work in regaining women displaced from the historical record is The New Historia, a project that is part-encyclopedia and part-virtual reality and uses three- dimensional mapping to create new ways of interacting with female networks and intellectual contributions. Her collaborator on this project is information architect Lisa Strausfeld, and together their vision is to create a \\"Google Earth for knowledge.\\" Professor Walker previously held faculty appointments at Rutgers University and Sarah Lawrence College.  Biography  Walker received her Ph.D. in 18th century Literature at New York University where she was given the Founders‚Äô Day Award for doctoral studies. These included discovery of primary documents by and about Hays in private hands, now part of The Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at The New York Public Library. Her areas of research include the history of learned women, women and Rational Dissent, late Enlightenment Feminisms, and women's autodidactic production of new knowledge. Professor Walker is a Member of the International Advisory Board, UDC International Doctoral School, Universidade Da Coru√±a, Spain and on the Advisory Editorial Board, Enlightenment and Dissent, Dr Williams's Centre for Dissenting Studies, Queen Mary University of London. She is actively involved in encouraging new Wikipedia encyclopedia articles on historical women and is an authority on historical encyclopedias.  Early life and education  Walker completed her undergraduate work at Barnard College and earned her master's degree at Columbia University. At Columbia, she intended to study the writer Jane Austen, placing her in the intellectual spectrum of the late Enlightenment. The Graduate Student Advisor discouraged her by saying that ‚Äúthere was nothing more to be learned about Jane Austen.‚Äù Walker ultimately published her thesis on the personal writings of James Boswell‚Äì‚Äìusing his recently discovered journals as source material‚Äì‚Äìas viewed through the prism of Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1943). Her advisor praised her thesis but told her she was ‚Äútoo pretty to bother with a Ph.D‚Äù and that she should ‚Äúgo home and get married.‚Äù Greatly discouraged, she nevertheless applied to New York University to pursue doctoral research. She intended to study ‚Äúa highly self-conscious woman on the margins of the late Enlightenment.‚Äù Kenneth Neill Cameron (1908‚Äì1994), the Oxford-trained scholar and expert on Percy Shelley, became her advisor. Unlike her previous academic experience, Cameron agreed that she could study Jane Austen. However, Cameron first encouraged her to visit the New York Public Library's Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection, of which he was the founding Director, as ask to see what information was available about Mary Hays.  Mary Hays  After researching the available material on Mary Hays in the Pforzheimer Library, Walker received a grant to meet with the owner of Hays‚Äô private correspondence in London. The owner of the letters was reluctant to share them because Hays had been a controversial figure during her lifetime. Her writing was criticized for questioning the inequality of the sexes, and she was personally attacked for pursuing knowledge (historically a male occupation) and being homely. In 1800, Samuel Taylor Coleridge referred to her as ‚Äúa Thing, ugly and petticoated.‚Äù On the last day of her visit, the owner of the letters permitted Walker to view the 115 private letters to and from Hays in correspondence with Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Mary Shelley, Robert Southey, Eliza Fenwick and others. Walker felt a complicated relationship with Mary Hays: ‚ÄúWhile I wanted to understand, empathize with, and defend Hays, her authorial self was so unlike the wise, steady persona presented by Austen‚Äôs narrators that had inspired me, that I, too, could not warm to her. She was angry, self-pitying, narcissistic, filled with resentment and yearning. Her unquiet spirit struggled against the tide of responses to her as unlovely, abrasive and unlovable, confirmation that no respectable man would want her. Studying Hays seemed to take me further away from the apparently safe, hallowed shores of the Canon. I felt adrift; as an uncredentialled female autodidactic, Hays offered no safety.‚Äù In 1972, Walker was awarded a doctorate for her work on Mary Hays. Hays' biographies of historical women struck Walker; she wondered why Hays would undertake such a project, a departure from her earlier philosophical work. Mary Hays had been a close friend of early feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. When Wollstonecraft passed away from complications of childbirth in 1797, Hays mourned her death by compiling biographies of 302 iconoclastic women. She wrote as a way to channel her pain and fortify herself by documenting the accomplishments of great female thinkers of the past. It was one of the earliest instances of feminist historical recovery. Hays‚Äô instinct to document the lives of neglected historical women would inspire the course of Walker's career.‚Äù  Academic work   Female Biography Project  In 2009, the Chawton House Library‚Äì‚Äìan estate once owned Jane Austen‚Äôs brother that now supports the recovery of early women‚Äôs writing‚Äì‚Äìcommissioned Walker to reproduce Mary Hays‚Äô Female Biography; or, memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women from All Ages and Countries (1803). Walker's edition was published in 2013 and 2014 by Pickering & Chatto. In order to recreate Hays‚Äô work with proper annotation, Walker established a network of 200 scholars, representing 120 institutions in eighteen countries, who collaborated to burnish the ‚Äúfemale biographies‚Äù of the women Hays included. These scholars, working under the name Female Biography Project, recovered historical material about previously lost women.  Project Continua  Project Continua launched in 2012 as the online compendium to the Female Biography Project. Scholars realized they had surpassed Mary Hays‚Äô source material yet continued to uncover female philosophers and intellectuals who were lost to history. The goal was to create a public, multimedia resource dedicated to the preservation of women's intellectual history from the earliest surviving evidence into the 21st Century. \\"There have always been women producing knowledge and contributing to human understanding and participating in the great events and new ideas of their time,\\" said Gina Luria Walker in an interview. \\"Most of whom have been ignored, trivialized, or written out.\\" The project features biographies and references to additional source material for scholars interested in conducting further research. Walker partnered with the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum to direct Project Continua. Walker and the scholars initially believed they were supplementing the traditional historical canon with new information‚Äì‚Äìhence the name Project Continua‚Äì‚Äìbut as the scope of previously unknown and suppressed material came to light, they renamed their effort The New Historia.  The New Historia  Having exhumed biographical information about and philosophical writing by thousands of previously lost historical women, Walker and the scholars felt apprehensive about publishing their findings in traditional formats. They feared their research would follow a trajectory common to historical women: initially their stories would be included in publications, then treated anecdotally, and eventually lost and neglected, repeating the established treatment of women in history. There is a saying in gender studies called ‚Äújust add women and stir;‚Äù the premise being, that if stories of a few great women are added to the traditional canon, history is now ‚Äúinclusive.‚Äù The truth is that with this approach the traditional, male-dominated history isn't challenged in any way‚Äì‚Äìit's still the same narrative and interpretation, and over time, the women will disappear from the narrative. On this note, Walker states: ‚ÄúMore women wrote texts and contributed to society in the past than we can possibly believe. They left evidence of their lives and then disappeared; sometimes they were resurrected, only to be buried again. Their work was lost through either intentional destruction or neglect, leaving a void of women‚Äôs historical invisibility. Our work today is reconstructing the lost knowledge of women‚Äôs ideas and productions. If we persist in only studying women through the prisms of male-knowledge ordering systems, old inaccuracies will remain, and history will continue to ignore past female thinkers and actors and their transformative responses to the obdurate presence of historical misogyny.‚Äú To create an entirely new approach feminist history, in 2018 Walker partnered with Information Architect Lisa Strausfeld to showcase the data she and her scholars had unearthed. The result was the Cooper Engine‚Äì‚Äìnamed after Strausfeld's late mentor, Muriel Cooper, a digital designer and co-founder of MIT's Media Lab. The Cooper Engine is an immersive, three-dimensional timeline that charts the course of each woman's life as it spreads through the decades. Users can move forward and backward in time‚Äì‚Äìlike a Google Earth for learning‚Äì‚Äìexploring each woman's work, publications, and networks of relationships. Instead of historical data about women being relegated to a handful of written pages‚Äì‚Äìwhere it risks being lost, yet again, in the traditional historical narrative‚Äì‚Äìusers step inside the data, into a new dimension of learning and knowing historical women. A searchable digital platform connects modern women with their mostly unknown foremothers who were female groundbreakers of the past. The project is still in its early stages.  Wikipedia  Disturbed by the gender disparity of Wikipedia's content, Walker started an Edit-A-Thon in 2015 to train more women as Wikipedia editors. Wikipedia is the Internet's largest source of free information, yet less than ten percent of Wikipedia editors are women, and only six percent of experienced editors are women. This is reflected in the site's content which is distorted in favor of men's contributions to science and philosophy. ‚ÄúHistorically, Wikipedia may not be that different from the very first encyclopedias, which developed as a way for educated men to communicate with each other and create foundational knowledge‚Äù said Gina Luria Walker during an interview with The Atlantic. \\"Around 150 men contributed to the great encyclopedia of the Enlightenment, Walker pointed out, but no women did. The very first version of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, written between 1768 and 1771, featured 39 pages on curing disease in horses, and three words on woman: 'female of man'.\\" In particular, Wikipedia suffers from an age-old sexist tendency, that of defining a woman by her relationship status with a man. ‚ÄúThe pages that do exist about notable women are more likely to mention their gender and relationship status than articles about men.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere needs to be a conscious collaborative determination by women, including girls, that we want to know about women of the past, we want to have access to our foremothers, and that we want to revise history,‚Äù Walker said. ‚ÄúEvery time a woman is denied the full weight of what she has achieved, it is a loss for all of us,‚Äù Walker said.  Women and textiles  Looking for ways women created and produced knowledge and influence outside the traditional narrative, Walker studies the history of women and textiles. Textile production has historically been a trade associated with women. New translations of Bronze Age texts reveal women were central to global trade since antiquity‚Äì‚Äìnot only in manufacturing cloth but in running textile empires. Ancient women owned wealth and property independently of their husbands. However, their work was not considered ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù because it was done inside the home.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. The historic district includes 65 properties that were part of a 2012 to 2013 survey of the area. It also includes as contributing properties the buildings in the West Jefferson Street Historic District and three buildings in the Manufacturing and Wholesale Historic District that were previously listed on the National Register. All total there are 122 resources within the district, which includes 108 contributing and 14 non-contributing properties. The downtown area developed in three periods. The first period (1865-1894) was an era of prosperity associated with the development of the city's railroad connections after the American Civil War. The second period (1895-1929) was an era of maturity and the development of modern commercial buildings. This is the time period when Burlington's \\"tall\\" downtown buildings were built. The third period (1930-1967) saw competition from suburban development, especially in West Burlington. There were efforts to retain old businesses and attract new ones, while modernizing and improving the area. The inclusion of West Jefferson Street was important because it was the main thoroughfare in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the Hawkeye Creek Valley. It led from the central business district along the Mississippi River to the Agency Road that headed westward out of town. For the most part the buildings in the district housed commercial enterprises, both retail, banking and professional offices. The government buildings are, for the most part, located elsewhere. The taller buildings are located on the east side along Jefferson Street and the adjacent blocks. Most of the buildings are three to four stories, with the tallest buildings rising eight to nine stories. There are also numerous one and two story structures. The buildings are mostly brick. The older buildings from the first period tend toward the Italianate and the Romanesque Revival styles. The taller, more modern buildings of the second period tend to utilize the Neoclassical style, and the buildings in the third period are in the more simplified modern styles.

It is a Smith truss bridge, built across the San Lorenzo River in 1872 by the California Powder Works, an explosives manufacturer whose factory complex stood on the river banks. The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015 as one of the best-preserved national examples of the Smith truss. It is owned and maintained by the Paradise Park Masonic Club, and is open to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, with a posted weight limit of 5 tons. Description and history The California Powder Works Bridge is located about north of downtown Santa Cruz, spanning the San Lorenzo River just downstream of Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. The bridge carries Keystone Way, a private road in the residential development known as the Paradise Park Masonic Club. It is a single span, with a total structure length of and a span length of . Its total width is , and it has a roadway width of . Its trusses are built out of Douglas fir, and its roof is corrugated metal. The exterior is clad in vertical board-and-batten siding. The bridge was constructed by the Pacific Bridge Company, its major elements manufactured at a plant in Alameda, and was installed in 1872. It was built for the California Powder Works, whose main manufacturing plant was on the east side of the river. The company operated on that site between 1863 and 1914, after which the site was largely demolished and abandoned. The property was purchased by a Masonic organization from Fresno, and developed as a summer colony they dubbed \\"Paradise Park\\". The bridge is one of 23 known historic (pre-1955) examples of a Smith truss remaining in the United States, and is the longest and among the best-preserved of those, as determined by a nationwide survey conducted by the National Park Service. This truss type was marketed on a nationwide scale by the Smith Bridge Company, and was briefly competitive with iron bridges, which were coming to predominate in the landscape.

Since then, there have been reports of this species in North and South America, Australia, and the Caribbean islands. Information regarding the species' general life cycle and egg development can be seen in the Trichuris page. Morphology and relationship to T. campanula During the early 1900s, many considered the only legitimate feline whipworm species to be T. serrata. However, another feline whipworm species known as T. campanula was also discovered. Whipworms of T. serrata are slightly bigger than those of T. campanula. Male and female lengths of T. serrata are 40 and 48mm respectively, while their T. campanula counterparts are 20.5 and 31.5mm respectively. However, the eggs of T. serrata are marginally smaller than those of T. campanula. The egg morphologies of both species are identical and have a light brown color and a lemon shape. Despite the size difference, studies have discovered that the best form of differentiation between the two species can be seen in the anatomy of their females. In 1975, it was discovered that female organisms of T. serrata have a fingerlike projection from the vulva while their T. campanula counterparts have two longitudinal lips on that sex organ. Both have a bacillary band, although based on the original description that of T. serrata is more obvious than T. campanula Treatment and diagnosis There are no clinical symptoms associated with whipworm infections in felines. Diagnosis of cats with these infections is usually through fecal flotation and an ELISA antigen test. To treat them, veterinarians recommend feeding the cats 50 mg/kg of fenbendazole once a day for three days. Although they are very infectious between cats, there are no recorded cases of T. serrata infecting humans.

Together with the tonalli and the ih√≠yotl was one of the three strengths that brings life and health to the humans. It was the part of the human being considered as the one that trascended to afterlife to different realms according ones way of death. After the Spanish conquest the term was assumed by Spaniard translators as equal to the word ¬´√°nima¬ª and ¬´alma¬ª (soul), which have some reminiscences in current expressions among modern indigenous.  Etymology  The nahuatl word teyol√≠a incorporates the prefix ¬´te-¬ª and the substantive ¬´yol√≠a¬ª. The particle ¬´te-¬ª is an indefinite pronominal prefix that indicates possession, so when it is placed before a noun it can be translated as ¬´of somebody, of another, of the people, of some¬ª. The noun ¬´yol√≠a¬ª contains the root ¬´yol¬ª meaning ¬´life¬ª, consequently it can be translated as ¬´that what makes to live¬ª. All together the word teyol√≠a might be translated as ¬´what makes to live the people¬ª. It is related etymologically with the word ¬´yollotl¬ª, used to describe the heart.  Description  According to the Aztec thought the teyol√≠a was an animic entity that gives life to the human beings located in the heart and, therefore, inside every person's chest. Related with the half part of the cosmos. In addition to the vitality it was attributed it to be the source of knowledge, tendency, affections, passions, memory and will. The Aztecs believed that after dead the teyol√≠a was the part of the man that separated from the body remained immortal. The teyol√≠a remained some days on the surface of earth be carried afterwards to one of any different destinations in which the Aztecs believed. The final destination of the teyol√≠a was determined by every person's way of dead. The teyol√≠a of the warriors, for example, was carried to the sun realm (nepantla tonatiuh) where they turned into beautiful birds. Among the modern indigenous peoples the term is used in some deformed ways as ¬´yol√≠a¬ª, ¬´yolo¬ª, ¬´teyolotl¬ª, ¬´I:l¬ª, ¬´yuhlu¬ª, ¬´I:ll(or)¬ª; or, by means of Spanish terms ¬´alma¬ª, ¬´√°nima¬ª or ¬´esp√≠ritu¬ª.

Education  Adrien Segal attended California College of the Arts in San Francisco, CA for her undergraduate degree, receiving a BFA in Furniture Design in 2007.  Career  In her creative practice, Segal is a data sculptor who works with physical materials that reflect the ebb and flow of water in various manifestations. She often works with wood and metal, and she has a background in furniture design. She is interested in drawing attention to environmental changes though art. In order to create her pieces, she employs a combination of hand sculpting and technology, finishing pieces by hand. Her work has drawn from data from national water consumption statistics, 30 years of annual snowfall levels, and tidal patterns in the San Francisco Bay. She uses this scientific research to create physical sculptural forms that evoke a sensory experience to engage dialogue about changes in our natural environment. Segal has exhibited work at the Richmond Art Center, Biblioteca Henestrosa in Oaxaca, Mexico, the Oakland Museum of California, and Ballroom Marfa in Texas. Her work has also been published in several books. Segal has held Artist Residencies at Oregon College of Art and Craft in Portland, the Bunnell Art Center in Alaska, and the Lucid Arts Foundation in Northern California, and Autodesk's Pier 9 Workshop in San Francisco. She was CCA's Wornick Distinguished Visiting Professor of Wood Arts in 2015 and has held visiting artist positions at San Diego State University, Oregon College of Art and Craft, and the University of the Arts. In addition to teaching, she pursues a creative practice out of her studio on the former Naval Base in Alameda, California. Segal's work is included in the permanent collection of the Center for Art in Wood. Tidal Datum of Kachemak Bay, a sculpture by Segal, commissioned by the City of Homer, AK  Projects  Tidal Datum  Scientific American has described Segal's Tidal Datum as \\"spectacular\\" with \\"unbeatable beauty and wonder.\\" This piece was inspired by Sutro Baths, a seaside bathhouse located in San Francisco established in the 1920s where waters change with the tides. In order to create this piece, Segal used data obtained from the tide charts of the San Francisco Bay from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the 29-day lunar cycle of in the months of April and May in 2006. As a result of this project, she has been inspired to create other pieces displaying the tide patterns of the Louisiana coast and of Homer, Alaska. Segal's 2006 Tidal Datum Table was featured on the cover of the book 500 Tables.  Snow Water Equivalent Cabinet  Drawing on snow survey data collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Service collected from 1980-2010 in the Western US and Alaska, this project looks at the change in snow water equivalent over time. Each drawer of the cabinet varies in depth and height based on the amount of snow water for a given year.

Notable individuals Canadian Clara Brett Martin became the first woman lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy dispute with the Law Society of Upper Canada, which argued‚Äìunsuccessfully‚Äìthat only men could become lawyers. At the end of the nineteenth century, Canadian women were barred from participation in, let alone any influence on or control over, the legal system‚Äìwomen could not become lawyers, magistrates, judges, jurors, voters or legislators. Clara Brett Martin (1874 - 1923) became the first female lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy debate in which the Law Society of Upper Canada tried to prevent her from joining the legal profession. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1891, Martin submitted a petition to the Law Society to become a member. Her petition was rejected by the Society after contentious debate, with the Society ruling that only men could be admitted to the practice of law, because the Society's statute stated that only a \\"person\\" could become a lawyer. At that time, women were not considered to be \\"persons\\" in Canada, from a legal perspective. W.D. Balfour sponsored a bill that provided that the word \\"person\\" in the Law Society's statute should be interpreted to include females as well as males. Martin's cause was also supported by prominent women of the day including Emily Stowe and Lady Aberdeen. With the support of the Premier, Oliver Mowat, legislation was passed on April 13, 1892, which permitted the admission of women as solicitors. Helen Kinnear (1894 ‚Äì 1970) was a Canadian lawyer who was the first federally appointed woman judge in Canada.

During that period she employed a nanny to care for her children, and deducted the wages paid to the nanny as a business expense on her personal income tax return.

Symes appealed to the Federal Court, which ruled that the expenses were valid and legitimate business expenses. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), which ruled in Symes v. Canada [1993] that her childcare expenses were not deductible as business expenses. Jody Wilson-Raybould is Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. *Marie Henein is a Canadian lawyer.

This is because in ancient chronicles and documents the members of the same family were sometimes cited as Saenz or Saez, so it is sometimes considered to be the same surname. The Saenz house name appears on the work of Joseph Maria Mena, \\"Surname Shields of Seville and Cordoba that went to the Indias\\". The surnames of Seville come mostly from the two hundred knights of lineage that recaptured Seville in 1248, accompanying the king San Fernando. These name is from a pre-invasion of Spain by the Moors, that is, going back to Visigoth period (7th to 9th century). Its origin is cited in the mountains of Santander, but also had lineage in Vizcaya, La Rioja and Navarra. What does appear clear is the enormous difficulty for joint research to those patronymic surname (habitation surname) derived from large families that carry no kinship links between them. In the mountains of Santander there are two houses of this lineage, \\"Nestares\\" place in 1545 and the \\"de Rozas\\", in 1590. Both duly proved their nobility. Another family named Saenz de Larramendi had the Legaria house in Navarra. A family stood in Riaza, Segovia, proving its nobility in the Royal Chancery of Valladolid. As an example of Saenz there is the quote of a character from the American line, Manuela Saenz, a politically absolutist regent that was a minister of state and regain power from Fernando VII that appointed him minister but had to be forcefully taken out of power by external representatives because of to the intensity and toughness that was dedicated to pursue liberal elements. The family owns land in the village of Calera, Valle de Carranza and Valmaseda (Vizcaya). Also its power spread to Guipuzcoa, Alava and Navarra, emanating from another house of Solar, in the town of Carazo, represented in the Salas de los Infantes (Burgos). With the discovery of the New World there were many men and women who crossed the Atlantic in search of new horizons and specifically those bearing the surname Saenz, extended their lineage to America. So after our research in the Archivo General de Indias, which contains the names of passengers who traveled the New World, we find that Juan Saenz, scribe, a native of Viguera, single, son of Juan Perez and Maria de Sotes, left to Charcas, providing services to the Doctor Juan Saenz, 10 January 1592. The name Oiza appears collected by the Chronicler King of Arms, Don Vicente de Cadenas and Vicent, in his \\"code of arms of the Hispanic Community\\", that means that the lineage has an official and certified coat of arms. Thousands of coats of arms are also part from various sections of the National Historical Archive, as well as the Royal Chancery of Valladolid, Hijodalgos and Vizcaya, etc. In summary, the name Oiza has done some testing of nobility.

From 1951 until his death, he was the owner of Reporter Publishing Company, which published the Sun-Reporter, the California Voice, and seven other regional African-American weeklies in Northern California. Goodlett maintained a busy medical practice in his newspaper office until his retirement from medicine in 1983. Early life He was born in Chipley, Florida, to Fannie T. Russ and Arthur Goodlett, and later migrated to Omaha, Nebraska. He was the youngest of two children. His sister's name is unknown, but when she was 5 and Carlton was 3 years old, her dress caught fire from the embers from the home's fireplace, and the house subsequently caught on fire too. She managed to get Carlton out but did not herself survive. Goodlett was a very precocious child, often following his sister to school, being too young to attend. The teacher turned him away repeatedly, until she decided to take him seriously, and let him stay. Education He received a bachelor's degree in 1935 from Howard University in Washington, D.C., and in 1938 he became one of the first African Americans to earn a doctorate in psychology from the University of California at Berkeley, at the age of 23. In 1944, he completed his Doctor of Medicine degree at Meharry Medical College in Nashville. Career Returning to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1945, he opened a medical practice to serve the burgeoning new black community drawn by the war industries. At the same time, he emerged as an civil rights advocate. As president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1947‚Äì49, he protested The City's discrimination against hiring blacks for its public transportation system, demanded improvements in public housing, and exposed the exclusion of blacks and Jews from draft boards in San Francisco. The Reporter In 1948 he became co-owner of The Reporter, a community weekly edited by his old friend Thomas C. Fleming, which then absorbed its competitor, The Sun, to become The Sun-Reporter. In 1951 Goodlett became sole owner. He wrote most of the editorials and established it as the leading black newspaper in Northern California. In 1971 he added Oakland's California Voice and seven Metro-Reporters to his chain. He served three terms as president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association (Black Press of America). By the late 1950s, through a constant barrage of speeches before community groups and the growing influence of his newspaper, Goodlett had become one of the city's most prominent black leaders. Using his combined newspapers to become a political force in San Francisco, Goodlett cultivated friendships with leading black entertainers, artists and politicians, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Dick Gregory. Medicine One problem that black physicians encountered in San Francisco was their inability to practice in any of the local hospitals. They could send their patients to the hospital but lost them at the hospital door, where black doctors were barred from following through with their patients' treatment. Under Goodlett's leadership, all nonwhite physicians won the right to see patients at all public hospitals in the City. Goodlett was also a businessman who developed town houses, open to all San Franciscans, on Steiner Street and Geary Boulevard. Goodlett retired from medical practice in 1983. Political activism In 1950, Goodlett, along with Phillip Burton and others, founded the San Francisco Young Democrats. Until Phil Burton's death in 1983, Goodlett was one of his closest allies. Phil Burton became a member of the California State Assembly and later a powerful member of Congress. Burton's brother, California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton, credited Goodlett as being \\"singularly responsible\\" for initially electing Phil Burton to office. Both Goodlett and Phil Burton strongly supported Willie L. Brown Jr. for a California Assembly seat in 1962. Goodlett named him the Sun-Reporter Man of the Year and financed his $7,500 campaign. Brown narrowly lost that time, but won in 1964, and went on to become Speaker of the Assembly for more than 14 years, a state record. Later Brown served eight years as Mayor of San Francisco. He was frequently and sharply critical of his Democratic friends, such as President John F. Kennedy and Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown, for not moving fast enough on civil rights and other causes. In 1966 Goodlett ran for governor himself as a protest against Pat Brown. He finished third out of six candidates in the Democratic primary, with 95,000 votes. Until the emergence of the Black Panther Party in the late 1960s, Goodlett was the dominant figure in San Francisco's civil rights movement in securing jobs for African Americans and appointments to important city commissions that blacks had never held. Goodlett was arrested in 1968 while supporting a strike by San Francisco State University students who demanded a Black studies department. The students won, and the University became the first in the nation to have a Black studies program. Positions and memberships In the early 1960s he joined the World Peace Council, a coalition of over 120 countries, then headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. He was a member of the presidium, and traveled the globe to encourage progressive and communist causes, sometimes meeting with heads of state. He was chairman of the board of the communist William L. Patterson Foundation, and was once turned away from England because of his leftist politics. Along with Martin Luther King Jr., Goodlett was one of the first prominent African Americans to publicly oppose the war in Vietnam. He was just as critical of his communist friends, refusing to sign a condemnation of the United States for the Vietnam War at the Communist World Peace Conference at Helsinki because it didn't go far enough. In 1970, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Medal by the Soviet Union. Like many well-known San Franciscans, Goodlett's reputation was tarnished somewhat by his close association with the Reverend Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple. He was Jones' personal physician and published his church's newspaper. In November 1978, Jones committed suicide in Guyana with more than 900 followers. Goodlett later said, \\"You don't need glasses for hindsight. Everybody is running like hell away from Jim Jones now, but none of us knew at the time.\\" Late life and legacy When he became incapacitated from Parkinson's disease, he continued dictating or writing many of the paper's editorials, holding political meetings in the office, and guiding the direction of his newspapers. \\"The black tail is never going to wag the white dog,\\" he once said, \\"But if we live in the belly of the beast, we can cause quite a bellyache.\\" In June 1994 Goodlett left San Francisco to spend his last years under the care of his son Dr. Garry M. Goodlett, in Cumming, Iowa, where he died in 1997. On January 29, 1997, San Francisco's then-Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. issued a statement: \\"It may be the single biggest loss that the black community and the progressive community has ever suffered in San Francisco. Dr. Goodlett was the pioneer on equal rights, equal opportunity, political action, entrepreneurship, and economic independence. He was truly a renaissance person.\\"press statement by San Francisco Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr., January 29, 1997 On January 18, 1999, following a unanimous vote by the 11-member San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the official address of San Francisco City Hall was changed to 1 Carlton B. Goodlett Place. The name appears on the street sign for two blocks of Polk Street and on all stationery, business cards, and mail to and from the building.

Penny has been active within the Olympic movement since joining Turner Broadcasting in 1989 as a research manager for the 1990 Goodwill Games. In 1991, Penny became the director of media and public relations for USA Cycling and eventually became managing director of the United States Cycling Federation, which oversaw the amateur road and track cycling disciplines. Penny left USA Cycling in 1996, returning to his hometown of Seattle to become Vice President of Bob Walsh Enterprises, focused on business development in conjunction with sports marketing, events, media and consulting. Penny was accused by former Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu of being at the forefront of USA Gymnastics ignoring the abuse of gymnasts. She called for his resignation. USA Gymnastics responded by saying that Penny was a leader in ensuring the safety and well-being of USA Gymnastics gymnasts. While being questioned under oath, Penny testified that USA Gymnastics rarely forwarded allegations of child abuse to police or child protective services without being asked because of a belief that there was not a duty to report abuse if USA Gymnastics was a third party to abuse allegations and concern about damaging a coach's reputation if an abuse allegation was false. USA Gymnastics dismissed complaints as hearsay unless they were signed by an alleged abuse victim or a victim's parent. Officials of USA Gymnastics‚Äîwhich is headquartered in Indiana‚Äîmay have violated Indiana state law by failing to report abuse allegations. Penny resigned from USA Gymnastics on March 16, 2017. When Penny testified before Congress in June 2018 he invoked his fifth amendment rights to avoid answering questions, leading to a cry of shame from one onlooker. On October 17, 2018, the United State Marshals Smoky Mountains Fugitive Task Force arrested Penny. He is alleged to have tampered with evidence during the investigation of sexual assaults against Larry Nassar. The indictment further alleges that Penny ordered the removal of the documents from the Karolyi Ranch that were related to the activities of Nassar. If convicted, Penny faces a punishment of 2 to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. The day following his arrest, USA Gymnastics placed Penny on its \\"permanently ineligible\\" list of members \\"per the provisions in SafeSport Code for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement, III.A.4, and USA Gymnastics Bylaw 10.14(b).\\"  Personal life  Penny graduated from the University of Washington in 1987, previously attending Mercer Island High School.

It was discovered April 11, 1825 by English astronomer John Herschel. Located some 43.8 million light years away, this galaxy spans arc minutes and is seen at a low angle, being inclined by 77¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. The morphological classification of NGC 4178 is SB(rs)dm, indicating that it has a bar feature at the core, and, per the '(rs)', has traces of a ring-like structure surrounding the bar. The 'dm' suffix indicates the spiral arms are diffuse, broken, and irregular in appearance with no bulge at the nucleus. This galaxy is a member of the Virgo Cluster, which is the richest nearby group of galaxies outside the Local Group and forms the core of the Virgo Supercluster. The radio continuum emission along the galaxy's major axis is asymmetrical, being brighter in the southwestern part than in the northeast. But the overall radio surface brightness is on the low side. In the mid-infrared range, the spectrum shows indications of high ionization levels usually associated with an active galactic nucleus. However, optical observations show no signs of an active nucleus, which may just mean it is heavily obscured. Indeed, the amount of ionized matter appears to increase near the core. Although this galaxy lacks a bulge that could supply mass to a supermassive black hole, a large black hole was detected at the core by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2012. It is inferred to have a mass of around 104 to 105 times the mass of the Sun. This makes it one of the lowest mass nuclear black holes known. In May, 1963, supernova SN 1963i was discovered in this galaxy by G. V. Zaytsheva at the Konkoly Observatory in Budapest. It was suspected of being a Type Ia supernova eruption, but this remains unconfirmed.

Before, between and after his terms as grand vizier, he served numerous posts as governor of various provinces and districts throughout the empire. As grand vizier, he commanded the Ottoman ground forces against the French Army in the Ottoman reconquest of Egypt and later served as a commander in the Ottoman wars with the Russian Empire. Biography K√∂r Yusuf's date of birth is not known. He was of Georgian origin. As a result of an accident while playing javelin he was blinded in one eye, hence his name K√∂r (\\"Blind\\"). K√∂r Yusuf was known for his fatalism and piety, as well as for being a competent commander.Aksan 2014, p. 238. K√∂r Yusuf started his career as a government clerk then as an intendant of mines.Salzmann 2004, p. 169. He was promoted to the rank of vezir and was appointed governor of Diyarbekir Eyalet in 1793, then Erzurum Eyalet in 1794 and Childir Eyalet and Trabzon Eyalet in 1796. Grand Vizier K√∂r Yusuf was appointed grand vizier on 25 October 1798 during the sultanate of Selim III. He was involved in the affairs of both the central government and the peripheral provinces. During his first term, he and his sons, Mehmet Beg and Sabit Yusuf Beg, purchased numerous tax farms in Diyarbekir Eyalet, and K√∂r Yusuf also owned a half-share of the copper refinery in the city of Diyarbekir. In 1799, K√∂r Yusuf was assigned command over an Ottoman ground force mobilized at √úsk√ºdar to reassert Ottoman control over Egypt and drive out French forces who occupied that province during the French campaign in the Ottoman Empire.Aksan 2014, p. 231. In the initial mobilization, K√∂r Yusuf's army consisted of 15,000 troops,Aksan 2014, pp. 235‚Äì236. but after recruiting soldiers from Aleppo and Damascus, the number grew to 25,000 by the time the Ottoman army reached Egypt from its marshaling point in Gaza. Arnauts formed the largest component of K√∂r Yusuf's forces, and were prone to revolt. Other components included a 5,000-strong cavalry and a contingent of Janissaries. In January 1800, K√∂r Yusuf signed the Convention of al-Arish with French general Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber and British admiral Sidney Smith, which called for the evacuation of French forces from Egypt. However, conflict resumed and Kl√©ber's forces defeated the Ottoman Army and allied Mamluk forces at Heliopolis in March. Kl√©ber was assassinated in mid-June, and after victories by the Ottoman-British alliance, the French were defeated by December 1801. When K√∂r Yusuf entered Cairo he had Christians accused of collaborating with the French executed or exiled, and seized large amounts of wealth from them. He remained in Cairo to dispatch the amir al-hajj to command the Hajj pilgrim caravan to Mecca. After sorting some of Egypt's affairs in the aftermath of the French withdrawal, K√∂r Yusuf departed Egypt for Syria. On 21 April 1805, K√∂r Yusuf resigned from the office of grand vizier and for a time remained in seclusion in his home. Later political career K√∂r Yusuf was appointed for a second term as governor of Trabzon in March 1807. In September he was appointed the governor of Baghdad and Basra eyalets, and Konya and Aleppo in October. In 1808 he was appointed a second term as governor of Erzurum and was given the high-ranking post of »ôark seraskeri (Commander-in-Chief of the East) making him responsible for all of the Ottoman military forces in the Diyarbekir, Sivas, Trabzon, Malatya, Marash, Chorum and Mosul eyalets (provinces). K√∂r Yusuf performed well against Russian Empire forces at Akhalkalaki. K√∂r Yusuf was appointed a second term as grand vizier in 1809 during the sultanate of Mahmud II. During his second term, he led efforts against the Russians in the Rumelian (southern Balkans) front for two years. He was dismissed as grand vizier on 10 May 1811. He was appointed governor of Chios Sanjak in 1817, after having been appointed as commander of Eƒüriboz Sanjak in 1815. K√∂r Yusuf died in Chios island in 1819 and was buried at the tomb of Sheikh Ilyas on the island, today a part of Greece.

Early life and education Goode was born on September 13, 1818, in Virginia to the slave Judith Goode and a white man. She met another slave, Albert Royal Brooks, and taught him to read and write so that they could write passes to see each other. When her master died in 1838, she became the property of a man named Sublett. That same year, she joined the First Baptist Church of Richmond. Shortly after Goode became Sublett's property, he allowed her to marry Brooks on February 2, 1839 and allowed them to live together. Albert's owner allowed him to operate a livery stable, for which he collected rent, but also permitted Albert to keep his additional earnings and use them to buy his freedom. In 1841 when the Baptist church divided, she was one of the group that joined in forming the First African Baptist Church. Career When Sublett died in 1858, his heirs threatened to sell Lucy and her children to different masters. She was able to negotiate with merchants who purchased her children and allowed them to live with her as long as they showed up for work daily. The sole exception was a daughter who was sold to owners in Tennessee. The knowledge that they could be separated made the Brookses work hard to try to buy the freedom of Lucy and the children. Her new master, Daniel Von Groning, who also owned her three youngest boys, allowed Albert to pay for their freedom in installments. It took four years, but on October 21, 1862, their deed of manumission was signed. The older three boys were not freed until the Civil War was ended. The loss of her daughter and a previous son‚Äîwho had been sold away as an infant‚Äîmotivated Brooks to try to help children who were separated from their parents, after the war had ended. The Freedmen's Bureau initially offered temporary rations and care for abandoned children, but by the fall of 1865 increasingly tried to shift the burden to local relief efforts and benevolent societies. Brooks, who was a leader of the Ladies Sewing Circle for Charitable Work, convinced the other ladies to help organize an orphanage. She then gained the support of several churches, including the local Quaker congregation to help found the Friends' Asylum for Colored Orphans. The plan was approved and building's location was authorized by the city council in 1867, with the orphanage opening two years later. The organization is still operational and functions as the Friends Association for Children, though its current focus is to provide childcare and family support services to low- and moderate-income families. Brooks died on October 7, 1900 in Richmond, Virginia, and she was buried in the Mechanic's Cemetery of Richmond. She was honored in 2008 by a Virginia Historical Marker being erected at the corner of Charity and Saint Paul Streets. A book about her life was published in 1989.

It is a shrub, similar to others in the genera Eremophila and Myoporum but is unusual in that it produces very large amounts of sticky, sweet-smelling resin produced by raised glands which cover the entire plant, except for the petals. It has been suggested that the resin traps insects which the plant uses as a source of nitrogen.  Description  Glycocystis beckeri is a compact, rounded shrub sometimes growing to a height of with branches which have many raised glands producing large amounts of sticky, sweet smelling resin. The branches are often black due to the presence of fungus. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide and lance- shaped with the narrower end towards the base. The edges of the leaves are serrated and their surface is covered with large numbers of small, raised resin glands. The flowers are arranged singly or sometimes in pairs in the axils of leaves on a stalk long . There are 5 narrow, pointed sepals which have similar glands to the branches and leaves. There are also 5 petals joined at their bases, forming a bell-shaped tube. The petal tube is white apart from inside the tube and the lower lobe which are white with yellow blotches. The tube is long with lobes of slightly different lengths. There are 4 short stamens which extend slightly beyond the petal tube. Flowering occurs throughout the year, especially after rain and is followed by fruits which are dry and winged when mature. Taxonomy and naming Glycocystis beckeri was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae as Eremophila beckeri from a specimen collected by George Maxwell in rocky hills near to the Phillips River. The genus name (Glycocystis) is from the Ancient Greek words Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œçœÇ (glyk√Ωs) meaning \\"sweet\\" and Œ∫œçœÉœÑŒπœÇ (k√Ωstis) meaning \\"a cyst\\" or \\"bladder\\" referring to the sweet smelling resin produced by the glands on many parts of this species. The specific epithet (beckeri) honours the artist, naturalist and explorer Ludwig Becker.  Distribution and habitat Glycocystis beckeri occurs near Ravensthorpe in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in pebbly clay loam. Ecology It has been suggested that the production of large amounts of sweet resin by this plant may be an adaptation to attract and trap insects which may in turn provide the plant with nitrogen in a similar way to that employed by plants in the South African genus Roridula. Conservation Glycocystis beckeri is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

During World War II, the company gained substantial experience in the design and construction of tanks and continuous track vehicles. After the war they developed a civilian crawler tractor that could be sold for use in peacetime reconstruction work. It was notable for the unusual sophistication of its chassis. The Vigor was built at the Scotswood, Newcastle-upon-Tyne works.  Design  1949 prototype at Vickers' Elswick Works The tractor's most distinctive feature was its running gear: four full height roadwheels also acting as rear drive sprocket, front idler and track return rollers. This was the same layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s. In common with tanks of this period, but in contrast to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, while the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite sides were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a flexible track, developed by Vickers, with rubber sealing washers between the moving parts. Wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy, a drawback to the design. Together with the sophisticated suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor was prone to throwing tracks when run at speed. Vehicle chassis was fabricated in two pieces, mainly from large iron or steel castings. The nose of early models was distinctively solid and sloped, while other makers had a vertical radiator grille. Later models, after experience in Australia, also gained a lightweight steel grille for better ventilation. The chassis unbolted relatively quickly, two hours being cited, into front (engine) and rear (transmission) components. The engine was a Rolls-Royce C6SFL 12.17l six-cylinder supercharged diesel. This engine was more powerful than other tractors of this age and weight, with 190 hp at the engine and 150 drawbar hp. However the fuel consumption was high, at 9.8 gallons per hour at full rate. The transmission was initially a three-speed manual and high-low-reverse splitter gearbox with a relatively small Borg & Beck 18 inch single plate dry clutch. This small clutch plate had a reputation for early failure if worked hard. An improvement from mid- production was the option of a Rolls-Royce hydraulic torque converter, the same converters Rolls-Royce were supplying with the same engines for the new British Rail DMU fleet. A full range of accessories were offered: front dozer blades with cable or hydraulic lifts, rear ripper blades for breaking virgin bush as farmland in Australia, and a rear logging winch of 30,000 to 50,000 lbf pull. Production of the VR180 ran from 1952 to 1958, with approximately 1,500 built. The design continued until 1961 as the Vickers VR110 Vikon with a smaller 142 hp C4SFL four-cylinder engine. Around 20 Vikon were built, most going to New Zealand.  Sales  As for most capital equipment of the early 1950s, the main market was in the Commonwealth: the UK home market could not afford it, particularly with the Austerity Purchase Tax of the time, while the US market preferred domestic products, such as the Caterpillar. Many Vigors went to Australia, where rough ground capability was appreciated, even though the purchase cost was considerably more than the popular option of war-surplus tanks with turret and roof armour cut away. A major UK seller was Jack Olding of Hatfield, who relinquished their pre-war Caterpillar dealership in favour of Vickers. Vigors were also used by the Royal Engineers. One is on display today in their museum at Gillingham, Kent.  In popular culture  The Vigor chassis became a distinctive feature of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds TV series. Many of the pod-carried land vehicles used by Thunderbird 2 such as Firefly and the carrier vehicle for The Mole were based on the Vigor. A 1/16 scale plastic model kit of the period by Victor Models of Guildford represented the Vigor; in typical Gerry Anderson style, a plastic kit that was available and affordable, but rare enough to be different and not obviously recognisable.

Gordon is a fictional character and the main character of the Warner Bros. Television/DC Comics TV Series Gotham. He is portrayed by Ben McKenzie. He is based on the character of the same name created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, that debuted in the first panel of Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Fictional character biography Season 1 Gordon is introduced as a homicide detective and Iraq War veteran who has recently been transferred to Gotham City, where he lives with his fianc√©e, Barbara Kean. As his first case, Gordon and his partner, Detective Harvey Bullock are assigned to investigate Thomas and Martha Wayne's murder. After arriving at the crime scene, he comforts the Waynes' son, Bruce, who witnessed his parents' murder, promising him that he would do everything in his power to find the murderer and bring him to justice. During his investigation, Gordon runs afoul of gangster Fish Mooney, who takes him hostage. Bullock later goes searching for him, and is captured alongside him. The two are freed by Gotham's most powerful mob boss, Carmine Falcone, who was an old friend of Gordon's deceased father. In return, Falcone asks Gordon to kill Oswald \\"Penguin\\" Cobblepot, Mooney's underling who had informed on her to the GCPD. Gordon fakes Cobbelpot's death and orders him never to come back to Gotham. After Gordon's gun is used to kill Dick Lovecraft, a corrupt billionaire, Mayor Aubrey James reassigns him to Arkham Asylum as a guard. He is later reinstated as a homicide detective by Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb after he captures a serial killer who had escaped from Arkham during a prison riot. Gordon then blackmails Loeb into naming him the President of the Gotham City Police Union. At the end of the season, he discovers that Barbara is in fact a murderer, and begins a relationship with Arkham physician Leslie \\"Lee\\" Thompkins. He is also present during a gang war between Mooney and mob boss Sal Maroni, during which Mooney and Maroni are killed, Falcone retires, and Cobblepot takes control of Gotham's criminal underworld. Season 2 After the events of the first season, Gordon is demoted to patrol officer by a vengeful Loeb. He is later reinstated as a Detective after Cobblepot blackmails Loeb into retiring and appointing Captain Sarah Essen to replace him as Commissioner. In \\"Worse Than a Crime\\", Gordon, upon realizing that there is a strong possibility that corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan will escape justice after terrorizing the city, takes him to an isolated place outside Gotham, where Cobblepot beats him mercilessly until Gordon stops him and shoots Galavan dead. In the same episode, he learns that Lee is pregnant with his child. He is later framed for the murder of corrupt cop Carl Pinkley by GCPD forensics technician Edward Nygma, and he breaks his engagement to Lee, who subsequently miscarries their child. He is later broken out by Falcone, and he chooses to stay at Gotham. He exposes Nygma for the murder of both Pinkney and forensics scientist Kristin Kringle, sending him to Arkham. Gordon eventually helps defend Gotham from the monsters that Hugo Strange has unleashed. Season 3 After apprehending Strange, Gordon leaves Bullock in charge of the GCPD and goes off to find Lee, only to discover she has moved on to a new lover, Mario Calvi, the son of Carmine Falcone. He ends up becoming a bounty hunter after he declined his reinstatement as a detective. Gordon works to hunt down a resurrected Fish Mooney in order to collect Cobblepot's bounty, although this act puts others lives at risk. After Mooney leaves Gotham, Gordon finds himself in a conflict with a crazed hypnotist named Jervis Tetch, who blames him for the death of his sister Alice. This breaks up his relationship with reporter Valerie Vale and puts him into more conflict with Lee. Tetch creates a virus that turns its victims into crazed killers and infects Calvi with it; when Calvi tries to kill Lee on their wedding day, Gordon is forced to kill him. After rethinking his life and rejoining the GCPD, Gordon discovers that his late father was a member of the Court of Owls, a secret society that has controlled crime in Gotham for centuries, and he joins it in order to bring it down from the inside. Simultaneously, Gordon is also forced to help find an antidote for Tetch's virus as it infects dozens of people, including himself, Lee, and GCPD Captain Nathaniel Barnes. He and Lee eventually come to terms with each other after the chaos subsides, and reaffirm their love for each other before Lee leaves the city once again. Season 4 Months later, Gordon watches with growing frustration as Cobblepot pledges to control the city's crime by issuing \\"licenses\\" allowing criminals to break the law as long as they agree to his \\"standards\\". The GCPD turns a blind eye, except for Gordon, who pledges to take Cobblepot down. He restores public confidence in the police by saving Bruce from Jonathan Crane and going after a masked serial killer calling himself Professor Pyg, who is killing corrupt GCPD officers. Gordon's heroics result in his being promoted to Captain of the GCPD, replacing Bullock. Meanwhile, Don Falcone's daughter Sofia returns to Gotham, and she and Gordon are instantly attracted to each other. However, Gordon eventually learns that Sofia pulled strings to get him promoted so she could have someone loyal to her running the GCPD. When Sofia instigates the murder of her own father, Gordon confronts her, and learns that she hired Professor Pyg to terrorize the city and give Gordon a chance to be a hero. She kills Pyg, and tells Gordon that he can ally with her or lose any chance he has of making Gotham safe. He reluctantly agrees to keep her secrets. Gordon renews his acquaintance with Lee, who is now running the Narrows with Nygma, her new lover. She helps Gordon take Sofia down by shooting her in the head, putting her in a coma. Lee prevents Nygma from killing Gordon, and Gordon tells her he wishes they could be together; Lee replies that it can never be. Meanwhile, Gordon's old nemesis Jerome Valeska threatens the entire city with Crane's madness-inducing laughing gas, leading Gordon and Bullock to pursue him into an underground lair, where they meet his twin brother, Jeremiah. Jerome escapes them and prepares to poison the entire city, but Gordon foils his plan with Cobblepot's reluctant assistance. In the ensuing struggle, Jerome falls to his death. However, Jeremiah - after being dosed with Crane's gas and driven insane - soon threatens Gotham City as well, with help from Ra's al-Ghul. The two criminal masterminds destroy the bridges leading out of Gotham City, turning the city into an isolated \\"No Man's Land\\". After Gotham is evacuated, Gordon resolves to stay behind, along with Bruce Wayne, to protect the city from the criminals who have taken it over. Season 5 Gordon is put in charge of the \\"Green Zone\\", the one section of Gotham that isn't controlled by criminals. To that end, he negotiates for better living conditions with government official Theresa Walker - unaware that she is really Ra's al Ghul's daughter Nyssa, orchestrating a plan to destroy the city to avenge her father's death. She sends in Gordon's army buddy Eduardo Dorrance, who declares the city in a state of martial law and tries to kill him. Gordon fights and severely injures Dorrance, but Nyssa saves his life and recreates him as the monstrous Bane. When Nyssa brainwashes Nygma into perpetrating an act of terrorism, Gordon assembles a task force to stop her - which includes Cobblepot and Nygma. Meanwhile, Gordon and Barbara have a tryst that results in her pregnancy; while Gordon wants nothing to do with her, he promises to be there for their child. After he is nearly killed during a cease-fire, he realizes that he truly loves Lee, and he proposes to her. They get married at GCPD headquarters, with Bullock officiating. When Barbara goes into labor with Gordon's child, Nyssa orders Bane to kill both her and the baby, and also tortures Gordon. He escapes, however, and leads a counter-offensive that ends when he convinces Bane's men to lay down their arms and oversees the arrest of Bane. Barbara then presents him with his newborn daughter, whom they name Barbara Lee. For his heroics, Gordon is promoted to Commissioner of the GCPD. Ten years later, Gordon is contemplating retirement when Cobblepot kidnaps him, wanting revenge; Gordon put him in Blackgate Prison shortly after the reunification of Gotham. Gordon tells Cobblepot that he is being used - by an unseen opponent who later turns out to be Jeremiah - and escapes. Soon afterward, Jeremiah kidnaps Gordon's daughter Barbara and brings her to the Ace Chemical Company, threatening to drop her into the same vat of chemicals that disfigured him. At the last moment, however, an unseen figure saves Barbara and apprehends Jeremiah. That night, the same figure - a vigilante dressed as a bat, who is secretly Bruce - apprehends Cobblepot and Nygma, and appears before Gordon and Bullock after they summon him with a signal. When Bullock asks who this figure is, Gordon smiles, and says, \\"A friend.\\" Career List of assignments * Junior Detective, GCPD Homicide (September 22, 2014 ‚Äì November 24, 2014) * Guard, Arkham Asylum (January 5, 2015 ‚Äì January 19, 2015) * Junior Detective, GCPD Homicide (January 19, 2015 ‚Äì May 4, 2015) * Patrol Officer, Gotham City Police Department (September 21, 2015) * Detective, GCPD Homicide (September 21, 2015‚ÄìPresent) * President of the Gotham City Police Union (March 2, 2015 ‚Äì May 4, 2015) * Captain, Gotham City Police Department (November 2017‚ÄìApril 18, 2019) * Commissioner, Gotham City Police Department (April 18, 2019‚Äìpresent) Ranks * Detective 1st Grade * Officer * Detective 1st Grade * Officer * Detective 1st Grade * Captain * Commissioner Partners * Detective Harvey Bullock, GCPD (September 22, 2014 ‚Äì May 4, 2015) * Officer Franks, GCPD (September 21, 2015) * Detective Harvey Bullock, GCPD (September 28, 2015 ‚Äì March 21, 2016, November 8, 2016 ‚Äì November 8, 2017, March 22, 2018 ‚Äì present) Portrayal In September 2013, it was reported that Fox was developing a TV series centred on James Gordon's early days as a police detective and the origin stories of various Batman villains.

He was a French painter, engraver and designer. Biography The son of a naval officer he studied at the \\"Tour d'Auvergne\\" school in Quimper. Mobilized during the 1914-1918 war he then studied painting under Th√©ophile Deyrolle at Concarneau. He was also influenced by Lucien Simon. He had little love of abstract painting concentrating on figurative works many depicting scenes of life in the \\"Pays Bigouden\\" and the area around Cap Sizun (Baie de Douarnenez, la baie d'Audierne, la Pointe du Raz.etc.). He painted the Breton pardons, scenes at the port and people collecting seaweed (\\"Le ramassage du go√©mon\\"). From 1923 to 1948 he worked as the registrar of Pont-Croix but continued to paint and was a leading figure in the Quimper intellectual and artistic community during these years, his friends including Jean Moulin and Max Jacob. Floch was anti- militarist, anti-clerical and anti-Gaullist. He executed portraits of both Jacob and Moulin, who both died at the hands of the Germans. Moulin died on a train on the way to a concentration camp in Germany and Jacob died at the Drancy camp awaiting deportation. In 1927, Floch showed his works at the Saluden Gallery in Brest. He then exhibited there regularly, and at the L√©cuyer Gallery in Quimper. He also exhibited regularly at the French Artists Salon and in the Autumn Salon. He was subsequently transferred as the registrar of Grasse and Chinon until finally retiring to Quimper in 1958 where he spent the rest of his life. In his final years he had a change of mind and became interested in abstract painting. Some of his works His works were numerous and include:- * \\"Un pardon en Pays Bigouden\\". He completed this oil painting in around 1934 and it is held in the collections of the Quimper Mus√©e des beaux-arts. * \\"La Cornouaille, sa mer, ses pardons, ses sites\\".

Data is from 2017. Equalization payments (, literally financial conciliation of (federal) states) are a mechanism in Germany to redistribute financial resources both between the federation and states, and between the states themselves. They are to be abolished in 2020 and will be replaced by new regulations.  Overview  Equalization payments are the most commonly known system for the redistribution of revenue in Germany and are an important tool for the financing of regional development.Chilla, Tobias, K√ºhne, Olaf & Markus Neufeld (2016): Regionalentwicklung. Stuttgart, utb. Levels of awareness are high due to public disagreements between the states; various states have taken legal actions over the allocation of payments in the Federal Constitutional Court on many occasions including 1952, 1986, 1992, 1999 and 2006.Daniel Buscher, Der Bundesstaat in Zeiten der Finanzkrise. Ein Beitrag zur Reform der deutschen Finanz- und Haushaltsordnung, Duncker & Humblot Berlin 2010, Seite 147ff. A legal action by the states of Bavaria and Baden W√ºrtemberg is pending in 2016. For many years the equalization payments have accounted for 2% to 3% of state income;Hubert Schulte, Jahrbuch f√ºr √ñffentliche Finanzen 2014,Berlin 2015, S. 381 ff. in 2015 they amounted to ‚Ç¨9.6bn compared to state and local tax revenues of ‚Ç¨306bn. The aim, as laid out in the German constitution, is to balance the differing financial strengths of the federal states. In this way all states are in the position to be able to comply with the responsibilities assigned to them by the constitution. Through this process the funding requirements of the federation and states are coordinated with the aim of agreeing equalization payments, this ensures that tax payers are not overburdened and maintains consistency in the standard of living across Germany. In order to ensure that this process guaranteed a unified budgetary policy, and to avoid the free rider problem, the federation and states budgets have been reviewed by a Stabilit√§tsrat or Stability Council since 2009. This council is a joint committee of the federal government and states, established to monitor budgetary management and adherence to European standards of budgetary discipline. Its establishment originated in the Federalism Reform II, a change to the constitution concerning the relationship between the federation and the states, and is regulated by the constitution. The State and Federal Finance Ministers, as well as the Federal Minister of Economics are all members of the Stability Council. For many years the equalization payments have opened up a gap between financially strong and financially weak states that was greatly intensified by the incorporation of the new states of Germany after reunification, with their initially especially weak economic and financial power. In 2015 only four states paid into the mechanism; Bavaria ‚Ç¨5.5bn, Baden W√ºrttemberg ‚Ç¨2.3bn, Hesse ‚Ç¨1.7bn and Hamburg ‚Ç¨112m. The biggest recipient state was the capital Berlin with ‚Ç¨3.6bn. The rural east German states between them received ‚Ç¨3.2bn with Saxony alone receiving ‚Ç¨1bn.  History of the equalization payments   German Empire  With the establishment of the North German Confederation in 1867, revenue sharing became necessary between the newly formed group of states. In Bismark's Imperial Constitution it was determined that the states would support the empire with Member States Contributions when its own income from tolls and excise duties was not sufficient. This was often the case and the federal government became financially dependent on the states.  Weimar Republic  In the Weimar constitution the relationship was reversed; according to the Weimar constitution the central government was granted legislative power and control of income and expenditure. The regionally fragmented financial administration was consolidated into a single entity and the states became financially dependent on the federal government. They basically received a proportional allocation of tax receipts divided among the states based on regional income and population. Any remaining differences in financial strength between the states were compensated for through a supplement guarantee made by the central government in accordance with state tax law (1920), which ensured that no state received less than 80% of the average state tax income. Finances in National Socialist Germany were also managed by a centralized state.  Federal Republic of Germany  In the consultations of the Parliamentary Council over the future constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany such financial dependency was to be avoided. The federation and the states should have equal rights and be financially independent of one another. With regard to a common economic region there was agreement on standardized taxes governed by federal law, a system of dividing tax income with the exclusive and concurrent legislative power of the federal parliament, financial administration shared between the federation and the states, and a system of equalization payments between the states. In practice a revenue sharing mechanism was introduced which was laid down in the constitution in 1955.  Finance Reform 1969  After years of consultation a finance reform was passed in 1969 which forms the basis of the finance element of today's constitution. Article 106 of the constitution regulates the allocation of tax revenue between the federation and the states. A revenue sharing system covering income, corporation and value added tax, the three largest taxes in terms of revenue making up around three quarters of total tax revenues, was set up between the federation and the states, the allocation ratios determined by statute. The states' share of the combined taxes is pre-determined, there is an advance adjustment of value added taxes for especially weak states, and various subsequent supplementary federal grants are also available. At the same time, the whole area of mixed financing which was constitutionally questionable was given a new constitutional basis with the introduction of common responsibilities, and provisions for payment law and federal investment support. Additionally planning elements were introduced into the constitution including middle term financial planning and law relating to budgetary principles.  Equalization payments between the states  Article 107 of the constitution regulates the horizontal payments between the states. Tax revenues assigned to a state are no longer allocated based on the location in which the tax arises, but instead based on the number of residents; so income tax revenue belongs to the state in which the resident lives and corporation tax revenue belongs to the state in which the taxable economic performance arises. An exception to this rule is a state's share of value added tax revenue; up to a quarter of a state's tax revenue can be assigned to especially weak states in advance. The equalization payments are being stepped up, the states entitled to payment adjustments should now receive 95% of the average of all states' revenue compared to 91% in the past. In hindsight the split according to place of residence disadvantages city states with their high proportion of commuters because the proportion of income tax grew especially in the first half of the 1970s due to the \\"cold\\" progression where the parameters in a progressive tax system are not adjusted for inflation and so the taxpayer pays an ever-greater proportion of income in taxes. During the 1950s income tax made up around a fifth of total tax revenue and value added tax a quarter, by 1973 income tax made up two fifths of revenue and value added tax only a sixth. Today the proportion is around a third and a quarter respectively. The residence basis provides a certain amount of compensation. The clause relating to up front value added tax adjustments, which was introduced into the constitution in 1969, gained in importance after reunification with the introduction of equalization payments for all the states in 1995. As part of the provisions of the first solidarity pact the federation allocated an extra seven percent of value added tax which flowed especially to the weaker former east German states. Owing to various legal actions individual parts of the financial constitution have been adjusted many times, but the reforms have held true for more than 40 years and have allowed the fiscal integration of the new states after reunification.

Pediobius foveolatus is in the family Eulophidae, and is the most successful biological control agent for Mexican bean beetle. This wasp only attacks beetle larvae, not eggs or adults. It is commonly used by smaller, organic growers; but is also mass released throughout the state of New Jersey, by their state department of agriculture.Stevens, L. M., A. L. Steinhauer and J. R. Coulson. 1975. \\"Suppression of Mexican bean beetle on soybeans with inoculative releases of Pediobius foveolatus.\\" Environmental Entomology 4(6): 947‚Äì952. Pediobius foveolatus was discovered in India, and is native to most of southern Asia and Japan. In its native range, Pediobius foveolatus either overwinters in host larvae, or not at all due to the lack of a cold season. In the United States, however, Pediobius foveolatus cannot survive cold winter months because all North American hosts (Mexican bean beetle and Squash beetle, Epilachna borealis) overwinter as adults, not larvae. Therefore, Pediobius foveolatus wasps die off each winter, and must be released annually in order to provide ongoing control of Mexican bean beetle or Squash beetle in the United States. Wasps are mass produced by, and can be purchased from, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture and other commercial insectaries.Angalet, G. W., L. W. Coles, and J. A. Stewart. 1968. \\"Two potential parasites of the Mexican bean beetle from India.\\" Journal of Economic Entomology 61(4): 1073‚Äì1075.Ghani, M. A. and A. I.

Female Pediobius foveolatus wasps lay around 20 eggs in a single beetle larva. Pediobius foveolatus larvae hatch within the beetle larva, and begin to feed. This eventually kills the beetle larva, causing it eventually turn brown. The dead, brown beetle larva is called a \\"mummy\\"). (Fig. 2) Adult wasps emerge from the larvae after about 15 days, mate, and search for more beetle larvae to parasitize. Pediobius foveolatus wasps will also parasitize the larvae of squash beetle, Epilachna borealis, a closely related species that feeds on cucurbit crops. Pediobius foveolatus wasps are extremely small, about 1-2mm long (Fig. 1 and 3), and will not harm humans, beneficial insects, or any organisms outside the beetle genus Epilachna.Hudson, W., G. Robbins, M. Mayer, T. Dorsey, E. Rooney, and L. Bronhard. 2013. \\"Biological control of Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis, using the parasitic wasp, Pediobius foveolatus.\\" New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Beneficial Insect Laboratory. Biological control  Mexican bean beetle \\"Mummy\\" (larva parasitized by Pediobius foveolatus) Pediobius foveolatus wasps Managing Mexican bean beetle using Pediobius foveolatus can be difficult due to its sensitivity to cool, wet weather, and the need for a release date to line up with the phenology of Mexican bean beetle larvae. Ideally, Pediobius foveolatus is released at both one and two weeks after first instar Mexican bean beetle larvae are discovered in beans. Pediobius foveolatus wasps reproduce most successfully within the older and larger beetle larvae; if older, larger Mexican bean beetle instars are present when Pediobius foveolatus is released, they will be without a host. Pediobius foveolatus is also sensitive to cold and wet weather, and are unlike to survive when released in these conditions. Wasps are generally released rate of 1000 wasps (or 50 mummies) per 3600 square feet of beans. Successful parasitism and emergence of the next generation of wasps is visibly monitored by the presence of dark-brown, dead Mexican bean beetle larvae (‚Äúmummies‚Äù). Mummies exhibit one small hole from which adult Pediobius foveolatus wasps exited.Stoner, K. A. 2002. \\"Using Pediobius foveolatus as biological control for Mexican bean beetle on organic vegetable farms.\\" Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station No. ENO22. History of Pediobius foveolatus in the United States Beginning in 1966, Pediobius foveolatus was imported to the United States to be tested for potential control of Mexican bean beetle. Initial testing determined that Pediobius foveolatus would readily parasitize the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, while leaving native, predatory coccinellids unharmed. In 1972, Maryland, then other states, began releasing Pediobius foveolatus to control Mexican bean beetle. USDA branches in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia released wasps throughout these states, focusing on areas with large soybean acreage and high Mexican bean beetle populations.Reichelderfer, K. H. 1979. \\"Economic feasibility of biological control technology: Using a parasitic wasp, Pediobius foveolatus, to manage Mexican bean beetle on soybeans.\\" USDA Agricultural Economic Report No. 430. Inoculative releases of Pediobius foveolatus yielded positive results; parasitism rates of 80 to 100% of Mexican bean beetle larvae were commonly documented near release sites. However, Steven et al. (1975) also reported slow population dispersal from these sites. Also, Pediobius foveolatus cannot overwinter in the United States due to cold winters and the lack of an overwintering host. In Pediobius foveolatus native territory, the weather either is conducive for year-round exposure, or wasps overwinter in their hosts, which overwinter as larvae. Because Mexican bean beetle overwinter as adults, wasps are without adequate winter refuge in the United States . Because Pediobius foveolatus can neither overwinter successfully nor spread rapidly, management with this wasp requires yearly releases in more locations than is practical to control of Mexican bean beetle on a large scale. By the mid-1980s, all states except New Jersey had discontinued state-run releases of P. foveolatus. At this time, pest pressure from Mexican bean beetle began its sharp decline as well, especially in soybean.Barrows, E. M. and M. E.

The book was first published in the United Kingdom in 1997 by Pavilion Books Limited and is illustrated by Michael Foreman. It was not initially planned for Morpurgo to write a sequel to War Horse, but the story was inspired after receiving many enquiries about what happens to Joey, a horse in service of the Army (the main character from War Horse) after the Great War. In an article in ChronicleLive Michael Morpurgo also stated that his favourite of his own works was Farm Boy. The book captures modern life on a farm in rural Devon, where Michael Morpurgo lives, while having retrospective flashbacks to the lives of Albert and Joey (characters from War Horse). He stated in the article in ChronicleLive: ‚ÄúI think Farm Horse because it‚Äôs about my home and because I know every lane, every hedge and every field in the book because it‚Äôs right outside my window. It‚Äôs very close to my heart and Michael Foreman‚Äôs illustrations are simply to die for. He really responded to it beautifully.‚Äù Farm Boy was republished in 1999 by Harper Collins Children's Book. Characters Main protagonist ‚Äì a young boy, who grows over the course of the story to become a young adult. He is the great-grandson of Albert. He lives in London, but often visits Grandpa over the summer and enjoys listening to his stories as well as helping him around the farm. Grandpa ‚Äì The grandfather of the protagonist and the son of Albert. He regularly tells stories to the protagonist about his life and the stories he learned of his Father. Albert/Father/Corporal ‚Äì The father of Grandpa and the original owner of Joey. He is a character from the book War Horse as well as this book. From when he first met Joey, he deeply cared about him, and went to extreme lengths to keep him safe and by his side. Albert is never referred to by his first name in the book. Instead he is either called Father by Grandpa, or the \\"Corporal\\" by townsfolk. Joey ‚Äì the younger horse owned by Albert and the main protagonist from the prequel War Horse. While the first book is narrated by Joey, Farm Boy is narrated entirely by humans, and so Joey is more realistic in a sense from this book's perspective. Zoey ‚Äì An old mare and the second horse that Albert owns. Zoey is older than Joey by about 5 years and was on Albert's farm when Albert was a child before Joey. Harry Medlicott ‚Äì A rich neighbouring farmer. In the course of the book he begins to dispute with Albert, believing that his new tractor is far superior to Albert's horses Joey and Zoey. Plot The story begins in \\"Burrow\\", a farm house in Devon where the protagonist, a young boy at the beginning of the story, visits his Grandpa. The young boy enjoys regularly visiting his Grandpa, especially during the summer, and imagining himself driving the old green Fordson tractor in the back of the barn. It is acknowledged that this tractor is very important. The grandfather tells the protagonist the story behind how he loves swallows- that they were the first birds he ever saw and when his Father was young (the great grandfather of the protagonist) the Father would go out and pinch the eggs of sparrows and rooks because they would always interfere with the farm; his Father would leave the swallows' nests alone because they never bothered his farm. In fact, Father even punched a friend for stealing from a swallow's nest, getting Father into trouble. Father is described as always managing to get into fights when he was younger. The protagonist's Grandpa then went on to describe events between his own Father and a horse named Joey, indicating that the pair were Albert and Joey from the prequel. He describes the lengths his Father went to keep Joey safe, even joining the army to find Joey when he was taken away to be used in WWI. Father was only 14 years old at the time of joining the army and had to lie to get in. This section is primarily a flashback to the previous book and the events around and before the war, but from another perspective. After such events and the end of WWI, the protagonist's great grandfather was commonly referred to as the \\"Corporal\\" by the townspeople. Once the protagonist finishes school, now a young adult, he visits his Grandpa again during the summer. One day during this time Grandpa asks of the boy to help him to learn to read and write. When the Grandfather was a child he prioritised helping out on the farm with his Father as the Corporal had a lasting leg injury from the war and found it difficult to keep up with the work to be done. The Grandpa's wife attempted to teach him to read and write years later, after the protagonist's mother and her siblings had left the farm, but unfortunately died unexpectedly from a weak heart. This has left Grandpa distraught and embarrassed for many years. Grandpa makes a bet with the protagonist that if he can read Agatha Christie and even write a short story by Christmas he will give the boy a hundred pounds, and also offers to pay him during his time living and working on the farm to teach him to read and write. Thanks to Grandpa's determination, on Christmas Eve he walks with the protagonist into the barn to read him Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie and by New Year he is able to read the book word for word. In February the boy chooses to travel to Australia and on the train he finds an envelope, containing the ¬£100 from the bet and a story written by Grandpa. The story is a recollection of how the Corporal, his two horses Joey and Zoey and his son (Grandpa) challenge an arrogant farmer, Harry Medlicott, in a bet where if the horses ploughed more than Medlicott's tractor, the Corporal receives his tractor. Despite determination from the Corporal, at the beginning of the bet the tractor easily pulls ahead, however after the break it refuses to start again. When the tractor starts back up again the Corporal is slightly in the lead, however Medlicott quickly catches, and the Corporal can no longer bear the strain due to his injury. Grandpa takes over and leads the horses in ploughing. In a surprising turn of events Medlicott accidentally tips the tractor over into a ditch, allowing Grandpa to just barely pull ahead and win. The tractor is the same one which resides in Grandpa's barn in the protagonist's time. This leads the protagonist to deciding to study engineering at college, before returning to the farm to live and work there while also fixing up the tractor so it is one day usable again. Adaptation A preview of the play adaptation. The novel has also become an inspiration for a play \\\\- the director Daniel Buckroyd's adaptation in October 2009 with New Perspectives Theater Company and another co-production with Scamp Theater in 2012. The play was a great success, having a great number of viewers in UK, reaching the Brits Off Broadway Festival ‚Äì Christmas in New York City in USA.

He was Mayor of Wellington between 2016 and 2019, following six years on the Wellington City Council. Early life and career Lester is from Invercargill, where he lived with his mother and two brothers in a state house. Lester has an LLB and BA (German) from the University of Otago and a Masters of Laws (LLM) from the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Before entering local politics, Lester worked in property and asset management, and in commercial real estate. He co-founded the salad bar chain Kapai in 2005. Political career Lester stood as a Labour Party candidate for the Wellington City Council in the 2010 Wellington local elections and was elected for the Northern ward. A first-time candidate, Lester received the most votes of the seven candidates for that ward and defeated incumbent Hayley Wain. He was appointed by mayor Celia Wade-Brown to lead the council's community facilities portfolio. Lester was re-elected in the 2013 Wellington local elections. Wade-Brown was re-elected mayor and chose Lester to succeed Ian McKinnon as deputy mayor. Lester also chaired the council's Governance, Finance and Planning Committee and the Performance Review Committee. In December 2015, Lester announced he was running to be Mayor of Wellington on a Labour Party ticket with Paul Eagle in the October 2016 local government elections. He ran on a platform of completing Wellington projects such as the film museum, airport runway extension and a convention centre. Wade-Brown had initially said she would seek a third term, but ultimately stepped down and gave Lester her endorsement. He was elected over former Porirua Mayor Nick Leggett and fellow city councillors Jo Coughlan and Andy Foster. As mayor, Lester appointed Eagle as deputy mayor and former journalist Joseph Romanos as his chief advisor, among other former Labour Party employees from Parliament. Lester chose to lead the council's arts portfolio. When Eagle resigned to become a member of Parliament in 2017, Lester appointed first-term councillor Jill Day as the new deputy mayor. Lester announced he would run for a second term in the 2019 local government elections. In a surprise result, he lost his bid for re-election to challenger Andy Foster by 62 votes, becoming the first incumbent Wellington mayor in 33 years to lose re-election after just one term in office.https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/10/live-updates-new- zealand-local-body-election-results-2019.htmlhttps://thespinoff.co.nz/local- elections/12-10-2019/live-blog-results-of-the-2019-local-elections/ https://thespinoff.co.nz/local-elections/13-10-2019/winners-losers-big-losers- and-gigantic-losers-from-the-2019-local-elections/ Lester applied for a manual judicial recount, but was denied.  Positions and views  Lester has supported the Wellington City Council's support of the Living Wage campaign. He has criticised the Wellington Chamber of Commerce for signalling that it will take legal action against the Council for extending the living wage to security guards. At his mayoral campaign launch in April 2016, he announced further policies and said he would: give first-home builders a $5000 rates rebate, introduce free entry for children under five at council pools, remove the fees businesses pay to have outdoor dining on public land, and address the council's \\"ingrained sexism\\" by employing more women in senior roles. During his campaign for the mayoralty, Lester promised to significantly boost arts investment. In March 2017, following economic data that showed Wellington was New Zealand's \\"most creative city\\", Lester confirmed a $500,000 funding boost to events, access to venues and public art in a bid to keep Wellington's culture scene competitive with Auckland. As mayor, Lester announced in February 2017 he was looking to trim council spending by $8m to help pay for his various election promises which included strengthening the city's town hall, developing a new movie museum and convention centre, establishing an emergency reservoir at Prince of Wales park, ensuring a living wage for council employees and directing money to new infrastructure projects to help ease congestion around Wellington's Basin Reserve. Later that month, Lester announced with Deputy Mayor Paul Eagle that the council would build 750 new social housing units and affordable homes in an effort to avoid a \\"housing crisis\\". He also committed Wellington to be a bilingual (English and MƒÅori) city by 2040. In his 2019 mayoral campaign, Lester pledged to end homelessness and remove private vehicles from the central city. Career after politics After losing the mayoralty Lester took up positions as government director at Dot Loves Data and savings ambassador for Simplicity, a KiwiSaver planning organisation. Personal life Lester lives in Johnsonville with his wife Elizabeth and two daughters.

It stood at the landward end of the pier, whilst the purpose of Pier station, which was juts northwards into the River Humber, was to enable railway passengers and goods to transfer to and from ferries plying between New Holland and Hull. New Holland Town station's purpose was for more conventional use by the local community. New Holland was a \\"railway village\\" in the sense that Crewe was a railway town. Expanding the dock, building the pier, the engine shed and the railway to it were promoted and started by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway, though by the time services began that railway had merged with others to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. For many years GCR laundry from restaurant cars and hotels was brought to New Holland for cleaning. History The station opened on 1 March 1848 following a Directors' tour of the ferry and route as far as Louth the day before. Services in the early days were a mix of local and long distance. The line was seen as the gateway to Hull, with transshipment of people and goods being a mere inconvenience. Before long lines reached Hull via Doncaster, so passengers and railways alike realised that longer could be quicker and more convenient. After this the pier and railway eventually settled down to providing local services across the Humber. These were: Ferry from Hull to New Holland Pier then train via New Holland Town: * to Barton-on-Humber * to Cleethorpes via Grimsby, and, from 1911 * to Immingham Dock The Immingham service ceased in 1963, but the other two survived until 1981. The station had two platforms with either one or two through lines between and, originally, an overall roof which was later removed. However, no published photograph or track diagram shows more than one through line or space for more than one. The station buildings were made of masonry and were more substantial on the eastern side. Average daily traffic along the pier in its peak years was 30000 passengers, 250 vehicles, 1200 cattle and sheep and 300 tons of luggage. This needs corroboration as it would imply 60 trains each carrying 500 passengers a day. Until the end of the Second World War publicity, tickets and timetables rarely differentiated between the Town and Pier stations, with the July 1922 Bradshaw, for example, giving a single entry for \\"New Holland.\\" The station was closed and the ferry withdrawn on 24 June 1981 when the Humber Bridge opened. New Holland pier was taken over by New Holland Bulk Services who started a grain and feed import and export business in 1984. When the station and its neighbour New Holland Pier were closed they were replaced by a wholly new New Holland station south of the former. This new station forms an integral part of the Barton Line. New Holland Town station has been demolished.

It is one of the most iconic climbs in the region, because of its steep slopes and narrow badly-surfaced cobbled road. Its average gradient is 7% with its steepest point, 14.2%, in the middle of the climb in a right-hand bend.

The company existed from 1945 to 1950. History The United States Television Manufacturing Corporation was founded in 1945 in Manhattan, New York City, to produce large-screen television sets and, later, conventional models. In April the following year, it announced an initial public offering of 99,000 shares of 50-cent par value common stock at US$3 each. The Guaranty Trust Company of New York was appointed registrar. Headed by president Hamilton Hoge, with his brother John Otis Hoge as vice president, U.S. Television Manufacturing aimed its initial product at taverns, clubs, fraternal organizations and similar business consumers, reasoning that with parts and materials remaining in short supply following World War II, the company needed to sell fewer but higher-priced units. Two views of U.S. Television Manufacturing Corp.'s Tavern Tele-Symphonic projection-TV set On September 18, 1946, U.S. Television Manufacturing held a public demonstration of large-screen rear-projection television, with sets at department stores including Bloomingdale's and Macy's in Manhattan, Bamberger's in Brooklyn, and Abraham & Straus in Newark, New Jersey, showing live coverage of the Joe Louis-Tami Mauriello heavyweight boxing championship at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx. The company said it had already begun delivering sets to customers. By July 1947, the company was producing 300 units a month of its initial model, it said, which were distributed by dealers in 13 states and the District of Columbia. It announced plans to produce a taller model with a 475-square-inch screen and AM-FM radio reception, to sell for US$1,995 excluding installation charges, and two home-consumer models: one with a \\"10-inch direct-view cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen, giving a 54-square-inch image\\", plus AM-FM radio and phonograph, for US$895; and a rear-projection TV with the same features but a 390-square-inch image, for US$2,275. The direct-view model's price was reduced to US$745 in November 1947. In March the following year, the large-screen projection-TV set increased in priced to US$2,495, with the company announcing shipment to distributors in 15 cities within two to three weeks and plans to produce 50 to 75 sets monthly. The company also announced plans to market a television set for theaters and auditoriums, with a variable screen size of 9 x 12 feet to 12 x 16 feet, for US$3,495. By October 1948, the company was marketing what it called two \\"improved\\" models with 475- and 675-square-inch screens. left Additionally, by January 1948, the company was producing a tabletop model with a 10-inch screen giving a picture size of nearly 9 by 7 inches. By November, U.S. Television Manufacturing Corp. subsidiary Zetka Television Tubes, Inc., of Clifton, New Jersey, was manufacturing 12- and 15-inch CRTs, with glass blanks supplied by Corning Glass Works. In December 1948, the company dropped prices, citing increased supplies of 15-inch glass CRTs. The home console with radio and phonograph was now US$1,095, and table models $695 and $325. Among its advertising and promotional efforts, the company said in August 1947 that it would launch a direct-mail campaign to 41,000 tavern-owners nationwide, via the advertising agency Huber-Hoge & Sons. In January the following year, it announced that the same agency would launch a $250,000 print-ad campaign for its tabletop sets, emphasizing quality over price. Following the public company's 1950 report on earnings, registering a loss, no further reports were issued.

Earnings and revenue The company reported a net loss of US$98,000 for the first six months of 1946. For the same period of 1947, it posted an estimated net profit of US$188,355 after taxes and after utilizing one-half of the company's 1946 tax loss of US$176,707. The half-year net profit represented 59 cents each on 319,000 common shares. For full-year 1947, the company reported net sales of US$1,907,874, resulting in a net loss of US$132,686.

It has been described as a \\"genuine icon of the High Tech movement\\". The house won a RIBA Award for Architecture in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. History and description Though the house has no formal name (simply a street number 49a) it was the first project of Michael and Patty Hopkins' architecture practice, Michael Hopkins and Partners (now Hopkins Architects), founded in 1976. It remains their \\"calling card\\" over 40 years later. The couple believed at the time architecture would soon combine with engineering and increasingly favour prefabricated, ultra-lightweight construction. The building was designed as \\"a machine for both living and working in\\". It was a simple two-storey glass and steel box, with few permanent interior partitions, only occasional plastic panels for privacy of the bathrooms and sleeping areas. The steel frame structure is left clearly visible. Patty Hopkins describes the technique as \\"really very basic 16th-century engineering\\", though replacing crafted timber joints with sophisticated metal joints, rods, and tension cables. The house is reached from the street by a 'drawbridge' entering at the first floor level. As such, the house appears to be only one floor in height from the street. It easily gained planning permission because the site was already expected to have a much larger four-storey building developed at that spot. The couple paid ¬£30,000 for the site and a further ¬£20,000 to complete the construction. The house was used as the offices of Michael Hopkins and Partners for the next eight years (until the practice outgrew the space and moved to Marylebone). It served as an advertisement for the company's work and clients would be keen to visit. The Hopkins family also lived in the building and their three children grew up there. Defying convention, there was nothing to physically distinguish the work space from the living areas, other than the fact the family generally stayed on the ground floor and the work was carried out above. All the same, Patty Hopkins recalled having to hide the bed to make the work area look more professional. She also found it easier to reinforce the children's behavioural boundaries when business was regularly being conducted nearby. The couple continue to use the house as their London home.

It is a training centre for those becoming deacons and diaconal ministers; it provides continuing education for ministers and offers a variety of programs and workshops for others seeking to deepen their faith or explore theology. The centre's primary areas of study include pastoral care, social justice, collaborative learning, transformative education, and social ministry. History The Centre for Christian Studies is historically rooted in the diaconal training schools of the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Anglican churches established in Canada in the late nineteenth century. The Social Gospel movement combined with the influence of early feminism, which was fighting for more vocational opportunities for women, as well as the increasing need of churches to fill overseas missionary sites were the major impetuses for the formation of these schools.

Biography  Holmes started his film career as a stop-motion animator. His 1999 short film The Scam took three years to make and won three Gold awards from the Australian Cinematographers Society (ACS). In 2001, Holmes began a year traineeship at South Australian production company Anifex Pty Ltd. He remained there until 2010, working on numerous of television commercials as a stop-motion animator, sculptor and storyboard artist. His commercial credits include Home Hardware, Louis the Fly, Schmackos and Mr. Rental. He also worked as an animator and sculptor on several Award-winning short films directed by Michael Cusack, including The Book-Keeper, (R)evolution and Gargoyle. Gargoyle won an AACTA Award for Best Short Animation in 2006. During his time at Anifex, he also worked with director Deane Taylor, the Art Director on The Nightmare Before Christmas, on various commercials and television spots for Nickelodeon. In 2001, Holmes directed and animated the 6-minute television pilot Eggabord and Bacon-Boy: The Spoons in Black with writer and co-creator Pete Court. Holmes first full-length film Twin Rivers was a live-action drama and was financed with his own savings. Filming began in 2001 and continued for four years, wrapping in 2004. Acclaimed Australian director/producer Rolf de Heer was instrumental in helping Twin Rivers reach completion, mentoring the director through the editing and enlisting the help of key sound editors James Currie and Tom Heuzenroeder. Post-production continued for another two years and the film was released in 2007 and premiered at the Capri Cinema. He also starred in the film in one of the lead roles, alongside his brother Darren Holmes. The film was released on DVD in 2008 through DV1 Entertainment and aired regularly on the Ovation Channel on Foxtel. In 2005, Holmes shot an experimental comedy feature film The Biscuit Effect which was primarily shot in one day, with all actors improvising their characters and lines. In 2007, the concept and characters from The Biscuit Effect were adapted into a 6-part television comedy series Crooked, which was exclusively financed by the cast. Again, all the cast improvised their dialogue throughout the filming. However, the series was not picked up by a commercial broadcaster, so in 2010 it was recut into smaller episodes and released on YouTube. Holmes was one of the lead animators on the 2013 short film Woody, directed by Stuart Bowen. Holmes wrote and directed the short horror film The Artifice in 2014. Later that year, he launched a crowd-funding campaign through Kickstarter to fund a 25-minute film on the bushranger Ben Hall, entitled The Legend of Ben Hall. The project exceeded funding expectations and was expanded to a 50-minute film. Filming began in August 2014. When the trailer for The Legend of Ben Hall was released, the project was picked up by Odin's Eye Entertainment and RCL Motion Picture Entertainment and expanded into a 2-hour feature film, incorporating the footage from the short film into the feature. Australian director Greg McLean joined the project as an Executive Producer in February 2015. Filming began in regional Victoria in March 2015 and continued into June. The Legend of Ben Hall is due for release in 2016.

Background The election was won by Baume's cousin and former Mayor of Auckland, Arthur Myers who stood as an independent Liberal. William Richardson, former secretary to opposition leader William Massey ran as a prohibitionist candidate. He opposed moves the Ward administration was making claiming it was working \\"hand in glove\\" with the liquor industry.

Two Labour Party candidates ran against each other, with George Davis coming in second place. George Irving McKnight was originally chosen by the Labour Party, but proved unsatisfactory. His endorsement was revoked and the party chose to sponsor Davis instead. The prohibition league also endorsed Davis as Myers owned a brewery.

For more than 50 years, he taught at the St. Petersburg State University Faculty of Philology. Biography He was born in Kazan, Russia and graduated from high school there in 1942. Then he volunteered for war service and served with the Baltic Fleet. He took part in the battles of the Siege of Leningrad. After the war, he studied philology at Kazan University, graduating in 1950. Then he continued his studies at the Classical Philology Department of Leningrad University, where he studied under a noted Russian philologist Ivan Tolstoi (1880-1954). In June 1953 he defended his thesis and began teaching at Leningrad University. Starting in 1956, he was sent to work for some time in Mongolia as Latin instructor, being one of the pioneers in this area. He also studied Mongolian, and published on this subject. In 1967 he received his doctorate for his monograph on the history of the Indo-European word- formation.

Carian language research Otkupshchikov spent 25 years on his research on the Carian and the Paleo-Balkan languages problem. In 1966, he suggested his own interpretation of the Carian alphabet, and his own reading of Carian inscriptions; he saw Carian as a language quite close to Greek, and to other Paleo-Balkan dialects.Yuri Otkupshchikov, ¬´–ö–∞—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞–¥–ø–∏—Å–∏ –ê—Ñ—Ä–∏–∫–∏¬ª // Kari«êskie nadpisi Afriki (Carian inscriptions in Africa) Lenigrad: Leningrad State University, 1966 He saw the Thracian, Phrygian, and Ancient Macedonian languages as such dialects. In his book, he was trying to justify his point of view using the analysis of Carian names and onomastics, as well as using other linguistic evidence as preserved in Greek texts. Also, according to him, his attempt to read newly discovered Carian inscriptions in Egypt gave him additional supporting evidence. Otkupshchikov came to the conclusion that Carian was a Paleo-Balkan dialect with quite transparent onomastical links especially to the Thracian and Phrygian. The book contains much linguistic evidence for his views. Nevertheless, the questions remain whether or not Otkupshchikov managed to identify the genuine Carian element in all that ancient material or, rather, that his cases may also represent an adstrate brought in by Paleo- Balkan infiltrations. In the latter part of his scholarly career, Otkupshchikov focused especially on the Balto-Slavic research. Ancient Greek and the Paleo-Balkan languages Otkupshchikov believed that the language of the ancient Phrygians was closest to the ancient Greek language. Phrygian had more features in common with ancient Greek than with other Indo- European languages.Yuri Otkupshchikov, –î–æ–≥—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å—É–±—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç (\\"The Pre-Greek substrate.

Summary Pale Arrow was orphaned as a boy and raised as the son of the Pawnee Chief, Wise Eagle. Now an adult, Pale Arrow witnesses his fellow braves attack a wagon driven by two people who are trying to rejoin the rest of a wagon train passing through Pawnee land. Pale Arrow rescues the two individuals and returns them safely to their comrades. Subsequently, he and Wise Eagle come to an agreement whereby Pale Arrow will see if he is able to return to his roots as a white settler. He takes the name Paul Fletcher and becomes a scout for the wagon train. Wise Eagle wants to live in peace with white people but, upon his death, Crazy Fox becomes Chief and stirs up a desire for war in the Pawnee. Paul Fletcher/Pale Arrow is caught between these two worlds and must choose one when it becomes clear the wagon train is about to be attacked.

It was passed by Congress on December 3, 2015, and President Barack Obama signed it on December 4. The vote was 359‚Äì65 in the House of Representatives and 83‚Äì16 in the United States Senate. The $305 billion, five- year bill is funded without increasing transportation user fees. (The federal gas tax was last raised in 1993.When did the Federal Government begin collecting the gas tax? - Ask the Rambler - Highway History - FHWA) Instead, funds were generated through changes to passport rules, Federal Reserve Bank dividends, and privatized tax collection. In Section 6021, Congress asked the Transportation Research Board to conduct a study of the actions needed to upgrade and restore the Interstate Highway System to fulfill its role as a crucial national asset, serving the needs of people, cities and towns, businesses, and the military while remaining the safest highway network in the country. The subsequent 2019 report, \\"Renewing the National Commitment to the Interstate Highway System: A Foundation for the Future,\\" recommends actions Congress could take.
