What is known about Gufler's childhood is that he was repeatedly haunted by unpredictable violence as a result of a serious skull injury, which he had suffered at the age of nine years from an incident. During the Second World War, he was again injured as an ambulance driver of the Wehrmacht in frontline operations from shrapnel in his head area. His impaired physical and mental condition could be an explanation for his actions.  Murders  After the Second World War, Gufler worked in the Lower Austrian town of St. P√∂lten as a bookseller until he met in 1951 the daughter of a tobacconist. In his father-in-law's kiosk, he offered customers banned pornographic photos, eventually leading to his and the kiosk owner's detention. Barely released from custody, Gufler killed prostitute Emilie Meystrzik, who was found in 1952 with a broken skull in a love hotel in the Viennese red-light district. Gufler, who now worked as a vacuum cleaner representative, developed into a cunning marriage swindler who promised marriage to women and killed them as soon as he had managed to get their money. He invited his victims to a honeymoon and then anaesthetisized them with coffee spiked with barbituric acid. He drowned the unconscious victims in lakes to make the crime look like a suicide.  Conviction  After the murder of Maria Robas in September 1958, the evidence against Gufler thickened. He was arrested in St. P√∂lten because of an urgent suspicion of having murdered 18 women since the end of the war. In order to be able to convict him, a new procedure was developed by Viennese forensics doctors at the time, with which two sleep aids could be separated and individually identified. Although he was charged with seven murders, only four murders and two attempted murders were proven in a jury trial before the Vienna District Court for Criminal Matters. Despite his severe brain trauma, Gufler was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1961. In 1966 he died at Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau.

The case drew intense public scrutiny as it called into question the definition of rape under Spanish law. Five men, including a member of the Civil Guard and another of the Spanish Army from Seville, filmed themselves repeatedly attacking the woman in the vestibule of an apartment building. La Manada means \\"pack\\" in Spanish. After their arrest and trial, the men were cleared of sexual aggression charges and instead found guilty of sexual abuse because the prosecution could not prove they employed violence to subjugate the victim. Thousands took to the streets in Pamplona and Spain to manifest their disapproval of the verdict. The inquiry of the aggression uncovered footage shared on social media recorded by the perpetrators in Pozoblanco, Andalusia, showing an unresponsive woman lying on their van subject to groping and derision, which gave rise to another lawsuit. In a sentence handed down on 21 June 2019, the Spanish Supreme Court reversed the lower court and affirmed that the men were guilty of rape, remanding Jos√© √Ångel Prenda, Jes√∫s Escudero, Alfonso Jes√∫s Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero and √Ångel Boza to 15 years in prison; Guerrero was given an additional two years for stealing the victim's mobile phone. Background Demonstration against the sentence in Pamplona Protesters in Pamplona In the early hours of 7 July, an 18-year-old woman reported a rape to the Police of Pamplona, perpetrated by five young men. The woman, who was going to her car to sleep, was accompanied during a part of the journey by the group of men she had just met. She alleged that they pushed her into a doorway of a building. While some committed the crime, others recorded it on their mobile phones. She was later abandoned in the doorway and her mobile phone was stolen. The perpetrators shared the video of the attack in a WhatsApp group called \\"La Manada\\" (\\"the wolfpack\\"). Seven clips of this video were studied by the police in a 200-page report in which it is reported that the woman maintained a \\"passive and neutral\\" attitude, that her attitude was not \\"participatory\\" and that there was \\"humiliation and vexation\\" toward her. After the offence, a couple in the street approached the victim and called the local Pamplona police. Following an interview with the victim, at least three police officers started a search for the perpetrators at 3.30 am. They followed the description provided and surveyed CCTV in the streets of central Pamplona. After tracking down the men of La Manada in the traditional bull running, the local and Navarrese police arrested them on the same day around noon in the city district of San Jorge. Trial = Charges filed = The prosecution was represented by the public prosecutor, the victim, the City of Pamplona, and the Government of Navarre. The tribunal considered in the sentence that the victim's testimony was objectively credible, was consistent throughout the investigation, did not introduce \\"improbable elements\\" and did not have \\"spurious motives\\" to make the accusation. It considered that there was \\"minimal violence\\" and \\"very serious intimidation that prevented the defense of the victim\\" surrounded by the five men, and that they left her helpless after the event because they took her mobile phone. The defendant argued that it was group consensual sex and she had made the accusation for fear that the video could be seen by other people. = Development = A year and a half on after the aggression, on 15 November 2017, the Court of Navarre took two diverging paths concerning evidence during the inquest; it unanimously accepted as evidence a report by a private detective commissioned by the defence to track the victim's whereabouts and behaviour following her assault, ultimately aimed at showing that the victim \\"held normal interactions\\" in social networks, and undermine her case. By contrast, the tribunal rejected as evidence relevant to the lawsuit footage from 1 May 2016 in Pozoblanco, Andalusia, showing the La Manada men sitting in their van next to an unconscious 21 year-old girl, and speaking of \\"fucking the Sleeping Beauty\\", \\"the new Marta del Castillo\\", wondering whether she was dead, as well as citing burundanga, and chloroform. On Thursday, 26 April 2018, five months after the trial, the Provincial Court of Navarre published its judgment. The court sentenced the five accused to nine years in prison for continued sexual abuse, although they did not find them guilty of sexual aggression (which would have meant 12 to 15 years of prison). As a result, the convicts were released on a 6,000 euro bail, until a final court decision. Amidst uproar raised by the judicial decision, opposition forces bitterly criticised the Spanish government for not incorporating into the Spanish Civil Code the Istanbul Convention signed four years earlier, and for not enforcing the State Agreement against Gender Violence. On 5 December 2018, the Provincial Court of Navarre confirmed the initial sentence, with two dissenting judges who still considered that the victim was subject to aggression. On 4 January 2019, the Provincial Court of Navarre dismissed the intent pursued by the popular accusation, i.e. the City of Pamplona and Government of Navarre, to imprison the convicts, confirming their freedom. Despite being considered a serious offence, the Court of Navarre opted to leave the convicts free on parole until the sentence is final, arguing \\"inexistence of flight risk\\". Ahead of the Supreme Court's final decision on the case, the Data Protection Agency imposed on one of the assailants a ‚Ç¨150,000 fine for distributing the footage of the victim during the assault. = Final sentence = On 21 June 2019, the Supreme Court of Spain upgraded the five men's previous convictions for sexual abuse to that of continuous sexual assault, and handed down 15-year prison terms. The sentence states that the victim was \\"intimidated\\", she was \\"overcome by fear\\", and \\"could offer no resistance\\", concluding that the crime was a rape. Antonio Manuel Guerrero received two additional years for stealing the victim's mobile phone. The sentence also banned them from coming within 500 metres of the victim for a period of 20 years and ordered compensation totalling ‚Ç¨100,000. The Court of Navarre ordered the immediate detention of the five convicts for risk of flight, just as two of them were about to leave Seville. On transfer to prison after arrest, El Prenda, one of the perpetrators, was filmed showing a smirk at the cameras. After notification of the final sentence, the Chief Bureau of the Civil Guard announced that it would initiate the procedure to remove Guerrero from the Spanish police force \\"as soon as possible\\". On 5 July 2019, the Supreme Court issued the whole sentence, elaborating on different points that had raised controversy and the definition of sexual assault (aggression). The sentence states that \\"consensual sex is only made clear by explicit consent or clearly inferred from the circumstances\\" according to the Istanbul Convention, considers the first sentence by the Court of Navarre an 'error', and asserts that \\"the victim needs to show no heroic opposition, which may lead to further harm to her\\". Video of demonstrations on 26 April 2018, in Madrid streets. = Spanish legal details = In Spain, the crime of sex without consent has 2 legal categories, sexual aggression or sexual abuse. Sexual aggression is defined as necessitating violence (violencia) or intimidation (intimidaci√≥n), sexual abuse is without violence, however there are controversies regarding the interpretation of these legal terms by the public; \\"intimidation\\" is more narrow than abusing superiority or influence over the victim.  Reactions  After the first convictions, there were demonstrations in Spanish cities against the leniency of the sentence, and political and social figures voiced their disagreement. Feminist associations denounced the first sentence as \\"very bad precedent\\". They pointed out that once again women are held responsible for the assaults they suffer. On 22 June 2018 the five culprits were released on bail of 6,000 euros. Joseba Asiron (EH Bildu), mayor of Pamplona at the time of the assault, criticised the sentence and considered the decision to release the convicts \\"highly distressing\\". American actresses Jessica Chastain and Rose McGowan expressed condemnation of the sentence.Hollywood hits out at gang-rape acquittal: Jessica Chastain and Rose McGowan condemn 'lenient' sentence in thinkspain.com Following the April 2018 conviction, the Civil Guard officer Antonio Manuel Guerrero and the army soldier Alfonso Jes√∫s Cabezuelo were suspended from duty but continued to be paid 75% of their wage until all appeals had been heard. Cabezuelo was expelled from the army in October 2018. Guerrero held his position in the paramilitary police body until notification of the final sentence. In response to the final sentence, feminist associations, Manuela Carmena, Pedro Sanchez, Irene Montero, Pablo Iglesias, Joseba Asiron, and Ines Arrimadas saluted the decision and the definition of the crime as rape. Juan Carlos Girauta likened the rapists to the pro-independence leaders facing trial for the 1-O 2017 Referendum, labelled 'putschists'. 130 feminist associations demanded that the sentence set legal precedent for the future.  Related developments  During the defendants' parole awaiting the outcome to their appeal, four members of the 'Manada' were subject to prosecution for another sex abuse case involving an unconscious 21-year-old woman lying unresponsive on the defendants' van in Pozoblanco, Andalusia. In late October, the convicts were declared persona non grata in Pozoblanco, C√≥rdoba, hometown of the victim of the male group's alleged assault in 2016, now under investigation. In late November 2018, the same panel of judges in charge of \\"La Manada\\" case convicted a man from Lodosa, Navarre, of occasional 'mistreatment' and handed down a 10-month prison term in a case in which the defendant \\"attempted to kill [the victim] with a knife and by strangulation while she struggled for her life, with their young children watching, before eventually giving up\\"; the sentence cited the man's mental state as a mitigating factor. Amnesty International has denounced the hurdles encountered by victims of gender aggression in the Spanish justice system.

It is the offices and meeting place of Northumberland County Council. The current building was completed in April 1981, after the county hall was moved from the old county hall in Newcastle. A statue of a Viking Warrior stands outside the building and was moved there from Doxford Hall. History Statue of Viking warrior For much of the 20th century County Hall was situated within an exclave of Northumberland (in the Moot Hall precincts) within the county borough of Newcastle upon Tyne; the area became part of the county of Tyne and Wear in 1974 and was thus extraterritorial to the county of Northumberland. After deciding that this arrangement was unsatisfactory, county leaders chose to procure a new purpose-built county headquarters within the territorial limits of the county: the site selected in Morpeth had previously been agricultural land. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 6 April 1979. It was designed in the modern style and was opened on 21 April 1981. The design for the three-storey building involved continuous bands of glazing with red brick above and below: Pevsner described it as a \\"spreading building of informal style in brick\\". A statue of a Viking Warrior, which had been sculpted by Margaret Wrightson in 1925 and placed in the grounds of Doxford Hall, was relocated to Morpeth at that time of the construction of County Hall. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Northumberland had lunch at County Hall on 26 July 2001. In October 2014 county leaders announced proposals to move the county headquarters to Ashington. However, after a change in political leadership, the new county leaders announced, in May 2017, that the proposals would be abandoned. Instead a phased programme of refurbishment works were announced with a project to repair the external fabric of the building approved in February 2018, a project to repair back-of-house office areas approved in November 2018 and a project to repair the reception area approved in March 2020.

He reached the summit in the heat of midday, in deep snow, with the landscape below him shrouded in cloud. The Brocken had always been a place of mystery, connected with witches and devils; where illusions such as the Brocken spectre might confuse an unwary traveller, and where few ventured by choice. This was the inspiration and the setting for his poem. \\"Harzreise im Winter\\" was the last of Goethe's works in his Sturm und Drang period, marking the end of a series of long, free-verse poems hymns by the young poet that had begun with ‚ÄòWandrers Sturmlied‚Äô, and it is less self-absorbed than his earlier writing. It was first published in 1789 in the eighth volume of his works. Creation and publication Commemorative plaque for Goethe on the Brocken Goethe wrote the poem during his first trip to the Harz when he spent two weeks on his own, with only local guides to accompany him, from 29 November to 14 December 1777. During this trip he signed himself in hotel guest books as \\"Johann Wilhelm Weber from Darmstadt\\". On 16 November he had referred in his diary to a \\"Project on the Secret Journey\\", an undertaking that he described on 7 December in a letter to Frau von Stein as a \\"pilgrimage\\". On the first of December, several days before the ascent of the Brocken, he had already conceived of the opening words of the poem, ‚ÄúLike the vulture‚Äù. The 'pilgrimage' up the Brocken was intended to be the highlight of his trip, but as well as being considered dangerous, the weather conditions made it uncertain, and he was not able to make the ascent until 10 December. Many years later, in his autobiographical essay ‚ÄúCampaign in France‚Äù, he declared that he had seen a vulture \\"in the gloomy snow-capped clouds that rose from the north\\" on the Ettersberg, and that he had already begun the poem that day. The original manuscript of the poem has not survived, so the earliest known version is a transcription by Philipp Seidel, attached to a letter to Johann Heinrich Merck dated 5 August 1778. Goethe did not include the work in his handwritten collection of texts which he put together in 1777 for Charlotte von Stein. He edited his early version for the eight volume of his writings in 1789, making some minor changes in the final stanza. Form and themes The work consists of 88 lines of free verse, divided into eleven stanzas of differing lengths. This was a common ode arrangement in the 18th century.Erich Trunz. In: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Goethes Werke, Anmerkungen, Hamburger Ausgabe, Band I, C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 1998, p. 491. It contains two key elements that were to become central to the discourse of the Romantics on winter travel ‚Äì references to frosty, lifeless landscapes, and their intimate connection with the loneliness of the hero who had withdrawn into the wilderness in the face of some kind of crisis. The poem opens with a stanza in which the poet likens his song to a hovering bird of prey looking down on the earth: The second to fifth stanzas contrast the fate of the lucky and those who struggle against misfortune, illustrating the difference in their experiences in terms of the landscape. Next, the poet's vision passes from the external into the internal perspective, illuminating the distress of the selfish and asking who heals the pain of \\"the balm that became poison\\" and of one \\"who but hate for man / From the fullness of love hath drunk?\\" In the following stanza, the song invokes the \\"Father of Love,\\" who refreshes the heart of the sufferer and clears his \\"clouded gaze\\" so that a \\"thousand springs\\" are revealed to the \\"thirsty / in the desert\\". This plea is extended to the \\"Brothers of the Hunt\\" in the eighth stanza, so that they too may be blessed. The tenth stanza then asks for the lonely soul ‚Äì the poet himself ‚Äì to be wrapped in \\"golden clouds\\" and surrounded by \\"winter green\\". After a well-lit and sheltered ascent through \\"the fords of the night,\\" the poet reaches the \\"dreaded summit\\" and gazes in gratitude toward the overawing spectacle of nature. Context After his Harz journey, Goethe was ready to move on from the unrestrained forms of expression which characterised the Sturm und Drang. Later in life, he distanced himself from the sentiments of his earliest work, including ‚ÄòThe Sorrows of Young Werther‚Äô, seeking measure and order instead. At the time ‚ÄòHarzreise im Winter‚Äô was written however, ‚ÄòThe Sorrows of Young Werther‚Äò continued to exert a strong influence on many young men. One of these was Friedrich Victor Leberecht Plessing, the prototype for the unfortunate person referred to in the poem as consumed in bitterness. He had been greatly influenced by Goethe's work and after studying theology and jurisprudence had returned to his parents‚Äô house in Wernigerode, consumed with melancholy. Plessing had written to Goethe asking for advice in 1776, but Goethe had not replied to him. Goethe visited Plessing on his journey to the Harz on 3 December, but was unable to help him. In his Campaign in France, Goethe later described Plessing's unanswered letter as \\"the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in its self-tormenting manner.‚Äù In addition to Plessing there were others who sought his help, and whom Goethe supported - he said that he had also \\"imposed\\" on other young men whom he wanted to help along their way. However, many of those who sought Goethe's help would not have gone along with him on his \\"path to a purer higher education,\\" and would have held back his own self-development. Indeed, as much as Harzreise im Winter may allude to his encounter with Plessing, it is Goethe's own self-development that its main topic. He ascends the mountain to consult the oracle about his own fate, in other words to understand whether he is condemned to live the existence of the unfortunate, or whether he is to be redeemed by love. Against the background of his diary entries and letters, this spiritual and redemptive element is shown in a clear light. After the eagerly awaited climb up the Brocken, he wrote: \\"cheerful, glorious moment, the whole world below in clouds and fog and above, everything cheerful\\" and added the sentence: \\"What is man that you are mindful of him?\\", a quotation from the eighth Psalm which he had written down on the anniversary of his arrival in Weimar. Language, imagery and critical appraisal The poem is less descriptive than reflective, as the landscape mentioned in the title is only lightly sketched and exists mainly as the framework for an existential experience. The poem opens with the image of a vulture flying high above the earth. Whether the bird he invokes was specifically a vulture if not is not entirely clear however - in Goethe's time the term ‚Äúvulture‚Äù might encompass different birds of prey such as hawks or buzzards. The vulture was however a bird used in divination by the Romans, as Goethe knew. In this context, the vulture in the first stanza may link with the ideas of the second stanza - \\"For a God hath / Unto each prescribed / His destined path.\\" It is this sense of finding one's destined path that rings through the solemn words of the last two stanzas. In the sense of Sturm und Drang, and the urge to deify nature, an encounter with the divine itself takes place, and the successful ascent of the summit becomes a symbolic ascension onto a higher plane of being. The language which conveys this is reminiscent of Goethe's earlier poem Ganymed; (\\"Embrace the embracing! / Upwards to your bosom / loving Father!\\"). The critic Albrecht Sch√∂ne has linked the evocation of the vulture in the first stanza and its oracular significance with Goethe's governmental activity, about which he still had very mixed feelings at the time. In the opinion of Jochen Schmidt however, the bird of prey is associated with the eagle found in Pindar's work. For him, the first stanza refers specifically to the third Nemean Ode and proclaims Goethe's self-assurance and the complex relationship between poetry and lived experience. The image of the \\"thirsty / in the desert\\" in the seventh stanza is associated with the book of Isaiah. While the phrases \\"mysterious-apparent\\" and \\"realms and majesty\\" of the last stanza define the religious quality of the lyric language, they are somewhat detached from their core exegetical meanings in the Epistle to the Romans and the Epistle to the Colossians as well as from the Temptation of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew. Klaus Weimar (1984), Michael Mandelartz (2006) and Sebastian Kaufmann (2010/11) have all developed interpretations of the poem which differ to some degree from the traditional view, with its emphasis on the biographical details of Goethe's life, and suggest that the voice of the poet need not be essentially bound up with Goethe's own. Inspiration for later works Crying Out in the Snow (Ruf im Nebel) by Ernst Barlach In 1792, the composer Johann Friedrich Reichardt set some of the poem's words to music in his ‚ÄòRhapsodie (Aus der Harzreise)‚Äô. The chosen text was substantially the same as Brahms' later and more famous composition, the ‚ÄòAlto Rhapsody‚Äô, with Reichardt setting sixteen lines and Brahms twenty-two. In 1924, Ernst Barlach produced a series of lithographs to illustrate \\"Harzreise im Winter\\".

On July 22, 2017, Martin revealed on his blog that the material for Fire & Blood had grown so large that the decision had been made to publish the histories of the Targaryen kings in two volumes. The first volume, simply called Fire & Blood, is set to cover the history of Westeros from Aegon's Conquest up to and through the regency of the boy king, Aegon III Targaryen. While the first volume of Fire & Blood has been published, the second volume was largely unwritten as of July 2017.Not a Blog: The Swords are Drawn (July 22, 2017) In April 2018, when announcing the publication date, Martin revealed the manuscript to be 989 pages long. An excerpt was revealed in October 2018. Contents Fire & Blood is illustrated in a similar fashion as A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. The book contains more than seventy-five black and white illustrations by Doug Wheatley.Not a Blog: Hugo Nominations Open (Feb 7th, 2018) - comment (Feb 14th, 2018) The first volume of Fire & Blood contains the following texts: * \\"The Targaryen Conquest\\": Aegon I Targaryen's conquest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.Youtube: Westeros.org Discusses...

Garc√≠a Jr. While Aegon I's reign is briefly glossed over in The World of Ice & Fire, no parts of the text have been published before. * \\"The Sons of the Dragon\\":Not a Blog: A Bit More (Fake) History (January 31, 2017) Focuses on the lives of Aegon I's sons, King Aenys I Targaryen and King Maegor I Targaryen, ending with Maegor's death and the ascension of Aenys's son Jaehaerys I Targaryen to the throne. An abridged version of The Sons of the Dragon was released in October 2017 titled The Sons of the Dragon in the anthology The Book of Swords. * \\"Heirs of the Dragon\\": Being about 17,000 words long, it focuses on the reign of Jaehaerys I Targaryen and the succession crisis following the deaths of his sons. An abridged version, The Rogue Prince, previously published in the anthology Rogues in 2014, uses the majority of this text.r/asoiaf.com: (Spoilers Extended) The Possibilities for GRRM's New Novella in the Book of Swords Anthology * \\"The Dying of the Dragons\\": Being about 60,000 words in length, it focuses on the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons.

According to Garc√≠a, it is \\"almost as long\\" as The Dying of the Dragons in total word count. Reception Fire & Blood received mixed reviews from critics. Hugo Rifkind of The Times described it as \\"interminable, self-indulgent crap.\\" Roisin O'Connor of The Independent faulted the book for its dry tone, and stated that reading it feels like \\"you've been assigned a mildly interesting, but often tedious, piece of homework\\". Publishers Weekly stated that \\"Martin‚Äôs evocative storytelling style and gift for gripping narrative are mostly absent from this dry history\\". Conversely, Dan Jones of The Sunday Times praised the book, calling it \\"a masterpiece of popular historical fiction\\". Similarly, Chris Lough of Tor.com described the book as \\"... the best Song of Ice and Fire book in 18 years\\" in his review. 18 years before Fire & Blood, the third book of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords, was published. Adaptations A 10-episode HBO series called House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones, is to be based on material from Fire and Blood, executive produced by Martin, Vince Gerardis, Ryan Condal, and Miguel Sapochnik; the latter two are to be its showrunners as well.

It was operated by Dinwoodie's Timber Company with probably less than 10 employees.  Route  Bush railway line The Makatote Tramway lies east of State Highway 4 approximately south of the village National Park, New Zealand on the western boundary of the Tongariro National Park. The track consisted of two main branches of tramlines extending in easterly and northeasterly direction. Both wooden and metal rails can still be found throughout the site. Several pits and water races were installed to serve the steam-powered log haulers and to meet the fire safety requirements of the tramway license.Heritage New Zealand: Makatote Tramway. List No 7668. Retrieved on 29 April 2018. = Main Branch = Only a small number of sleepers and rails of the Main Branch are still in situ today, but the route can be clearly distinguished. The wooden tramway of the Main Branch was constructed from approximately totara rails, laid onto rough-sawn logs of various diameters. The rails were attached to the wooden sleepers by large metal spikes, some of are still in place along the tramway. The sleepers are spaced apart and the gauge of the rails is approximately similar to the Wellington tramway system. A bogey wheel is also still on site near the main branch, shortly before a junction where it splits into the Left-hand and Right-hand Branches.Joanna Wylie: The history and archaeology of the Makatote Tramway, Erua.

The second side branch to the west is particularly interesting because of its preserved rails, bearers and sleepers, and even a points change. It runs towards a skid site and log hauler, which is embossed with the name S. Luke and Co Ltd, Wellington, one of the 13 principal log hauler manufacturers in New Zealand. The log hauler has a significant fatigue crack in the side, which was crudely repaired on site,Krustysimplex: Bush repair to cracked frame, Luke hauler, Dinwoodie's tram near Erua. but subsequently taken out of service. The Left-hand Branch then splits into two branches at the former boundary between Lots 10 and 11. The Left Left-hand Branch has more in situ sleepers, rails and bearers than the Left-hand Branch, and has two skid sites, a causeway and a bridge crossing. The Right Left-hand Branch runs from the junction towards east. It crossed two bridges and consisted mainly of intermittent sections of corduroy roads, but there is a small length of wooden tramway at the very end of the branch, which lead to a skid site and associated draglines. There is also a junction partway along the Right Left- hand Branch with a branch in northerly direction. = Right-hand Branch = The Right-Hand Branch runs eastwards up a slight incline from the junction, where exotic trees have since been planted on either side of the track. It then runs north-eastwards towards a skid serving some draglines. It is partially overgrown, but continuous lengths of wooden rail, including a section of double tramline, are present, and there are metal rails further along the branch. There were also several bridges and side branches with skid sites and draglines, including two to the south that crossed the stream. Recorded artefacts include numerous bogey wheels.  Licences  The tramway license allowed the Dinwoodie Timber Company Limited \\"to occupy the land specified in the Schedule hereto as a tramway route for the purpose of using and maintaining a tram-line and running a tram thereon,\\"Tramway License PN/38/42/4, Archives NZ File F1 23/3/42/8 An attached plan showed the extent of the existing tramway, which crossed the Bulls‚ÄìTaumarunui Road (now State Highway 4) to join the North Island Main Trunk railway. The license did not allow for any other use of the land such as felling of trees for maintenance of the tramline, this was to be assessed and charged for. The Forest Service reserved a strip of native bush along the road for scenic purposes, when it sold the licence for timber harvesting.Krustysimplex: '385mm (approx) dia wheels, Dinwoodie's tram near Erua.' Dinwoodie was required to provide free carriage of young trees and materials for replanting for the New Zealand Forest Service, when unloaded trolleys were returning to the bush. The State Forests Service planted Western Red Cedar and Lawson's Cypress along the tramway in the 1930s as part of an experimental high-altitude planting programme. They cannot be harvested without damaging the historical and archaeological remains of the tramway and are now slowly being overgrown by native vegetation.

The siege was an important episode in a long-running war between Mercia and Northumbria in the years 616‚Äì679. This war was fought in the area north of the River Trent, in particular in and around the Peak District (Wirksworth) and in and around Heathfield (Doncaster), Elmet (Aberford) and Lindsey (Lincoln), as these were provinces of Northumbria at the time. Background and origins In or about 616 AD, the Northumbrians, apparently attempting to expand their Anglo-Saxon kingdom under King √Üthelfrith, fought the native Britons and their allies at the Battle of Chester. The Northumbrians had the victory and allegedly slaughtered a large number of monks nearby who had prayed for a Briton victory. 'Early medieval Chester 400-1230', in A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 Part 1, the City of Chester: General History and Topography, ed. C P Lewis and A T Thacker (London, 2003), pp. 16-33. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/ches/vol5/pt1/pp16-33 The Northumbrians were then able to take control of the area north of the River Trent.Collins R, 1999 Early Mediaeval Europe 300-1000, Basingstoke, MacMillan, pp186-195 The Britons (later the Welsh), supported by the Anglo-Saxon Mercians, then attempted to regain control of the area from the Northumbrians. This resulted in a war which took place up and down Ryknield Street, Ermine Street and lesser known north‚Äìsouth Roman routes. These roads gave entry, respectively, to Northumbria from the south and to Mercia from the north. The series of battles and sieges was recorded in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons).Giles JA, 2000, History of the Britons by Nennius, Cambridge, In parentheses Publications, p 28. Later, in a more incoherent way, the battles were noted from the Northumbrian viewpoint by the Venerable Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Ecclesiastical History of the English People).Bede, 731AD Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Book 3 Battle sites and episodes *616: Battle of Chester ‚Äì A Northumbrian victory, the Briton and Mercian army defeated. Recent archaeological work at Heronbridge near Chester has identified the battle site. Davies S, 2010, The Battle of Chester and Warfare in Post-Roman Britain, Wiley, History, Vol. 95, No. 2 (318) (APRIL 2010), pp. 143-158 https://www.jstor.org/stable/24428809 *633: Battle of Hatfield Chase ‚Äì A Northumbrian army was defeated by an alliance of Mercia and Gwynedd, and Edwin of Northumbria was killed.Collins R, 1999 Early Mediaeval Europe 300-1000, Basingstoke, MacMillan, pp186-195 There are two possible locations which lay claim for this battle site. Either Hatfield Chase near Doncaster, near where a small former Roman fort at Kirk Sandall guards the south bank of the Don; or Hatfield near Cuckney in Nottinghamshire, near a former Roman camp at Gleadthorpe.264x264px *636: Morfael, a British leader, attacks Caer Lwytgoed ( Cair Luit Coit) and kills a bishop during the battle. Several locations lay claim to being this place, though most of which are not in the battle zone or cannot be dated to the period. Wirksworth church in the Peak District is a possible location. This episode appears to represent the first known battle or siege of Urbs Iudeu. Caer Lwytgoed is synonymous with Urbs Iudeu / Urbs Judeu, the Welsh and Northumbrian place-names for the same location. *642: The Battle of Aberford (a.k.a. the battle of Maes Cogwy [Battle of Maserfelth / Maserfield]) in which Oswald of Northumbria was defeated by Penda of Mercia. The battle took place where the western branch of Ermine Street crosses the Cock Beck at the Aberford Dykes (ancient fortifications).Grigg E, 2015, Early Medieval Dykes (400 to 850 AD), Thesis Phd, University of Manchester, p271 *655: The siege of Urbs Iudeu at which King Oswiu of Northumbria was compelled to buy off Penda of Mercia and Cadafael of Gwynedd by \\"delivering all the treasures which were in the city into the hands of Penda, and Penda distributed them to the Kings of the British, this is called the Restitution of Iudeu\\".Brady L, 2017 Writing the Welsh Borderlands in Anglo-Saxon England, Manchester, Manchester University Press, p 40 *655: Battle of the Winwaed (Maes Gai) ‚Äì Penda continued attempts to eject the Northumbrians building to this November battle. Penda was killed and the Mercians and Britons defeated. Oswiu of Northumbria then set up Peada as 'King' of Mercia under Northumbrian control. It was said of the battle that the river rose in flood and as many were killed by drowning as in the battle. *657‚Äì674: The Mercian nobility rebel, kill Peada and make Wulfhere king of Mercia. In 670, Oswiu dies and is succeeded by his son Ecgfrith as King of Northumbria. In 674, Wulfhere dies and is replaced by √Üthelred as King of Mercia.Zaluckyj S, 2001, Mercia: The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Central England, Almeley, Logaston Press, pp 28-30, p3 *679: Battle of the Trent ‚Äì The Northumbrians are wholly defeated by the Mercians at an unknown site near the River Trent. Outcomes and legacy The battles of the Northumbrian‚ÄìMercian war resulted from Northumbrian attempts to expand their kingdom, which originally comprised the provinces of Deira and Bernicia, including all the region north of the River Trent and in close proximity to it. This destroyed Briton supremacy in \\"the old North\\" and resulted in the war. Its eventual outcome and legacy, however, was the development and expansion of the Mercian kingdom beyond its original focal point in the Trent Valley around Tamworth and Repton. After the Battle of the Trent in 679, the border between Mercia and Northumbria appears to have been settled, with the provinces of Elmet and Heathfield becoming part of Northumbria and the provinces of The Peak District and Lindsey becoming part of Mercia. The Britons appear to retire quietly to Wales and, at least at the start of the Mercian kingdom, relations between the Mercians and the Welsh were of equal respect.Brooks N, 1989, ‚ÄúThe formation of the Mercian Kingdom‚Äù in Bassett S, The origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms, London, Leicester University Press, pp158-170 The place-names of this war cause the very greatest difficulty. Only some of these can be accurately located with modern knowledge and many have been spuriously located by antiquarians for years: Lichfield, for example, has long and wrongly claimed to be Caer Luit Coit (sometimes spelt Cair Loit Coit), but it is outside the battle area and unlike Wirksworth contains no Northumbrian stone sculpture nor remains of any Northumbrian presence: it is, in any case, south of the Trent. Stirling and Cramond have also been suggested as Urbs Iudeu, but these are far beyond the kingdoms involved in the war (Penda is simply not fighting a war in Scotland). Oswestry has been suggested as the site of the battle of Maserfelth, though it is also far too far from the battle zone and an unlikely location as the Welsh and the Mercians were allies at this time. Wirksworth in the Peak District is the principal candidate for the location of Urbs Iudeu due to its antiquity, its strategic location and its Roman and Northumbrian remains. Greater consideration of circumstances and a clearer understanding of the geography and archaeology of the conflict may help in determining the battle sites.

He represented the department of Oran, French Algeria, in the National Assembly and then the Chamber of Deputies from 1871 to 1882. He was then Senator of Oran from 1882 to 1900. Life R√©my Jacques was born on 1 January 1817 in Breteuil, Oise. After completing his law studies he enrolled as an advocate in Oran. =National Assembly (1871‚Äì76)= Jacques ran for election as Representative of the Oran department in the National Assembly on 17 February 1871, but won only 2,175 votes out of 10,167. After Joseph Andrieu resigned and L√©on Gambetta chose to represent another department there were two vacancies in the Assembly for Oran. Jacques ran again on 12 July 1871 and was elected in second place by 2,288 votes out of 7,193. This election was annulled due to irregularities in the vote counting process. Jacques ran for election again on 7 January 1872, this time successfully. He sat with the Republican Union group, Union r√©publicaine. He voted for return of the Assembly to Paris, against the resignation of Adolphe Thiers on 24 May, against the septennat, against the state of siege, against the law of mayors, against the Ministry of Albert de Broglie, for the Wallon and Pascal Duprat amendments and for the entire Constitutional law. He held office until 7 March 1876. =Deputy (1876‚Äì82)= Jacques was invited to run for the Senate in 1876, but chose to run for the Chamber of Deputies on 20 February 1876, and was elected to represent Oran by 5,638 votes out of 6,245. He sat with the left, and was a member of the budget committee. He opposed the government after the 16 May 1877 crisis, and voted with the 363 deputies against the government. He was reelected without opposition on 14 October 1877, and joined the Opportunist Republicans majority. He voted for invalidation of Louis Auguste Blanqui's election, for Article 7 of the Higher Education Act, for the new press laws and for the right of assembly. On 30 June 1881 Jacques attacked the acting Governor-General of Algeria, Albert Gr√©vy, for having caused the insurrection in Sud-Oran through his negligence. He said \\"it is necessary to rid Algeria of a man who has forever lost her trust\\". Jacques was reelected on 21 August 1881, holding office until 26 January 1882. He supported the Gambetta ministry in the Chamber before leaving for the Senate. =Senator (1882‚Äì1900)= Jacques was elected Senator of Algeria on 8 January 1882. As Senator he participated in debates over Algeria. He voted for reform of judicial staff, for credits for the Tonkin Campaign, for divorce, for expulsion of the princes, for the new military law, for reinstatement of the district poll (13 February 1889), for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and for the procedure to be followed in the Senate against General Boulanger. He was reelected on 4 January 1891 with 233 votes out of 235 due to the decisive support of Eug√®ne √âtienne. He now devoted all his energy to defense of colonization in Algeria. On 6 March 1891 he intervened in a discussion over antagonism between colonists and indigenous people and stated his regret that France had not brought more vinemakers to Algeria after the southern French vineyards had been ruined by phylloxera. After this debate a committee was set up which issued a lengthy report debated on 29 May 1893. Jacques intervened again to ask that useful proposals from the report be brought together in an organic law, which would end the administrative instability in Algeria.

The regional road numbered R323 uses this pass on its leg between Riversdale in the south and Ladismith in the Little Karoo to the north. From Riversdale, the road winds to the Garcia Pass across the Langeberg to Muiskraal in the northern foothills. The maximum slope is 1:14 on the southern descend. Toll houseThe pass was named in honor of Maurice Garcia, the commissioner of Riversdale between 1863 and 1877. He quickly came to see that a road between the recently established town of Ladismith and the coast would be of great benefit to the farmers of the Little Karoo to enable their produce to be shipped from the harbor at Mossel Bay. From horseback, Garcia himself laid out a route that is much shorter than the earlier route over the Gysmanshoek Pass. By the year 1868 his bridle path was already used by riders. In 1871, Thomas Bain upgraded the pass to enable transport by carts. Prison labor was used to construct the tracks, while the workers were housed in a temporary jail on site. The Cape Colony's Prime Minister, Sir John Gordon Sprigg officially opened the pass in November 1879. A toll house was constructed along the pass. Jimmy Luyt was the first tax collector, and after his death, his wife and Jan Swart continued this job. Nationwide, the levying of tolls stopped in 1918. The toll house was given the status of monument in 1968, one of several provincial heritages sites near Riversdale. The Kristalkloof and the Sleeping Beauty footpaths both start from the site of the toll house. The pass was reconstructed in 1976, when the road got an asphalt covering.

He is considered the architect of the famous Double Irish tax scheme used by U.S. firms such as Apple, Google and Facebook in Ireland, and a leader in the development of corporate tax planning tools, and tax legislation, for U.S. multinationals in Ireland. Personal O'Rourke comes from an established Fianna F√°il political dynasty. He is the son of former Irish Minister (various portfolios) Mary O'Rourke, nephew of former Irish T√°naiste Brian Lenihan Snr, and cousin of former Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan Jnr, and former Irish Minister of State Conor Lenihan. He chaired the college branch of Fianna F√°il at UCD and joined the national executive on graduation; however, there is no record of him still being a member. Double Irish O'Rourke is labeled the \\"great architect\\" of the Double Irish base erosion and profit shifting (\\"BEPS\\") tool, as used by U.S. multinationals in Ireland such as Google, a known client of O'Rourke's, Facebook, and Apple. As the conduit by which U.S. multinationals built untaxed offshore reserves of over US$1 trillion, the Double Irish is the largest BEPS scheme in history. O'Rourke's work on Google's BEPS tools featured in a 2018 book by Richard Brooks: The ‚Ç¨13 billion fine levied by the EU Commission on Apple's Double Irish BEPS tool, for Irish taxes avoided from 2004‚Äì2014, is the largest corporate tax fine in history. O'Rourke's PwC (Ireland) tax practice represented the Irish State in its tax defence, during the commission's Apple investigation. O'Rourke rejects the labels, but also rejects the notion that the Irish tax code shouldn't legally, and transparently, exploit loopholes in the US tax code: Other Irish financial commentators have taken a different view on this strategy: In October 2013, O'Rourke predicted the end of the Double Irish, which was closed to new entrants in January 2015. New Irish BEPS tools replaced it: the Single Malt scheme (used by Microsoft and Allergan), and the Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (\\"CAIA\\") scheme, (used by Apple in its Q1 2015 restructuring). It was O'Rourke's 2009 Commission on Taxation, that recommended expanding Irish capital allowances tax scheme to intangible assets creating the CAIA BEPS tool in the 2009 Finance Act. Accenture was an early user of the CAIA BEPS tool, when it executed the first corporate tax inversion to Ireland in 2009. Effective tax rates The Tax Justice Network estimates Ireland's effective corporate tax rate at between 2.5‚Äì4.5%, and ranks Ireland as one of the main corporate tax havens. In January 2014, O'Rourke publicly defended Ireland's BEPS tools, when the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) method of calculating effective tax rates (ETRs), showed Ireland's corporate ETR was between 2.2% to 3.8%. It renewed international controversy on Ireland as a corporate tax haven. O'Rourke defended Ireland's ETR as being close to the headline Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5%, and quoted the World Bank/PwC survey. In one February 2014 radio interview, O'Rourke asserted that \\"there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon\\", in the BEA analysis of Ireland's ETR. The disconnect lies in the distinction between Ireland's corporation tax \\"regime\\" versus Ireland's corporation tax \\"rate\\", which was highlighted by the EU Commission's 2016 findings against Apple's double Irish tax system in Ireland. According to the Irish Revenue, Apple had being paying the full Irish 12.5% tax rate on what Revenue considered to be \\"taxable profits\\" in Ireland The EU Commission found a very different situation: Experts note the potency of Ireland's corporation tax regime, and O'Rourke's BEPS tools, as opposed to the headline 12.5% corporate tax rate.Misleadingly, studies cited by the Irish Times and other outlets suggest that the effective tax rate is close to the headline 12.5 percent rate ‚Äì but this is a fictional result based on a theoretical ‚Äòstandard firm with 60 employees‚Äô and no exports: it is entirely inapplicable to transnationals. Though there are various ways to calculate effective tax rates, other studies find rates of just 2.5‚Äì4.5 percent. Legacy The ETRs of 0‚Äì2.5% from O'Rourke's BEPS tools have drawn international criticism. Academic research has shown Ireland as a major tax haven (see tax haven lists), and in June 2018 tax academics showed Ireland to be the largest global tax haven, helping U.S. multinationals to shield over $100 billion in annual profits from Irish and U.S. taxation. O'Rourke's defense of Ireland's low corporate ETRs for U.S.‚Äìcontrolled multinationals is part of Ireland's \\"green jersey agenda\\" to advance \\"Ireland Inc.\\" over other potential consequences, such as reputation or financial risk, which is not an uncommon political strategy in Ireland. Regardless of the tax losses to other nations, O'Rourke's BEPS tools have brought prosperity to Ireland. 25 of Ireland's top 50 firms (by turnover) are U.S.‚Äìcontrolled multinationals, employing one quarter of Ireland's private sector workforce, paying 80% of Irish business taxes, and creating 57% of Irish private sector non-farm value-add in Ireland. (see low tax economy). O'Rourke's BEPS tools however have been less effective in attracting non‚ÄìU.S. multinationals to Ireland, or more accurately, multinationals from \\"territorial\\" tax systems (e.g. the U.K post their 2009 transformation to a \\"territorial\\" tax system). Bloomberg noted in October 2013 that O'Rourke is regarded a \\"hero\\" in Ireland. He is a sought after commentator on the Irish economy, and on Irish corporate taxation policy. O'Rourke has sat on several major Irish State taxation review groups, including the major 2009 Commission on Taxation, and is one of the 5 people named in Ireland's \\"Independent Persons of Standing\\" list under the Double Taxation Arbitration Convention. In February 2014, he was named in the Irish Times 50 people who run Ireland list. O'Rourke sits on the Board of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, the lobby group for U.S. multinationals in Ireland. In March 2018, he noted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be a challenge to Ireland's U.S. economic model but that Ireland should be able to withstand it. In April 2018, he advised that the Irish State should build a rainy day fund. O'Rourke maintains an active Twitter account.

The formation and activities of the BMPC represents a long struggle between activists and successive governments of Karnataka over the devolution of planning powers to local authorities as per the Constitution (74th) Amendment Act, 1992. Currently ambiguity surrounds the function and authority of the BMPC given that its mandate overlaps with the powers of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the de facto planning authority for the Bangalore metropolitan region.  Background  The BMPC was formed according to the requirements of The Constitution (74th) Amendment Act, 1992. This Act mandated the formation of a planning authority for each metropolitan area and tasked it with the responsibility of preparing a draft development plan. Due to the reluctance of the successive Governments of Karnataka to shift planning responsibilities from the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to a Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC), this amendment was not implemented for more than 20 years. When the Siddaramaiah government moved to set up a new Bangalore task force in March 2014 called the Vision Group, activists successfully petitioned the High Court to stay the task force until the formation of a BMPC. Following notification of the Draft Metropolitan Planning Committee Rules by the Government of Karnataka in 2013, the formation of a Bangalore Metropolitan Planning Committee (BMPC) was formalized in January 2014 following pressure by the High Court of Karnataka. T R Raghunandan, former Joint Secretary, Panchayati Raj, Government of India described the MPC rules as \\"symptomatic of a much deeper dysfunctionality\\" due to the fact that planning responsibilities are currently concentrated in the hands of parastatals such as the BDA and BMRDA which were created prior to the 74th amendment. For the MPC to work properly, Karnataka will need to reform the whole planning system to factor in the spirit and requirements of the amendment. The first Committee had 30 members comprising elected corporators from the BBMP, commissioners from other civic agencies and ministers of the state legislature. The chairman of the Committee was the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Having formed the BMPC at the behest of the court, and under pressure from activists, the government showed little enthusiasm for the committee and no meetings where called between September 2014 and February 2016, after which it was dissolved. A new committee was elected in February 2016 and has met on several occasions since then, albeit with members reporting that the meeting are informal and lasted no more than a few minutes over a cup of tea. In June 2018, following government efforts to appoint a new expert led advisory committee, the Bengaluru Blueprint Task Force, the High Court directed the Government to transfer all documents to the BMPC.

She was a founder and leading force of the Navvy Mission Society. Life Garnett was born in Otley in 1839. Her father conducted a service as Vicar of Otley for the men killed building the Bramhope Tunnel. The impressive monument is now listed and commemorated the work of the navvies who built the tunnel. Garnett married a clergyman but within a year she was a widow. In about 1872 Garnett was moved by a camp of navvies who were encamped near her home who were involved in building Lindley Wood Reservoir. She opened a Sunday School at the site and within a year she resolved to move to the camp. She was joined in her work by the Reverend Lewis Moule Evans. The Sunday School teachers and Evans founded a mission to the navvies by writing hundreds of letters to obtain support. The crowdsourcing created what was formally called the Christian Excavators' Union, although the Reverend Lewis Moule Evans took a lot of the credit for creating what became known as the \\"Navvies' Mission\\". The mission was founded in 1877 and Garnett was the force within it. That year she published Little Rainbow which was the first of the \\"navvy novels\\" which provided funds to the mission. Garnett is regarded as a co-founder even though she was not recognised as a leader of the mission. The mission grew and besides supplying missionaries the mission supplied libraries to enable education at other remote camps for navvies as well as soup kitchens and saving banks. Evans had died in 1878 and Garrett became involved in further missions. The Church of England was supportive and when the Embsay Reservoir was built near Skipton the mission was based in a mill that provided a living space for 150 workers. The transformation in working conditions led to the mill being called a \\"mansion\\". The Navvy Mission Society merged with the Christian Social Union (UK) in 1919 to form the Industrial Christian Fellowship, which continued to develop issues of social justice and business ethics. Garnett died in Croydon in 1921. Five years later a memorial was erected to her in Ripon Cathedral.

The county hall, which was the meeting place of Northumberland County Council from 1910 to 1981, is a Grade II listed building. History In the early 20th century the Moot Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne had been the local facility for dispensing justice and the meeting place of Northumberland County Council. After deciding that the old Moot Hall was inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected for the new building was within the Moot Hall precincts which formed an exclave of Northumberland. The new building was designed by J. A. Bain in the classical style and completed in 1910. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of thirteen bays facing south east; the central section of five bays featured a porch with Doric order columns supporting a triglyph frieze on the ground floor and sash windows on each of five floors above; the left and right sections of had sections of three bays which slightly projected forwards. An extension down to the Side and the top storeys were designed by Cackett, Burns, Dick and McKellar and completed in 1933. Following the creation of the county of Tyne and Wear in 1974 the County Hall was extraterritorial to the county of Northumberland, and so in the late 1970s Northumberland County Council decided to re-establish County Hall in Morpeth, to provide them with a meeting place within the territorial limits of the county; the county council completed the move to Morpeth in April 1981. The building in Newcastle was converted into a hotel, becoming the \\"Vermont Hotel\\" under the management of Lincoln Group in 1993. Visitors to the hotel at that time included the singer, Engelbert Humperdinck, in 2001. Meanwhile, the film, School for Seduction, starring the actress, Kelly Brook, was filmed in the hotel in 2004. After Lincoln Group went into administration in January 2012, the hotel changed ownership and was acquired by Gainford Hotels in April 2012. The television presenters, Ant & Dec, visited the hotel for a charity event in May 2015.

As a Senior Researcher of the National Fund for Scientific Research (NFSR) at the University of Li√®ge, Belgium, in the Department of Geology, Steemans studies fossilised spores from Palaeozoic, mainly from their first occurrence in the Ordovician (or possibly Cambrian) up to the Devonian.  Early life and education  Steemans was educated at the Ath√©n√©e Royal de l'Air Pur located at Seraing, Belgium, from 1963 up to 1976 and at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium where he earned a BS (1980) and a PhD (1986) in Geology and Palynology. He is living at Anthisnes, a small village not far from the University of Li√®ge.  Career and impact  After completing his Ph.D. in 1986, Steemans worked in applied geology at the S.A. Carmeuse which extracts limestone in quarries from Belgium and from other countries. Since 1990 he was appointed NFSR Associated Researcher at the University of Li√®ge and since 2009 he is NFSR Senior Researcher. Steemans is a palynologist and has played a key role in expanding our understanding of first miospore evolution and the terrestrialisation of land plants. He has provided evidence for the first undoubted cryptospores in the Ordovician in Argentina. Later, he has discovered the first trilete spores in the Late Ordovician in Saudi Arabia demonstrating the possible first appearance of vascular land plant much earlier than previously believed. Much earlier he had established a detailed biostratigraphic scale based on trilete spores for the Lower Devonian still universally used. Steemans has focused mainly his research on systematics of spores, biostratigraphy, palaeoecology and palaeophytogeography. Recently (2017) he has been involved in a team who has analysed minerals included in leiospheres from the Emsian of Saudi Arabia. Novel methods for discriminating biological from nonbiological chemistries of microfossil-like structures are of the utmost importance in the search for evidence of early life on Earth. This, too, is important for the search for life on Mars by in situ analyses via rovers or sample return missions for future analysis here on Earth In addition to conducting fundamental research in Palaeozoic palynology, he is also working on applied palynology as expert in miospore for petroleum societies like Totalfina, Petrobras, Saudi Aramco etc.  Awards and honors  * Jun 1991 ‚Äì Prix du Pr√©sident Andr√© Leroux des ¬´ Amis de l'Universit√© de li√®ge ¬ª.

This lake extends entirely in the canton of Poisson. This lake, which is part of the natural course of the M√©giscane River and collects the waters of the Suzie River by artificial deviation. It is famous thanks to the M√©giscane Dam, built to its natural mouth. This dam was erected in 1954 to divert current from Suzie River and from the upper part of the M√©giscane River to an eastbound diversion channel to the Gouin Reservoir, thereby further feeding downstream the hydroelectric power stations on the Saint-Maurice River. Hydropower is the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry and recreational tourism activities, second. The \\"Du Po√®te Lake\\" hydrographic slope is served on the North side by a forest road (East-West direction) serving the M√©giscane Dam, as well as by the forest road R1009 (North-South direction) serving the West of the Gouin Reservoir.

Killendoon is on the Ewenma Creek Macquarie River outside Warren, New South Wales.  History  Before European settlement the area is said to have been occupied by the Ngiyambaa Aborigines. Explorer John Oxley camped on the present town site during his investigation of the Macquarie River in 1818. He noted an abundance of kangaroos and emus. Charles Sturt carried out further exploration in 1828‚Äì29. Cattle were grazing hereabouts by the late 1830s. Warren station was established in 1845 by Thomas Readford and William Lawson, the son of explorer William Lawson who was a member of the first European party to breach the Blue Mountains in 1813. Some say the name derives from a local Aboriginal word, meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"substantial\\". Another theory is that it represents the adoption of a contemporary English term, \\"warren\\", meaning a game park - perhaps a reference to the picturesque riverside setting where the station hut was built (on what is now Macquarie Park) and to the large numbers of wildlife in the area. A post office opened in 1861, a bootmaker's shop (made of bark) in 1863, a store in 1866, a school in 1867, an Anglican church in 1873, the first courthouse in 1874 and the first bridge in 1875. However, closer settlement did not really develop until the late 1880s. Warren was incorporated as a municipality in 1895 and the Warren Weir was established in 1896. The town benefited greatly with the arrival of the railway in 1898, making it the rail head for an enormous area. In general terms, its prosperity rose and fell with the price of wool. In the 1920s the town developed quite substantially. In the Great Depression the economy shrank, expanding again in the postwar years. The eternal water shortage was greatly eased when Burrendong Dam was opened in 1967, allowing the development of cotton and produce.

It goes back to a 1390 hymn, which later appeared as \\"'Freu dich, du werte Christenheit\\". The final version appeared first in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of 1975, later in several regional sections of the Gotteslob.  History  The current hymn goes back to around 1390, when a Ein Mainzer Prozessionale (A Mainz processional , meaning a book of processional hymns) has a chant with the incipit \\"Disse oisterliche dage\\" (These Easter days). The five stanzas appear as verses of the Marian antiphon \\"Regina celi letare\\". A Breslau manuscript from 1478 lists three stanzas which are related to three stanzas of the Mainz source (1,2,5) but in reverse order, now beginning \\"Frew dich, alle Christenheit\\" (Be joyful, all Christendom). The hymn, now \\"Freu dich, du werte Christenheit\\", became part of the of 1947, in an attempt to unify Catholic hymn singing in German. The current text, finally \\"Nun freue dich, du Christenheit\\", was adapted for the first common Catholic hymnal, the Gotteslob of 1975, which had the hymn in its common section. The following edition Gotteslob of 2013 has it no longer in the common section, but in 19 of the 24 regional sections. The Diocese of Mainz has it as GL 817.

The structure, which overlooks the Tyne Bridge, is a Grade I listed building. History The building was commissioned as a courthouse to replace the facilities at the Castle which were used for holding assizes and which had been condemned for their inconvenience and unhealthiness. The site selected had formed part of Pons Aelius in Roman times and two copper coins from the time of the Emperor Antoninus Pius and two Roman altars were found during preparatory work on site. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Earl Percy on 22 July 1810. It was designed by John Stokoe in the Greek Revival style and completed in August 1812. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of eleven bays facing north west with the end bays slightly projected forwards; the central section of three bays featured an tetrastyle portico with Doric order columns supporting a pediment. Internally, the principal rooms were the Grand Jury room (straight ahead from the entrance), the nisi prius court (on the left) and the crown court (on the right). A significant number of cells for prisoners were created in the basement. Alterations were carried out to a design by William Crozier, Durham County Architect, in 1877. The building continued to be used as the county facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, the building was also used as a meeting place for Northumberland County Council until it moved to County Hall in 1910. An inquiry in to the loss of SS Ina Mactavish was held at the Moot Hall in December 1907 and February 1908. The trial of the then 11 year old Mary Bell for the murder of two young boys took place at Newcastle Assizes in 1968. Other notorious court cases held at the Moot Hall included the trial of Robert Black for the murder of four young girls committed between 1981 and 1986 and the trial of Albert Dryden for the murder of Harry Collinson in June 1991. The Moot Hall heard all Crown Court cases before the new combined court complex was completed on the Quayside in 1998. After becoming licensed as a venue for civil weddings, the Moot Hall hosted its first civil wedding in September 2005. In March 2019 Her Majesty's Courts Service decided that the building was surplus to requirements and instructed estate agents, Avison Young, to market it for sale. It was announced in October 2019 that the building had been acquired by the property business, Gainford Group, which also owned the Vermont Hotel, located immediately to the north of the Moot Hall.

She showed promise as a juvenile in 1955 when she won three of her six races. She reached her peak in the following spring when she won the Free Handicap and the took the 1000 Guineas. She never won again but finished fourth in the Epsom Oaks and third in the Yorkshire Oaks before being retired from racing at the end of the year. She had some success as a broodmare. Background Honeylight was a bay mare bred and owned by Victor Sassoon. During her racing career she was trained by Charles Elsey at his Highfield Stable in Malton, North Yorkshire. Her regular jockey Edgar Britt described her as a \\"placid and gentle\\" horse. Honeylight was sired by Honeyway, a top class racehorse whose wins included the July Cup, Cork and Orrery Stakes and Champion Stakes. As a breeding stallion he initially had fertility problem but sired many good winners including Great Nephew. Honeylight's dam Crepuscule won only one minor race, but was an exceptional broodmare, who went on to produce Crepello and Twilight Alley. Racing career =1955: two-year-old season= Honeylight ran six times as a juvenile in 1955 and won three times over the minimum distance of five furlongs. She was among the first three finishers on two of her other starts and was regarded as a speedy and consistent performer, but some way below the best of her generation. =1956: three-year-old season= Honeylight began her second campaign by winning the Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket in April. The 143rd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile on 4 May attracted a field of 19 runners with the Princess Elizabeth Stakes winner Victoria Cross starting favourite ahead of the French challenger Midget while Honeylight, ridden by Edgar Britt, went off at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16.7/1). Eighteen of the fillies raced up the stands side (the left-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) whilst Midget raced alone on the far side of the wide, straight course. Honeylight went to the front soon after the start and came home well clear of the stands side group and two lengths clear of Midget, whose jockey Roger Poincelet misjudged the finish and believed that he had won comfortably. Third place went to Honeylight's stablemate Arletta. Edgar Britt was again in the saddle when Honeylight was stepped up in distance for the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles on 8 June. She started the 11/2 second choice in the betting and finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind Sicarelle. After a two month break, she returned for the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August and finished third behind Indian Twilight and Kandy Sauce. For her final start she was brought back in distance and finished third in the Straitlace Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Assessment and honours The independent Timeform organisation gave Honeylight a rating 125 in 1956. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Honeylight an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Honeylight was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least nine foals and three winners between 1959 and 1972: *Ribotlight, a bay colt, foaled in 1959, sired by Ribot. Winner. *Come On Honey, chestnut filly, 1960, by Never Say Die.

The company executes the port policy of the Government and coordinates and controls the efficiency of the port system, made up of 28 Port authorities that manage the 46 ports of general interest. This company, along with ENAIRE, exists for a constitutional mandate in Article 149, which grants the State the exclusive competence of ports and airports. Competences The functions of the company are regulated in the Royal Legislative Decree 2/2011, of September 5, about State Ports and the Merchant Navy: * The execution of the Government's ports policy and the coordination and control of efficiency of the Ports System of State, in the terms foreseen in this law. * The general coordination with the different bodies of the General State Administration that establish controls in the port spaces and with modes of transport in the scope of state competition, from the point of view of port activity. * Training, promotion of research and technological development in matters related to economy, management, logistics and port engineering and others related to the activity carried out in ports, as well as the development of measurement systems and techniques operations in marine oceanography and climatology necessary for the design, exploitation and management of port areas and infrastructures. * The planning, coordination and control of the Spanish maritime signaling system, and the promotion of training, research and technological development in these matters. The coordination in maritime signaling is carried out through the Lighthouses Commission. Spanish Ports System According to the Royal Legislative Decree 2/2011, the system consists of two types of ports; the ports of regional ownership, which depend on the governments of the Autonomous Communities where they are located and the ports of State ownership, that is, the ports qualified as of general interest for gathering some of the following features: =Characteristics of ports of general interest= # That international maritime commercial activities take place in them. # That its area of commercial influence affects significantly more than one Autonomous Community. # That serve industries or establishments of strategic importance for the economy of the Nation. # That the annual volume and the characteristics of its maritime commercial activities reach sufficiently relevant levels or respond to essential needs of the general economic activity of the State. # That due to their special technical or geographical conditions constitute essential elements for the safety of maritime traffic, especially in the islands (mainly the Canary and Balearic Islands. =Members of State's Ports= The Spanish State Port System is composed of 46 ports of general interest, managed by 28 Port authorities, whose coordination and efficiency control corresponds to the Ports of the State company, a body under the Ministry of Public Works that is responsible for the execution of the Government's ports policy. Port activity and maritime transport contribute 20% to the GDP of the transport sector. The Law provides the Spanish port system with the necessary instruments to improve its competitive position in an open and globalized market, establishing a management autonomy regime for the Port Authorities, which must exercise their activity with business criteria. =Spanish Port Authority Model= Within this framework, it is intended that the management of ports of general interest respond to the so-called \\"landlord\\" model, in which the Port Authority is limited to being a provider of infrastructure and port land and to regulate the use of this public domain, while the services are mainly provided by private operators under authorization or concession regime.

Early life She was born at Pontgibaud, the daughter of Elie Mayade, a blacksmith, and his wife F√©licie, a dressmaker. She studied art in Paris, staying with an aunt who kept a gallery in Montmartre; there she became associated with Maurice Utrillo and Suzanne Valadon. At the age of seventeen, she became a pupil of Auguste Renoir. She joined the French Communist Party. At the outbreak of the Second World War, she was teaching at a girls' school; she soon joined the Resistance and did not hide her political beliefs. Wartime activities On 30 October 1941, Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French, broadcast on the BBC from London, encouraging a national \\"Stand to Attention\\", in which French people would observe a five-minute silence in memory of those killed by the Germans, as a protest against the occupation of France. In 1943, when Garcin-Mayade encouraged her pupils to participate in another such exercise, two of them reported her to the authorities, and she was arrested and sentenced to five years' hard labour. On 10 May 1944, she was deported to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. While at Ravensbr√ºck she was accused of sabotage and was transferred to a punishment camp at Rechlin. There she was encouraged by another Resistance member, Paulette Pradel, to begin drawing again. She produced many works illustrating the prisoners and the terrible conditions at the camp. The camp was liberated by the Swedish Red Cross in 1945, but her art works were burned for fear of typhus contamination. She later recreated many of them from memory, in oils and other media. Legacy On the 70th anniversary of the Liberation, an exhibition of Garcin-Mayade's work was held in her home town of Pontgibaud. Many of her works are on permanent display at the Mus√©e Michelet in Brive. In her birthplace of Pontgibaud, the Coll√®ge Anna Garcin-Mayade was renamed in her honour.

Synopsis  The book warns against the breakdown of \\"mutual toleration\\" and respect for the political legitimacy of the opposition. This tolerance involves accepting the results of a free and fair election where the opposition has won, in contrast with advocacy for overthrow or spurious complaints about the election mechanism. The authors also assert the importance of respecting the opinions of those who come to legitimately different political opinions, in contrast to attacking the patriotism of any who disagree, or warning that if they come to power they will destroy the country. The authors point out that the various branches of government in a system with separation of powers have actions available to them that could completely undermine the other branches or the opposition. The authors warn against ramming through a political agenda or accumulating power by playing \\"constitutional hardball\\" with tactics like court packing, stonewalling nominations, or abusing the power of the purse, and recommend \\"forbearance\\" and some degree of cooperation to keep government functioning in a balanced fashion. Other threats to democratic stability cited by the authors include economic inequality and segregation of the political parties by race, religion, and geography. The authors dedicate many chapters to the study of the United States, President Donald Trump, and the 2016 presidential election, but also apply their theory to Latin America and European countries, especially Venezuela and Russia. According to them, the United States has, until 2016, resisted the attempts to undermine democracy thanks to two norms: mutual toleration and forbearance, the latter defined as the intentional restraint of one's power in order to respect the spirit of the law if not its letters. They finally predict three potential scenarios for the post-Trump United States.  Analysis  Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, Harvard professors, study the prospect of the democratic system in an holistic approach, and take a critical stand of the Trump presidency. They describe their work as a study of how democracies die. The main subjects are drawn in the introduction: the authors argue that in our time, democracies still die but by different means, \\"less at the hand of men with guns and more by elected leaders\\". The methodology used is mainly based on the \\"comparative method\\" and it is a book that tries to \\"reveal about our future\\" based on history, more specifically on historical comparisons (finding similar dynamics, presenting models of \\"gatekeeping\\" and the \\"rhymes\\" of history). The object of the study is the president Trump as an \\"autocrat in becoming\\" and, a comparison with state failures and autocrats. The study assesses the risk of his presidency and try to identify the pattern of autocratic tendencies. = Recommendations of the authors = Levitsky and Ziblatt accept the fear of the Trump presidency as legitimate and pledge for the protection of the democracy. Particularly the last chapter saving democracy, put emphasis on political recommendations to save democracy in a pledge A proposed solution to the crisis And they make recommendations for the Republicans And also to the Democrats In an interview, Levitsky identifies two objectives of the book: One is defeating Trump and the other is shoring up our democracy . Finally, they suggest that the effect of the Trump presidency could be a mild form of \\"competitive authoritarianism\\" see the work: THE RISE OF COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIANISM Steven Levitsky and Lucan A. Way  Reviews and awards  The New York Times called it an essential guide to what can happen in the United States. The Washington Post said the book offers a sober look at the current state of affairs. The Wall Street Journal called it an unintentional clarifying lesson. In the United Kingdom, The Guardian called it provocative but also unsatisfying. The magazine Foreign Affairs concluded it is an important study. Fair Observer called it an original contribution valuable to researchers, policy makers, and citizens. Columbia University historian Adam Tooze described the book as the \\"most thought-provoking book comparing democratic crises in different nations.\\" In a scholarly review, political theorist Rosolino A. Candela praised the work and concluded that academics will find \\"much to learn, unpack, and develop\\". The book was on The New York Times Bestseller list.

He was born in Lynn, Massachusetts on March 16, 1753, and died and was buried in the Outlet, Lower Canada (now Magog, Quebec) in 1825. His grandfather, Ralph Merry, arrived in New England in the late seventeenth century from London, England. He sold his vessel, married and settled in Lynn, Massachusetts, where he had one son, Ralph II. Ralph III married Sarah Sylvester, with whom he had eight children. He served in the American Revolution, enlisting in 1775, stationed in Lynn and nearby Salem, Massachusetts. After the war, he lived for a time in Providence, Rhode Island, and then moved to St. Johnsbury, Vermont in 1792. Like many Americans at the time, Merry was enticed by the prospect of land in Lower Canada, which was then being freely offered to those who would swear loyalty to the Crown. Merry purchased large tracts and settled at the Outlet on Lake Memphremagog in 1798. The village that grew from this settlement would be renamed as Magog in 1855. Merry developed saw and grist mills on the Magog River, as well as ironworks, though these were unsuccessful due to the poor ore quality of the region. He continued to develop the village with a carpenter's shop, wool mill, and a general store that opened in 1820. By 1823 this was a stage stop on the mail route between Montreal and Stanstead. Merry built a comfortable home for his family in 1821, which still stands today as the oldest structure in Magog. Merry died in 1825 and is interred at Pine Hill Cemetery in Magog.

It begins at Baltimore Lake at an elevation of 7,184 feet, roughly 10.8 miles west-northwest of Donner Pass in the Tahoe National Forest in Nevada County, California.  Course  After leaving its headwaters at Baltimore Lake, an alpine glacial lake, it flows due north for less than a mile and enters French Lake Reservoir ‚Äî a man-made lake created by French Lake Dam, which was first constructed in 1859, reconstructed in 1948, and is managed by the Nevada Irrigation District. After flowing 1.2 miles to the northwest below the dam, Canyon Creek enters its second man-made reservoir ‚Äî Faucherie Lake. Then, 1.4 miles further northwest, it enters the third of four man-made reservoirs, this time Sawmill Lake, before continuing another mile to the northwest and entering the largest of the four man-made reservoirs ‚Äî Bowman Lake. Canyon Creek then proceeds to plunge nearly 3,000 feet in elevation in just 9.1 miles through a steep canyon before its mouth at the South Yuba River at an elevation of 2,800 feet just 2.6 miles due east of the town of Washington, California.  Recreation  It's during this steep, nine- mile section that Canyon Creek is used for recreation in the form of whitewater kayaking. A 2.4 mile Class IV to V run begins at an old bridge site on Arctic Mine Road and treks southwest until its confluence with the South Yuba. The run is functional when flows from Bowman Dam are between 250 and 350 cubic feet per second. There are dozens of campgrounds for recreational use along Bowman Road during the summer months, and fishing is popular at each of the four man-made lakes, as well as Baltimore Lake.

In 1776, he became the President of the Anacreontic Society, after the death of the previous President, George Bellas. Star Spangled Banner Early publications of the song ascribe its lyrics to the Society's president, Ralph Tomlinson. Tomlinson was baptized in Plemstall, Cheshire, in 1744; by 1766 he was a lawyer working in London. Tomlinson likely became president of the Society following the death of the previous president, George Bellas, in January 1776. The lyrics are \\"a good-natured takeoff on a bit of pseudoclassical mythology\\". Tomlinson died in March 1778 at the age of thirty-three. Ralph Tomlinson and John Stafford Smith were credited for composing the music for The Anacreontic Song: a song that was used to put music to Francis Scott Key's poem, Defence of Fort M‚ÄôHenry. The song became the United States National anthem on March 3, 1931. Long before songs were protected by copyright, the melodies of songs were used by anyone without compensation. The song was written for a social club. John Stafford Smith wrote the music and Tomlinson, who was president of the club, wrote the lyrics.

He was born on 6 January, 1826 in Hamburg, Germany, and was baptized Heinrich Friedrich. He worked as a builder and designer, and spent some years in Austria and Russian Poland. He moved to the United States in 1847, spending some time in Kentucky, then moving north due to his health, living in Chester, Nova Scotia where he had an uncle. He continued designing and building wooden houses, and met his wife in nearby Hubbards. They married on 27 December 1860 and moved to Halifax. On arrival in Halifax he joined architect Henry Elliot as a draftsman, and by April 1862 they were partners. Between 1857 and 1861 three fires had created the need to rebuild whole blocks in the business district of Halifax, and new regulations demanded that construction in the city centre use fire-proof materials rather than timber. The partners were responsible for the design of several blocks of business buildings in brick, stone, fire-stone, and granite. In 1863 they got the contract to design the new Halifax County jail. Other joint projects included a house for William Cunard (1864), the Halifax Protestant Industrial School (1871) and a Presbyterian church on Tobin Street (1871). From the time of its construction in 1872 until the early 1890s, Busch lived in the right-side of the townhouse at 2575 - 2581 Creighton Street, Halifax, now a municipally registered heritage property. Between 1868 and 1875 he and his wife were involved in several real-estate transactions. In 1874 Busch became a British citizen, and in 1877 he began practising on his own. His works include the Halifax Academy building, the provincial Normal School at Truro, the Provincial and City Hospital in Halifax, the Halifax Poor‚Äôs Asylum (1886), the bandstand in the Halifax Public Gardens (1887), Convent of the Sacred Heart Chapel, Salvation Army Citadel, and Halifax Visiting Dispensary. Busch retired in 1899 and died in Halifax on 26 January 1902.

On 8 May 1965, over twenty years after her death, she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  Early life  Safronova was born in 1918 to a Russian family in the village of Baksheevo, but her family moved to village of Lgovsky shortly after her birth, and in 1921 the village was officially incorporated into the city of Bryansk proper. After completing school she worked as the leader of a pioneer detachment and later as a supervisor in a small savings bank that was later used as hideout by resistance members during German occupation. She was also a member of the Komsomol. World War II Not long after the German invasion of the Soviet Union Safronova began working as a partisan intelligence officer for the Kratsov Braynsk Partisan Detachment. In early September 1941 she participated on a mission where the unit parachuted into the Kletnya forest behind enemy lines, after which they engaged in several ambushes and sabotage operations while gathering intelligence, requiring her to cross the front lines on numerous occasions. After the Germans constructed a new theater in her hometown of Bryansk she and her fellow partisans hatched a plan to disrupt the opening ceremony. While the mayor was giving a speech another partisan turned off the lights so they could toss around anti-Axis pamphlets; after the brief incident Safronova ran away to the bathroom. While leaving the theater she accepted a ride from a German officer she knew and used that opportunity to pinpoint the location of a German airfield as well as what types of defenses the Luftwaffe aircraft were equipped with after she was made to work shoveling snow at the airfield. After she relayed the information to Soviet Intelligence, bombers were able to destroy 58 German aircraft and five anti- aircraft batteries based on the information she had collected. Later she transmitted information on the locations of fuel depots, ammunition storage facilities, and the schedules of German trains. On one of her most successful missions she and a partisan dressed as a German police officer delivered a crate of TNT from Moscow to Byransk, which was used to attack a factory that produced tanks and motor vehicles. Under her leadership the partisan unit increased to 50 members and maintained ten safehouses across the city. The unit derailed trains, sabotaged cars and communications systems, laid landmines, and killed German soldiers. Eventually German military intelligence managed to acquire a photograph of Safronova and increased their efforts to capture her. After the Byansk partisans' radio broke in February 1942 a crew of seven partisans, with Safronova the only female member, made their way on foot Belev (over 100 kilometers away) which was not occupied by the Germans in order to hand over maps and other important documents about enemy military activities to the Red Army. On the route the partisans escaped German military patrols twice, walked through deep snow, and destroyed field fortifications with a machine gun. Only a week after delivering the documents she suffered a severe concussion on 16 March 1942 and was sent to a Soviet hospital, but parachuted with supplies from Moscow into German-occupied territory immediately after recovering in May. The day after she parachuted in the detachment was confronted by a German search party; during the confrontation Safronova took over the duties of a machine gunner. Throughout Spring 1942 many partisans from her unit were wounded during intense fighting. Safronova found herself in the hospital again after suffering repercussions from her previous head injury. While in the Monino hospital she learned that she had been awarded the Order of the Red Star. After leaving the hospital she toured Soviet controlled territory and was gifted with a brand new submachine gun from the Ivanovo Kosmosol Committee. Shortly after she flew back to Bryansk from Moscow she and two other partisans, one of whom was her company commander, got lost in the forest while searching for the rest of the detachment, which had recently retreated after heavy battle. While staying in an abandoned dugout to survive the winter cold the three were discovered by German forces and taken hostage. Safronova attempted to resist capture by firing on them with her submachine gun, but eventually lost consciousness from wounds. After she was taken to Glinnoye village by her captors she was transferred to the custody of the Bryansk Gestapo. Her head injury was treated by a German doctor in hopes that she would remember more information, but she refused to take any medicine for it. The circumstances surrounding her death are unclear, but some accounts claim she was tortured to death on 1 May 1943. 1989 Soviet envelope featuring portrait of Safronova.  Recognition  A street and secondary school in Bryansk were named in honor of Safronova. By decree of the Supreme Soviet she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1965, over twenty years after her death. In 1970 a monument in her likeness was placed in Bryansk, and in 1989 a Soviet envelope featuring her portrait (pictured) was issued.

In the Middle Ages it was also known as the Sawad, which strictly speaking designated only the southern alluvial plain, and al- ªIrƒÅq al- ªArabi (\\"Arabian IrƒÅq\\"), as opposed to \\"Persian Iraq\\", the Jibal. Lower Mesopotamia was home to Sumer and Babylonia. Delimitation The medieval Arab geographers placed the northern border between Iraq and Upper Mesopotamia (the Jazirah) in a line running from Anbar on the Euphrates to Tikrit on the Tigris, although later it was shifted to a line running due west from Tikrit, thus including several towns on the Euphrates past Anbar into Iraq. Geography An alluvial plain begins north of Baghdad and extends to the Persian Gulf. Here the Tigris and Euphrates lie above the level of the plain in many places, and the whole area is a river delta interlaced by the channels of the two rivers and by qanat. Intermittent lakes, fed by the rivers in flood, also characterize southeastern Iraq. A fairly large area () just above the confluence of the two rivers at al Qurnah and extending east of the Tigris beyond the Iranian border is marshland, known as Lake Hammar, the result of centuries of flooding and inadequate drainage. Much of it is permanent marsh, but some parts dry out in early winter, and other parts become marshland only in years of great flood. Because the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence are heavily silt-laden, irrigation and fairly frequent flooding deposit large quantities of silty loam in much of the delta area. Windborne silt contributes to the total deposit of sediments. It has been estimated that the delta plains are built up at the rate of nearly twenty centimeters in a century. In some areas, major floods lead to the deposit in temporary lakes of as much as thirty centimeters of mud. The Tigris and Euphrates also carry large quantities of salts. These, too, are spread on the land by sometimes excessive irrigation and flooding. A high water table and poor surface and subsurface drainage tend to concentrate the salts near the surface of the soil. In general, the salinity of the soil increases from Baghdad south to the Persian Gulf and severely limits productivity in the region south of Amarah. The salinity is reflected in the large lake in central Iraq, southwest of Baghdad, known as Lake Milh. There are two other major lakes in the country to the north of Lake Milh: Lake Tharthar and Lake Habbaniyah.

The French Second Army (General No√´l de Castelnau) conducted the attack as part of a general action by several French armies, to hinder the movement of German reserves to Vimy Ridge, during the decisive action of the Tenth Army in the Second Battle of Artois (9 May ‚Äì 18 June). The village of H√©buterne lies north of Albert and south of Gommecourt. After the fighting of 1914, the French and German lines ran between the village and Serre-l√®s-Puisieux (Serre) to the east, a village on the D 919 road, north of Beaumont-Hamel. About halfway from H√©buterne to Serre was (Fluorspar Farm) just inside a bulge in the German front line. After several weather delays, the Second Army attacked on 7 June, overran the German first and second lines on a front and captured Toutvent Farm. From 7 to 13 June, both sides attacked and counter-attacked but the initial French gains were held and the new positions were consolidated. The French suffered and Germans At the southern end of the battlefield, two German trenches jutted into the new French position and were fortified by the Germans to become the , known to the British in 1916 as the Quadrilateral. Background =H√©buterne and Serre= North of the Ancre river, the Auchonville Spur, the Beaucourt Spur from Colincamps and Grandcourt Spur, with the village of Serre-l√®s- Puisieux (Serre) on its summit to the north, point south-west down to the river. The Colincamps‚ÄìBeaucourt Spur has a slight east‚Äìwest rise to the north of Beaumont-Hamel, later known to the British as Redan Ridge. In the shallow valley between the Auchonvillers and Beaucourt spurs lies Beaumont-Hamel and the road to Auchonvillers. H√©buterne is north of Albert and Gommecourt lies further north. After the fighting of 1914, the front line ran between the village and Serre to the east, a village on the D 919 road, south of H√©buterne and north of Beaumont-Hamel, south-west of Puisieux and to the north-east of Mailly-Maillet. About half-way along the Rue de Serre from H√©buterne to Serre lay Ferme Toutvent, just inside the German front line. =Battle of Albert (1914)= On 21 September 1914, General Erich von Falkenhayn, Chief of Staff of (the German supreme army command), ordered the 6th Army (Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria) near Amiens, to attack westwards and envelop the French northern flank, which was south of the Somme. An offensive by the French Second Army (General No√´l Castelnau) forced Falkenhayn to divert two corps as soon as they arrived. The troops extended the front northwards from Chaulnes to P√©ronne on 24 September, to drive the French back over the Somme (from Ham to P√©ronne, the river runs north). On 26 September, the French dug in south of the Somme and on 27 September, the German II Cavalry Corps ( 2) drove back two French reserve divisions, clearing the front for the XIV Reserve Corps (General Hermann von Stein). General Louis de Maud'huy found that instead of making another attempt to get round the German northern flank, his forces were menaced by a German offensive north of the Somme going in the opposite direction. From 25 to 27 September, the French XXI Corps and X Corps north of the Somme, with four Territorial divisions and the French II Cavalry Corps on the right flank, defended the approaches to Albert. On 28 September, the French were able to stop the German advance on a line from Maricourt to Fricourt and Thiepval south of the Ancre. The Germans could see French troops in Beaumont-Hamel and Serre on the far side of the valley. On 29 September, Joffre reorganised the command of the French forces north of the Somme into a new Tenth Army. By 5 October, the German Guard Corps had reached Serre; by October, the front line on which the French and then British Armies faced the Germans around Serre had been formed, not to change until the big German retreat in Operation Alberich (9 February ‚Äì 20 March 1917). =1915= Strategic developments In March 1915, General Joseph Joffre, head of (GQG) realised that the dire state of the Russian army made a defensive strategy in France impossible. Inactivity would benefit the Germans, even though the French had only begun to replace the industrial plant and raw materials overrun in 1914 and to increase the output of munitions. General Ferdinand Foch proposed a \\"general action\\" on the Western Front to confuse the defenders and pin down reserves, then a \\"decisive action\\" at a place where the Germans would not be able to establish a new front by making only a short retirement after a breakthrough. Joffre accepted a plan to capture Vimy Ridge and exploit eastwards into the Douai plain. The French army had not completed its adaptation to siege warfare and much of the equipment necessary, particularly heavy artillery, did not exist. Joffre favoured continuous battle involving all resources but advocates of methodical battle like Foch, wanted a series of attacks, with pauses to reorganise and consolidate. Analysis of after-action reports received since 1914 led to the publication of (Objectives and Conditions of General Offensive Action, 16 April 1915) and Note 5779, a version circulated to divisional commanders. The note contained instructions on infiltration tactics, \\"rolling\\" barrages and the use of poison gas, which were to be used systematically for the first time. Joffre persuaded the British to attack on the northern flank of the Tenth Army. Tactical developments Over the winter lull, the German army began to reduce divisions from twelve to nine infantry battalions, to make it easier to shuffle whole divisions from quiet sectors. A German western offensive was cancelled in April, due to the deteriorating situation on the Eastern Front, where the Austro-Hungarian army faced collapse. The new 11th Army, which had been assembled from divisions raised in Germany over the winter and several other new divisions were sent east. The initiative in the west was left with the Entente armies, apart from the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April ‚Äì 25 May) to divert attention from the transfer of the 11th Army and attacks in the Forest of Argonne during the summer. The defences of the German army in the west had been improvised since late 1914 but in many places were vulnerable to the growing number of French heavy guns. In the spring, the began to implement a standard defensive scheme and to build a second position, far enough behind the first position, to require an attacker to pause to bring field artillery into range. The front-line trench was elaborated into a front position with three wired-in trenches and camouflaged strong points; a line of concrete machine-gun nests designed for all-round defence were sited between the front and second positions. Joffre canvassed the French army commanders for proposals for local offensives to assist the main effort by the Tenth Army but on 14 April rejected all but the plans submitted by the Second Army. Because of the manpower shortage in the Second Army, Castelnau suggested a limited attack to capture the German first position but Joffre wanted a more ambitious plan to break through the German defences, even if this narrowed the attack front. Joffre provided the 53rd Division, the XVII Corps and used the new 151st and 154th divisions to increase the XI and XIV Corps to three divisions each. Preparations were to begin immediately and be completed during late April and early May. When the Germans began the Second Battle of Ypres on 22 April, Joffre had to alter his offensive plans. Flanders was reinforced by three divisions from the Tenth Army and replaced by XVII Corps and the 53rd Division from the Second Army, which made the double attack by the Tenth and Second armies impossible to achieve. From 15 May, Joffre began preparations for the second big attack by the Tenth Army. It was even more important than during the first attack on 9 April for the other French armies to divert German attention from the Tenth Army front. On 17 May, Joffre ordered the commanders of the Second, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth armies to carry out spoiling attacks and to produce schemes for a larger effort. Prelude =Plan= Deprived of the XVII Corps and the 53rd Division, Castelnau continued to work on the plan to support the main effort by the Tenth Army, assuming that the divisions would be replaced; if not the resources would have to come from within the Second Army. XI Corps (G√©n√©ral Maurice Baumgarten) was to attack with the 21st Division (G√©n√©ral Dauvin) comprising the 64th, 65th, 93rd and 137th Infantry Regiments and the 97th Territorial Infantry Regiment. The division was so understrength that Castelnau set only the German front line and the second trench as the objective but later became more optimistic that a German collapse might occur. XI Corps was reinforced with a brigade from XIV Corps and a battalion of the 56th Division; Joffre agreed to the I Cavalry Corps moving closer to the front, ready to exploit success. Castelnau kept command of the army artillery, the 53rd Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 56th Division and the I Cavalry Corps, ready to exploit opportunities. Preparations had to be complete by 30 May and on 28 and 29 May, Castelnau issued orders for the attack to begin on 1 June. Toutvent Farm was to be attacked after two days' artillery preparation and then the troops were to dig in facing Serre to the south-east and La Louvi√®re Farm to the north-east. Once the objectives had been achieved, Castelnau would decide if reserves were to continue the attack towards La Louvi√®re Farm and Serre, then swing north. The 21st Division was reinforced by a 75 mm field gun group, heavy artillery batteries of XI Corps and part of the artillery of the 56th Division. To disguise the point of attack, the other Second Army corps were to simulate preparations on 30 and 31 May, especially with artillery-fire. On 6 June, Castelnau altered the plan to accommodate Joffre's late changes. The 21st Division with the 53rd Brigade and a battalion of the 56th Division under command, was to attack at on 7 June, with the support of 22 batteries of field guns, eight batteries of heavy artillery and 30 58 mm Crapouillot (toad) mortars; the 56th Divisional artillery was to bombard Gommecourt further north. The 51st Division was near Marieux in army reserve and the I Cavalry Corps assembled around Villers-Bocage. The deceptions on the rest of the front ordered on 28 May continued. The artillery preparation begun on 5 June had proceeded satisfactorily and by on 7 June, the 21st Division with the battalion of 56th Division on its left flank, was east of the H√©buterne‚ÄìAuchonvilliers road, opposite Toutvent Farm and the 53rd Brigade formed the second line on the west side of the road. The 51st Division in reserve, echeloned its brigades back from Bayencourt, Courcelles and Beaussart, its rear elements at Marieux and Sarton; the divisions of I Cavalry Corps gathered to the north of its billeting area. =French preparations= An attack on Toutvent Farm, from Beaumont-Hamel was a secondary effort for the larger scheme. The Second Army could conduct the attack if Joffre allotted more ammunition; surplus heavy artillery was transferred to Lorraine front and mortars to the Tenth Army, which left the Second Army with sixty heavy guns for the attack; Castelnau asked for more ammunition to be sure of destroying the German fortifications. As the preliminaries were complete, the attack could begin in four days and on 24 May, Joffre approved the plan, granted the extra ammunition and another 24 mortars. French reconnaissance found no sign of German troop or artillery transfers from the 2nd Army, which had eleven German divisions opposite from Berles-au-Bois to the Oise, to the 6th Army at Arras. The Second Army comprised twelve divisions in the XIII, XIV and XI Corps and the independent 62nd, 56th and 86th divisions. The I Cavalry Corps ( Louis Conneau), with three divisions, was concentrated to the west of Amiens from 12 May. The 21st Division was withdrawn from the front line from 24 to 26 May and replaced by Territorial troops. On 29 May, Joffre transferred the 51st Division from the Fifth Army to the Second Army to permit Castelnau to commit all of the Second Army reserve if the Germans collapsed; the attack of the Tenth Army on Vimy Ridge was postponed because of poor weather until 7 June. Joffre moved a division of the Colonial Corps into the Second Army area, in case the attack was more successful than expected; Joffre also offered the 6th Division, which was in reserve behind the Tenth Army but Castelnau declined. =German preparations= The section of the Western Front around H√©buterne was held by the 2nd Army (General Karl von B√ºlow) with its headquarters in Saint-Quentin. The 52nd Division ( Karl von Borries) held a front from Monchy- aux-Bois to Serre and on its southern flank, the XIV Reserve Corps held the ground to Montauban. Since the fighting in late 1914, the area around Toutvent Farm had become a salient about wide, jutting forward from the German lines. The German had been fortifying the area during the winter and spring 1915, because of its excellent observation over the H√©buterne‚ÄìColincamps plain. On 13 May, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 of the 26th Reserve Division was ordered to send II, III and IV Battalions to the 6th Army, which came back after 30 June, having suffered The survivors of the regiment passed on their experience with reports, demonstrations and examples of hand grenade tactics. During the month, the XIV Reserve Corps also lost six companies of replacement troops which became part of Reserve Infantry Regiment 122. In late May, the Germans detected French preparations opposite the new 52nd Division. Air reconnaissance discovered five new communication trenches near Toutvent Farm. Troops could hear wagons moving from Auchonvillers at night and from the lines of RIR 119 around Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre (Beaumont) wagons were seen moving between Albert and Auchonvillers. The French dug saps forward from the front line then linked them by digging sideways and more new communication trenches were spotted. Germans travelling through occupied villages in the neighbourhood heard rumours from the inhabitants that they would soon be liberated. Battle =7 June= At a lull in the French artillery-fire, that bad begun some hours earlier, ended and bombardment resumed on the defences of RIR 119. After thirty minutes, French infantry joined in with small-arms fire and RIR 119 stood to; there was no attack and the small-arms fire stopped. There was a great deal of firing on the right flank and then silence. The French 21st Division attacked at overran the German front and second trenches on a front and surrounded Toutvent Farm. Nothing could be seen by RIR 119 through the fog and smoke of the bombardment. A runner was sent back with a message that contact has been lost with the 52nd Division on the right flank and that the regimental flank has been uncovered but that Sector S6, south of the Mailly‚ÄìSerre road, still held. A scouting party found that Toutvent Farm had been captured and that IR 170 was vulnerable to an advance around its left flank. A message arrived from the 52nd Division that the farm had fallen and the French had pressing forward to Sector Serre-East, of trench had been captured and the farm taken, after a determined defence by its garrison. The French stopped to consolidate and mop up pockets of resistance. At the fog lifted and observers of the 26th Reserve Division saw that the French had overrun the German front line for about north of the Mailly- Maillet‚ÄìSerre road and that reserves were moving forward with ammunition and trench stores. The divisional artillery at once began to fire in support of the 52nd Division. The III Battalion, IR 180 ( [Colonel] von Linck) was alerted and at noon received orders to recapture Sector S3 from La Louvi√®re Farm on the right (northern) flank and Toutvent Farm and continue the advance west of La Louvi√®re Farm. The infantry moved up via Copse 125 in sweltering heat and occasional artillery-fire. On arrival, III Battalion found that IR 170 and IR 66 had recaptured much of Sector S3 and retook Sector S4. Reinforcements began to converge on Serre and II Battalion, RIR 109 ( [Lieutenant-Colonel] von Baumbach) was ordered towards Miraumont to the south. Flanking fire from the artillery of the 26th Reserve Division was found to have great effect in supporting the defence of the 52nd Division, by pinning down the French in and behind the new front line. French counter-battery fire, guided by artillery-observation aircraft, fell on the German artillery positions but the gunners kept firing amidst the French Shrapnel shells, one battery firing during the day. The French attacked again at noon towards of IR 180 but were quickly stopped as they advanced over open ground; at more German reinforcements were ordered forward. By nightfall, French troops were consolidating on the ridge, east of Toutvent Farm, having taken and four machine-guns, for about casualties. Ammunition columns moved forward to the German artillery positions through French harassing fire but counter-attacks that night were cancelled, due to the difficulty in co-ordinating attacks at short notice. =8 June= The 21st Division continued its attack to increase the depth of the break-in but the main effort was to be made against La Louvi√®re Farm on the left (northern) flank by the 53rd Brigade, to threaten Serre with being outflanked from the north. The 53rd Brigade attack towards the farm with the 75e and 14e Infantry Regiments was to capture the German trenches north-east of Toutvent Farm along the H√©buterne‚ÄìSerre road; the rest of the Second Army was to stay on the defensive. The attack began at but the Germans had already recovered from their disorganisation on 7 June and the battalions opposite the French on 7 June had been reinforced by several more. The reinforcements counter-attacked, supported by a great volume of artillery- fire, which caused many casualties to the French reserves as they tried to move forward and pinned them down. After early success by some of the attacking units, the 53rd Brigade took until the night of to capture the last of its objectives by a grenade attack. During the evening, Castelnau sent orders to widen the breach on the southern flank along the Serre‚ÄìMailly- Maillet road to create jumping-off points for operations against Serre. The French attacked again at and advanced past Toutvent Farm, which lay in Sector S3 in the middle of the bulge in the German front line. The 8th and 11th companies of IR 180 were dispatched to reinforce the defenders of IR 170 and IR 66. The French advance was stopped after about and at the 10th Company, IR 180, counter-attacked the French in Sector S3. The German infantry advanced in the open and then recaptured the trench in hand-to-hand fighting, taking forty prisoners. The 9th and 11th companies IR 180 had advanced in support and retook the rest of S3 along with another fifty prisoners. Around the French attacked again in four waves but shortly after the infantry got going, they were repulsed again by devastating German artillery-fire; a French aircraft was shot down by German infantry during the attack. A thunderstorm drenched the battlefield but the French resumed their attacks at only to be repulsed again by the German artillery; a party of IR 180 surrounded and took prisoner 37 French troops. After an intense hour-long bombardment, the French attacked again but each effort was repulsed by German artillery-fire. Counter-battery fire from the French artillery failed to suppress the German guns but the bombardment falling on the German trenches demolished them incrementally; by the evening the German infantry had little protection. After dark, two companies from IR 66 relieved two of IR 180; I Battalion, IR 190 reached La Louvi√®re Farm. Troops sent forward to Serre found that its defences had been destroyed. After dark, patrols from RIR 119 and RIR 111 went out to mark the captured ground with flags for their artillery and fresh troops arrived from Beaumont, ready to attack up the Serre‚ÄìMailly-Maillet road. Recruits manned trench blocks, small French attacks on the front of RIR 119 were repulsed and some ground was retaken. =9 June= The French attacked further south at La Signy Farm near the Serre‚ÄìMailly-Maillet road, with the fresh 243e and 347e Infantry regiments, supported by the 233e Infantry Regiment. Thick fog delayed the French attack until most of the French were repulsed by German artillery- fire and new belts of barbed wire. Part the 52nd Division was forced back to the second line, leaving the flank of I Battalion, RIR 119 uncovered and units from RIR 121, IR 180 and IR 99 counter-attacked. An attempt to gain touch with I Battalion, IR 170 failed in the fog, as did small French attacks. Two companies of RIR 121 reinforced on the southern flank of the French break-in, to fill a gap between RIR 119 and IR 170. Conflicting orders arrived during the day, to dig in or prepare to attack and were then cancelled. Patrols reconnoitred and troops from IR 111 (28th Reserve Division) saw the French infantry being repulsed by artillery and small arms fire. Troops from III Battalion, IR 111 probed towards Toutvent Farm and found that the French were dug in on the (meadows) about west of Serre. A patrol to the right, looking for IR 66, bumped into French troops and after an exchange of hand grenades both sides retreated, the Germans with two prisoners. III Battalion, IR 180 on the right flank attacked and ejected the French in La Louvi√®re Farm and managed to link with IR 66, taking a mixed bag of 100 prisoners from the French 21st Division, XI Corps and infantry and gunners of XIV Corps. =10 June= Over Baumgarten received two regiments of the 51st Division and artillery reinforcements for another attack; lack of time for an adequate artillery preparation led to a postponement until the afternoon of 10 June. Despite many casualties from German machine-guns, the French infantry captured the German trenches south of Toutvent Farm a far as north of the Mailly- Mallet‚ÄìSerre road. At the French artillery began to bombard Sector S6 at Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre, on the southern flank of the French attack front. French infantry attacked the front of IR 170 an hour later and the French infantry were engaged by flanking fire from the 1st Company IR 180 and the 8th Company, RIR 121. French troops began to envelop the 8th Company, which retired towards Hill 143. IR 180 ran out of ammunition and the 12th Company, RIR 111 gathered spare ammunition and carried it over, losing several casualties to French artillery-fire. All of the officers of the 1st Company, IR180 were found to have become casualties and Kessler stayed behind to co- ordinate the defence. Kessler sent messengers to Serre for reinforcements, before being killed repulsing the French attack. By the time that the attack ended, hardly any of the few survivors were unwounded. The right flank or RIR 119 had been exposed and two companies of II Battalion, RIR 121 moved forward to plug the gap. The French bombardment continued and several small counter- attacks failed, through lack of force and poor co-ordination, which also prevented bigger counter-attacks by I and II battalions, RIR 99. On the right flank, Sector S3 was still vulnerable to being overrun from a dip in the ground which shielded French infantry moving up to La Louvi√®re Farm. The Germans moved troops of I Battalion IR 190 and I Battalion, RIR 180 during the night of and the following morning. Several German units had been forced to yield ground but artillery, firing from three sides, had been able to repulse the majority of the French attacks. Two fresh Bavarian battalions reached the area and the German infantry spent the night repairing trenches and putting out more wire; Serre and the adjacent sectors were taken over by the 26th Reserve Division. =11‚Äì13 June= On 11 June, Castelnau gave orders that the gains since 7 June were to be consolidated, ready to continue operations towards Serre. The Germans used the lull to dig in and relieve tired units but care was taken to leave no trace for French balloon and aircraft observers to see. It was believed that the HQ of III Battalion, RIR 111 ( von Ley) had been identified this way and destroyed by French artillery. RIR 111 began a new trench west of Serre but the digging was spotted by the French and the area bombarded until 12 June. A plan was laid for a counter-attack in Sector S6 near the Mailly-Maillet‚ÄìSerre road by Regiment (I and II battalions IR 185, 185th Division), Regiment (II Battalion, RIR 109, 28th Reserve Division and I Battalion, IR 186 of the 185th Division) and a battalion from BRIR 15. The troops assembled at with RIR 109 leading the attack in front of the second wave, which was to mop up in front of the third wave, which carried trench stores to consolidate the captured ground. The attack began at but was exposed by flares and searchlights and subjected to massed small-arms fire, particularly on the right (northern) flank. The first wave found the French trench empty and assumed that the French had run away. A grenade fight began and when two red flares were set off in the French lines, the French artillery replied with an hour-long bombardment. The German infantry got lost in the maze of trenches, which did not correspond to their maps and the troops retreated to Beaucourt less one platoon, left behind to receive stragglers and to link the trenches south of the road with those west of Serre. The Germans repeated the counter-attack in the early hours of 12 June but this was repulsed, after which the German artillery resumed its bombardment of the French positions. After the failure of the second counter-attack, Nagel. the commander of Sector S6, decided to close the gap between the right flank of the 26th Reserve Division near the Mailly-Maillet‚ÄìSerre road and the left of the 52nd Division south-west of La Louvi√®re Farm, with a new trench about long, later called . On 13 June at the French 51st Division attacked towards Serre with the 327e, 233e and 243e Regiments. The infantry attacked north of the Mailly-Maillet‚ÄìSerre road in waves followed by columns and forced back III Battalion, RIR 121 on its right flank. South of the road, II Battalion, RIR 121 shot down the French infantry when they were about away in no man's land. Troops of RIR 119 fought illuminated by the flames of a farmyard, as German doctors and orderlies evacuated the wounded from the cellar. A few small French probes were attempted after the main attack but by the French retired towards La Signy Farm; RIR 121 suffered The French official account recorded that the attack consolidated the French positions on the southern flank towards the Mailly-Maillet‚ÄìSerre road. The attack left and in a salient, later named the . French artillery bombarded the German positions for the rest of the day but French troops and guns were seen moving south. Aftermath =Analysis= In volume III of (1923), the French official history, the historians of the Service Historique wrote that the fighting from 7 to 10 June and capture of Toutvent Farm had been a costly success. The operation had been based on careful planning, implemented by determined troops, who had breached the German defences and driven a salient deep into the German line on a front. German counter-attacks, made with great vigour, failed and the Germans reinforced the area with fresh battalions of infantry and a considerable amount of artillery. The German defences between the old front line and Serre had been captured, the village was not prepared for defence and there were few German troops to resist another attack. Despite the lack of fortification, the long slope up to Serre and the orchards and fences around it made it easy to defend and the Second Army would need reinforcement to capture the village. Serre was of little tactical value except as a jumping off point for a bigger attack and Joffre gave priority to the Tenth Army at Arras; preparations for another attack by the Second Army continued as a deception. In 1928, the British official historian, James Edmonds, referred to the French supporting operations, which were handicapped by a lack of heavy guns and ammunition. The attack on Serre by elements of the French XI Corps took the German salient at Toutvent Farm and held it against German counter-attacks. The French supporting attacks were costly and enormously demanding on the limited French stock of ammunition. The lack of success of the French operations shook the confidence of the French government in Joffre. In a 2004 web publication, Didier Lodier wrote that on the morning of 7 June, the 64th, 65th, 75th, 118th, 137th Infantry Regiments of the 35th RAC attacked from H√©buterne, captured two lines of trenches on a front of and took many prisoners. Toutvent Farm was situated on a bare ridge and was attacked by the 140th, 162nd, 361st Infantry Regiments and captured against determined resistance by the German garrison, which suffered many killed and prisoner. Four German counter-attacks from 10 to 13 June were repulsed by the 233rd, 243rd and 327th Infantry Regiments on the road between H√©buterne and Serre. In 2005, Robert Doughty wrote that the decisive action was the Second Battle of Artois, supported by a general action along the rest of the French front, according to a proposal by Foch at the end of March. The Second Army, further south, had attacked from 7 to 13 June and advanced on a but the casualties incurred by the general action amounted to 40 percent of those suffered by the Tenth Army, to little benefit for the main attack. In 2009, William Philpott wrote that the French attack on Serre showed that with a sufficient weight of artillery, the German front line could be captured fairly easily and with limited casualties. Subsequent attacks encountered reinforced defences which could not be bombarded as effectively and infantry attacks were costly failures. Analysis of the failures led to the French moving away from breakthrough attempts to methodical, limited, set-piece attacks within the range of artillery support. The experience of defending led to more emphasis by the Germans on deep dug- outs and tactical reserves close by, able to move relatively freely along communication trenches and covered ways. The garrison of Serre redoubled their efforts to turn the village into a fortress. In a 2010 translation of excerpts from the 1915 volumes of , the German official history, Mark Humphries and John Maker wrote that with greater numbers and the advantage of attacking in fog, the French had taken the German front line. Over the next week, the defenders had limited the French success to the elimination of a German salient west of Serre, by the rapid transfer of reinforcements to the threatened area. French attacks further south at Fricourt on 10 and 19 July failed. Ralph Whitehead wrote in 2013, that as fresh troops arrived, the reinforcements sent to Serre returned to their usual positions and the German commanders decided that the French attacks were a diversion. The HQ of the XIV Reserve Corps reviewed the German performance in the battle; the best efforts of the 52nd Division and the 26th Reserve Division had not prevented the French from advancing on a front, after preparing the ground with artillery and mortar fire. German counter-attacks had failed to recapture the lost ground, which the German commanders judged to be a serious defeat. The reviewers concluded that counter-attacks would have to be bigger, with more artillery preparation. Scraping up men and improvising units with unfamiliar leaders had led to men not following orders, even when they were appropriate, particularly at night. The recapture of the original front line would have boosted morale but had no tactical benefit. =Casualties= The French official historians wrote in that from 7 to 15 June, French casualties were and killed or missing; and most lightly; a total of and men; the French artillery lost five of them heavy, to German artillery-fire. Ten German officers and were taken prisoner, along with six machine-guns; corpses had been buried by one French battalion on of front. In 2005, Robert Doughty wrote that the attack on Serre cost the French Second Army which were fatal. In 2010, Mark Humphries and John Maker wrote that in the fighting between 7 and 15 June, the 2nd Army had about against a French loss of David O'Mara wrote in 2018 that the French Official History for the prisoner total and that unit war diary () claims added up to could have been taken. O'Mara also used the data in for French casualties and that French artillery lost guns and five heavy pieces. =Subsequent operations= Before the French attack in June 1915, the had been part of the original front line through Matthew Copse and Toutvent Farm. The French attack had captured the German defences further north, leaving the as a salient jutting into no man's land. The Germans judged the area to be untenable and did not intend to make a determined stand if attacked. The redoubt was mined and left occupied by only a machine-gun team and a party of engineers, who were to blow the mine as soon as attacking troops entered it. When the British 4th Division attacked the (Quadrilateral Redoubt to the British) at on 1 July 1916, the German machine-gun jammed. The German engineers sprung the mine too early and were caught in the explosion before the British arrived. The magnitude of the blast was far greater than expected and blocked the entrances to many of the German (deep dugouts) in the vicinity. The 3rd Company, on the right flank of Reserve Infantry Regiment 121, was overrun and of the German support trench was captured.

Key findings of his research include the following: * The introduction of social security can Pareto-improve social welfare by sharing aggregate risks between generations, but the reform's crowding-out effect on capital tends to overturn these gains in welfare (with Dirk Krueger). * A borrowing interest rate equal to the expected return on equity minimizes the demand for equity (with Steven J. Davis and Paul Willen). * Competitive equilibria always exist in models with a single perishable consumption good and productive assets as the only collateral, and, assuming that all exogenous variables follow a Markov chain, there are also stationary equilibria, which can be characterized by a mapping from the exogenous shock and current distribution of financial wealth to prices and portfolio choices (with Karl Schmedders). * Together with Dirk Krueger, K√ºbler has developed a method to compute equilibria in overlapping generations models with stochastic production based on Smolyak's algorithm.

The tomb of Pauline Leroux and Pierre- Ch√©ri Lafont in Montmartre Cemetery Born in Paris, she was the daughter of Louis-B√©nigne-Marie Leroux, Commissioner of War, and Marguerite-Suzanne (n√©e Lecocq). Her older sister Antoinette-D√©sir√©e Leroux (1807-?) had been a dancer at the Opera from 1821 to 1827, while her sister Aminthe Delisle-Leroux (1815-1878) was an actress. On 12 July 1848 she married the actor Pierre-Ch√©ri Lafont (1797-1873). Leroux was a pupil of Auguste Vestris and Jean-Fran√ßois Coulon and was a member of the Paris Opera Ballet from 1826 to 1837, then from 1840 to 1844 to replace foreign celebrities like Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler. She then joined full international tours. Leroux had her first success when she created the role of Marie in La tentation by Jean Coralli (1832), then in Filippo Taglioni's Leda, the Swiss Milkmaid (1832) and triumphed in Coralli's Le Diable Boiteux (1836), then as Uriel in The Devil in Love with Joseph Mazilier (1840). She danced regularly in London between 1824 and 1833, appearing before a young Princess Victoria who painted watercolour portraits of Leroux as Fenella in Massaniello at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden (1832),Mad.

The composer Richard Wagner was in the audience on the first night. In her later years Leroux was a choreographer. Pauline Leroux died in 1891 in the 9th arrondissement of Paris and is buried in Montmartre Cemetery with her husband Pierre-Ch√©ri Lafont.

Her publications on girls and women at work, and, especially, her work on violence against women, have become core academic texts. Another of her more notable specialities involves her contributions to the international debate on (social) care.  Life  Margrit Br√ºckner was born during the aftermath of war at Mennigh√ºffen or Rinteln, in the countryside between Bielefeld and Hannover. She studied Sociology at Mainz, Frankfurt and the London School of Economics between 1966 and 1972. In 1979 she accepted an appointment as a Professor for Sociology and Women's Studies at the Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main (as the Applied Sciences University was then known). At Frankfurt she participated actively in the Socialist Student League. In 1969 she joined with others to establish the first \\"Frankfurt Women's Council\\" (\\"Frankfurter Weiberrat\\"), described later by one authority as \\"the nucleus of the Frankfurt women's movement\\". As a sixteen year old she had been a beneficiary of a new schools exchange programme and spent time at a school in a small town in the United States, enabling her to improve her English language skills and acclimatize to the very different unwritten social rules governing the behaviour of school-age girls. She returned across the Atlantic after receiving her first degree, undertaking a two-year research stay at the Institute for the Study of Social Change (University of California). Br√ºckner then received her doctorate from Frankfurt University in 1983. Adumbrating her subsequent academic career, her prize-winning dissertation was entitled \\"Liebe der Frauen ‚Äì √ºber das Verh√§ltnis von Weiblichkeit und Misshandlung\\" (loosely \\"Love of women - on the relationship of the female condition and abuse\\"). She also trained to become group analyst and supervisor (\\" Gruppenanalytikerin und Supervisorin\\"), terms which even she has subsequently struggled to translate into English. It was again at Frankfurt University that in 2000 she received her habilitation (higher academic qualification), also receiving \\"Venia legendi\\" (loosely: \\"teaching rights\\") in Sociology. She has continued to teach and support sociology students at the Hochschule in Frankfurt up to and beyond her retirement in 2012. Her research and campaigning work has continued to focus on care-work and care-networks, along with the life situations of women working in the sexual services field. Since 2001, with Monika Simmel-Joachim, she has chaired the working group on Domestic violence, an expert crime- prevention group established by the regional Ministry for Justice.

Although three radiocarbon dating tests performed in 1988 provided conclusive evidence of a date of 1260 to 1390 for the shroud, some researchers have challenged the dating based on various theories, including the provenance of the samples used for testing, biological or chemical contamination, incorrect assessment of carbon dating data, as well as other theories. However, the alternative theories challenging the radiocarbon dating have been disproved by scientists using actual shroud material, and are thus considered to be fringe theories. The Holy See received custody of the shroud in 1983, and as with other relics, makes no claims about its authenticity. After the 1988 round of tests, no further dating tests have been allowed.  Overview  The Shroud of Turin is a length of linen cloth bearing the negative image of a man who is alleged to be Jesus of Nazareth. The cloth itself is believed by some to be the burial shroud he was wrapped in when he was buried after his crucifixion. The origins of the shroud and its images are the subject of multiple fringe theories. Diverse arguments have been made in various publications claiming to prove that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. In 1988, three radiocarbon dating tests dated a sample of the shroud as being from the Middle Ages,Taylor, R.E. and Bar-Yosef, Ofer. Radiocarbon Dating, Second Edition: An Archaeological Perspective. Left Coast Press, 2014, p. 165 between the years 1260 and 1390. Some shroud researchers have challenged this dating, arguing in favor of fringe theories. However, all of the scientific hypotheses used to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted,Christopher Ramsey, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, March 2008, http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/shroud.htmlRadiocarbon Dating, Second Edition: An Archaeological Perspective, By R.E. Taylor, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Routledge 2016; pg 167-168 including the medieval repair hypothesis, the bio-contamination hypothesis and the carbon monoxide hypothesis. As the highly-respected journal Nature put it, writing about the radiocarbon dating: \\"These tests provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is .\\"  Defective sample theories  Allegations have been made that the sample of the shroud chosen for testing was defective in some way, usually involving questions about the provenance of the threads: for example that the sample chosen was not from the original shroud but from a repair or restoration carried out in the Middle Ages. =Medieval repair argument= Although the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image- bearing cloth.John L. Brown, \\"Microscopical Investigation of Selected Raes Threads From the Shroud of Turin\\"Article (2005)Robert Villarreal, \\"Analytical Results On Thread Samples Taken From The Raes Sampling Area (Corner) Of The Shroud Cloth\\" Abstract (2008) It is hypothesised that the sampled area was a medieval repair which was conducted by \\"invisible reweaving\\". Since the C14 dating at least four articles have been published in scholarly sources contending that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole shroud.Emmanuel Poulle, ‚Ä≥Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin. Revue critique‚Ä≥, Revue d'Histoire Eccl√©siastique, 2009/3-4, Abstract ; G. Fanti, F. Crosilla, M. Riani, A.C. Atkinson, \\"A Robust statistical analysis of the 1988 Turin Shroud radiocarbon analysis\\", Proceedings of the IWSAI, ENEA, 2010. =Questionable provenance of samples= The medieval repair argument was included in an article by American chemist Raymond Rogers, who conducted chemical analysis for the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and who was involved in work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Rogers took 32 documented adhesive-tape samples from all areas of the shroud and associated textiles during the STURP process in 1978. He received 14 yarn segments from Luigi Gonella (Department of Physics, Polytechnic University of Turin) on 14 October 1979, which Gonella told him were from the Raes sample. On 12 December 2003, Rogers received a tiny fragment of what he was told was a shroud warp thread, and a tiny fragment of what he was told was a shroud weft thread, which Luigi Gonella told him had been taken from before it was distributed for dating. The actual provenance of these threads is uncertain, as Gonella was not authorized to take or retain genuine shroud material, but Gonella told Rogers that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample. Raymond Rogers stated in a 2005 article that he performed chemical analyses on these undocumented threads, and compared them to the undocumented Raes threads as well as the samples he had kept from his STURP work. He stated that his analysis showed: \\"The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/mordant coating and cotton fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials.\\" He speculated that these products may have been used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection. Based on this comparison Rogers concluded that the undocumented threads received from Gonella did not match the main body of the shroud, and that in his opinion: \\"The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken.\\"Turin Shroud 'could be genuine as carbon- dating was flawed Stephen Adams in the Daily Telegraph 10 Apr 2009 In March 2013, Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from to , potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Because of the manner in which Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud‚Äôs official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider: \\"As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [on] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments.\\"Science Shines New Light on Shroud of Turin‚Äôs Age; BY SHAFER PARKER JR.

If you‚Äôre using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit your approach to other scientists.\\" = Response to restoration claims = The official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample \\"came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas.\\" As part of the testing process in 1988, a Derbyshire laboratory in the UK assisted the University of Oxford radiocarbon acceleration unit by identifying foreign material removed from the samples before they were processed.Rogue fibres found in the Shroud Textile Horizons, December 1988 Edward Thomas Hall of the Oxford team noticed two or three \\"minute\\" fibers which looked \\"out of place\\", and those \\"minute\\" fibers were identified as cotton by Peter South (textile expert of the Derbyshire laboratory) who said: \\"It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven. It may not have taken us long to identify the strange material, but it was unique amongst the many and varied jobs we undertake.\\" Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is an expert in the restoration of textiles, who headed the restoration and conservation of the Turin Shroud in 2002. She has rejected the theory of the \\"invisible reweaving\\", pointing out that it would be technically impossible to perform such a repair without leaving traces, and that she found no such traces in her study of the shroud.The Shroud, by Ian Wilson; Random House, 2010, pgs 130-131The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality; by Mechthild Flury-Lemberg, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf H. E. Gove, former professor emeritus of physics at the University of Rochester and former director of the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester, helped to invent radiocarbon dating and was closely involved in setting up the shroud dating project. He also attended the actual dating process at the University of Arizona. Gove has written (in the respected scientific journal Radiocarbon) that: \\"Another argument has been made that the part of the shroud from which the sample was cut had possibly become worn and threadbare from countless handlings and had been subjected to medieval textile restoration. If so, the restoration would have had to be done with such incredible virtuosity as to render it microscopically indistinguishable from the real thing. Even modern so-called invisible weaving can readily be detected under a microscope, so this possibility seems unlikely. It seems very convincing that what was measured in the laboratories was genuine cloth from the shroud after it had been subjected to rigorous cleaning procedures. Probably no sample for carbon dating has ever been subjected to such scrupulously careful examination and treatment, nor perhaps ever will again.\\" In 2010, statisticians Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: \\"The effect is not large over the sampled region; ‚Ä¶ our estimate of the change is about two centuries.\\"Riani M., Atkinson A.C., Fanti G., Crosilla F., (4 May 2010). \\"Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin: Partially Labelled Regressor and the Design of Experiments\\". The London School of Economics and Political Science. Retrieved 2010-10-24. In December 2010, Timothy Jull, a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal Radiocarbon, coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample that was left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and were assisted by the director of the Gloria F Ross Center for Tapestry Studies. They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30√ó) stereo microscope, as well as under high magnification (320√ó) viewed through both transmitted light and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found \\"only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers\\" and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.  Vanillin loss theory  Raymond Rogers argued in the scientific journal Thermochimica Acta that the presence of vanillin differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: \\"The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea Scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years\\". It has been stated that Rogers‚Äô vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment ‚Äì heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth. In a 2020 paper, respected pro-authenticity advocates Bryan Walsh and Larry Schwalbe stated of this test that \\"Rogers‚Äô method has limitations and his results have not yet been widely accepted.\\"An instructive inter-laboratory comparison: The 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin\\", by Bryan Walsh & Larry Schwalbe, published in 2020 in the Journal of Archaeological Science (Reports Volume 29, February 2020, 102015), freely available here Rogers' analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as Joe Nickell, who reasons that the conclusions of the author, Raymond Rogers, result from \\"starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence\\".  Contamination theories  Various theories call into question results of carbon-14 dating, based on contamination by bacteria, reactive carbon, or carbon monoxide. = By bacteria = Pictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842 indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present. Rodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight. Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe Raman analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers. Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), once hypothesised that a \\"bioplastic\\" bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, could have rendered the tests inaccurate. He has, however, also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing. He noted that different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, and that even if some slight contamination remained, about two thirds of the sample would need to consist of modern material to swing the result away from a 1st century date to a Medieval date. He inspected the Arizona sample material before it was cleaned, and determined that no such gross amount of contamination was present even before the cleaning commenced. = By reactive carbon = Others have suggested that the silver of the molten reliquary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth.Moroni, M. & van Haelst, R. ‚Äì ‚Äò'Natural Factors Affecting the Apparent Radiocarbon Age of Textiles‚Äô‚Äô. Shroud News, Issue No. 100, February 1997  Kouznetsov claims  The Russian , an archaeological biologist and chemist, claimed in 1994 to have managed to experimentally reproduce this purported enrichment of the cloth in ancient weaves, and published numerous articles on the subject between 1994 and 1996. Kouznetsov's results could not be replicated, and no actual experiments have been able to validate this theory, so far.Fesenko, A. V. ‚Äì Belyakov, A. V. ‚Äì Til‚Äôkunov, Y. N. ‚Äì Moskvina, T.

They concluded that the proposed carbon-enriching heat treatments were not capable of producing the claimed changes in the measured radiocarbon age of the linen, that the attacks by Kouznetsov et al. on the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the shroud \\"in general are unsubstantiated and incorrect,\\" and that the \\"other aspects of the experiment are unverifiable and irreproducible.\\"An Archaeological Perspective, By R.E.

The amazing Dr Kouznetsov. ANTIQUITY-OXFORD- 81, 779 = By carbon monoxide in smoke = In 2008, John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado proposed a new hypothesis ‚Äì namely the possibility of more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils that make up the cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. Before conducting the tests, he told the BBC that \\"With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence.\\" Ramsey stressed that he would be surprised if the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out ‚Äì especially \\"a thousand years wrong\\" ‚Äì but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.Fresh tests on Shroud of Turin; By Jonathan Petre; Religion Correspondent; The Telegraph; 25 Feb 2008 at - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579810/Fresh-tests-on- Shroud-of-Turin.html The results of the tests were to form part of a documentary on the Turin Shroud which was to be broadcast on BBC2. The producer of the 2008 documentary, David Rolfe, suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries,Chickos, J.S., and Uang, J. (2001). Chemical Modification of Cellulose. The Possible Effects of Chemical Cleaning on Fatty Acids Incorporated in Old Textiles (St. Louis MO, Department of Chemistry - University of Missouri-St. Louis). as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at Chamb√©ry. Other similar theories include that candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon- dating unreliable as a dating tool.Brunati, E. - Note critiche sulla datazione della S.Sindone con il radiocarbonio - Typescript, Gennaio 1994, pp. 1-45.Cardamone-Blacksburg, J. - La cellulosa dal lino; caratterizzazione e datazione - Typescript, Symposium Scientifique International de Paris sur le Linceul de Turin, 7-8 Septembre 1989, pp. 1-5. In March 2008, Ramsey reported back on the testing that: \\"So far the linen samples have been subjected to normal conditions (but with very high concentrations of carbon monoxide). These initial tests show no significant reaction ‚Äì even though the sensitivity of the measurements is sufficient to detect contamination that would offset the age by less than a single year. This is to be expected and essentially confirms why this sort of contamination has not been considered a serious issue before.\\" He noted that carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure. He also added that there is as yet no direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate. In 2011, Ramsey commented that in general \\"there are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up.\\"The Turin Shroud is fake. Get over it Tom Chivers in the Daily Telegraph 20 Dec 2011  Incorrect dating calculation theory  In 1994, J. A.

However critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in Nature: including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% ‚Äì rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.Fanti, G., and Marinelli, E.

His son Friederich Tutein continued the company under the name Fr. Tutein & Co. after his father's death. Early life and education Tutein was born in Mannheim, the son of Pierre Tutein and Elisabeth Henri. He apprenticed as a merchant in Landau. Career Tutein moved to Copenhagen in 1748. He managed Peter De Windtz' trading house after Windtz' death. In 1756 he established his own trading house. It soon developed into one of the most successful in the city. He traded on the Danish colonies with his own ships and had close ties to the Danish Asiatic Company. A few of his ships participated in the Triangular trade. He mainly traded colonial goods such as coffee and sugar. He was one of the largest importers of coffee to Denmark of his time. He had close ties to Danish Asiatic Company. Tutein was also involved in a number of enterprises. He became the owner of a stockings factory through his marriage. He also became a partner in Reinhard Iselin's kattun factory in Klampenborg.

The series is an Edwardian period adaptation of the H.G. Wells's 1898 science fiction novel of the same name, and is the first British television adaptation of Wells's Martian invasion novel. The War of the Worlds miniseries premiered in other countries before its UK broadcast on the BBC between 17 November and 1 December 2019. Premise Set in Edwardian England, the miniseries follows journalist George (Rafe Spall) and his live-in relationship Amy (Eleanor Tomlinson), who works as an assistant to local scientist Ogilvy (Robert Carlyle). They start a life together in the town of Woking in defiance of British society, due, as the viewer soon learns, George already being married (his wife is not willing to grant a divorce). They suddenly must face the escalating terror of an invasion of Britain, and possibly the whole planet Earth, from Mars, while also fighting for their very lives against an unstoppable enemy beyond humanity's comprehension.

The series is produced by Mammoth Screen for the BBC, co-produced with Creasun Media, in association with Red Square. Writer Peter Harness expanded the role of the narrator's wife, stating \\"I think the clearest choice that I made from the start of this project was to give the male character a wife who had strength of character in her own right [...] It was very important to me to make the female character three-dimensional\\". The series was directed by Craig Viveiros, produced by Betsan Morris Evans, executive produced by Damien Timmer, Preethi Mavahalli, Peter Harness and Viveiros from Mammoth Screen, Tommy Bulfin from the BBC, Minglu Ma from Creasun and Jamie Brown from Red Square. The interpretation makes use of time shifting forwards and backwards in the timeline in order to \\"throw in a clever touch of time-shifting into the narrative to upend audience expectations\\". =Filming= Filming began April 2018 in Liverpool. Locations include St George's Plateau, Eldon Grove, Vauxhall (where an abandoned building was used as a London location), Sir Thomas Street, Dale Street, Ainsdale Woods, Delamere Forest, the village of Great Budworth in Cheshire, the Palm House and Croxteth Hall. Filming and post-production were completed by May 2019. Release =Marketing= The first footage from the BBC miniseries appeared in July 2018, followed by trailers in January 2019, with the first, longer trailer for the drama being released in September 2019. =Broadcast= The miniseries was released in the UK in three weekly episodes. Originally set to premiere in the UK during Christmas 2018, The War of the Worlds actually premiered in Canada on T+E between 6 and 20 October 2019.

The miniseries holds a 67% approval rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads \\"Respectful, if not exactly riveting, Craig Viveiros' reimagined The War of the Worldss wandering narrative undermines its strong performances\\". The Guardian gave the miniseries four stars, deeming it 'solid and reliable' drama, but criticised the plot's pacing, stating it had a 'lack of urgency'. The Independent gave it three stars, commending the performance and special effects, but complained about its attempts to speak to contemporary political issues. The Telegraph gave the first episode two stars and criticised it for appearing low budget and the performances by Tomlinson and Spall. The Irish Independent was unfavourable to the first episode and called it a 'massive disappointment'. The Telegraph was more negative towards the second episode, giving it one star. The Independent was more negative towards the third episode, giving it two stars, stating \\"The real war is not about martians, but the perceived liberal perceptions of a 2019 audience.\\" References External links  Category:2010s British crime drama television series Category:2010s British science fiction television series Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2019 British television series endings Category:Alien invasions in television Category:BBC television dramas Category:English- language television shows Category:Television shows based on British novels Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series by Mammoth Screen Category:Television shows set in England Category:Works based on The War of the Worlds ","title":"The War of the Worlds (British TV series)"},{"id":"57274964","text":"The Rise of Iskander is the seventh novel written by Benjamin Disraeli who would later become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Background The Rise of Iskander was written in Bath, England in the winter of 1832‚Äì3. It is based on the life of George Castriota, better known as Skanderbeg, a prince and national hero of Albania (which Disraeli had visited two years earlier on his Grand Tour).Elsie p8 It was published in London in 1833 together with The Wondrous Tale of Alroy.Elsie p9  Plot  Iskander was a young prince when his father‚Äôs kingdom (Epirus) was taken over by the Turks. He was brought up a Moslem, although secretly remaining Christian. When his father died, the Turks saw Iskander‚Äôs potential as an officer in their occupying armies (of the Emperor Amurath II). Iskander was posted to Athens, happily working with the Prince of Athens (Nicaeus, a Christian) suppressing Moslem insurrections. Iskander receives news that he has been commissioned to leave Athens to help the Turkish armies fight off a Christian invasion led by Hunniades in Albania. Iskander leaves reluctantly and on reaching the Epirot division of the army he is to command (under the overall command of Karam Bey), Iskander secretly visits Hunniades, meeting his beautiful daughter, Iduna. Iskander reveals to Hunniades the Turks‚Äô battle plan for the following day and also agrees to withhold his division from the battle, instead leaving the field to raise the standard of Christian independence. alt=A young man of vaguely Semitic appearance, with long and curly black hair Everything goes to plan and Iskander and his men head off and take Croia, the capital of Epirus. Throughout Epirus there are uprisings against the Turks who are ousted. Nicaeus joins Iskander and they receive word from Hunniades that although he has been successful and captured Karam Bey, Iduna has been taken prisoner. She is being held at Adrianople (the Turkish capital) where Amurath‚Äôs son, Mohamed, has taken a fancy to her so the Turks are refusing to exchange her for hostages. Iskander and Nicaeus, who is in love with Iduna despite her having previously rejected his advances, go to Adrianople disguised as an Armenian doctor and his page. There they learn that Iduna is ill and Mohamed is offering a reward for anyone who can cure her. Through one of Mohamed‚Äôs eunuchs (Kaflis), Iskander and Nicaeus gain access to Mohamed, who permits Kaflis to show them to Iduna. Talking to Iduna in Greek, which Kaflis doesn‚Äôt understand, Iskander tells her they have come to rescue her. He doesn't reveal his true identity but does disclose that his companion is Nicaeus. Mohamed is impressed as Iduna's health improves over the next few days and asks ‚Äúthe doctor‚Äù to arrange for him to kill Iskander, who just promises that he (Mohamed) will meet Iskander if he thrashes his scimitar in a particular lake. As Mohamed is planning for Iduna to accompany him at the head of his army marching on Epirus, Iskander and Nicaeus effect Iduna‚Äôs escape. The three flee Adrianopole on horse but are pursued by the Turks. With their horses tiring, Iskander resolves to confront alone their pursuers, giving time for Nicaeus and Iduna to get further ahead. At this point Iskander reveals his identity to Iduna. He has feelings for her and sees that she is not particularly affectionate towards Nicaeus. Iskander single-handedly defeats all the chasing Turks. Nicaeus and Iduna reach Epirus with Nicaeus feeling jealousy for Iskander on seeing how melancholy Iduna is in his absence. He resolves that marrying Iduna is more important than his country and Iskander who should not set eyes on Iduna again unless she is Nicaeus‚Äôs bride. When Iduna rejects him again, Nicaeus imprisons her, saying she will never see her father again unless she marries him. Iduna escapes and runs to a forest where she comes across Mohamed thrashing his scimitar in the lake, whereupon Iskander appears. Mohamed reveals it is a trap and instructs his soldiers to arrest Iskander, whereupon Iskander reveals he has comes with Hunniades and his men. Then Nicaeus (in pursuit of Iduna) arrives. The Turks and Christians resolve to have a battle the next day and Mohamed leaves. Nicaeus also departs, disgraced. In the battle the following day, Nicaeus fights heroically with Iskander and Hunniades and dies of his wounds afterwards. The Turks are defeated and retreat. Iskander is proclaimed king of Epirus and is married to Iduna. Reception The Rise of Iskander quickly slipped into obscurity despite some literary merit.Blake p108 A contemporary critic in the American Monthly Review wrote, \\"The story is pleasantly told, and is altogether the most unexceptional of any work of fiction from the author's pen that we have seen.\\" A more modern review, however, draws attention to the novel's unique status as \\"the first and most notable instance of a literary adaptation of the Scanderbeg theme in English prose and... seemingly the only work of English prose focussing on... Albanian subject matter\\".Elsie p22  Political significance  The Rise of Iskander is typical of Disraeli‚Äôs early fiction which featured messianistic heroes, ‚Äúwhose political aims concentrated on national renewal because [Disraeli] also saw himself as a person of great promise who was strongly committed to upholding Britain‚Äôs place in the world and its imperial authority.‚ÄùDiniejko Nevertheless in his foreign policy as Prime Minister Disraeli showed little sympathy for the plight of countries like Albania, supporting the Ottoman Empire out of fear of Russian expansionism.Elsie p3 Diniejko The novelette has therefore been characterised as, \\"a romantic inversion of his later theme of 'Peace with Honour'.\\"  References  Category:Novels by Benjamin Disraeli Category:1833 novels ","title":"The Rise of Iskander"},{"id":"57274976","text":"Prem Kumar may refer to: * Prem Kumar (Malayalam actor) (born 1967), Indian film actor in Malayalam films * Prem Kumar (Kannada actor), Indian film actor in Kannada films * Prem Kumar (footballer) (born 1989), Indian footballer * Prem Kumar (politician) (born 1960), Indian politician * Swami Premananda (guru) (Prem Kumar, 1951‚Äì2011), Indian guru * Prem Kumar: Salesman of the year, 2018 Odia language film ","title":"Prem Kumar"},{"id":"57274982","text":"The 2018 Asian Men's Softball Championship was an international softball tournament which featured nine nations which was held in April 2018.

The pilot's license, as issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, can only be achieved after serving many hours on shipboard and by passing a grueling set of examinations. Early life McCue moved around with her family during her childhood due to her father's employment as an engineer. Originally from San Francisco, she spent time in Evans, Georgia, where she attended Lakeside High School, and was resident for a period in Michigan. After travelling with her family on a cruise ship to the Bahamas when she was 12, she sought to become a cruise director. Her family then moved back to San Francisco. Maritime career She began attending the California State University Maritime Academy, then California Maritime Academy, in 1996. McCue graduated with a Bachelor's degree in business administration in 1999, and also studied celestial navigation during sailing trips in the summer breaks. While undertaking her degree, she undertook an internship for Chiquita Brands International working on one of their cargo ships, transporting bananas from Ecuador to Long Beach, California. After graduation, she moved to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands where she stayed with her cousins for six months, working as a general deck hand on a catamaran undertaking tourist cruises to the Molokini crater. McCue then became a logistics manager to Maersk Sealand in Los Angeles, but wanted to return to sea. After applying to cruise lines for nine months, she gained a job with Disney Cruise Line in an entry-level position as a third mate. In 2003, she became a second officer for Royal Caribbean. While her role on Disney saw her travel around the Caribbean, her new posting saw her travel all over the world. After a year, she was promoted to first officer. She attended the Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies in Baltimore in 2009 where she earned her Chief Mate and Master‚Äôs Licence to enable her to take command of a vessel. When she returned to Royal Caribbean, she was promoted first to chief officer (the senior first officer) and then to staff captain (the second in command) in 2011. The president of Celebrity Cruises, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, contacted McCue in 2015 and asked her to apply for a role of captain with them. Celebrity Cruises is owned by the Royal Caribbean Cruises LTD. McCue duly applied and was appointed as the commanding officer of Celebrity Summit on September 13, 2015, making her the first American woman to command a modern \\"mega ship\\". Lutoff-Perlo later said that \\"Kate was the first opportunity to make significant change at Celebrity related to gender equality.\\" In 2018, she left the Summit to become the commanding officer on Celebrity Equinox and subsequently moved to the Celebrity Edge in 2019. McCue follows in the footsteps of other female cruise ship captains, with Swede Karin Stahre-Janson placed in command of a Royal Caribbean vessel in 2007. Other women such as Inger Klein Thorhauge for Cunard Line (2010), Sarah Breton for P&O; Cruises (2010), Lis Lauritzen for Royal Caribbean, and Margrith Ettlin for Silversea Cruises (2013) each preceded McCue.

The owner was Harry J. (or Henry G.) Shaw.

It was initially released in September 2018, and was later released in other regions. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and had grossed over 50 million by the end of 2018. The game has crossed over with multiple series, including Fire Emblem, Mega Man, and Monster Hunter. Plot The story takes place in Alberia, the kingdom where dragons live. All royal members in Alberia have the Dragon Transformation ability, where they can wield a dragon's power by forming a pact with a dragon to borrow their form in battle. One day, a strange occurrence begins to happen in this kingdom. The Holy Shard protected by the capital starts to lose its power. In order to save his people, Euden, the Seventh Prince, who has not made a pact with a dragon, sets off on his Dragon Selection Trial. Gameplay Dragalia Lost is an action role-playing game with touchscreen controls, where characters attack enemies with simple and magic attacks of different elements which can be weaker or stronger than other ones. Another method of attack is a special attack where the character transforms into a dragon and can greatly damage the enemy for a moment when they have sufficient energy that can be collected while playing or destroying statues of dragons. The characters also have their own classes, with attacking and healing types being the primary ones. While the game is fully playable as a single-player experience, it also supports up to four-player co-operative multiplayer. Development Dragalia Lost is a collaborative development between Nintendo and Cygames. It was a secret project within Cygames, with many of its employees being surprised upon learning of the collaboration, with Nintendo even buying 5% of their stock. The game marks as Nintendo's first intellectual property released for mobile devices without any prior appearance on Nintendo hardware. According to director Hiroki Matsuura, the game's main story comprises more than 600,000 words in its original Japanese version due to the inclusion of character stories and sidequests, with around 100 more words for every post-release event.

He worked as a teacher at Serb elementary schools in Te≈°anj and Tuzla, in the north-east of the Ottoman province of Bosnia. He wrote, illuminated and bound two books in 1841 and 1842. The first book was commissioned by Serb members of the guild of goldsmiths in Sarajevo. It contains a collection of advice to be presented to journeymen on the ceremony of their promotion to master craftsmen. His second book contains a version of the apocryphal epistle known as the Epistle of Christ from Heaven or the Sunday Letter. Although Jovanoviƒá states that he writes in Slavonic-Serbian (a literary language blending Church Slavonic, vernacular Serbian and Russian elements), the language of his books is basically vernacular Serbian of the Ijekavian accent. He follows traditional Church Slavonic orthography, rather than the reformed Serbian Cyrillic introduced in1818. Life and work Lazar Jovanoviƒá was born in the village of Plakaloviƒái in the district of Vlasenica, in the east of the Ottoman province of Bosnia. His original family name was Plakaloviƒá, which he later changed to Jovanoviƒá after his father's name, Jovan. He was in Sarajevo in the service of the Orthodox Metropolitan of Dabar-Bosna Venijamin at latest until 1834. He probably went to school while in Sarajevo, and his job at the metropolitan residence was to prepare coffee. By 1835 Jovanoviƒá had taken the teaching position at the Serb elementary school in Te≈°anj; he is the first known teacher of this school. While the majority population of Te≈°anj were Muslims, it had a Serb quarter (Srpska varo≈°) that developed in the 18th century. Wealthy Serb merchants living in it financially supported the school and the Orthodox church in the town. Sometime between 1843 and 1847, he went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem and consequently prefixed the title Had≈æi to his name. During that period he also moved to Tuzla, the main city in north-eastern Bosnia. Beside being a teacher at the Serb school there, he was also employed by a pasha as his personal physician. Many of the physicians recorded in the retinues of Ottoman dignitaries in Bosnia had a questionable level of medical education; they hailed from various countries and regions. Jovanoviƒá created his first known manuscript work in 1839. It was a ƒçitulja, an obituary booklet containing names of deceased members of a family to be mentioned by a priest at church services. By 1843 he had written, bound and modestly illuminated five such booklets, ordered by people from Te≈°anj, his home village and two neighbouring villages. Three of them were kept at the Lomnica Monastery, located near his home village. He also rebound three old liturgical books from this monastery (in 1840 and 1847), a book from the Ozren Monastery (in 1841), and two books from the Church of Saint John the Baptist in Zvornik (in 1853). These books were printed in the 18th century, three of them in Moscow and one in Vienna. In each of them, Jovanoviƒá wrote inscriptions that included some facts about him. He reportedly signed himself in a lost book as the secretary to the Orthodox Metropolitan of Zvornik and Tuzla, Agatangel. In 1841 Jovanoviƒá wrote, illuminated and bound his first book, which was commissioned by Serb members of the guild of goldsmiths in Sarajevo. In this manuscript, Jovanoviƒá collected advice that was presented to journeymen on the ceremony of their promotion as master craftsmen. It is one of only two such texts known today. In 1842 Jovanoviƒá created his second book, which was commissioned by the Church of the Annunciation in the village of Osjeƒçani in the Doboj area. This book presents a version of the apocryphal epistle known variously as the Epistle of Christ from Heaven, Letter from Heaven, Sunday Letter, etc. By the standards of his time and surroundings, Jovanoviƒá was a very literate person. Although he wrote only two small books, his work is significant, especially considering that a relatively small number of manuscripts are known to have been written by Serbs in Ottoman Bosnia. The first printing press in this territory, founded by a Serb merchant, ceased to work in 1523, and the next would not appear until 1866. Books =Sobornik= Sobornik, folios 12v‚Äì13r (black-and-white reprint) Lazar Jovanoviƒá's 1841 book is referred to in literature as Sobornik ili sovjetnik majstora esnafa kujund≈æiskoga (Cyrillic: –°–æ–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –∏–ª–∏ —Å–æ–≤—ò–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –º–∞—ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –µ—Å–Ω–∞—Ñ–∞ –∫—É—ò—É–Ω—ü–∏—Å–∫–æ–≥–∞, Collection or Advisory for the Masters of the Guild of Goldsmiths), as he approximately refers to it in the first two pages. It is kept in Belgrade in the Library of the National Museum of Serbia, in its collection of old and rare books (Rr1). The manuscript was commissioned by Serb members of the guild of goldsmiths in Sarajevo, and Jovanoviƒá wrote it in Te≈°anj. The guild had a ceremony called testir, in which a journeyman (kalfa) was promoted to a master craftsman (majstor) and a full member of the guild. This ceremony included a presentation of various advice to the future master, and Jovanoviƒá collected it in Sobornik. A particular guild in Sarajevo could include people belonging to different religions, Muslims, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, and Jews. Orthodox Serb members of a guild celebrated annually their slava, the patron saint of their guild. The testir ceremony had a religious component, and it could be held at the house of the master who trained the journeyman to be promoted. Periodically, all members of a guild had an outdoor party outside Sarajevo at which a number of apprentices and journeymen were simultaneously promoted to journeymen and master craftsmen, respectively. Sobornik is written on paper and contains 60 leaves and a front flyleaf. The size of the leaves is 155 by 116millimetres, while the size of the text columns is 145 by 102millimetres, with usually 11 to 13 lines per page. Normal text is written in black ink, and the headings in red. The covers are made of wooden boards coated with leather of dark wine colour, measuring 160 by 120millimetres. Folios 2v‚Äì3r and 31v‚Äì60v were left empty by the writer, but f.31v‚Äì32v and 60r, as well as the flyleaf, contain inscriptions by the patrons of the manuscript. The central section of the book (f.12v‚Äì25r) directly addresses the future master, often calling him \\"dear brother\\" (–¥—Ä–∞–≥–∏ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—î). Its heading implies that it was composed on the basis of some earlier text, whether written or orally transmitted. It contains a series of moral advice, supplemented with corresponding Bible passages. Beside general advice of piety, hard working, righteousness, honesty, respectfulness, spiritual and physical purity, charity, temperance, etc., it more specifically calls for loyalty and obedience to the guild. It ends with a prayer for the living and deceased members of the guild. A short section about truthfulness is given in f.28r‚Äì28v. Preceding the central section are instructions on proper behaviour in a church and correct performance of ritual gestures there. The book also contains hymns to Saints Constantine and Helena, the patrons (slava) of the guild of goldsmiths, as well as hymns to archangels Michael and Gabriel, the patrons of the Old Orthodox Church in Sarajevo. The book is illustrated with a headpiece representing the archangels (f.1r), a whole-page miniature with standing figures of Saints Constantine and Helena (f.3v), a headpiece depicting the Deesis (f.12v), a tailpiece (f.25r), and a whole-page miniature showing Saint Nicholas in the upper part and the archangels below (f.25v). Jovanoviƒá states (f.1r) that he writes in Slavonic-Serbian (a literary language blending Church Slavonic, vernacular Serbian and Russian elements), but the book is written basically in vernacular Serbian of the Ijekavian accent. Church Slavonic influences can be seen in phonology and, to a lesser degree, in morphology. These influences come from both the Serbian and the Russian recensions of Church Slavonic. Only the hymns, taken from liturgical books, are written purely in Church Slavonic. The script is half-uncial Cyrillic with a loose orthography, though generally following Church Slavonic conventions. The letters look archaic, though an influence of printed books can be seen in their shaping. The letter —£ (named yat, transliterated as ƒõ) is mostly replaced with –∏—î (ie), reflecting the Ijekavian reflex of the Proto- Slavic vowel designated by —£. Inscriptions in Sobornik name the guild members who engaged Jovanoviƒá to write it: Nikola Gabeliƒá, Teodor Mijiƒá, Stani≈°a Vasilijeviƒá, Peri≈°a Smiljaniƒá, and Andrija. They paid him 57piastres and 20paras for it, which corresponded to a monthly salary of a teacher at the Serb school in Sarajevo. An 1846 document of the guild mentions a \\"book of advice\\" (–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –æ–¥—ä –Ω–∞—Å–∏—è—Ç–∞). In 1852, Georgije Mijiƒá wrote a text in f.31v‚Äì32v by which nine members of the guild confirmed the validity of Sobornik and supplemented it with a couple of guild rules. The book was still in possession of the guild in 1902, when it was first mentioned in literature, in an article by Vladislav Skariƒá. In 1954 a person sold it to the National Museum of Serbia. Sobornik is one of only two such advisories known today. The other advisory was composed for the Serb members of the guild of tailors and published in 1869 by the Vilayet Printing House in Sarajevo, as part of a calendar. There are many similarities between the two texts, but there are also differences. Sobornik lacks concrete guild rules, which are found in the 1869 text, while the latter lacks instructions on proper behaviour in a church and liturgical hymns. It was printed in the reformed Serbian Cyrillic (introduced in1818). =Epistolija= Epistolija, folio 1 verso, containing Jovanoviƒá's declaration of authorship Lazar Jovanoviƒá's 1842 book is referred to in literature as Epistolija (Cyrillic: –ï–ø–∏—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∏—ò–∞), and it is kept in Belgrade in the National Library of Serbia, in its collection of old and rare books (Rs97). The manuscript was commissioned by the Church of the Annunciation in the village of Osjeƒçani in the Doboj area, and Jovanoviƒá wrote it in Te≈°anj. It contains a version of an apocryphal epistle known by various names, such as the Epistle of Christ from Heaven, Letter from Heaven and Sunday Letter. This epistle is found in a great number of versions written in many languages within traditions of both Eastern and Western Christianity. It was first mentioned in AD584 in a letter by Licinian, the Bishop of Cartagena (in the Byzantine part of Spain), in which he strongly condemned it. The epistle claims to have been written by Jesus Christ or God and descended from heaven, usually to Rome or Jerusalem. It curses those who doubt its divine origin, and promises benefits to those who copy and spread it further or read it in public. It could also be used as a personal or household amulet. Eastern Church authorities were not unanimous in its condemnation, and there are indications that it was sometimes read at church services. Epistolija is written on paper and contains 30 leaves measuring 200 by 155millimetres, while the size of the text columns is 130 by 120millimetres, with 12 to 14 lines per page. The covers are made of wooden boards coated with dark brown leather, measuring 205 by 160millimetres. Normal text is written in black ink, and the headings in red. Folios 2r, 20v‚Äì23v, 26r‚Äì29v and 30v were left empty by the writer, but some of these leaves contain later inscriptions. In Epistolija, the text of the epistle is preceded by an introductory section, a kind of abstract, titled \\"Edification of the Serb People\\" (–ü–æ—É—á—î–Ω–∏—î –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ —Å—Ä–±—Å–∫–æ–≥–∞). The epistle itself begins in f.5r with the account of how God sent it from heaven enclosed in a stone that fell near Jerusalem. The stone was small, but nobody could lift it. After Saint Peter and the Patriarch of Jerusalem prayed with bishops, monks and priests before the stone for three days and nights, it opened up and the letter within it was taken to a church and read before the congregation. The text of the letter is then presented, after which the narrative returns to the congregation, who piously engage in the copying and spreading of the letter throughout the whole land. Some versions of the epistle present only the letter without the framing stories. The letter contains condemnations of various kinds of sins, disregard for precepts of the Church, and bad conduct, depicting vividly the harsh punishments for these transgressions. It especially focuses on the strict observation of Sunday as the Lord's Day. The epistle ends in f.19v, and the remaining leaves of the book were reserved for writing the names of persons to be prayed for at services in the Osjeƒçani church. Already Jovanoviƒá had written about sixty names, mostly in the section \\"Memory Eternal of the Deceased Servants of God\\". The book is illustrated with two headpieces, one representing Jesus Christ (f.3r) and the other depicting the Deesis (f.5r). Characteristics of the language and script of Epistolija are similar to those of Jovanoviƒá's previous book, Sobornik. It is unknown for how long Epistolija remained in the church in Osjeƒçani. It was later kept in the village of Ko≈æuhe, also in the Doboj area. One of its owners in Ko≈æuhe was priest ƒêorƒëe Stefanoviƒá, the brother of an organiser of the 1858 Serb revolt against the Ottomans in that area, priest Jaƒáim Stefanoviƒá. In 1940 it was in Tuzla, and Petar N. Jovanoviƒá, the protopope of Tuzla, wrote a historical note about Jaƒáim Stefanoviƒá (f.26v). The next year began World War II in Yugoslavia, and the book was brought to Belgrade. An unknown person gave it to the National Library of Serbia in 1943. Beside Jovanoviƒá's Epistolija, there are other instances of the Epistle of Christ from Heaven written by Serb scribes. Each of them has its peculiarities regarding the contents, orthography, and the relationship between Church Slavonic and vernacular Serbian elements in it. One of them, written in the early 18th century and showing traces of the Ijekavian accent, shares with Epistolija the condemnation of tobacco smokers. In both manuscripts, they are referred to as \\"those who drink tobacco\\".

It was opened to the public on 8 March 2019. The station is linked to Wardha Road through a short road. The Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (now the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) awarded the contract to construct the station to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (ILFS) in July 2016. Construction of the outer structure of the station was completed by November 2017, and interior work began in the same month. The station was awarded a platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council, the highest rating the Council presents for sustainable construction practices that reduce environmental impact. Construction of the station was completed by January 2019. Design The station's design was modeled on the Sanchi Stupa, and was built in the Indo-Saracenic style fused with features of Buddhist architecture. The station's entrance is a torana, the same structure used as the gateway of the Sanchi Stupa, and has a colonnade on either side. The station facade is made up of stone louvers and cladding. The outer facade features cream-coloured terracotta tiles which help control the temperature inside the station. Solar panels fitted on the station's roof supply around 65% of the total electricity required by the station. A glass dome is located at a height of 40 meters atop the station. The dome is identical to the dome of the Sanchi Stupa and is topped with a chatra (parasol structure). The New Airport station dome weighs 23 tons, has a diameter of 13.4 meters and a height of 8.5 meters. Around 25 workers and architects worked on the construction of the dome. It was built using glass and stainless steel. It was built on the ground and then lifted atop the station by a crane with a lifting capacity of 200 ton. The dome does not require any routine maintenance, but may have to be monitored in the event of heavy rains. Polycarbonate sheets line the inner side of the dome, preventing damage from ultra violet radiation. An eight-foot, sandstone sculpture of Buddha is located inside the station underneath the dome.

Her nickname, \\"Mago,\\" means \\"magician\\" in Spanish. She was a graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and then went on to teach art at Bowie High School. In 1949, she saved $1,000 to go and study at the Art Institute of Chicago. She attended the Chouinard Art Institute. Orona G√°ndara also studied with Urbici Soler. When Orona G√°ndara was twenty-one, she got married and had five children. For many years, she followed her husband in his career, only separating after twenty-one years to pursue her own art career. Orona G√°ndara returned to El Paso in late 1971 after living in California for around twenty years. She began teaching classes at the El Paso Museum of Art and opened her own art studio. Orona G√°ndara also began teaching at the El Paso Community College (EPCC). A mural project she did for EPCC became part of her master's degree from Antioch University. She also opened an art studio in Ju√°rez with help from her daughter who lent her the money for the home and studio.

Her work is a cultural mix of both Mexican and American themes and inhabits the concept of nepantla. Her murals, Se√±or Sol and Time and Sand were created by her working alone. Se√±or Sol has degraded over time and Orona G√°ndara considered it \\"neglected and dishonored.\\" Some of her work was influenced by Aztec themes, such as those displayed on La Avenida de los Aztecas and in the Tourist Information Center for Chamizal in Ju√°rez.

The Guard were an armed force of 30 to 40 women who guarded the Nashua River crossings to prevent the movement of Loyalist couriers.  History  The Guard was raised in Pepperell, Massachusetts shortly after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 and was composed entirely of women, the men having been called away to fight at the Battle of Concord. It was named after Prudence Cummings Wright, who formed the unit on her own initiative and was elected its first captain and commander. Wright was a 35-year-old mother of six whose husband David was a private in the Massachusetts militia. She was born in nearby Hollis, New Hampshire and was very familiar with the town; her father had been town clerk for 22 years and she visited regularly. She was visiting her mother in Hollis when she overheard her two brothers talking to Loyalist Leonard Whiting, and she discovered that he was planning to meet with British spies near Groton, Massachusetts; they were travelling from Canada and Whiting was to guide them to Boston. Wright returned to Pepperell and hastily formed a militia from her female friends. She chose Sarah Shattuck from Groton to be her lieutenant, and the guard numbered between 30 and 40 women from the local area. One night, the Guard were dressed in men's clothing and armed with guns and pitchforks, stationed at Jewett's Bridge over the Nashua River between Pepperell and Groton. They were hidden by a curve in the road and were able to surprise a horseman attempting to cross the river who proved to be Leonard Whiting. They captured him and found incriminating papers, and they detained him overnight in Solomon Rodgers' tavern in Pepperell. Whiting was delivered to the Groton Committee of Safety the next day.

The highway begins at U.S. Highway 64 (US 64) at Hamlet and runs east through several small communities to Searcy, where it serves as the Beebe-Capps Expressway, a major crosstown arterial roadway. Following a discontinuity at US 64/US 67/US 167 (future Interstate 57 [I-57]), the highway continues east to Kensett as Wilbur D. Mills Avenue before state maintenance ends at the small community of Georgetown. This highway is maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT). One of the original 1926 Arkansas state highways, Highway 36 was established between Hamlet to Searcy largely along its modern alignment. Extensions to Kensett in 1938 and Georgetown in 1945 established the highway's present eastern terminus. The alignment through Searcy has also changed through the years to accompany the growth of the city as a regional hub, and the increased role of US 67 in the region's transportation system. Route description Highway 36 begins at US 64 east of Conway in Central Arkansas near the unincorporated community of Hamlet. It runs north through rural parts of the Arkansas Valley ecoregion, passing the Liberty School Cafeteria, a historic building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, shortly north of the US 64 junction. Winding north through a sparsely populated rural area, Highway 36 serves as the southern terminus for Highway 287 in Holland and Highway 107 near Enola. Approaching the White County line, Highway 310 joins Highway 36 for a concurrency through the small town of Mount Vernon. In the town, Highway 310 turns due east; Highway 36 continues north, crossing the East Fork Cadron Creek before entering White County. Highway 36 looking east in Rose Bud Upon entering White County, Highway 36 enters Rose Bud, a small town. Highway 36 serves as the eastern terminus of Highway 124 before again bridging the East Fork Cadron Creek. Continuing east, the route has an offset intersection with Highway 5, a major north‚Äìsouth highway in the region. East of Rose Bud, Highway 36 continues through rural lands predominantly used for ranching or broiler production on its way to Searcy, a regional population and economic center. Highway 36 passes unincorporated communities such as Joy and Center Hill, and junctions with (a separate section of) Highway 310, Highway 305, and Highway 320. The highway passes two NRHP properties on its way to Searcy: the Titan II ICBM Launch Complex 373-5 Site and Smyrna Methodist Church. Upon entering Searcy, the county seat of White County, Highway 36 is known as the Beebe Capps Expressway, named for Searcy legislators Mike Beebe (who would later be elected Governor of Arkansas) and John Paul Capps, who were both instrumental in its construction. The route is a four-lane divided highway, with a two-way left turn lane (TWLTL) across most of the city. Highway 36 has an intersection with Highway 13 (Sunset Park Road / Honey Hill Road) along the western Searcy city limits before entering a residential area. In the city, Highway 36 has an intersection with US 67 Business (US 67B, Pleasure Avenue), passing Searcy Public Schools' Southwest Middle School before another intersection with US 67B (Main Street). East of the second intersection with US 67B, Highway 36 intersects Burks Drive, the entrance to Harding University, before entering an industrial area of the city and intersecting US 64/US 67/US 167 (Future I-57), a freeway providing access to Little Rock to the south and St. Louis, Missouri to the north. Highway 36 continues east to a junction with Highway 367 (Eastline Road). The highway has a gap in the route; resuming north at the eastern side of the US 63/US 67/US 167/US 67B interchange. It runs east as Race Avenue, intersecting Highway 367 (Eastline Road) near Doniphan Lake and the Doniphan Lumber Mill Historic District and angling south to enter the small town of Kensett. Highway 36 is named Wilbur D. Mills Avenue in Kensett, the birthplace of the 38-year United States Congressman and 1972 Democratic presidential primary candidate known as \\"the most powerful man in Washington DC\\" during his time chairing the House Ways and Means Committee. Passing near Mills' longtime home, now listed as the Mills House on the NRHP, the highway serves as the northern terminus of Highway 385 (SE 1st Street), which leads to downtown Kensett. Highway 36 continues southeasterly until turning onto SE 4th Street, crossing Black Creek, and exiting Kensett. East of Kensett, Highway 36 runs east and begins paralleling the Little Red River near the Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) to the small town of West Point. Highway 36 serves as the northern terminus of Highway 323 (Pete's Road) before turning toward the river and downtown. Once downtown, Highway 36 turns along Front Street, paralleling the Little Red River eastbound, passing West Point City Hall and the Otha Walker Homestead and exiting town heading toward the southeast corner of White County. Passing through sparsely populated country, Highway 36 runs through Andrews and Pryor, curves around Taylor Slough, and passes Entight and the Henry Gray Hurricane Lake Wildlife Management Area (WMA) before entering the small town of Georgetown. State maintenance terminates at an intersection with Pearl Street, with the roadway continuing northeast as Dee Mears Road. The ARDOT maintains Highway 36 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the Department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ARDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2018, the peak AADT on the highway (excluding concurrencies) was 24,000 vehicles per day (VPD) as Beebe-Capps Expressway in Searcy near the Sawmill Road intersection. Traffic volume drops quickly heading west, below 10,000 west of the Honey Hill Road intersection, and below 5,000 by the western city limits of Searcy. Between Rose Bud and Searcy, Highway 36 sees around 4,000 VPD, and west of Rose Bud, the highway sees around 2,000 VPD, increasing to 3,900 VPD near the western terminus. Eastbound, Highway 36 sees 19,000 VPD near downtown Searcy and around 12,000 VPD near US 67/US 167, establishing it as the second-most used entrance to the city from the freeway (behind the 21,000 using Race Avenue). Counts dropped to 4,100 VPD in Kensett, and as low as 470 VPD east of West Point. No segment of Highway 36 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History Highway 36 was created during the original 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering between State Road 60 (now US 64) at Hamlet and Searcy. It was extended east to Kensett around 1938, and to Georgetown around 1945. The section connecting US 67 near Doniphan to Searcy became US 67 City (US 67C, now US 67B) as part of a major realignment of US 67 in 1950. A realignment in Kensett shifted Highway 36 from Searcy Street to Marquad Avenue (today Wilbur D. Mills Avenue) on August 2, 1961. Following construction of a four-lane US 67 along the east side of Searcy, Highway 36 replaced part of US 67C through Searcy. The Highway 36 and US 67B alignment was changed again on December 5, 1991 and again on May 13, 1998. Much of Highway 36 through Searcy closely follows the former Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad tracks. Some track section are still visible in parking lots along Mulberry Avenue. Major intersections Mile markers reset at some concurrencies.

Found today as a subcaste of the Sri Lankan Vellalar, the Madapallis were considered an independent caste until recently. Originally serving as cooks for the Jaffna kings, they were also appointed as palace steward of the Jaffna Kingdom. They were reputed as a powerful caste in the colonial era, who held the positions of Mudaliyars and Kanakkapillais.  Etymology  The etymology of Madapalli is disputed. The word Madapalli can in the Tamil language mean \\"kitchen\\" or \\"cook house\\", specifically used in a temple, derived from the Tamil words ma·π≠ai meaning \\"cooking\\" and pa·∏∑·∏∑i meaning \\"place of worship\\". Mudaliyar Rajanayagam gives the meaning of Madapalli as signifying \\"Royal kitchen\\". Others derive the word from a place called \\"Madapalli\\" located in the Kalinga region, where some claim origin from. Another theory suggest the word being derived from Madappan meaning \\"500 villages\\", as they claim themselves as rulers of 500 villages in the Kalinga region.  History  As the etymology suggest, the Madapallis were the former cooks of the Jaffna Kingdom. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai credits the last king, Cankili II, with creating the class of Madapalli. Cankili appointed higher-classes of Vellalars as cooks and officials of the royal kitchen personnel. Some of them were descendant of concubines of the last Aryacakravarti nobles. Those working for the royals were known as Raja Madapalli, those working for the ministers were known as Sarva Madapalli, and those who blew the conch in the temples were known as Sanku Madapalli. The Sanku Madapallis constituted of the Akampadiyar, Paradesikal, Sangamar and the Panar communities. After the fall of Jaffna Kingdom, sections of the Madapallis were converted to Christianity and drew closer to power under the Portuguese colonizers in the 16th century. After the Portuguese were defeated by the Dutch colonizers, the Christian Madapallis along with the Karaiyars revolted against the Dutch rule in the Jaffna region in 1658. The Dutch started favoring the Vellalars, whose power started to grow rapidly under their reign. To counterbalance the growing power of the Vellalars, the Madapallis were removed from earlier suspicion and were equally appointed to the administrative office by the Dutch in the 1690s. Larger numbers of the Ceylonese Mudaliyars were drawn from the Madapallis who were constantly in rivalry with the Vellalars for political power. The Dutch minister of 17th century, Philippus Baldaeus, described the Christian Madapallis along with the Christian Karaiyars and Vellalars as the most influential classes of the Christians. The Madapallis took up agriculture as occupation and merged and formed a subcaste of the Vellalars.

Early life  Lisitsyna was born on 14 February 1922 to a Vepsian family in Zhitnoruchey, Karelia. After graduating from secondary school in Rybreka she studied to become a librarian from 1938 to 1940 in Leningrad, after which she worked as a librarian at the Segezha Regional Club until the German invasion of the Soviet Union. She was a member of the Komsomol and enjoyed sports, including cycling, skiing, and sharpshooting, which later proved to be useful skills when she was a partisan. Partisan activities On 15 June 1942 Lisitsyna, fellow partisan Mariya Melentyeva, and six other partisans were sent by the Red Army behind enemy lines in Leningrad for a one-month reconnaissance-in-force mission, where the two were assigned to establish an underground Komsomol Committee and construct safehouses for other partisans in Sheltozero in addition to gathering information on enemy forces, fortresses, and firing points. A village elder where she was stationed assisted in establishing the Komsomol division, which spread anti-axis leaflets in prisoner-of-war camps and in Finnish Army barracks. After pinpointing locations of Axis garrisons for the Soviet Airforce to bomb and lists of names of several individuals who had assisted the Axis, the partisans were told they would have to return to Soviet-controlled territory alone because the aircraft assigned to transporting them could not make the trip. The journey required the partisans to cross the Svir river, which was icy but not frozen. When they discovered the small boat intended for the crossing was gone, they constructed a haphazard raft that fell apart during the crossing. After she fell into the water she removed her heavy dress and placed the important documents on her head under her hat; due to the temperature of the water Lisitsyna developed cramps so bad she couldn't move, but couldn't yell for help because there were several enemy camps on the shore. Melentyeva tried to save Lisitsyna but couldn't carry her across the river, so she left Lisitsyna behind and took the documents from Lisitsyna with her.  Recognition  Lisitsyna was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 25 September 1943 by decree of the Supreme Soviet.

Formative years Born on September 6, 1918 in Geffen, in what was the Maasdonk province (and in what is now a section of the North Brabant province of the Netherlands), Maria Catharina (‚ÄúRiet‚Äù) van Grunsven was the eldest child of her family. Her father was a contractor who engaged in animal husbandry, raising chickens and the occasional pig while also producing milk and cheese from the family‚Äôs cow to help support his family. He was also reportedly was a firearms enthusiast who also enjoyed archery.Kriele, Paul. \\"Riet van de Haterd-Van Grunsven.\\" 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands: Bossche Encyclopedie: Retrieved online April 28, 2018. World War II Maria Catharina (‚ÄúRiet‚Äù) van Grunsven and her father both joined the Dutch Resistance when World War II broke out in Europe. Immediately becoming an armed freedom fighter, she initially operated in the Netherlands province of North Brabant, gathering intelligence, delivering medication to Allied and Resistance troops in the north and performing courier duties for her resistance cell while also helping to free captive Dutch citizens from the prison at Mari√´nhof, the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in Vught, and that concentration camp's subcamp at Sint-Michielsgestel.Riet van de Haterd-Van Grunsven, Bossche Encyclopedie. Meanwhile, her father assisted the Landelijke Knokploegen (the National Knokploegen or LKP), a resistance organization established by the National Organization for Assistance to Abduction (LO), which falsified identity cards and ration cards as part of the group‚Äôs efforts to help Dutch citizens evade persecution and capture by Nazi officials. Hiding soldiers, businessmen and political figures in the attic of a secret annex he had built into the van Grunsven home, which was located in one of Geffen‚Äôs more secluded areas, he then hid more at-risk individuals in a shelter he had constructed outside between two wooded hills. Under increasing scrutiny, he was arrested multiple times.Riet van de Haterd-Van Grunsven, Bossche Encyclopedie. As Riet van Grunsven continued her resistance work, she accepted increasingly dangerous assignments. During one, she broke two fingers while evading capture, an injury which left those two fingers in a permanently crooked state. In September 1944, she was assigned to rescue a priest and another Dutch citizen who had been arrested and sentenced to death after being falsely accused of blowing up a railroad. Dressed in a nurse's uniform and carrying a 6.35 mm revolver, she infiltrated the prison at Mari√´nhof by bribing a guard with a bottle of wine laced with sleeping medication. After locating the key to the men's cell, she spirited the pair out of the prison, and sent them to a Taalstraat safehouse.Riet van de Haterd-Van Grunsven, Bossche Encyclopedie. By the final year of the war, Riet van Grunsven had become a ‚Äúline crosser,‚Äù one of just 21 special resistance operatives from the larger Biesbosch resistance and Albrecht intelligence groups who safeguarded the secret connection between occupied and liberated Netherlands. Operating with her colleagues via the waterways of the Biesbosch and the Merwede, she risked her life numerous times to make this line crossing as a courier, transferring vital information to Allied troops under the aliases of ‚ÄúIce Block‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrouble.‚Äù While engaged in one of these missions during the winter of 1944‚Äì1945, she was permanently partially paralyzed during a fall in which she damaged a cervical vertebra.‚ÄúPrins Bernhard reikt onderscheidingen uit‚Äù (‚ÄúPrince Bernhard awards honors‚Äù), Haarlems Dagblad. 1949.Riet van de Haterd- Van Grunsven, Bossche Encyclopedie. Although she frequently traveled alone on her various resistance assignments during the war, she did regularly work for or with several individuals, including: Ad Benne, Carel van de Donck, Daan and Klaas Gielen, Henk Koning, Harrie Roelands, Jan de Swart, and the students known as Duyx and Trimbos.Riet van de Haterd-Van Grunsven, Bossche Encyclopedie. After her nation was liberated from its German occupiers in May 1945, word of her dangerous exploits spread va newspaper reports, which heralded her valor while also documenting her injury and partial paralysis. Rather than using her birth name, many of those accounts used her resistance name, a practice which would be repeated for much of her post-war life. Her given name was used, however, when she was formally honored by the Dutch government.‚ÄúPrins Bernhard reikt onderscheidingen uit‚Äù (‚ÄúPrince Bernhard awards honors‚Äù), Haarlems Dagblad. 1949.\\"Oud-illegaal werkster door de Koningin ontvangen\\" (\\"Former resistance worker received by the Queen\\"), Leidsche Courant, 1946.\\"Bronzen Leeuw: Grunsven, mej.

In June 1946, she was received by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands during a personal audience at the Paleis Het Loo (the Het Loo Palace or \\"Palace of the Woods\\") in Apeldoorn in early June 1946.

The first episode was released in 2009, with twelve episodes total. The first video introduces Carl and Paul, two llamas that share an apartment, and focuses on Paul's reaction to Carl's murder of a human. It became progressively darker as time went on, with the final episode culminating in Carl's suicide some time after Paul has died.  Characters  Carl, voiced by Chris Alex, is a gray llama who wears a green hat. In episode 4, he describes himself as \\"a dangerous sociopath with a long history of violence\\". Paul, voiced by Jason Steele, is a beige llama who wears a red hat with a flower on it. His name and gender are unknown until episode 3.  Plot  The first video opens with Paul confronting Carl over the dead body he has discovered in their living room. After questioning Carl, Paul discovers that Carl has eaten the dead man's hands in addition to murdering him. Carl's actions escalate with each episode. In the second, Carl murders several people on a cruise ship before eventually causing its destruction with no survivors, as Carl disables all the other lifeboats. The third has Carl destroy an unnamed South American country's government and gather the bodies of orphans for the purpose of constructing a \\"meat dragon\\". In the fourth, Carl destroys the city in which he and Paul live with a nuclear weapon and ties the citizen's faces to balloons, which rain down from the sky, allegedly as a surprise for Paul's birthday. The fifth opens with Carl detailing a seemingly-harmless day, only to reveal he has created a rift in the fabric of the universe from which he may harvest the severed hands from countless babies. In the sixth, Paul makes the decision to move out and Carl has completed the dragon first mentioned in episode three. Subsequent episodes show Carl trying and failing to replace Paul, an attempt to reconcile, and Carl's further mental decay until he throws himself from a bridge in the finale upon discovering Paul's remains (and after Carl had destroyed all other life on Earth).  Production  According to Steele, his vision for the series evolved after fans successfully predicted that Carl would blow up the earth in the fifth episode. Steele recorded the audio for the series using Amadeus Pro and edited it all together in Final Cut Pro. Adobe Flash was used to draw individual characters, while Adobe Photoshop was used to draw the backgrounds for the series. The program Magpie Pro 2 was used for lip syncing, and the series itself was animated in Adobe After Effects. Steele, when interviewed with E.O. Wilson for Good Alice's Handbook of Midwifery, stated that The Residents tonal-poem cover of the Robert Johnson song, \\"Dirty Gumbo\\", was used as his artistic muse during the early creative process.  Reception  The American television series The Good Wife made reference to the series in the episode \\"Killer Song,\\" which aired on March 29, 2011.

She designed and operated several prominent hotels along the Gulf Coast in the 1930s. In the 1910s she was known for her skill with sailing, skippered a portion of a race from New York to Bermuda in 1910, and learned to drive in 1911. She raised her children in Maine and Panama, where the family lived while her husband was employed by the Panama Canal Company. In 1921, after returning to the United States, she ran a hotel known as the Inn-by-the- Sea in Pass Christian, Mississippi, which was a luxury resort built by her husband. Losing the hotel during the Great Depression, the family lived on board a boat for several months before landing at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Leasing the abandoned Fort Gaines from the government, they ran The-Sea-Fort- Inn until they discovered property while sailing along the Santa Rosa Sound. In 1935, they moved to Mary Esther, Florida, where Bacon designed and ran Bacon's-by-the-Sea. The hotel was frequented by several movie production companies and stars and was listed in 1954 as one of the top ten hotels in America in Look. Early life Mabel Marks was born on December 17, 1876 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Jeanette \\"Nettie\\" Holmes (n√©e Colwell) and William Dennis Marks. Her father was a noted engineer, originally from St. Louis, Missouri, who taught at the University of Pennsylvania and later became president of the Edison Electric Light Company. During the height of his fame, he was painted by Thomas Eakins, and his portrait is now in the permanent collection of the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum. Her mother, originally from Chattanooga, Tennessee, raised the daughters and enjoyed playing both the piano and zither, as well as riding horses. Mark's older sister, Jeannette, known in her youth as \\"Gussie\\" would grow up to become a writer and a professor at Mount Holyoke College. Their parent's marriage was estranged and the girls lived with their mother, periodically in Philadelphia, as well as at their home on Lake Champlain, near Westport, New York. The family dynamic was marked by indifference and ambivalence, without close ties. Though well-to-do, the girls were mostly taught at home sporadically by a stream of governesses. Her education ended after a two-year attendance at a boarding school in Dresden, Germany, where she, her mother and her sister had located to enable Gussie's treatment for rheumatic fever. After their return to the United States, the girls and their mother primarily lived in Westport until her mother's health began to decline and she was sent to a sanitorium. She died around 1894 and soon thereafter, Marks married her second cousin, Henry Douglas Bacon (1876‚Äì1948). H.D. was the son of Frank Page Bacon and Mamie (n√©e Cooper) and grandson of Henry Douglas Bacon, an early philanthropist who had banking interests in St. Louis and San Francisco. After the banking collapse of 1855, grandfather Bacon moved to Oakland and donated his extensive art collection to the University of California. As had been the case in his wife's family, H. D.'s parents had been estranged and divorced soon after Frank inherited his father's estate. The couple married over their family objections, as their union caused H.D. to quit school in his senior year at the Virginia Military Institute. The Bacons first lived in California, where their daughter Mabel, known as \\"Bell\\", was born in 1898, but were living in Scotland in 1900, when their son Henry Douglas Jr. (1900‚Äì1925) was born. A month after his birth, in March 1900, the family returned to the United States to settle in Philadelphia. In 1903, they moved to Bath, Maine, where H.D. began working in the shipyard of the Bath Iron Works. In 1904, H.D. bought Thorne Island near the eastern shore of the Kennebec River as a summer camp and deeded it to Bacon. The couple's third child Francis Page was born in Maine in 1908. Besides raising the children, Bacon was an accomplished sailor and in 1910 made headlines in the New York Times when she participated in a motor boat race from the New York Motor Boat Club to Bermuda, which touted that she was the first woman to participate in power boat race, was going to skipper the boat, and that she had a steamboat pilot's license. She made the news again in 1911, when she took up driving a car. In 1916, H.D. was hired to head one of the shipyards for the Panama Canal project and the family relocated to Panama, though they kept their home in Maine and returned periodically over the next 3‚Äì4 years. Career In 1921, H.D. who was heading the shipbuilding department of the Foundation Company in New Orleans, Louisiana, bought property to develop as a hotel near Pass Christian, Mississippi. He designed the hotel, but Bacon operated it. Soon after the couple relocated, their three-year-old granddaughter, Rollie, came to live with her grandparents, when Bell and her first husband, Henry Thorne divorced. In 1922, Bacon' last child, William Dennis was born, and he and Rollie grew up together at the large estate. By 1924, the Inn-by-the-Sea was well-known on the Gulf Coast and had become a popular entertainment spot. The large Spanish- influenced property featured a patio ringed with Japanese lanterns which jutted to the water, allowing dancing on the deck. A 1925 expansion included a crescent of cottages facing the beach, a large water garden, and an ice manufacturing plant and the following year, 36 additional rooms were added. The couple and their extended family lived a life of luxury, building yachts and sailing, while the children enjoyed the swimming pools and ponies on the estate. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the family sold their belongings to pay the mortgage and left Mississippi with the children and two servants aboard a borrowed boat. For several months, the group sailed up and down the Alabama and Mississippi coastline, fishing for food. They came ashore on Dauphin Island, Alabama, taking refuge from a storm and discovered the abandoned Fort Gaines. Leasing the property from the government, the couple spent several months renovating the property and then opened The-Sea-Fort-Inn. They were able to eke out a living in Alabama until 1935, when the couple discovered a property in Mary Esther, Florida while sailing near Fort Walton Beach in Santa Rosa Sound. Buying the lot, Bacon designed a Tudor-style hotel along the waterfront. Known as Bacon's-by-the-Sea, the property featured cottages under the trees and gained a reputation for fine dining, manicured gardens and comfort. By 1942, H.D. and Mabel had divorced, but Bacon continued running the property until 1958, when she sold it and retired. During the war, the hotel was frequented by servicemen stationed at nearby Eglin Field and Jimmy Doolittle and Hap Arnold stayed in a couple of the cottages. A tablecloth now in the Air Force Archives at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio was taken from Bacon because it contained planning notes on Doolittle and Arnold's plans of the Tokyo raid. When Doolittle and Arnold moved out, Van Johnson moved into one of the suites formerly occupied by the generals in 1944, as the hotel served as the home base for filming of Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. In 1949, screenwriter Sy Bartlett and director Henry King completed the script for Twelve O'Clock High while staying at Bacon's-by-the Sea. During filming, the picture's star, Gregory Peck, also booked in to Bacon's. In the January 12, 1954 issue of Look, Bacon's was listed as #6 of the top 10 hotels in the United States by Duncan Hines. Look had secured agreement from the noted restaurant critic to have a film crew accompany him and his wife on a tour throughout America to rate the top 10 hotels out of all 44 states they visited. Death and legacy Bacon died December 14, 1966 died in Panama City, Florida after an illness of several years and was buried in the Mary Esther Cemetery on December 16. After Bacon's death, the hotel which she established was purchased and an attempt made to bring back the prestige it had earned during Bacon's lifetime. The venture did not succeed as in 1978, its zoning as a hotel was grandfathered with the stipulation that a hotel be built on the site again within five years. No hotel had yet been completed by 1985.

Milica Miljanov Biography Duke Marko Miljanov Medun, the birthplace of Milica Miljanov Milica Miljanov was born in Medun, around 1860. She was one of three daughters of the Montenegrin duke, Marko Miljanov. She married Ivan Lazoviƒá. Miljanov volunteered to the army in 1914 as a mother and at an age when even men are relieved from active duty, fighting all across the Balkan warfront. Unlike other women who joined the army, she did not change her identity and name, and was able to fight as a woman till the end of the war. Her daughter, Olga, born in 1898, was a writer, dancer, composer, philosopher and teacher, who was remembered as Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, the wife and associate of the American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.

It was subsequently performed by American actress and vocalist Barbra Streisand in the 1970 film adaptation of the musical. Three variations of the song appear in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack album produced by Wally Gold: the initial version sung by co-star Yves Montand, a reprise version sung by Streisand, and an orchestral version performed alongside a live chorus. The Streisand rendition was released by Columbia Records as a promotional single on 7\\" vinyl (with a stereo mix on one side and mono on the other) in July 1970. The track received positive reviews from music critics, with many of them listing it as a highlight of the soundtrack.  Background and release  \\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\" was introduced by John Cullum in the 1965 Broadway musical of the same name. It was subsequently used in the 1970 film adaptation of the musical, in which Streisand appears as the main character. The song was recorded in early 1970 while filming the movie at Samuel Goldwyn Studios in West Hollywood, California. Three versions of the song are used in the film, and all appear on the accompanying soundtrack album. The song is initially performed in the film by Streisand's co-star Yves Montand, whereas the reprise version is sung by Streisand and the orchestral version is performed with a live chorus. The reprise rendition was released as a promotional single on 7\\" vinyl in July 1970 by Columbia Records. The standard edition release includes both the mono and stereo versions of \\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\" as the A-side and B-side, respectively. A limited edition version also exists, where the mono version exclusively appears on 7\\".  Composition  \\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\" was written by Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner and produced by Wally Gold. According to the official sheet music published by the Warner Music Group, the song is written in the key of E major with a moderately fast beat consisting of 126 beats per minute. Accompanied by the instrumentation of a piano, Streisand's vocals range from G3 to C5. She begins the song with the lyric \\"On a clear day, rise and look around you / And you'll see who you are\\".  Critical reception  \\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\" was perceived as a highlight on the film's soundtrack. Vincent Canby from The New York Times lauded the single and album tracks \\"Come Back to Me\\", \\"Go to Sleep\\", and \\"What Did I Have That I Don't Have\\" for being the soundtrack's four best songs. Although AllMusic's William Ruhlmann was critical of the majority of On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, he complimented Streisand's vocal performance on the title track. The staff at Billboard complimented Streisand's performance on \\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\". They wrote that because of its strength, and the strengths of soundtrack songs \\"He Isn't You\\" and \\"What Did I Have That I Don't Have\\", the album will likely become a commercial success and is worth purchasing.

Live versions by Streisand are also included on her 1994 album The Concert and her 2000 album Timeless: Live in Concert. Robert Goulet and Johnny Mathis both recorded charting versions of the song in 1965, in the wake of the original musical's success. Goulet's version, from his album On Broadway, reached #119 on Billboard's Bubbling Under chart and #13 on the Easy Listening chart. Mathis' recording, from his album The Shadow of Your Smile, reached #96 on the Hot 100 chart and #6 on the Easy Listening chart. Other artists to record the song include John Cullum, on the 1965 cast album from the original Broadway production; Frank Sinatra, on his 1966 album Strangers in the Night; Matt Monro, on his 1966 album This Is the Life!; Jerry Vale, on his 1966 album Great Moments on Broadway; Shirley Bassey, on her 1967 album And We Were Lovers; Sammy Davis Jr., on his 1967 live album That's All!; Blossom Dearie, on her 1967 live album Sweet Blossom Dearie; The Peddlers on their 1968 album Three in a Cell; Tony Bennett, on his 1970 album Tony Bennett's \\"Something\\"; Cleo Laine, on her 1971 album Portrait; and The Singers Unlimited, on their 1975 album Feeling Free.

He is solely signed to Warner Chappell Music, Artist Publishing Group and Atlantic Records on the publishing side, while currently signed as Internet Money Records with TenThousand Projects and Caroline Records on the label side. He formerly signed a record deal with Alamo Records and Interscope Records. Early life Taylor grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, the drummer for a local band, brought him to band practice where he began learning the drums, and guitar. Taylor lost interest in playing instruments as he grew up and dropped out of school in 7th grade. At the age of 17, his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and Taylor looked for a new way of earning income. After a brief stint as a graphic designer, Taylor turned to production. He sold his first beat online for $250, and began to produce full-time. Career After realizing that he could make money selling beats online, Taylor pawned many of his possessions to furnish his in-home studio. As he developed his beat creation, he also developed his business strategy, which at first revolved around using Twitter and PayPal to sell his beats to any artist who wanted them. Taylor sells his creations via a one-time payment for usage of his material, eschewing the more complicated publishing and songwriting deals traditionally preferred by producers. In 2016, Taylor placed songs with Trey Songz and Desiigner, which were his first major placements. This led to a publishing deal signed in August 2017 with Warner Chappell Music, Artist Publishing Group and Atlantic Records, which allowed him to lease his works in the traditional way, as well as independently sell beats via his Internet Money YouTube channel. Internet Money Records Internet Money Records is a record producer collective and record label co-founded by Taz Taylor and Nick Mira. A blend of a YouTube channel, a record label, and a producer union, Internet Money is a medium for producers to sell beats, as well as an aggregator for producers and creatives. Beyond helping other producers with the business side of making music, Taylor and Internet Money host \\"tours\\", where producers can collaborate and work together. Taylor believes that Internet Money is a way to help producers make money off of music using the same techniques he uses. In 2018, Internet Money Records signed a record deal with Alamo Records and Interscope Records. During a stint in mid-2019, Taz's relationship with Alamo and Interscope soured. By late summer, Taz had agreed to a buyout with Alamo and Interscope and signed a new record deal with TenThousand Projects and Caroline Records, giving him more control of who he could sign to the joint venture. As a producer collective, Internet Money has been responsible for 34 singles that have ascended the Billboard Hot 100 in 2019, and has earned the RIAA Platinum and Gold certificates as well. The label released their debut album, B4 the Storm on August 28, 2020. The album includes vocals from Future, Kevin Gates, Gunna, Trippie Redd, Juice Wrld, 24kGoldn, Iann Dior and The Kid Laroi, among others.

It remained the seat of the St Leger family from that time until the mid-20th century. The park is open all year with free admission. The house is being restored. History The estate, together with other lands, was purchased in 1629 by Sir William St. Leger, Lord President of Munster, who moved into the 13th-century Doneraile Castle. By 1645 the castle had been attacked and burned several times and was so badly damaged that it had to be abandoned. The present house was constructed in its place in the late 1600s, utilising some of the stonework of the old castle. It was extensively remodelled and the current facade added in 1725 by architect Isaac Rothery. Over the years various extensions were added such as an octagonal kitchen and game store built in 1869. A dining room built at the same time and a nine bay Gothic Revival style conservatory built in 1825 have since been demolished. Other improvements within the estate included cottages, lodges, farm buildings and stables. The St. Leger family owned and bred horses for hunting and racing on the estate. In 1870 the Doneraile demesne covered some in and around Doneraile, but was gradually reduced in size by the sale of land to tenants under the various Land Acts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The remaining demesne land, which now comprises Doneraile Wildlife Park, was sold to the government in 1943, followed by the house itself in 1969 when the last St Leger occupier left. When Doneraile Court was the residence of Lord Castletown, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who had been a soldier in the American Civil War, and became a lawyer and United States Supreme Court justice, carried on an extensive correspondence with Clare, Lady Castletown. He visited Doneraile on several occasions, and may have had an affair with her. The grounds in the vicinity of the house is laid out in the style of Capability Brown whilst the deer park contains Killarney Red, Sika and Fallow deer and the meadows a herd of Kerry cattle.

The paper is notable as the first to publish the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as being the first daily newspaper in the United States. History Benjamin Towne published the first issue of the Post on January 24, 1775, using paper borrowed from James Humphreys without expectation of payment. The paper was supportive of the cause of the American Revolution, and was the first to publish the United States Declaration of Independence, with it taking up the front page of the July 6, 1776 issue. During the British occupation of Philadelphia in 1778, the paper's ideology shifted towards loyalism. Other loyalist papers in the city, such as Humphrey's Pennsylvania Ledger, ceased publication as the British were losing control of Philadelphia; Towne stayed. As a result of his loyalist publication, the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania placed him on a list of traitors. Towne's Post was selected to publish this list of traitors, possibly because other printers had not returned to the city. In 1779, the Post published a series of articles written by Whitehead Humphreys, under the pseudonym \\"Cato.\\" Humphreys's articles attacked the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 and accused Thomas Paine of being a loyalist. On July 24, supporters of the Constitutional Society, lead by Charles Wilson Peale, dragged Towne to a meeting and demanded the identity of Cato. Towne named Humphreys, and the mob attacked Humphreys's house. These controversies lead to a decrease in revenue. In 1780, Towne began advertising for hawkers. The paper started daily publication in spring of 1783, the first in the country to do so. The paper would continue publication in this format until 1784; reportedly, near the end of its run, Towne personally hawked the paper.

Epub 2011 Dec 13.Tracking anti-vaccination sentiment in Eastern European social media networks, UNICEF but, with the exception of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the 1950s, there have been few documented cases of vaccine-strain virus infecting contacts of a vaccinated person. Viral shedding is part of the mechanism of virus transmission. Shedding is impossible with killed vaccines or those made using only isolated proteins (most vaccines fall into one of these two classes), but a small number of vaccines contain live attenuated virus which can theoretically infect others. Not all pathogens are shed; shedding does not equal transmission; and transmission does not always cause disease. The only vaccine to have caused any significant number of infections is the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the 1950s, and this vaccine is no longer used. The route of infection was through contact with faeces, and some vaccines, like the viruses they prevent, are shed in stool for up to 28 days. Normal hygiene is sufficient to prevent infection but immunocompromised individuals need to be especially diligent. Other attenuated vaccines show no significant shedding, inadvertent infection is rare (for example, there are 11 cases of chickenpox which may have been transmitted by vaccinated individuals out of approximately 50 million doses), and only a single case of transmission of influenza virus has been documented, and that person remained asymptomatic. The attenuated virus from vaccines is much weaker and less likely to infect than the wild virus. A study of 345 participants aged 5‚Äì49 years who received the live influenza virus vaccine LAIV3, and for whom shedding was assessed by viral culture of nasal swabs (daily for days 1‚Äì7 postvaccination, every other day for days 9 through 25, and on day 28) indicated that 30% had detectable virus in nasal secretions obtained by nasal swabbing. In an open-label study of 200 children aged 6‚Äì59 months who received a single dose of LAIV3, shedding of low titers of at least one vaccine virus was detected on culture in 79% of children and was more common among the younger recipients. Serious illnesses have not been reported among unvaccinated persons infected inadvertently with vaccine viruses. The estimated probability of transmission of vaccine virus within a contact group with a single LAIV recipient in this population was 0.58%. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/background/safety- vaccines.htm References Category:Vaccines Category:Virology ","title":"Vaccine shedding"},{"id":"57276040","text":"Mirza Nizamuddin was a mansabdar of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar.

It is situated along Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square, Cambridge and consists of five floors of residential areas, kitchens, and student lounges. It houses about 45 female students. Structure Women's Independent Living Group (WILG) second floor lounge The house consists of 2 entryways leading to five floors of single and double bedrooms for approximately 45 students. The house also hosts a main dining room, four lounges on various floors, a music room, an exercise room, a library, a Graduate Resident Assistant (GRA) suite, two kitchens, a computer room, a guest room, and other common spaces. The basement houses laundry machines, storage space, and machinery for renovations. Additionally, the back entryway leads to a parking space and areas for bike racks. The building itself is connected structurally to the MIT Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) fraternity, which shares a balcony with the house. The house is run by an executive government, with advisory from the WILG Alumnae Corporation. History The Women's Independent Living Group (WILG) was founded in 1976 by Kate Hendricks '71, Dorothy L. Bowe '84, Marjorie Pierce, Elisabeth Drake ‚Äô58, former Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Nancy Wheatley ‚Äô71, Zaurie Zimmerman ‚Äô77, and former Dean Ken Wadleigh. Women's Independent Living Group (WILG) first floor kitchenthe 1960s, several sororities at MIT approached coed living groups about starting a chapter on campus. A small group of students approached the Association of MIT Alumnae (AMITA) about the possibility of an all-women's living group. At the time, while there were places for women to live on and off campus, including McCormick, a female-only dorm, and several co-ed fraternities and dorms, there was no cooperative living group for females. The population of female students on campus was also beginning to overcrowd McCormick, so the Dean of the Graduate School Ken Wadleigh proposed using a building at 351-355 Massachusetts Avenue as the location for the new living group. The building was MIT controlled, although owned independently by Northgate Corporation and being used as an apartment providing off-campus housing to MIT affiliates. Because the building was deemed too large for one living group, half was allotted to Alpha Delta Phi (ADP), then a new fraternity forming on campus. While 355 Massachusetts Avenue was being renovated, both the women's living group and the fraternity shared the living space in 351. The first floor was built with a ramp instead of stairs for the back door to ensure at least one handicapped-accessible floor. In 1976, the independent living group had its first entry in the Undergraduate Residence Book, distributed to incoming freshmen to help them choose their living arrangement for the year. In the 1976-1977 school year, ten women and six freshman joined the house, alongside four transfer students. Several of the founders, Dorothy Lowe, Elisabeth Drake, Marjorie Pierce, and Kate Hendricks, formed the WILG Alumnae Corporation as its first members in order to advise the house.

The group is the largest operator of bowling alleys in Britain. HBG is a Member of the Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA) along with other bowling centre groups in a UK and has to adhere to the British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA) governing body‚Äôs guidelines.  History  = Under AMF Bowling= The United States company AMF Bowling opened its first centre in the United Kingdom in Stamford Hill, North London on 20th of January 1960. Between 1967 and 1970, AMF Bowling UK acquired its first 15 centres. After Goldman Sachs purchased AMF Bowling in 1996, the number of centres owned and operated by AMF Bowling in the UK rose in 1997 from 15 to 37. The company then embarked on a program to refurbish the acquired centres. The AMF Bowling centres were found at Ashford, Gravesend, Stamford Hill and other locations. In 2004 certain shareholders of the British leisure conglomerate, Bourne Leisure, acquired the AMF-branded centres in the UK. AMF Bowling UK then embarked on another programme of refurbishment and since 2007 had opened five new centres in the UK. = The Original Bowling Company = An example of the score screen at Hollywood Bowl in Yeovil In August 2010 AMF Bowling UK acquired the Hollywood Bowl business from Mitchells & Butlers PLC to become the Original Bowling Company Ltd (OBC), UK‚Äôs largest bowling centre operator. OBC then sold its \\"traditional\\" business to 1st Bowl, now known as MFA Bowl. In September 2014, Electra Private Equity acquired OBC for ¬£91 million. In 2015, OBC purchased rival Bowlplex. OBC itself then rebranded as Hollywood Bowl Group (HBG) after purchase of Bowlplex and phased out Bowlplex and most AMF branded centres, rebranded them as Hollywood Bowl ‚Äì which was already its biggest brand of its three.https://www.cityam.com/original-bowling-company- strikes-take-over-bowlplex/ =Puttstars and pandemic = With phasing out of Bowlplex complete, Hollywood Bowl Group (HBG) started to develop a mini golf brand. HBG opened its first Puttstars but 20 days later, on 23 March 2020, the British Government imposed a lockdown across the UK causing all centres to shut. Before bowling centres were able to open, it was announced that similar businesses (for example cinemas) could open but bowling alleys could not. HGB campaigned to be able to reopen at the same time as these businesses. On 15 August 2020, Hollywood Bowl Group, along with other bowling centres and casinos, could reopen all its centres after over four and a half months of not being able to operate. Two planned Puttstars, also in August 2020, could open as their original opening dates were pushed back due to lockdown. Rules to protect staff and customers had to be put in place to keep people inside of the centres from contracting Covid-19 from others in the centre if they had it and did not know or flouting rules and willingly bring in the contagion. Brands =Hollywood Bowl= HBG‚Äòs Flagship brand. =AMF Bowling= AMF Bowling is a brand that was owned by a USA counter-part and is now a sub brand of HBG. AMF Bowling is currently being phased out, as its centres are being renovated and moving to the Hollywood Bowl branding. =Puttstars= Puttstars is the newest brand of the three. Hollywood Bowl Group opened its first mini golf centre at The Springs Retail Park, Leeds in March 2020. On the 23rd that same month of opening, however, it had to be closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic due to measures put in place by the British Government. This pandemic also shuttered all of Hollywood Bowl Group‚Äôs other centres, with most only able to reopen after push backs on the 15th of August. Two planned mini golf centres in York‚Äôs Community Stadium development (with adjacent Hollywood branded centre) and Rochdale were able to open for the first time in with reopening of other sites. Former brands =Bowlplex= Bowlplex Ltd was a bowling and leisure corporation that owned and operated 18 \\"total entertainment centres\\" across England, Wales and Scotland. Centres Bowlplex Centres were found at: Basingstoke, Birmingham, Blackburn, Braehead, Brighton, Bristol, Castleford, Dudley, Dunfermline, Nantgarw, Oxford, Poole/ Branksomehttps://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/16395080.bowlplex-become- hollywood-bowl-250-000-upgrade/, Tower Park, Portsmouth: Gunwharf Quays and Tunbridge Wells. The final additions to the Bowlplex branding were in Cwmbran (Wales) and Camberley (Surrey). Both centres were operated with the new style of operations, with Brunswick Machinery lane machinery, scoring system and Meriq online bookings package. The stadium sports bar and Grill & Chill also had the addition of a new food and beverage operating system. History Millhaven Leisure was formed in 1976 to acquire the Branksome Bowl, as a Wessex Bowl. In 1984 that long-serving Managing Director Tracy Standish became involved with Bowlplex. Over 25 years Bowlplex grew into a national group at 18 locations across the UK offering late-night licensed bars, dance floors, American pool. In a commercial deal with Sega Amusements Europe, Bowlplex had new arcade and gaming machines installed at all 18 centres. The Bowlplex unit at Yeovil was bought by 1st Bowl in 2012 and is now trading as a MFA Bowl. In April 2015, the Original Bowling Company announced its intention to purchase Bowlplex, subject to approval by the Competition and Markets Authority. By late 2015 10 Bowlplex units were acquired by the company with most of the locations being rebranded under the \\"Hollywood Bowl\\" name. With competition concerns, six Bowlplex sites were sold to Tenpin Ltd in Bristol, Camberley, Castleford, Dudley, Glasgow and Nantgarw.

She has served as Mayor of Montpelier, Vermont since March 2018. Watson is a physics teacher at Montpelier High School. She served on the Montpelier city council for several years before running unopposed for mayor in late 2017. In 2010, Watson launched an eventually successful campaign with the Vermont Youth Ultimate League to recognize Ultimate Frisbee as an official varsity-level sport in Vermont's high schools. In April 2018, Watson was named in a blog article on the REI website as one of \\"five of the coolest mountain-city mayors\\" in the United States. In November 2018, Watson was named to Vermont Business Magazine‚Äôs rising star ‚Äú40 under 40 list.‚Äù Biography Watson was born in Essex, Vermont. She received her bachelor's degree in mathematics, with a minor in physics, from Penn State University in 2003. Watson next enrolled at the University of Vermont, where she completed a one-year master's degree in secondary education with a specialty in science. =Teacher= Watson joined the faculty of Montpelier High School as a physics teacher in 2004. Watson having completed 5 years fellowship became a Senior Fellow at the Knowles Teacher Initiative. In 2010 she received certification from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards and became one of the 118,000 certified teachers in America. 3.3% of American teachers are board certified. In 2015, Watson appeared before the State Education Committee to advocate for a plan in which students from China would spend a year in Montpelier, attending the local high school. She proposed that the students would be housed in the dormitories of the Vermont College of Fine Arts. She received a Rowland Foundation Fellowship to further work on this proposal. =Coach and sports activist = Watson coaches Ultimate (once known as Ultimate Frisbee). Under her coaching, the Men's Ultimate team advanced to the Vermont finals five times from 2010 to 2017. In 2010, Watson launched a campaign with the Vermont Youth Ultimate League to recognize Ultimate as an official varsity-level sport in Vermont's high schools. Watson, who had played Ultimate (as it's commonly known) in college and coaches the sport at Montpelier High School, led a seven year state lobbying effort on behalf of the sport. Her efforts proved successful on November 3, 2017, when the Vermont Principals Association, which supervises the state's high school sports programs, unanimously approved Ultimate as a full varsity sport, beginning in the Spring 2019 season. The approval made Vermont the first state in the country to recognize Ultimate as a varsity sport. The approval ensures that players are not charged to participate, and that coaches are paid and provided with safety training. Watson has been widely credited with Ultimate's landmark varsity recognition through her campaign. =Political career= Watson entered politics in 2012 when she was appointed to the vacant District 2 seat on the Montpelier City Council. She served three terms on the city council from 2012 until she left office to become mayor in 2018. On November 2, 2017, three-term incumbent Montpelier Mayor John Hollar announced that he would not seek re-election to a fourth term in the March 2018 mayoral election. Watson, who was serving as President of the Montpelier City Council, announced her candidacy on November 6. Watson campaigned on a platform with a focus on finances, infrastructure, the environment, and development. \\"Montpelier is a place where we have twice as many jobs as residents, and that's not even adjusting for job-age residents,‚Äù Watson says. ‚ÄúMany more people commute here to work than live here, and if we can make it more affordable and accessible for people to live here, it‚Äôll help reduce carbon emissions. If we can enhance recreational options so they don't have to drive far to get to them, that will also help.\\" Watson was elected on March 6, 2018.

Blackwell gained national media attention when she represented hundreds of United States citizens and permanent residents who were replaced by recipients of H-1B temporary work visas. In 2018, she represented New Orleans Saints cheerleader, Bailey Davis, who was fired for an Instagram post and allegedly attending a party where NFL players were present.  Background  Blackwell earned a B.S. in Criminal Justice from McNeese State University (1999) and her J.D. from Louisiana State University, Paul M. Hebert Law Center (2002). She currently (April 2018) teaches Employment Law at the University of South Florida. Her public sector experience includes working for a judge as a federal court law clerk and she served as an attorney for the Western District of Louisiana. In the private sector, she has worked for several firms as an employment attorney. She is currently the president of The Blackwell Firm.  High profile cases  = H-1B visa foreign worker replacement = In 2016, Blackwell represented former Information Technology (IT) personnel of Walt Disney Corporation, in Perrero v. HCL America, Inc. et al. In dismissing the case, Judge Gregory A. Presnell exposed a loophole in the displacement protections afforded United States workers. In the 1998 amendment, a class of exempt H-1B workers was created with the minimum criterion of either a master's degree or a $60,000 salary. The exemption is only available to H-1B Dependent firms who employ 15% or more of their personnel on H-1B (or L-1) visas. The Atlantic reports that these firms, primarily specializing in outsourcing, are free to replace older or more expensive employees with temporary foreign workers. Undeterred with the dismissal in Perrero v. HCL America, Inc. et al., Blackwell provided representation and organizational expertise in several similar H-1B cases: 49 career IT personnel at the University of California, Davis, forced to train their replacements, resulting in a workforce reduction of 97 personnel, 400 IT personnel trained their replacements at Southern California Edison, 200 similarly dismissed IT personnel from Carnival Cruise Line, and in its 220 personnel separation, Eversource Energy labeled the training of replacements as \\"knowledge transfer\\". Blackwell has appeared on 60 Minutes, and spoke at Trump presidential campaign rallies, but she voiced frustration with the administration's progress in addressing the flawed temporary foreign worker programs in March 2017. = NFL cheerleaders differential treatment = In March 2018, the New York Times printed the story of a former New Orleans Saints cheerleader's E.E.O.C. filing concerning the team's employment policies. The New York Times learned from Bailey Davis' interviews, emails and an eight-page handbook that unlike the rule for NFL players, the team has an anti-fraternization policy where cheerleaders must leave public accommodations if a player enters the room, may not speak to and must block NFL players on social media, may not be photographed in uniform and may not appear nude or in revealing attire. Davis was fired for appearing on her private Instagram in a one piece bathing suit. A Blackwell orchestrated a series of television interviews gained wide exposure in the United States, and with some international publishers. In April, former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, Kristan Ann Ware, joined with Davis as an additional plaintiff concerning an incident related to her religion, the team admits to the incident and that it reprimanded the supervisory employee; however, that employee is still with the team. As of April 29, 2018, the plaintiffs are seeking arbitration with the NFL and one dollar in compensation. Prior to the Bailey Davis E.E.O.C. filing, Time magazine reported that NFL cheerleaders are paid about $10.00 per hour, and these salaries are often capped. An earlier lawsuit claimed with additional commitments and expenses, a San Francisco 49ers cheerleader earned about $2.75 per hour.

Early life and career  Stephen Price was born in New York City on September 25, 1782. He was the eldest son of Michael Price and Helena Cornwell, who also had one daughter and three younger sons who survived infancy. Price's parents owned a farm in Red Bank, New Jersey, prior to the American Revolution. Michael Price sided with the Loyalists during the war, and when the British occupied New York City, he moved his family to the city and became a merchant. In August 1783, Michael Price was indicted for his loyalty to the British crown, and the family fled to Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Unlike many other Loyalists who left the United States at the conclusion of the war, Michael Price returned with his family to New York, probably in early 1784, and was able to resume his career as a merchant, sending three of his sons to college, and setting up the youngest as a grocer. Stephen Price graduated from Columbia College in 1799. In 1804, he became a lawyer, and practiced in New York City for four or five years before a change in career.  Philip Hamilton and George Eacker  On November 20, 1801, Price accompanied Philip Hamilton (the oldest son of Alexander Hamilton) to a play at the Park Theatre, where a verbal confrontation with George Eacker took place. Although contemporary reports named Hamilton's companion only as \\"Mr. Price\\" or \\"young Mr. Prince\\" , historians have identified that person with near-certainty as Stephen Price. The encounter with Eacker culminated in challenges issued by Price and Hamilton, resulting in two separate duels with pistols in Weehawken, New Jersey. The first duel, between Price and Eacker, took place at noon on November 22, 1801, and resulted in no injuries, though four shots were fired. Price and Eacker shook hands and reconciled, and Price was heard to remark that Eacker was \\"such a damned lath of a fellow that he might shoot all day to no purpose\\". The second duel took place the next day, November 23, 1801, when Philip Hamilton was shot and killed by Eacker.  Theatrical career  Park Theatre (at right), on Park Row in Manhattan, Price began purchasing shares in the Park Theatre in 1808, taking advantage of the theatre's financial difficulties to gradually attain a controlling interest. Upon taking over management of the theatre, Price became the first American theatre manager who was not also an actor or playwright, focusing solely on management. He managed the Park Theatre for 31 years, during which time he initiated the decline of the theatrical resident company by bringing foreign celebrities to New York, leading to an emphasis on stars over a traditional stock company. Price began importing stars in 1810, beginning with George Frederick Cooke. He also began to abandon the practice of staging productions in repertory, and favored attracting audiences with visually spectacular shows. Assisted by stage manager and operating manager Edmund Simpson, Price was able to keep the theatre open during the War of 1812, after which he traveled regularly to London in search of talented players such as Mary Greenhill Barnes, Clara Fisher, Edmund Kean, Charles Mathews, and Henry Wallack. After a fire in May 1820, the Park Theater was rebuilt, and reopened in September 1821. From 1826 to 1830, Price left New York to manage the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, securing for himself a steady supply and near-monopoly on English stage stars for American tours at the Park Theatre and venues in other cities, which he organized into a circuit. The Park began to decline during the 1830s, and soon after Price resumed his personal management of the theatre, he fell ill and died on January 20, 1840.  Family and personal life  Stephen Price was the oldest of four brothers and one sister. He and two of his younger brothers, Edward and William, attended Columbia College. William M. Price became a lawyer and politician who served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1834 to 1838. Price's youngest brother, Benjamin, became a grocer in Rhinebeck, New York. In May 1816, Benjamin was killed in a duel at Weehawken by a British army officer, who then returned to England. Several years later, Stephen Price learned that a different British officer, during a visit to New York, had boasted of being \\"instrumental\\" in goading his fellow officer into the 1816 duel. As a result, despite suffering from gout, Price promptly challenged the visiting officer and killed him in a duel at Bedloe's Island.

It is used in menopausal hormone therapy among other indications. As the sodium salt (sodium estrone sulfate), it is the major estrogen component of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and esterified estrogens (Estratab, Menest). In addition, E1S is used on its own as the piperazine salt estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate; Ogen). The compound also occurs as a major and important metabolite of estradiol and estrone. E1S is most commonly taken by mouth, but in the form of Premarin can also be taken by parenteral routes such as transdermal, vaginal, and injection. Medical uses E1S is used in menopausal hormone therapy among other indications. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= E1S itself is essentially biologically inactive, with less than 1% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for the estrogen receptors (ERs), ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. The compound acts as a prodrug of estrone and more importantly of estradiol, the latter of which is a potent agonist of the ERs. Hence, E1S is an estrogen. =Pharmacokinetics= E1S is cleaved by steroid sulfatase (also called estrogen sulfatase) into estrone. Simultaneously, estrogen sulfotransferases transform estrone back into E1S, which results in an equilibrium between the two steroids in various tissues. E1S is thought to serve both as a rapidly-acting prodrug of estradiol and also as a long-lasting reservoir of estradiol in the body, which serves to greatly extend the duration of estradiol when used as a medication. When estradiol is administered orally, it is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (95%) in the intestines and liver. A single administered dose of estradiol is absorbed 15% as estrone, 25% as E1S, 25% as estradiol glucuronide, and 25% as estrone glucuronide. Formation of estrogen glucuronide conjugates is particularly important with oral estradiol as the percentage of estrogen glucuronide conjugates in circulation is much higher with oral ingestion than with parenteral estradiol. Estrone glucuronide can be reconverted back into estradiol, and a large circulating pool of estrogen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates serves as a long-lasting reservoir of estradiol that effectively extends its terminal half-life of oral estradiol. To demonstrate the importance of first-pass metabolism and the estrogen conjugate reservoir in the pharmacokinetics of estradiol, the terminal half-life of oral estradiol is 13 to 20 hours whereas with intravenous injection its terminal half-life is only about 1 to 2 hours. Estrogen sulfates like estrone sulfate are about twice as potent as the corresponding free estrogens in terms of estrogenic effect when given orally to rodents. This in part led to the introduction of conjugated estrogens (Premarin), which are primarily estrone sulfate, in 1941. Chemistry E1S, also known as estrone 3-sulfate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one 3-sulfate, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and a derivative of estrone. It is an estrogen conjugate or ester, and is specifically the C3 sulfate ester of estrone. Salts of E1S include sodium estrone sulfate and estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate). The logP of E1S is 1.4.

According to the lore of the Mosaic Templars of America, happenstance led to the founding. John E. Bush and a white acquaintance were standing on the corner of Ninth and Broadway in Little Rock, when an elderly black women requested a donation to help with the final expenses of her husband. Bush was moved to act upon the request. He met with a close friend, Chester W. Keatts, and the two had the idea to form Mosaic Templars of America. The name metaphorically linked the organization's services to African Americans and the oppressive conditions of the Jim Crow South to Moses' leadership during the Israelites exodus from slavery in Egypt and into the Promised Land. By 1900 Mosaic Templars' industries grew to include an insurance company, a building and loan association, a publishing company, a business college, a nursing school, and a hospital. By the end of 1922 the MTA had 87,069 members.Preuss p.282 The MTA's goal was \\"to unite fraternally all persons of African descent of good character of every profession, business and occupation and to give all possible moral and material aid in its power to its members.\\" It did not interfere with the political and religious opinions of its members. In 1923 the group's \\"Acting Grand Scribe\\" wrote to Arthur Preuss saying that \\"not as much stress is laid on the secret side of the organization as the business side.\\" Preuss pp.282-3 By 1905 it had lodges across the state and thousands of members. Its headquarters were housed in a handsome new building that opened in 1913 at Ninth and Broadway in Little Rock, Arkansas; Booker T. Washington delivered the dedication speech. In the 1920s it claimed chapters in twenty-six states and six foreign countries, making it one of the largest black organizations in the world. In the 1930s, the MTA began to feel the effects of the Great Depression and eventually ceased operations. However, a single chapter remains, in Barbados. The site of the organization's former headquarters is now home to the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center.

Raphael is said to have been the abbot of a monastery of Karyes, near the village of Thermi, Nicholas a deacon in the same monastery, and Irene the 12-year-old daughter of the local mayor. The story of the three saints first emerged in 1959, when local villagers reported seeing them in their dreams and in miraculous visions, during which the saints revealed their stories to them. The supposed site of their martyrdom was subsequently excavated and human remains believed to be those of the saints were found. These relics are today kept in a monastery that was re-built on the site.

The museum is located at Saransk Square in the centre of Botevgrad, western Bulgaria.  History  The museum work in the region of Botevgrad has deep roots and traditions. Two of the earliest researchers of Botevgrad's historical past were priest Georgi Popdimitrov from Skravena village, and the long-term teacher from Trudovets village, Georgi Popivanov. On 10 January 1927 a publication in the local newspaper \\"Orhanie News\\" announced the establishment of an archaeological museum as a part of the town's Ivan Vazov Library. The first museum collection was opened for the public in 1937 by the director of the local high school Asen Stefanov. In 1950, already enriched and extended, the collection was moved to the local culture centre (chitalishte) \\"Hristo Botev 1884\\", and two years later the collection was declared a state museum, and was provided with a separate building. On 24 May 1959 the museum was opened with an inauguration ceremony. In 1970 a second exhibition of the museum was inaugurated. In 1985 the museum was extended with an art collection and the opened an art gallery. From 1988 to 2010 the museum and the art gallery were located in a separate building next to the Botevgrad Clock Tower, the symbol of the town. On 1 July 2010 commenced the reconstruction of the building of the Law Court in Botevgrad. Less than an year later, on 3 May 2011, the building was re-opened and since then it has been hosting the Botevgrad History Museum.  Museum collection  The museum offers exhibition areas, as well a conference hall equipped for presentations, art exhibitions, concerts, discussions, public lectures and celebrations. The museum develops collection, research, education and popularization activities, and takes part in the organization of events from the cultural calendar of Botevgrad Municipality. As of 2018, the museum collection contains more than 15 thousand items, including documents, original photographs, personal belongings, armament, old printed literature, numismatic and heraldic artifacts, and art works.

It was alternately known as the Chicago Market. History =Founding and early activity= The Chicago Curb Exchange was incorporated in 1927. It was organized on February 6, 1928. Officers were elected and a constitution and by-laws adopted, although when trading in unlisted securities would begin and choice of quarters was undecided. Frank L. Schreiner of the Chicago Board of Trade was named president. John G. McCarthy was named treasurer, and James A. Cavanaugh was named secretary. The officers, along with E. D. Norton and E. J. Kuh Jr., formed the board of directors. It began doing business in July 1928 as \\"a trading place for securities of new companies and small concerns.\\" August C. Babize served as its first president. Among others, the broker Adolph Kempner was a \\"moving spirit\\" in the curb's founding and later a president, from 1928 until 1929. The curb was created in competition with the Chicago Stock Exchange. In 1928 and 1929 it was quite successful, and one session in 1929 saw a turnover of 175,800 shares. In 1929, peak volume was 6,645,635. On May 21, 1930, it was reported that the curb exchange was fighting the dual listing of stocks. 30 of the 200 members of the curb signed a petition asking for the resignation of the curb's three governors for being \\"active in the development of the securities market of the Chicago Board of Trade.\\" It resulted from a controversy over the dual listing of the Walgreen Company and the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. On October 14, 1931, the AP reported that the curb had \\"moved to protect investors\\" by adopting measures to facilitate company financing, while also protecting investors. At the time, Clarence G. Troup was president of the curb. When the SEC formed, the curb applied for an exemption to new guidelines. Also, the curb requested the SEC investigate \\"alleged rigging of the market in stock of the Paducah Cooperage Company.\\" In light of \\"startling information\\" developing in their investigation, on February 22, 1935, agents of the newly formed SEC in Chicago, on orders from Washington, announced that the SEC investigation into the Chicago Curb Exchange would be expanded. It would include a hearing on \\"the application of the exchange for exemption from the provisions of the SEC.\\" =Decline and closure= Its deficit was $17,931 in 1934, $17,271 in 1935, and $6,329 in 1936. In 1936, profits for the curb were $23,358 and expenses were $29,597. On December 31, 1936, net assets were $74,652, in cash and government bonds. That year, the board of governors at the curb approved 14 new listings and four additional listings, with two memberships transferred, one for $1000 and one for $1,250. The exchange also received exemption in four new states: Texas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Kansas. By January 1937, there were 82 members. In 1937, the curb sold only 560,584 shares with $26,000 par value of bonds. As of February 1938, the exchange had 77 members, many of whom were also involved in other exchanges. It leased its trading quarters in the Postal Telegraph Building. On February 4, 1938, members of the curb exchange voted to liquidate the exchange, and also voted to apply to the SEC to cancel their license as a national security exchange. 65 members voted to dissolve the organization, with no dissenting votes. The application cited its reasons as decline in membership, a four-year deficit, and a volume of listings and transactions insufficient to warrant continuing operation. The application was granted by the SEC on February 26, 1938. They were permitted to withdraw registration two days later. On March 7, trading on the curb became on a cash only basis. On 2 pm on March 15, 1938, trading permanently ceased and the board dissolved. The exchange ceased to exist with no ceremonies held.

Her father was Natan Tajtaƒçak, a poor Belgrade craftsman. As a child, she remembered the Serbian-Turkish Wars, and perhaps that survival was defined by her future voluntary work. Career As a volunteer nurse, she applied for the first time at the age of 20, during the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, and later participated in all the wars Serbia led for independence, liberation and unification. On the outbreak of World War I, she volunteered as a nurse and despite contracting typhus in 1914, she did not stop her work. During the retreat of the Serbian army, without any help, Munk collected some material and resources, and established a military hospital in Kru≈°evac, where she tried to remain until the return of the Serbian army. During the occupation, she was frequently imprisoned and was twice charged with the offence of \\"collecting aid for the Serbian irregulars\\". After the end of World War I, she continued to work in humanitarian work. She was a member of the Governing Board of the Jewish Women's Society, the League of War Volunteers, and the Serbian Red Cross. For her humanitarian work, she was honored with the Medal of the Red Cross and the Cross of Mercy. She was recognized for her work and received the Golden and Silver Medal of Queen Natalija, two St Sava Medals, Memorials from all the wars from 1885 to 1918, a Medal of the Red Cross and the Cross of Mercy. She also received the highest military honor, the Karadjordje's Star with Swords. Personal life She was married to Gutman Munk, a tailor who moved to Belgrade from Austria. Gutman held a small tailor shop in Vuk Karadzic Street, where he was manufacturing suits for more than a dozen Belgrade wholesalers. Gutman and Natalia Munk had seven children. She died in Belgrade on April 8, 1924. Beginning in 1885, until her death, she was one of the most prominent members of Serbian society.

After graduation from the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium, he studied law at the Saint Petersburg University. Due to the violations of the Lithuanian press ban, he was imprisoned for a month in 1899 and could not find a jurist job. With the help of professor Eduards Volters, he obtained a job at the library of the Russian Academy of Sciences before progressing tuberculosis forced him to return home. He died at the age of 25 and left less than a hundred original poems. His first poems were published in 1896 in Varpas though the vast majority of them were published in Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥, a Lithuanian newspaper published in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. The first collection of his poems was published posthumously in 1903 in the United States. His poems are popular, particularly those about nature in Lithuania, and have been adopted to folk songs. His poetry is sensitive, intimate, without more complex metaphors or lyrical devices, and with a depth of feeling that distinguishes it from other poetry of the period. Biography Vaiƒçaitis was born in the village on the Penta river near Sintautai, Suwa≈Çki Governorate, Congress Poland. He attended a primary school in Sintautai and Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. He started writing poetry at age 13, but his earliest poems have not survived. As typical of the period, his parents wanted him to become a priest and continue education at the Sejny Priest Seminary, but he felt no calling for priesthood and instead chose to study law at the Saint Petersburg University in 1895. His parents refused to support him financially due to his refusal to become a priest; his father remained cold and distant until his death. He received assistance from professor Eduards Volters, but struggled financially. According to visitor logs kept by Volters, he was visited by Vaiƒçaitis 29 times in 1895 (the first time on 23 August), 33 times in 1896, and 69 times in 1897. At the university, he met fellow Lithuanian student Povilas Vi≈°inskis, who became known as a mentor of literary talent. Vi≈°inskis sent three of his poems to Varpas even though the editors discouraged submissions of poetry as too many of the submitted poems were too amateurish and dilettantish; the poems were published in 1896 with an editor's note that while Vaiƒçaitis' poetry was better than average, it was still weak. Perhaps insulted by such a reception, Vaiƒçaitis sent his other poems to Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥, a Lithuanian newspaper published in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. This newspaper published more than sixty of his poems under pen name Pranci≈°kus Sekupasaka in 1897. In the summer of 1896, Vaiƒçaitis met Julija Pranaitytƒó at the home of her brother-in-law Saliamonas Banaitis. At the time, Pranaitytƒó was a gymnasium student in Saint Petersburg and they developed a close friendship that culminated in their engagement. In 1897, Vaiƒçaitis was implicated in the Sietynas case. Sietynas was an organization of Lithuanian book smugglers that smuggled and distributed the banned Lithuanian press. Police found a small library of the illegal books with his cousin Antanas Pranas Daniliauskas. Since one of his seized letters discussed obtaining the history of Lithuania by Simonas Daukantas for Vaiƒçaitis, he was also searched by the police which found a handwritten copy of a Lithuanian poem by Antanas Baranauskas. This was a particularly difficult time for Vaiƒçaitis as he lost his university stipend and was monitored by the police for a year. He was imprisoned for a month in 1899 at the Peter and Paul Fortress. Vaiƒçaitis graduated from the university in June 1899, but as politically compromised, he could not obtain a jurist job with the Russian government. He had plans to study commerce in Belgium, but he did not have funds. With the help of Volters (there are hints that Vaiƒçaitis lived with Volters for about six months), he managed to get a job at the library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but, due to progressing illness, he had to return home in April 1901. He was treated by Jonas Staugaitis and cared for by his fiance Pranaitytƒó, but the family had no money for more extensive treatments and the tuberculosis progressed. He died on 21 September 1901 in his parents' home. His tombstone was organized by Saliamonas Banaitis. He collected 95 rubles, purchased the monument in Kaunas, and transported it to the cemetery in Sintautai. It was installed for the first anniversary of his death. The tombstone cost more than 95 rubles and Volters covered the difference of 23.5 rubles. Works and legacy Vaiƒçaitis left 98 known original poems and 21 translations of poems by Russian and Polish authors, including Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolay Yazykov, and Maria Konopnicka. His manuscripts have not survived. In 2008, three new poems and one quatrain were discovered among other papers that belonged to Martynas Jankus during a renovation of a house in Kaunas. The booklet also contained a loose and shortened translation of Christmas Eve by Nikolai Gogol, which was published by Jankus in 1892. One of the poems is dated 1883, but that would mean that Vaiƒçaitis wrote it when he was seven years old. The neat handwriting indicates that it was written by a gymnasium student, thus dating the text to 1890‚Äì1891. Vaiƒçaitis' poetry is sensitive, intimate, natural, and without more complex metaphors or lyrical devices. The depth of feeling distinguishes him from other late 19th-century poets. His poetry has features of both romantic poetry and literary realism. It includes both traditions of Lithuanian folk songs (including common folk personifications, parallels, and precision of poetic scenes) ‚Äì several of his poems have been transformed into popular folk songs ‚Äì and elements of well known Russian and Polish poets. The poetry varies in topic (nature, history, patriotism, social inequality, religion, personal experiences) and in mood (love, regret, nostalgia, anger, irony), but often expresses ideas of serving your nation and seeking justice. His later poetry is particularly melancholic due to the sense of his approaching death; he was the first to write elegies in Lithuanian. Other genres included sonnets, ballads, satires, and epigrams. His works have influenced other poets, including Jonas Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas (Jovaras), Liudas Gira, Julius Janonis. Vaiƒçaitis' poems were first collected and published by the editorial staff of Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥ in the United States in 1903. In 1904, Eduards Volters published a collection of Pushkin's poems translated into Lithuanian, which was dedicated to Vaiƒçaitis and included two of his translations. The second edition (1912) of his poems was also published in the United States. His collected works, edited by Liudas Gira, though incomplete, were published in Lithuania in 1921. Various poetry collections followed: Lyrika ir satyra (1951), Rinktinƒó (1956), Yra ≈°alis (1964), Lƒókite, dainos (1975), Kas na≈°laiƒçius priglaus? (1988). A new edition of collected works was prepared by Albertas Zalatorius and Zenius ≈†ileris and published in 1996. His biography was published by Juozas Klimaitis (1994) and Zenius ≈†ileris (2001). In 1936, Vincas Grybas prepared a model for a monument to Vaiƒçaitis, but it was not erected due to financial difficulties and the outbreak of World War II. A small museum exposition was collected in 1965; it was housed at the secondary school in Sintautai before it was moved to the homestead of the Vaiƒçaitis family in 1995. A wooden sculpture by Kƒôstutis Krasauskas was installed at the homestead in 1996. A granite monument to Vaiƒçaitis by sculptor Juozas ≈†livinskas was unveiled in Sintautai in 2013.

According to other sources, Robin sowed a Robinia in each of these two gardens. In 1636, his son Vespasien Robin (1579-1662) planted another specimen of Robinia in the King's Garden, now the Jardin des plantes de Paris, where it still stands. Robin published several books, the first one in 1601 was a catalog of the 1,300 native and exotic species he cultivated (Catalogus stirpium ...). Robin was responsible for several gardens, including the one that Catherine de' Medici created for the Tuileries Palace. The small botanical garden of the School of Medicine (rue de la B√ªcherie) was also entrusted to him from its creation in 1597. This garden closed in 1617. J. Robin had brought many seeds and onions of exotic plants from Holland, which he refused to share. When the Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants (now Jardin des plantes) was created in 1626, Guy de La Brosse made Vespasien Robin his sub- demonstrator: he thus obtained that the father gave to the garden \\"more than twelve hundred species, which formed the first stock of the School of Botany \\"Le Jardin des Plantes, de BERNARD, P. ; COUAILHAC, Louis ; GERVAIS, N.

The Marathon was conceived centuries ago and as of recent has been gaining popularity among many populations around the world. The 42.195 km (26.2 mile) distance is a physical challenge that entails distinct features of an individual's energy metabolism. Marathon runners finish at different times because of individual physiological characteristics. The interaction between different energy systems captures the essence of why certain physiological characteristics of marathon runners exist. The differing efficiency of certain physiological features in marathon runners evidence the variety of finishing times among elite marathon runners that share similarities in many physiological characteristics. Aside from large aerobic capacities and other biochemical mechanisms, external factors such as the environment and proper nourishment of a marathon runner can further the insight as to why marathon performance is variable despite ideal physiological characteristics obtained by a runner.  Brief history of marathon running  The first marathon was, according to legend, a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. According to the story, he dropped dead of exhaustion shorty after arriving in Athens. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. After around 40 years of various distances, the 42.195 kilometer (26.2) mile trek became standard. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. With an increase in popularity, the scientific field has a large basis to analyze some of the physiological characteristics and the factors influencing these traits that led to Pheidippides' death. The high physical and biochemical demands of marathon running and variation across finishing times make for an intricate field of study that entangles multiple facets of human capacities.  Energy pathways during exercise  Humans metabolize food to synthesize energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is the human body's instant accessible form of energy for all functions of cells within the body. For exercise the human body places high demand for ATP to supply its self with enough energy to support all the corresponding changes in the body at work. The 3 energy systems involved in exercise are the Phosphogenic, Anaerobic and Aerobic energy pathways. The simultaneous action of these three energy pathways prioritizes one specific pathway over the others depending on the type of exercise an individual is partaking in. This differential prioritization is based on the duration and intensity of the particular exercise. Variable use of these energy pathways is central to the mechanisms that support long, sustained exercise‚Äîsuch as running a marathon. = Phosphogenic = The Phosphogenic (ATP-PC) anaerobic energy pathway restores ATP after its breakdown via Creatine Phosphate stored in skeletal muscle. This pathway is anaerobic because it does not require oxygen to synthesize or use ATP. ATP restoration only lasts for approximately the first 30 seconds of exercise. This rapid rate of ATP production is essential at the onset of exercise. The amount of creatine phosphate and ATP stored in the muscle is small, readily available, and used quickly due these two factors. Weight lifting or running sprints are examples of exercises that use this energy pathway. = Anaerobic = The Anaerobic Glycolytic Energy Pathway is the source of human energy after the first 30 seconds of an exercise until 3 minutes into that exercise. The first 30 seconds of exercise are most heavily reliant on the Phosphogenic Pathway for energy production. Through Glycolysis, the breakdown of carbohydrates from blood glucose or muscle glycogen stores yields ATP for the body without the need for oxygen. This energy pathway is often thought of as the transitional pathway between the Phosphogenic Energy Pathway and the Aerobic Energy Pathway due to the point in exercise this pathway onsets and terminates. A 300-800 meter run is an example of an exercise that uses this pathway‚Äîas it is typically higher intensity than endurance exercise, and only sustained for 30‚Äì180 seconds, depending on training. = Aerobic (Oxidative) = The Aerobic Energy Pathway is the third and slowest ATP producing pathway that is oxygen dependent. This energy pathway typically supplies the bulk of the body's energy during exercise‚Äîafter three minutes from the onset of exercise until the end, or when the individual experiences fatigue. The body uses this energy pathway for lower intensity exercise that lasts longer than three minutes, which corresponds to the rate at which the body produces ATP using oxygen. This energy system is essential to endurance athletes such as marathon runners, triathletes, cross-country skiers, etc. The Aerobic Energy Pathway is able to produce the largest amount of ATP out of these three systems. This is largely because of this energy system's ability to convert fats, carbohydrates, and protein into a state that can enter the mitochondria, the site of aerobic ATP production.  Physiological characteristics of marathon runners  = Aerobic capacity (VO2Max) = Marathon runners obtain above average aerobic capacities, oftentimes up to 50% larger than normally active individuals. Aerobic capacity or VO2Max is an individual's ability to maximally take up and consume oxygen in all bodily tissue during exhaustive exercise. Aerobic capacity serves as a good measure of exercise intensity as it is the upper limit of one's physical performance. An individual cannot perform any exercise at 100% VO2Max for extended periods of time. The marathon is generally ran at about 70-90% of VO2Max and the fractional use of one's aerobic capacity serves as a key component of marathon performance. The physiological mechanisms that aerobic capacity or VO2Max consist of are blood transportation/distribution and the use of this oxygen within muscle cells. VO2Max is one of the most salient indicators of endurance exercise performance. The VO2Max of an elite runner at maximal exercise is almost two times the value of a fit or trained adult at maximal exercise. Marathon runners demonstrate physiological characteristics that enable them to deal with the high demands of a 26.2 mile (42.195 km) run.  Components of aerobic capacity  The primary components of an individual's VO2Max are the properties of aerobic capacity that influence the fractional use (%VO2Max) of this ability to take up and consume oxygen during exhaustive exercise. The transportation of large amounts of blood to and from the lungs to reach all bodily tissues depends on a high cardiac output and sufficient levels of total body hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the oxygen carrying protein within blood cells that transports oxygen from the lungs to other bodily tissues via the circulatory system. For effective transportation of oxygen in blood during a marathon, distribution of blood must be efficient. The mechanism that allows for this distribution of oxygen to the muscle cells is muscle blood flow. A 20 fold increase of local blood flow within skeletal muscle is necessary for endurance athletes, like marathon runners, to meet their muscles' oxygen demands at maximal exercise that are up to 50 times greater than at rest. Upon successful transportation and distribution of oxygen in the blood, the extraction and use of the blood within skeletal muscle are what give effect to a marathoner's increased aerobic capacity and the overall improvement of an individual's marathon performance. Extraction of oxygen from the blood is performed by myoglobin within the skeletal muscle cells that accept and store oxygen. These components of aerobic capacity help define the maximal uptake and consumption of oxygen in bodily tissues during exhaustive exercise.  Limitations to aerobic capacity (VO2Max)  During the course of the marathon and endurance exercise in general limitations to one's aerobic capacity are what yield these athletes' aerobic capacity and therefore, their performance in running a marathon. = Cardiac = Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume . A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum hear rate can only pump a specific volume of blood. = Oxygen carrying capacity = An individual running a marathon experiences appropriation of blood to the skeletal muscles. This distribution of blood maximizes oxygen extraction by the skeletal muscles to aerobically produce as much ATP needed to meet demand. To achieve this, blood volume increases. The initial increase in blood volume during marathon running can later lead to decreased blood volume as a result of increased core body temperature, pH changes in skeletal muscles, and the increased dehydration associated with cooling during such exercise. Oxygen affinity of the blood depends on blood plasma volume and an overall decrease in blood volume. Dehydration, temperature and pH differences between the lungs and the muscle capillaries can limit ones ability to fractionally use their aerobic capacity (%VO2Max).  Secondary limitations  Other limitations affecting a marathon runner's VO2Max include pulmonary diffusion, mitochondria enzyme activity, and capillary density. These features of a marathon runner can be enlarged compared to that of an untrained individual but have upper limits determined by the body. Improved mitochondria enzyme activity and increased capillary density likely accommodate more aerobically produced ATP. These increases only occur to a certain point and help to determine peak aerobic capacity. Especially in fit individuals, the pulmonary diffusion of these individuals correlates strongly wit VO2Max and can limit these individuals in an inability to efficiently saturate hemoglobin with oxygen due to large cardiac output. The shorter transit time of larger amounts of blood being pumped per unit time can be attributed to this insufficient oxygen saturation often seen in well trained athletes such as marathoner's. Not all inspired air and its components make it into the pulmonary system due to the human body's anatomical dead space, which, in terms of exercise, is a source of oxygen wasted. = Running economy = Despite being one of the most salient predictors of marathon performance, a large VO2Max is only one of the factors that may effect marathon performance. A marathoner's running economy is their sub maximal requirement for oxygen at specific speeds. This concept of running economy helps explain different marathon time's for runners with similar aerobic capacities. The steady state oxygen consumption used to define running economy demonstrates the energy cost of running at sub maximal speeds. This is often measured by the volume of oxygen consumed, either in liters or milliliters, per kilogram of body weight per minute (L/kg/min or mL/kg/min). Discrepancies in time of winning performances of various marathon runners with almost identical VO2Max and %VO2Max values can be explained by different levels of oxygen consumption per minute at the same speeds. For this reason it can be seen that Jim McDonagh has run the marathon faster than Ted Corbitt in his winning performances compared to that of Corbitt. This greater requirement for sub maximal oxygen consumption (3.3L of oxygen per minute for Corbitt vs. 3.0L of oxygen per minute for McDonagh) is positively correlated with a greater level of energy expenditure while running the same speed. Running economy (efficiency) can be credited with being an important factor in elite marathon performance as energy expenditure is weakly correlated with a runner's mean velocity increase. A disparity in running economy determined differences in marathon performance and the efficiency of these runners exemplifies the marginal differences in total energy expenditure when running at greater velocities than recreational athletes. = Lactate threshold = A marathon runner's velocity at lactate threshold is strongly correlated to their performance. Lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold is considered a good indicator of the body's ability to efficiently process and transfer chemical energy into mechanical energy. A marathon is considered an aerobic dominant exercise, but higher intensities associated with elite performance use a larger percentage of anaerobic energy. The lactate threshold is the cross over point between predominantly aerobic energy usage and anaerobic energy usage. This cross over is associated with the anaerobic energy system's inability to efficiently produce energy leading to the buildup of blood lactate often associated with muscle fatigue. In endurance trained athletes, the increase in blood lactate concentration appears at about 75%-90%VO2Max, which directly corresponds to the VO2Max marathoner's run at. With this high of an intensity endured for over 2 hours, a marathon runner's performance requires more energy production than that solely supplied by mitochondrial activity. This causes a higher anaerobic to aerobic energy ratio during a marathon. The higher the velocity and fractional use of aerobic capacity an individual has at their lactic threshold, the better their overall performance. Uncertainty exists about how lactate threshold effects endurance performance. Contribution of blood lactate levels accumulating is attributed to potential skeletal muscle hypoxemia but also to the production of more glucose that can be used as energy. The inability to establish a singular set of physiological contributions to blood lactate accumulation's effect on the exercising individual creates a correlative role for lactate threshold in marathon performance as opposed to a causal role.  Alternative factors contributing to marathon performance  = Fuel = To sustain high intensity running, a marathon runner must obtain sufficient glycogen stores. Glycogen can be found in the skeletal muscles or liver. With low levels of glycogen stores at the onset of the marathon, premature depletion of these stores can reduce performance or even prevent completion of the race. ATP production via aerobic pathways can further be limited by glycogen depletion. Free Fatty Acids serve as a sparing mechanism for glycogen stores. The artificial elevation of these fatty acids along with endurance training demonstrate a marathon runner's ability to sustain higher intensities for longer periods of time. The prolonged sustenance of running intensity is attributed to a high turnover rate of fatty acids that allows the runner to preserve glycogen stores later into the race. Some suggest that ingesting monosaccharides at low concentrations during the race could delay glycogen depletion. This lower concentration, as opposed to a high concentration of monosaccharides, is proposed as a means to maintain a more efficient gastric emptying and faster intestinal uptake of this energy source. Carbohydrates may be the most efficient source of energy for ATP. Pasta parties and the consumption of carbohydrates in the days leading up to a marathon are common practice of marathon runners at all levels. = Thermo- regulation and body fluid loss = Maintaining internal core body temperature is crucial to a marathon runner's performance and health. An inability to reduce rising core body temperature can lead to hyperthermia. To reduce body heat, the body must remove metabolically produced heat by sweating (also known as evaporative cooling). Heat dissipation by sweat evaporation can lead to significant bodily water loss. A marathon runner can lose water adding up to about 8% of body weight. Fluid replacement is limited, but can help keep internal temperatures cooler. Fluid replacement is physiologically challenging during exercise of this intensity due to the inefficient emptying of the stomach. Partial fluid replacement can serve to avoid a marathon runner's body over heating but not enough to keep pace with the loss of fluid via sweat evaporation. = Environmental factors = Environmental factors such as air resistance, rain, terrain, and heat contribute to a marathon runner's ability to perform at their full physiological ability. Air resistance or wind, and the marathon course terrain (hilly or flat) are factors. Rain can affect performance by adding weight to the runner's attire. Temperature, in particular heat, is the strongest environmental impediment to marathon performance. An increase in air temperature affects all the runners the same. This negative correlation of increased temperature and decreased race time is affiliated with marathon runners' hospitalizations and exercise induced hypothermia. There are other environmental factors less directly associated with marathon performance such as the pollutants in the air and even prize money associated with a specific marathon itself.

As part of her advocacy against the bill, she also co-organised the first ever sex worker protest in Northern Ireland, in October 2014. =Legal challenge= Following the passing of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015, Lee initiated a judicial review at Belfast's High Court in respect of the provisions criminalising the purchase of sex. She argued that making it a criminal offence to pay for sex would drive the sex trade further underground and endanger sex workers. Lee's challenge was based on human rights legislation and she stated her intention to bring the case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights. On 28 September 2016, Lee won the right to have a judicial review. At the time of Lee's death, the judicial review was reportedly a few weeks away. On 8 March 2018, owing to her death, the legal challenge was formally withdrawn. In a statement following Lee's death, her solicitor, Ciaran Moynagh, described her as \\"one of this country's most fearless human rights advocates\\". Journalist Lyra McKee paid Lee tribute, and noted her views on the sex industry had changed because of Lee's campaigning.

It is owned by 19 union and management pension funds and its commercial assets are valued at over $5 billion. It is the largest developer of rental housing in Western Canada, with properties in the Greater Toronto Area, Metropolitan Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, including 7,600 homes, 500,000 square feet of commercial space, 18 police facilities in Ontario, and three Tapestry retirement communities. It has also built 22 schools in Alberta and 18 in Saskatchewan. The current CEO and president of Concert Properties is Brian McCauley.  History  The Vancouver Land Corporation was co-founded in 1989 by Jack W. Poole and David R. Podmore to develop economically priced rental housing in British Columbia. The company's name was later changed to Greystone Properties, then to its current name, Concert Properties. The company was created jointly by the Provincial government, the City of Vancouver, and 26 union pension funds. Some media reports in 2005 indicated that Jack Poole planned for Concert to bid on some of the Olympic Games infrastructure projects, but Poole abandoned these plans due to negative media coverage. He later died of cancer at the age of 76. David Podmore stepped down as CEO in 2017 and was replaced by Brian McCauley. Podmore still works at Concert. In June 2017, Concert paid RioCan, another real estate company, $26.3 million for a 50% interest in Toronto's oldest strip plaza, the Sunnybrook Plaza. The two companies will collaborate on its redevelopment. In 2018, Concert announced they would be redeveloping Coquitlam Park into 8 buildings comprising up to 2,600 housing units. The City of Coquitlam will cover half the costs, and the buildings are expected to be completed by 2021. Many Coquitlam residents have expressed concern over the project and want the park to remain unchanged.

Mike Bender, the founder of the company, and his writing partner, Doug Chernack, launched the site early that year, which asked people to submit any awkward photos that they had in their family photo albums. From then on, the site gained much momentum and various products were developed, such as books and games, and an exhibition at ESMoA. Origin The idea for Awkward Family Photos was started in 2009 when Mike Bender saw one of his own family photos framed and hung in his parents‚Äô house. He mentioned this photo to Doug Chernack, his childhood friend and writing partner, who also acknowledged that he had family photos that were similar. Therefore, they decided to develop a simple webpage for people to share these photos, which rapidly spread across the Internet due to it being shared on the website of a radio station. They received submissions instantly and journalists took note of them from both the New York Times and Time Magazine. Awkward Family Photos swiftly became a franchise. Books and games Bender and Chernack published their first book in 2010, titled Awkward Family Photos. After this first publication, they continued with several other books, including Awkward Family Pet Photos in 2011, Awkward Family Holiday Photos in 2013, Born to Be Awkward: Celebrating Those Imperfect Moments of Babyhood in 2015, and Everything is Awkward in 2016. Soon after publishing their first book, they began developing board games, such as Awkward Family Photos and The Awkward Family Photos Movie Line Caption Game. Among their standard books and board games, they also have two different postcard books, a coloring book for adults, and a day to day calendar for 2019.

He trained in a number of gyms as a teenager and went on to become a professional bouncer and a doorman. As a sportsman he first made his name as an arm wrestler, winning the British light-heavyweight title and going on to win the British heavyweight title. He then entered the world of strength athletics. In Britain's Strongest Man he came fourth in the 1980 and 1983 versions of the event, before winning the title in 1984. This enabled Crossley to qualify for the 1984 Europe's Strongest Man in which he represented the United Kingdom alongside Geoff Capes, the then current World's Strongest Man. As a doorman he gained significant renown. He was featured in a 1989 episode of the BBC Bristol series 10x10, entitled Hardman.IMDB 10x10 Hardman 1989 He was later featured as one of the three British bouncers including, Lenny McLean and John 'The Neck' Houchin, in Steven Cantor's film Bounce: Beyond the Velvet Rope,Bounce: Beyond the Velvet Rope on IMDB in which his portrayal has been described as \\"a soft spoken professed Christian, who can quote Shakespeare whenever the mood takes him, but who prefers handling obnoxious customers in their most pliable state - knocked unconscious\\". New York Times Film Review, September 7, 2001 Crossley also features in a book about Lenny McLean's life, entitled: (The Guv'nor - Revealed) By writing duo Lee Wortley and Anthony Thomas. This book of untold stories also features his lifelong friend John 'The Neck' Houchin. Over the years, in and amongst the cobble-fighting hierarchy, it has been stated that Crossley and his unnatural power and speed were unmatched, and many who have worked alongside him have said that in his heyday, not a soul would have had the brawn to go toe-to-toe with him. What is more, it has been documented in various crime magazines that a life story is currently being written, and that ‚Äòwriter and best selling author‚Äò Lee Wortley is the man behind it.

Radiolarians are amoeboid protists found as zooplankton in oceans around the world and are typically identified by their ornate skeletons.  History  Polycistine radiolarians were first popularized by Ernst Haeckel, a German biologist who drew Radiolaria in detail and described 2775 new polycystine species. However the first taxonomic descriptions of Radiolarians were done by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg from 1838 to 1876. Ehrenberg was the first to describe Stylodictya with what is now the lectotype species Stylodictya gracilis. Early classifications of radiolarians were somewhat arbitrary and have been improved upon since the mid-nineteenth century drawings by Ehrenberg and Haeckel. Improvements in microscopy technology have allowed more specific morphological descriptions of pre-described radiolarian genera. In addition, new species of Stylodictya and other radiolarians are constantly being discovered from both live samples and fossil evidence.  Ecology  Two species of Stylodictya, Stylodictya multispina and Stylodictya validispina, are quite prevalent in ecological literature regarding Radiolarian diversity. These two species are found quite commonly in the western Pacific, particularly extending from equatorial regions east of Java to south of New Zealand. Stylodictya multispina is also known to be found in the central equatorial Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico, however the full distribution of the genus is not wholly understood. Based on data from the western Pacific correlating Stylodictya distribution with upwelling zones, the appearance of the genus is likely highly dependent on upwelling. Upwelling is known to have a drastic effect on phytoplankton blooms and evidence suggests that Stylodictya is one of the genera of zooplankton that is heavily controlled by upwelling-related phytoplankton blooms. The cause of Stylodictya‚Äôs dependence on upwelling is a result of the vertical distribution of the genus. Stylodictya is a surface-dwelling plankton, reaching at absolute limit as far down as 750 meters, but being heavily concentrated in the upper 200 meters of the photic zone. Being restricted to the upper edge of the vertical column means that Stylodictya‚Äôs prey is relatively wealthy in energy from sunlight but is ecologically restricted from population growth by a scarcity of nutrients (e.g. nitrates and phosphates). Therefore in upwelling zones where nutrients rise to the surface of the ocean, Stylodictya is able to proliferate extensively. Stylodictya, like other radiolarians, is a particle feeder and a predator of other planktonic organisms such as diatoms. The geologic age of the oldest Stylodictya-type fossils are evidence of the lasting ecological significance of Stylodictya and Radiolarians as a whole on the oceanic ecosystem. Stylodictya is food for a variety of organisms, from other zooplankton to filter feeders.  Morphology  Morphological terms regarding radiolarians have evolved to be more precise since the 19th-century descriptions. Terminology is inconsistent over time, as multiple terms are often used to describe a singular structure. Therefore, each morphological term used here will be accompanied by a description of the structure. The species Stylodictya gracilis has been described by Ogane and Suzuki and Ogane et al as a coin-shaped discoidal spumellarian (circular radiolarian, as opposed to the cone-shaped nasselarians). At the center of the disc is a microsphere (sphere of silica that houses the nucleus and endoplasm). Surrounding the microsphere is the biretta, which is a porous rectangular box- shaped shell. Four radial beams connect the microsphere to the biretta. Surrounding the biretta are three hoops, circular rings of silica that are concave toward the center (microsphere) of the skeleton. The three hoops are connected at the top and bottom in equatorial view (viewing the side of the coin-shaped disc instead of the face) by the roof, which is also porous. There are two concentric rings of pores in the roof of each of the three hoops. Ten secondary radial beams connect the biretta through the hoops all the way to the flange (outer edge of the side of the coin shape). Four of those secondary radial beams reach past the flange outside of the rest of the skeleton and act as radial spines. Other species of Stylodictya have a similar overall coin- shaped morphology, but with slightly different characteristics. A common way to tell species of Stylodictya apart is by the number of radial spines that species possesses (e.g. Stylodictya multispina has 16 radial spines). Being solitary spumellarians, Stylodictya must feed using its many radiating axopodia. When a Stylodictya comes into contact with a bacterium or small algae with one of its axopodia, it contracts that axopodia into its body in order to feed on the prey. Along with other radiolarians, Stylodictya have bubble-like alveoli outside of the central capsule of the organism. These alveoli are filled with gas and act as buoyancy regulators for the organism, which is weighed down quite heavily by its silicate skeleton.  Fossils  Although the geologic history of Stylodictya is sparse, fossils of Stylodictya have been found in Switzerland that date back to the Jurassic. Stylodictya- type fossils are much more common in the Cenozoic and are found in cherty limestones in New Zealand and in oceanic drill holes around the world‚Äôs oceans. Even this sparse paleontological evidence suggests that the Stylodictya morphology of spumellarians has been prevalent in oceanic ecosystems for many millions of years. The distribution of Stylodictya in the rock record also gives insight into the paleoclimate at the time of fossilization. This is because the most important rock type lithified from fossil skeletons, limestone, is primarily calcium carbonate, which is not able to lithify under acidic conditions. Stylodictya, like other radiolarians, forms a silicate skeleton, not a carbonate one. Thus whenever Stylodictya- bearing chert becomes more common than limestone in the stratigraphy, that may be evidence of a shifting oceanic climate. This makes radiolarians important indicators of climate change within the stratigraphical record. It is important to note that micropaleontology is an extensive and under-studied field, so the fossil evidence that has already been collected on this genus likely only represents a portion of the extent of the genus over geological time and space.  Significance to humans  In addition to the paleoecological implications of Stylodictya fossils, Stylodictya can also be used as an index fossil in stratigraphy. Radiolarians are often used as index fossils, as they are usually instantly recognizable, widespread, and individual species are restricted to a specific time frame. This may not be easy with Stylodictya, however, as the genus has existed over a long period of time and different species of Stylodictya are often not very easy to tell apart, especially in the fossil record. This may not be true in the future, as species are still being discovered, and one may yet prove to be a good index fossil.

He served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1740 to 1742. Buchanan Street in Glasgow is named after him. Life Andrew Buchanan was born in 1690. He was the second of four sons to George Buchanan, a maltster in Glasgow, and his wife, Mary Maxwell, daughter of Gabriel Maxwell a Glasgow merchant. His father had been a Covenanter who had fought at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge and was descended from the Buchanans of Buchanan and Leny.Dictionary of National Biography: Andrew Buchanan In his youth, he shared lodgings with Robert Carrick, then a Divinity student, and later Rev Robert Carrick. The Reverend's son, also Robert Carrick became a rich banker, and clearly an admirer of the Buchanans later left his entire fortune to them.http://www.glasgowhistory.co.uk/Books/MansionHouses/MansionChapters/Mount%20Vernon.htm He was one of the first Scots to have tobacco plantations in \\"the New World\\", with major holdings in Virginia.View of the City of Glasgow, John McUre 1830 In 1719, he purchased a property at the Long Croft in Glasgow. He purchased two further properties nearby in 1732 and 1740.Glasgow Past and Present, James Pagan 1851 Having assembled sufficient adjoining properties he then created a new street: Virginia Street, lined with new villas. His own house on the street, Virginia Mansion, was not completed in his lifetime. Virginia Street still exists in the Merchant City but none of the original houses survive. In 1725, he founded the Buchanan Society a well-intentioned, but strangely selective charity which gave financial help to apprentices and widows, but only those with the surname of Buchanan. The Society still exists and still serves this function. In 1735, with his new-found wealth, he purchased the estate of Drumpellier building Drumpellier House there from 1736 to 1739 and extending it twice thereafter. In 1737 he bought an additional estate at Auchentorlie.Old Country Houses of the Old Glasgow Gentry 1878 He had served in Glasgow Town Council since 1728 as Dean of Guild and, in 1740, he was elected Lord Provost of Glasgow. In 1745, after the Battle of Prestonpans, Buchanan was one of the commissioners who met John Hay, quarter-master to Bonnie Prince Charlie's army. However, he became deeply unpopular with the prince in reducing the required levy from 15,000 shillings to 5,500 shillings.Memorabilia of Glasgow, John Hill 1835 This resulted in a personal levy of 500 shilling bounty being levied by the Prince against Buchanan.Scots Magazine viii 30 In 1750, he was one of the joint founders of the Ship Bank on the corner of Saltmarket and Bridgegate, Glasgow's first local bank. He died in Glasgow on 20 December 1759 and is buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery in the centre of the city. Andrew's descendant, Lt Col Carrick Buchanan, gifted Drumpellier House and its grounds to the town of Coatbridge in 1919 and it is now Drumpellier Country Park. Legacy Buchanan Street in Glasgow, named after Andrew Buchanan Although built after his death (1777) Buchanan Street in Glasgow was built on lands owned by him, and is named in his honour. Family He was married to Marion Montgomery and had two sons and four daughters. His eldest son James Buchanan of Drumpellier (1726-1786) was twice Lord Provost of Glasgow. His second son was George Buchanan of Mount Vernon (1728-1762).

The house takes its name from Elizabeth Murphy, wife of loan broker Lawrence Murphy, who purchased a lot as an investment on which to build the house speculatively, block one, lot six (6), Hillcrest Village, East Milwaukee (renamed Shorewood in 1917) and who contracted with Herman F. Krause, Jr., a carpenter, to build the house in 1917 according to plans supplied by Frank Lloyd Wright via Wright's marketing agent for ASBH projects, the Arthur L. Richards Company.Lilek, Michael P, \\"2106 Newton Avenue, 2106 Newton Avenue Shorewood, Wisconsin, An American System-Built House Model A203, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,\\" 2016 A lawsuit and liens filed in 1919 reveal that construction took longer and cost more than expected.Milwaukee County Historical Society, Milwaukee County Records, Circuit Court Case #56129, Record Book 133, Page 5, 1919 The Elizabeth Murphy House - by Frank Lloyd Wright For example, Krause sued the Murphys for unpaid invoices and the Murphys countered by claiming incomplete work. The architect is named as final decision-maker for changes suggested by the contractor to hold down costs, but absence of correspondence suggests that he was not consulted. Despite the trouble, the home's dimensions and layout are exact matches to the architect's drawings, although it was constructed in a mirror image to accommodate lot proportions and the relationship to neighboring houses. The lot and home were sold by Elizabeth Murphy to Alfred and Gladys Kibbie in 1919 for $5,200 dollars. Since the Kibbies purchased the house before the lawsuit was settled, they were also named a defendants. The suite was eventually dropped. The Kibbie family lived in the house until 1941 when it was advertised as a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed bungalow and priced to sell for $5,300. The house changed hands again in 1971 and 1993. For reasons still unclear, the house's architectural lineage was lost along the way. When it was purchased in 1993, the buyers suspected it to be a \\"special\\" design, but did not know who designed it. The house is a one story cottage with two bedrooms and one bath, a breakfast nook, a large open living area with a brick fire place and an open-air (since enclosed) sleeping porch. Elizabeth Murphy House Interior Art Glass Windows The floorpan and most of the interior are undisturbed and in original form. The interior includes birch trim with the original rubbed-shellac finish, dining and kitchen cabinets and leaded art- glass doors, windows and light screens with a simple motif that may represent a flower or a tree. Modifications include shingles over the original exterior pebble-dash stucco, double pane-glass windows where there were once single panes, and the excavation of a garage where there was once a crawl space under the sleeping porch. Plan records for ASBH Model A203 are held in the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives (1082.001).The listing notes the model A203 to be ‚Äúsame as 201 except hip roof,‚Äù highlighting features like \\"the Roof Plan, 4 Elevations and 1 Section.\\" A drawing from a brochure page on file at the Milwaukee County Historical Society shows model A201 as featuring a flat roof, model A202 with a gabled roof, and A203 with a hip roof. In 2015, onsite and recordsresearch completed by Michael P. Lilek, the then Curator of American System-Built Homes with Frank Lloyd Wright Wisconsin, Inc., re- confirmed the house as a Wright design and deemed it the \\"Elizabeth Murphy House,\\" based on the practice that Wright homes be named for the original buyer. The house was featured as a stop on the 2017 Wright and Like Tour, organized by Wright in Wisconsin. It is listed in the Fourth Edition of William A. Storrer's The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, A Complete Catalog.Storrer, William Allin. The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, a complete catalog, 4th Edition.

It has one or two bluish green leaves at its base and up to fifteen greenish, insect-like flowers with red glands on its mushroom-like labellum. This species is known by some authorities as Phoringopsis lavarackiana. Description A. lavarackianus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It one or two bluish green, linear to lance-shaped leaves, usually one larger than the other, each leaf long and wide. Between three and fifteen greenish, insect- like flowers long are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear to spatula-shaped, long, about wide and curves forward towards the column. The lateral sepals are linear to oblong, long and about wide. The petals are linear, long and about wide and curved. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary and are inconspicuous. The labellum is mushroom-shaped, long and about wide and held above the flower. The callus is about long, mop-like, covered with spiky, bristly hair-like glands. The tip is of the callus is strap-like and about long. The column is long with two pairs of wings. Flowering occurs from January to August. Taxonomy and naming The glaucous truffle orchid was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones and given the name Phoringopsis lavarackiana from a specimen collected on Moa Island. The description was published in The Orchadian. In 2006, Bill Lavarack changed the name of this orchid to Arthrochilus lavarackianus. Distribution and habitat The glaucous truffle orchid grows in scrub on Moa Island and in Tropical North Queensland as far south as the Mutjati country of Shelburne Bay. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. lavarackianus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known.

(Scott Hartvigsen Photography, 2018.) Billson's Brewery is a brewery established in 1865 in Beechworth, north-east Victoria, and is one of the oldest continuing beverage manufacturers in Australia. It operates from a complex of heritage buildings centred around a Victorian-era ‚Äòtower brewery‚Äô, constructed in 1872-3. Historically, Billson's Brewery made ale and porter, a range of cordials, aerated mineral waters, soft-drinks and health tonics. Throughout most of the twentieth century, it went under the name of Murray Breweries. Billson's Brewery continues to operate and is open to the public daily. History Staff at Billson's Brewery, c.1907. Owner Alfred 'Bosher' Billson, far right; Percy Haddon, far left. Held to have been established in 1865, Billson's Brewery began commercial operations when 50 year old Englishman George Billson took on the Ovens Brewery and malthouse, Beechworth, which became known as Billson's Ovens Brewery in 1867.The establishment of the brewery is traditionally given as 1865. However the brewery does not appear in the United Shire of Beechworth rate books until 1867. An article in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser 15 Sept 1888, p.5, mentions that it was 21 years since the business started. Yet another article in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 26 oct 1895 p.7, states that the brewery was established 28 years ago. George Billson‚Äôs obituary (Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 13 February 1886, p.6), also gives a clear timeline which indicates that he returned to Beechworth after an absence of a few years in 1867. The Brewery also produced cordials. In January 1872, Billson took on his eldest son George Henry Billson as a business partner, and together, G. Billson and Son expanded operations. Selecting a site at 29 Last Street on land which is rich in spring water of exceptional purity, the Billsons opted to build a ‚Äòtower brewery,‚Äô a design which had only recently been adopted in Britain.Call for tenders to build the new brewery advertised in Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 5 June 1872, p.3. Billson's brewery, along with a cordial factory, cooperage, and stables for the brewery's horse teams, were all built in 1872-73.United Shire of Beechworth rates books, held in the Robert O‚ÄôHara Burke Memorial Museum, period of 1874. After government analysis proved its water quality, an ‚Äòaerated waters manufacture‚Äô was added in 1874.Advertisement, Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 23 July 1874, p.3. A wine and spirit department was added in 1880.Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 5 October 1907, p.4. By 1879, George Henry Billson had left the partnership to pursue his own brewery and malting venture in Albury, New South Wales.Wagga Wagga Express, 26 April 1879, p.3. Meanwhile, George Billson senior retired, appointing his socially and politically-oriented 23-year-old son, Alfred A. Billson, as his successor in 1881.Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 8 December 1881, p.5. After the death of his father in 1886, Alfred Billson changed the name of the business to A. A. Billson's, once again expanding the business. Brewing operations, producing both bottled and draught beers, were headed by Billson's nephew George Collier;The Anglo-Australian Brewery,‚Äô Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 26 October 1895 p.7. while new products were introduced to Billson's line of cordials and aerated waters, managed by Bert Petersen.‚ÄòThe Anglo-Australian Brewery ‚Äî A Flourishing Industry,‚Äô Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 5 October 1907, p.4. A cordial factory and depot were opened at Tallangatta in 1885.Wodonga and Towong Sentinel, 24 October 1885, p.2. In 1888, Billson's began producing its popular Anglo-Australian Ale. A ‚Äòpure malt ale‚Äô styled after a light English ale, it was a traditional beer which did not use any sugar in its fermentation. Accordingly, it required a comparatively long and cool maturation in-bottle, and was brewed in winter.‚ÄòThe Anglo- Australian Brewery, Beechworth,‚Äô Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 2 June 1900, p.12. Facing increasing pressure from the temperance movement in the 1890s, Billson's responded favourably with a low-strength ‚Äòmild family table ale,‚Äô‚ÄòThe Anglo-Australian Brewery,‚Äô op. cit.,1895. as well as a range of non- alcoholic sparkling beverages catering to adults. These included Social Ginger Cup; Claretta (a beverage intended to replace claret and soda); the health tonic Malto-Quinia Wine;‚ÄòPalatable and Wholesome Beverages‚Äô, Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 22 June 1895, p.13. and a distinctive ‚Äòherbal beer‚Äô named Ecks.‚ÄòThe Anglo-Australian Brewery ‚Äî A Flourishing Industry,‚Äô op. cit., 1907. Billson's also took advantage of the high quality of its water to produce aerated mineral waters, including soda water, potass water,This won a medal at the Melbourne Exhibition, as reported in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 9 March 1889. and lithia water laced with lithium salts. In the early twentieth century, Billson's sold its lithia water as a ‚Äòthe most healthful mineral water produced in Australia.‚ÄôAn example of such an advertisement appears in the Wodonga and Towong Sentinel, 12 November 1909, p.2. Lithium was later demonstrated to have clinical efficacy in treating mood disorders in trials run by Dr John Cade, a former superintendent of Beechworth's May Day Hills Asylum. Billson's traded as A. A. Billson's Anglo-Australian Brewery Company from 1892.‚ÄòAnglo-Australian Brewery,‚Äô Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 3 December 1892, p.9. By 1895, its cellars were capable of holding 7000 dozen bottles;‚ÄòThe Anglo-Australian Brewery,‚Äô op. cit., 1897. and at its manufacturing peak in the early 20th century, the brewery could treat 20 hogsheads of liquor (about 5000 litres) per day. In 1902, when Alfred Billson was increasingly busy pursuing a burgeoning political career in the Legislative Assembly, he handed the daily running of the brewery to new management, while still serving as chairman of the board.'The Anglo-Australian Brewing Company,' Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 2 August 1902, p.2. Employer- employee relations remained tight-knit and stable. End of year employee ‚Äòsocials‚Äô were held at Billson's private residence adjacent to the Brewery, and in 1906 after a particularly strained period leading up to Christmas, Billson praised his staff to the effect that ‚ÄòThroughout the whole establishment a fine spirit of harmony prevailed, and he hoped this would always continue.‚Äô'Australian Brewery Employees Social‚Äô, Ovens and Murray Advertiser, 29 December 1906, p.2. In 1911 the company amalgamated with George Henry Billson's Albury Brewing and Malting Company, to become the Border United Co-operative Breweries Ltd.‚ÄòBorder United Co-operative Breweries, An Important Amalgamation‚Äô, The Border Morning Mail and Riverina Times, 7 July 1911, p.2. Towards the end of 1914, this company was liquidated and its operations transferred to the newly registered Murray Breweries Pty. Ltd.Chiltern and Howlong Times and Ovens Register, 27 November 1914. Board directors included preeminent Beechworth businessman Albert Michael Zwar of the Beechworth Tannery. At the same time, Zwar also created the Melbourne- based soft-drinking company, Ecks Pty. Ltd. Murray Breweries immediately began downsizing, closing the Tallangatta factory at the end of 1914,Upper Murray and Mitta Mitta Herald, 24 December 1914, p.2. and selling the Albury brewery (which no longer brewed due to poor water quality) in 1920.Albury Banner and Wodonga Express, 17 December 1920, p.28. The first half the twentieth century saw a decline in the production of alcoholic beverages. The Beer Excise tax (1901), and the increasing local popularity of ‚Äòbitter‚Äô beers from Melbourne breweries,Competition from bitter-tasting Melbourne beers is clearly a point of the concern for the company, expressed in the minutes of its Directors‚Äô Meeting, 13 March 1919. (Minutes still held by Billson‚Äôs Brewery.) may have contributed to Murray Breweries‚Äô curtailing of its beer production. However, the company continued to produce its Extra Matured Stout into the mid-20th century. It continued to produce its non-alcoholic herbal beer Ecks until the 1980s. Throughout the middle years of the century the Brewery also supplied the town of Beechworth with ice. In the closing decades it produced and home- delivered soft drinks, which were eventually replaced by bulk spring water sales and delivery under the name ‚ÄòSnowline mountain spring water.‚Äô The Brewery has never ceased producing its range of traditional cordials. Historic buildings and equipment Billson's Brewery features a range of historic buildings centred on an original four-storey tower brewery built in 1872-3. The brewery was organised on the ‚Äògravitational principle‚Äô, so that the raw materials started at the top of the building and moved downwards in each successive stage of the brewing process. Billson's tower is thought to be the oldest surviving tower brewery building in Australia. Billson's original manufacturing floors and cellars are now open to the public. Billson's also retains several pieces of original equipment. A fifteen-head Albro All British filler (bottling machine) built in 1922 is still used in daily operations. The tubular Cornish steam boiler (manufactured by Miller and Co Machinery of Melbourne and Bendigo), which once powered a horizontal steam engine; remains at the side of the brewing tower. Long-time employee Fred Wyatt maintained and ran this boiler until the early 1990s.Personal communication, Fred Wyatt, Beechworth, Victoria, 2018. Mild steel ship tanks manufactured by Lancaster and Co (of Bow) that once held water for the brewing process have stayed in the roof-space of the tower. Smaller items include original copper brewing vats, and the steam whistle once used to sound the beginning and end of shifts. Brewery revival In late 2017, the Brewery was taken over by new owners, who have commenced restoring its historic buildings. The original name of Billson's has been restored, and there are moves to expand brewing and beverage manufacturing operations to the fullness of their original scope, as well as expand tourist facilities.

Being the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico, Monterrey serves as a commercial center of the north of the country. Its huge commercial centers and industries are consequences of its big industrialization after the end of the Second French Intervention War (1861‚Äì1867). Before this event happened, Monterrey served as a distribution center of imported goods to the north of the country. The industrial and economic development of the state came in several phases, starting at the end of the Second French Intervention, followed by the development of the industry in the state, and the boom of industrialization before the Mexican Revolution. These three phases dictated the industrial path of Monterrey, each one of them having its own consequences in this process. During the year 1867, several important changes initiated in the city of Monterrey starting its industrialization: the falling of the commerce in the city, the development of communications, the development of agriculture, development of new industries, and other several changes. Monterrey changed from a distribution center of imported goods to an industrial state in a period of two decades.  Beginning of Monterrey's economy  Monterrey's economy started to develop when, in 1820, the Refugio port, in Matamoros, was opened. Following this port, the port of Tampico, in 1823, was opened for the city. Both of these ports were important for the economy of the city, thanks to its geographical situation. Monterrey was the only natural path to the center of the country between the mountain range system Sierra Madre Occidental. Due to this, Monterrey was the center of distribution for the states in the north of Mexico: Coahuila, Zacatecas, Durango, Chihuahua, etc. American Civil War (12 of April 1861 ‚Äì 13 of May 1865) = American Civil War = Another important event for the development of the economy in Monterrey was the American Civil War. During the civil war, the ports of United States were blocked, causing the use of the ports of the north part of Mexico for the distribution of cotton to Europe. These ports were controlled by the Monterrey's customs, allowing an important capital flow into the city. Even though this brought positive consequences in Monterrey's economy, after the end of the American Civil War, the traffic from the United States stopped, affecting the city's commerce. = Falling of the commerce = The early development of the city economy was caused by several abnormal events. For example, constant revolutions in the country, establishment of the free zone in the neighbor state Tamaulipas, and the American Civil War. These abnormal events created a constant development on Monterrey's economy. After these events stopped, an inevitable decrease in the city's economy started. Some researches stated that the city could not get again in the same position that was during the city economy development, because it was caused by the abnormal events mentioned before. Despite of this, there exist other two main reasons why the commerce in Monterrey started to decrease: the creation of the ‚ÄúConstraresguardos‚Äù and the development of railways in the country. One of the reasons was the creation of the mobile force ‚ÄúContraresguardo‚Äù. This was a mobile force that was in charge of traveling along far paths and roads to stop clandestine imports. Smuggling was an important economic activity in many towns of Monterrey bringing capital flow into commerce. The creation of this anti-smuggling force caused the decrease of the activity, affecting the economy of many families and commerce in Monterrey. The anti-smuggling forces raised important amounts of money from the smugglings that were stopped: during the years 1869‚Äì1870 several contrabands were stopped with a value of $213,415 pesos, in the next year this value increased by $844,542, and during the years 1874‚Äì75 a total of 148 contraband were stopped by these forces. Another important factor for the decrease in commerce in Monterrey was the development of railways in the country. Before this development, Monterrey served as a distribution center for the north states of the country, thanks to its geographical position. The development of railways allowed the north states of the country to get products from other routes, without the intervention of Monterrey. Also, the railways created contrabands in small scale, as people were allowed to go to the frontier easily and in a cheap way, smuggling products. The small-scale contraband affected all kind of commerce in Monterrey, didn't letting them develop. = Communications development = An important factor in Monterrey's industrialization was the development of communications throughout the state. The development of railways, telegraphs, telephones and trams started a new chapter in Monterrey's transportation and communication era, leaving behind the mule drivers, drivers, and diligence drivers. Before this new era, the opening of routes was an important topic for the government. Monterrey had several routes that connected it with other neighbor states like Matamoros, Laredo, Tampico, Piedras Negras, Saltillo, etc. These routes where controlled and managed by the municipalities, who didn't take care of them, leaving them in bad shape. Even though, the traffic between this dirt routes were high. The most common mean of transport to transport products, before the development of railways, was by convoys: groups of wagons pulled by mules. Also, the most common way of transporting people between states before the railway, was by the use of errands.  Railways  The first railway track was inaugurated in 1881, it connected the cities of Monterrey and Matamoros. Other railways were also created to connect Monterrey to other cities in this new mean of transport: Laredo, Saltillo, Lampazos, Salinas Victoria, Cadereyta, Torreon, San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico, and also with the United States. These new routes of railway boost the movement of large group of people around the state and country in a cheap and effective way. These new railways also helped to present the city of Monterrey in a national and international context. People from outside the city came, especially from the United States, for vacations or business trips.  Telegraph  The telegraph was the one of the first communication development in the city, before the railways. The first line of telegraph was built 12 years before the first railway track in the city. The telegraph created a communication line between Monterrey and the center of Mexico. Also, the cities of Matamoros, Saltillo, San Luis Potos√≠, Ciudad Victoria, Nuevo Laredo, etc. These new lines of telegraph communications followed almost the same lines as the routes of railways.  Trams  One of the first means of urban transportation was the tram. The first tram was built in 1882 by the government of the state. Later, permissions to build more tram routes around the city were delivered to private companies. By the year of 1891, most of the tram lines were managed by four private companies who had a total of 40 kilometers of tram lines, 58 wagons and 17 loading platforms. All of these track lines connected the urban and rural zones of Monterrey.  Telephone  In 1882, the telephone was installed in the city of Monterrey. The purpose of the first line of telephones was for the use of the government, connecting the house of General Trevi√±o with the headquarters in the city. The use of telephones for public purposes was established in 1883. By the next year, it already had 91 subscriptions, 256 telephone devices, and 300 kilometers of telephone line. = Agriculture = Sugar Cane Before the industrialization of Monterrey, agriculture and cattle raising were the most important economic activities of the city. Monterrey was an exporting city, exporting to the rest of the country corn and sugar cane. Even though corn was the most agricultural product produced in the city, sugar can was the most profitable. Piloncillo was a very profitable product and it was extracted from the sugar cane. Monterrey was one of the most important cities that exported this product to the country. Also, cattle raising was an important activity for the city, but throughout the years, it was being substituted by the agriculture. This decrease in cattle production was also caused by other factor besides the growing agricultural activity in the city. It was caused also by the cattle theft, attacks of barbarian Indians to the farms, revolutions through the state and droughts. In the year of 1890, the rural activities of the city were in development, having an increase in agricultural and cattle raising production. = Development of new industries in Monterrey = Before the fall of commerce in Monterrey, huge amount of capital flowed into the city. This gave a lot of economic resources to families and businessmen of the region. After the fall of commerce in the city, this families and businessmen started to look for new industries in which they could invest their resources. The industries that were developed by these investments were in the areas of mining, railways and customs, textiles, and livestock companies. After these investments, the industrialization of Monterrey was initiated. The textile industry was one of the first industries developed in Monterrey. The first textile companies were called ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù, which was founded in 1854 by an investment group, and ‚ÄúEl Porvenir‚Äù, founded in 1871. After this two companies were founded, more little textile industries were created in the region, causing that the textile industry was an important activity for the city of Monterrey after several years. Other new industries that were founded in Monterrey during the same period were little workshops and handcrafts. The main objective of the workshops was to create tools for agricultural purposes, creating wheat mills, floats, and other agricultural tools. Other new industries developed were hat, ice, floats, and cars, sugar and mezcal, beer, pasta, starch, candles production. These small industries became the beginning of the industrialization of Monterrey. All these new industries that were developed started to change the way of thinking of the government, businesses and people in Monterrey. The idea that the industrialization of the city was the solution for the future of the state was starting to appear. The government and business started to foment the industrialization in all the aspects of the economy. An important tool to expand this idea through the state and to present Monterrey's product to the country and internationally was by the use of expositions. In these expositions, products were presented in four different categories: industry, labor, mechanical arts and arts. All these expositions helped the community to get to know all the products that were produced in Monterrey and the innovations on them. The products of Monterrey reached exposition in the United States like the exposition of New Orleans in 1885, Paris in 1889, and San Antonio in 1889. These expositions were an important platform for the world to get to know Monterrey as an industrial center.  Industrialization of Monterrey  In 1889, the first important industries for the industrialization were founded: Fabrica de Cerveza y Hielo de Monterrey and Fundicion de Fierro y Elaboracion de Maquinaria Monterrey. The first industry was in beer production and the second was in the melting industry. The foundation of these two industries in Monterrey, caused a wave of concessions for the foundation of new industries in the city. Many industries were founded in the next several years, covering diverse areas of industries: furniture, metal, clothe, cigarettes, soap, among others. In a period of 3 years, 14 new industries were founded in Monterrey. = Causes of industrialization = Monterrey, 1910 This boom in the industrialization of Monterrey was caused by internal and external factors of the city. The internal factors are the ones that involved the citizens and business of Monterrey. On the other hand, the external factors are the ones that involve everything that influenced Monterrey from the outside of its borders. These factors had an important role in the development of the industry in Monterrey.  External factors  One of the external factors was the high tariffs of the United State government high sales rates on metals. These high rates caused metal industries to be founded in Monterrey, avoiding these high costs. Monterrey had an advantage over other cities that also were affected by these high rates in United States, it was connected with several important mining centers of the country, reducing the cost of transporting the coal needed for the mining industry. Another important external factor in Monterrey's industrialization was the international investment in the city. Most of the businessmen or companies that invested in new industries in the city were from outside of Mexico. The brought important amounts of capital into the city, leading them into a favorable position to its citizens and government for future development.  Internal factors  Monterrey, 1904 One important factor was the government position towards the foundation of new industries in the city. The government in Monterrey reduced taxes and lent land to business or persons who wanted to create new industries in the city, creating a friendly environment for entrepreneurs. This environment could not be performed without the important amounts of capital that were created during the early stages of commerce in the city. The huge amount of economic resources that some citizens and businesses in Monterrey had available for investments were a key factor on the industrialization. Also, another important factor in this phase, was the huge amount of skilled craftsmen. These craftsmen were important to the industries, who contract them because they knew how to use machines and work in the production of products. One important factor was Monterrey's geographical position towards United States. Monterrey is the nearest important city of Mexico to the frontier and industrial area of the United States. This closeness also let Monterrey's citizens to go to the United States to study or work in the neighbor country, bringing new ideas and process to the industrial sector of Monterrey.  Industrial expansion  Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc, 1890 Monterrey's industrialization continued another 20 years and stopped during the Mexican Revolution. During these 20 years, the industries in the city continued to develop and to grow. The most important and more developed industries during this interval of time were: * Metal Plants (Nuevo Le√≥n Smelting and Manufacturing Company Limited, Compa√±ia Minera, Fundidora y Afinadora Monterrey, La Gran Fundacion Nacional Mexicana) * Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc * Fundidora de Fierro y Acero * Glass Industry (F√°brica de Vidrios y Cristales, S.A.) * Cementos Hidalgo * Industry for construction materials. * Textile industry Fundidora de Fierro y Acero, 1920 This industrialization raised again the commerce in the city, creating new commerce and investments in Monterrey, causing an increment in the capital flow to the city and its businesses. The population in Monterrey also increased thanks to its industrialization and commerce attraction, catching the attention of businessmen and families from other states. This industrialization brought more development in Monterrey urbanization, lifestyle and education, beneficiating its citizens, industries and commerce.

She died of cancer on 13 December 1906 in Sacramento and is buried in Colma, California.  Confederate Spy  An account of her activities during the American Civil War was published in 1898. She recounted being present at the Siege of Vicksburg, traveling with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to far-off Lynchburg, Virginia, meeting General John C.

Her spying activities were discovered and she was arrested in Knoxville, Tennessee by the Union Army. She was held by General William Rosecrans at Chattanooga, Tennessee for six weeks. Upon her release she carried out a spy mission to burn a bridge on the Nashville to Chattanooga line. Her return home was fraught with peril. She walked more than a hundred miles from Tennessee to Alabama, then on to Selma, Alabama where the Battle of Selma was fought in spring 1865.

Description  New branches form at or below ground level on a regular basis to compensate for the short-lived main branches, which generally only live up to 12 years. Branches range in size up to diameter. They spread to: decumbent branches that run along the ground and surface with their ends curved upwards, upright branches that are essentially vertical, or rhizomatous roots and shoots from nodes on the stem of the plant. Olearia adenocarpa has opposite egg-shaped leaves, ranging in size from in length and 2 to 4 mm wide. The upper side ranges in tone from light green to a dark browny-green or grey-green with a hairy silvery-white underside Clusters of flowers begin to bloom in January; These are usually pale white in colour with a yellow/green centre. At this point it releases its pollen from small anthers that dehisce. The dry seeds are covered with hairs. This trait is significant in distinguishing it from other species.  Distribution  = Natural global range = Olearia adenocarpa is a threatened native and is one of eight rare species of Olearia in the world. However, throughout Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand, there are a total of 180 known species of Olearia. = New Zealand range = Olearia adenocarpa is endemic to the Canterbury Plains in the South Island of New Zealand, with only two known sub-populations at two different sites: the lower Rakaia River known as the Great Island and part of the Waimakariri River floodplain between Harwood and West Melton. A fully fenced and monitored conservation site within one of these sub-populations has been set up essentially to enhance and preserve Olearia adenocarpa, hoping to avoid rapid extinction. = Habitat preferences = Olearia adenocarpa generally grow in degraded to unimproved dry grassland along the dry stony terraces and channels that border a braided riverbed, in recently deposited, alluvial deposited gravels and sands that are drought-prone but fertile with high levels of readily available phosphorus. Alluvial essentially means the surface materials (gravel and sand) deposited where water has previously flowed or has been flooded. Olearia adenocarpa are generally scattered individuals and are rarely seen in abundance. Life cycle and phenology Olearia adenocarpa has very little known about its general life cycle due to its low-occurring numbers of individual plants. At 6 months old Olearia adenocarpa main stem becomes decumbent. By one year old there are two or three decumbent main branches and few shorter upright branches. At two years old Olearia adenocarpa have more than 12 decumbent branches at 3‚Äì12 cm long, with many other shoots arising. By the age of three years plus, Olearia adenocarpa is considered mature, having at this stage more than 18 slender branches, however these branches are short lived based on the measurement of the annual growth rings of the plant that live no more than 20 years. Many old branches are scattered around the base of the plant in various states of decay. The growth depends upon the extent of animal grazing. Moderately grazed plants produce new shoots regularly. However, severely grazed plants produce very few new shoots. Therefore, as older branches die, they are not replaced. Gradually the plant dies from grazing by hares, rabbits, sheep, or other animals. The phenology of the Olearia adenocarpa is also little known due to the recent discovery of this species and the lack of individuals. From mid-December, flower buds begin to appear on the plant at about a 0.1 cm length, by late December this has increased to 0.2 cm. By mid-January the buds have elongated to a length of 0.4 cm. Flowering occurs around the end of January as the first florets open and the anthers dehisce. These flowers commonly appear in clusters. Anther- part of a stamen that contains pollen. Dehisced- stamen/pod/seed gape or burst open setting the pollen free. The flowering of the Olearia adenocarpa is completed by the end of February as pollen is all dispersed and the dry seeds are covered with fine hairs that characterize them from other species. It is suspected that seed dispersal happens with the flood waters of the river washing them downstream, however the hairs signify that it may be seed dispersal through a carrier such as sheep or rabbit. Diet and foraging Olearia adenocarpa does not have any nitrogen fixing nodules on its roots, therefore lives in soils of low nitrogen. Instead it thrives off phosphorus in the soils. The soils this plant is found in are relatively fertile due to the pH being at a fairly neutral level. However located on dried braided river bed the Olearia adenocarpa the environmental conditions for this plant are extreme, ranging from drought like conditions harsh sun and lack of water to flooding in the river totally covering the plant. It however has adapted to these conditions as can be seen in the low to the ground growth of this plant. Predators, parasites, and diseases The Waimakariri River is the main location where Olearia adenocarpa occurs, however up to 95% of these plants are predated upon. The main predators for this plant are hare, rabbits, and sheep. This predation has greatly affected the growth patterns of the Olearia adenocarpa, with plants that are grazed on having older branches that are far more slender and short than those that have not been grazed on. This plant species is rare, and with such a small population, heavily grazed on plants are unable to reproduce or flourish. Researchers believe that only ungrazed Olearia adenocarpa have the ability to reproduce. Other information With a maximum of 650 individual plants remaining, Olearia adenocarpa had been mis- identified as Olearia odorata or Olearia virgata. However, with the development, new discoveries and advances in systematics, fueled by molecular technology have added species to lists of threatened species Olearia adenocarpa was described and named in 2004. As a result, this suggests natural hybridism may have taken place as it is frequent within the genus Olearia in New Zealand. Future population expansion is unlikely as Olearia adenocarpa essentially relies on natural disturbance in particular erosion or flooding for the colonization of fresh surface through seed dispersal from the surviving population. With the increase and development of infrastructure for protection and maintenance of roading and water networks, such events are being prevented limiting the opportunities for further establishment.

It was a special unit of the Federal Party of active participation during the civil war between federales and unitarios.  History  The Battalion of Volunteers \\"Rebajados\\" of Buenos Aires was an infantry unit created in 1840 during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. It was formed by veterans of the Brazilian War and the Desert Campaigns. This military unit had militia companies of cazadores, granaderos and artilleros, and took an active part during the Argentine Civil Wars. Some 350 members of the Rebajados participated in the Battle of Quebracho Herrado against the Unitarian troops of Juan Lavalle. Several officers belonging to the battalion corps of Rebajados participated in the persecution of political opponents of Juan Manuel de Rosas, and in the compliance with the laws decreed by his government. A veteran officer of this unit, Lieutenant Sinforoso Canaveris (1808-1872), took part in the inspections for the mandatory use of the divisa federal in the territory of Buenos Aires. In 1843, the Batall√≥n of Rebajados of Buenos Aires traveled to the Banda Oriental to support the forces of Manuel Oribe, having an active participation during the Great Siege of Montevideo. Messengers of this battalion were entrusted to deliver the correspondence of Manuel Oribe to the consuls of France and England during the armistice of 1847. In addition to the Rebajados, Rosas sent to Montevideo, the \\"Batall√≥n Libertad\\", under Colonel Mariano Maza, the \\"Batall√≥n Independencia\\", under Colonel Ger√≥nimo Costa, the \\"Escolta de Rosas\\", and the \\"Batall√≥n Libres de Buenos Aires\\", commanded by the Colonel Pedro Ramos. This military unit also took part in the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado, against the Anglo-French alliance, and in the Battle of Caseros, against the Ej√©rcito Grande under General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Its commander was the Edecan Joaqu√≠n Ramiro, a distinguished military man, veteran of the Brazilian War, who was in command of the Battalion until the fall of Rosas. The uniform of this unit was red, similar to other military corps of the Argentine Confederation, and had an armament composed of spears and facon, with some soldiers equipped with single-shot carbines. The officers of this unit were armed with saber and flintlock pistols, and wore red jacket uniform with its respective divisa federal. According to the British Packett, this Battalion wore an arrogant appearance during its entry into the battlefield, and according to the same newspaper the officers uniform was similar to that used by the English army. This battalion had an excellent military band, which had great acceptance from the public of Buenos Aires during the patriotic and government parades held in honor of Juan Manuel de Rosas.

The temple is regarded as the cradle of Pure Land Buddhism. Name The name of the temple is cited from the Vimalakirti Sutra. History =Tang dynasty= In 681, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang dynasty (618-907), master Shandao, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism, died. To commemorate Shandao, his disciple Huaiyun () established the temple, which became the first temple of Pure Land Buddhism. At that time, the emperor gave thousands of Sariras to the temple. When the poet Wang Wei visited the temple, he wrote a poem Visiting Xiangji Temple () to eulogize the beautiful scenery. Xiangji Temple was badly damaged in the An Lushan Rebellion. In 840, when Taoist believer Emperor Wuzong ascended the throne, he presided over the destruction of tens of thousands of temples, and confiscate temple lands and force monks to return to secular life. Xiangji Temple was devastated in the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution. =Song dynasty= In the Song dynasty (960-1279), Pure Land Buddhism continued to prevail in China. In 978, in the 3rd year of Taiping Xingguo period of the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), the temple was renamed \\"Kaili Temple\\" (). But it restored the original name soon. =Ming dynasty= Xiangji Temple was renovated and refurbished in the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). =Qing dynasty= In 1768, in the 32rd year of Qianlong period of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), monks repaired the temple.

In the past the cemetery was known as the \\"Pioneer Cemetery\\" and also as the \\"Litchfield Cemetery\\". It is the final resting place of many Mexican migrants and Native-Americans who worked in the Goodyear Farms and the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park. The majority of the unmarked graves are of those who perished in the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic which spread throughout the entire globe. The Pioneers' Cemetery Association (PCA) defines an \\"historic cemetery\\" as one which has been in existence for more than fifty years. History Paul Weeks Litchfield was an American industrialist, born in Boston, Massachusetts, who in 1900 became the superintendent of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company plant in Akron, Ohio. During World War I, the demand for cotton was in an all- time high in the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture suggested that cotton could be grown in the area surrounding Phoenix, Arizona. Litchfield went to Phoenix, but was unsuccessful. He did become interested in the Salt River Valley area and convinced the Goodyear to establish the Southwest Cotton Company in Phoenix. Litchfield was named president and he purchased in the general Salt River Valley area which included around the present site of Litchfield Park, then known as Litchfield Ranch.Goodyear Two thousand men and women, mostly Mexican migrants and Native Americans were recruited by the Southwest Cotton Company. They transformed the desert area into agricultural fields which they worked and cultivated thousands of acres of cotton fields. Cemetery In 1917, Litchfield established the cemetery for the employees of the Goodyear Farms and the Wigwam Resort.The cemetery was first called the \\"Pioneer Cemetery\\" and later changed to \\"Litchfield Cemetery\\". In 1918, the labor camps in Arizona were not exempt from Spanish influenza pandemic. Many of the workers of the Litchfield Ranch were affected and died. It is believed that there are approximately 1700 graves in the cemetery. Most of the graves related to those who died from the epidemic are unmarked. Eventually, other workers and their families used this cemetery. Former Avondale City Councilman Amado B. Sernas (1908‚Äì1994) is buried there. Sernas Plaza in Avondale is named after him. The mural was painted by Cuban artist Victor Caldee in honor of those who worked the fields.Victor Caldee Mural The cemetery dedication reads as follows: Cemetery vandalism thumb In 2017, the cemetery was subject to vandalism with racial and derogatory marks made on the tombs. When the community members found out they participated in a candlelight vigil set up by Avondale City Councilman Lorenzo Sierra. One example of the vandalism that has taken place is the attempt to scratch the name of Jose M. Villela from the historic monument dedication.

It has also undertaken collections for charity.Jeremy Morton, 'Club supports Yorkshire Air Ambulance', South Leeds Life (22 March 2018). Decline and recovery Blue Plaque on Holbeck Working Men's Club In the early twenty-first century, the Club faced a downturn associated with the Great Recession, compounded by delays in replacing demolished housing around the Club. The Club's membership base was also affected by the rise of bars in Leeds city centre; destablisation of traditional pub culture by the 2007 smoking ban in England; local demographic shifts to ethnic groups with less of a tradition of drinking in pubs; and a national shift towards drinking supermarket-bought alcohol at home.John Baron, 'holbeck: oldest working men‚Äôs club in country needs you!', The City Talking (28 May 2013). The same forces led to the closure of at least four nearby pubs, as well as Holbeck's library, sports centre, and many other amenities, and by April 2013, as the Holbeck WMC's debts rose, it was feared that it too would fail.John Baron, 'holbeck: oldest working men‚Äôs club in country needs you!', The City Talking (28 May 2013).John Baron, 'Regulars rally to save UK's oldest working men's club', The Guardian (31 May 2013).John Galliver , 'Working Men's Clubs fight for survival', BBC News (5 February 2014). However, local activists, putting in volunteer labour, succeeded in turning the Club around, partly by appealing to new audiences by providing space for community meetings and other events.John Baron, 'Regulars rally to save UK's oldest working men's club', The Guardian (31 May 2013).John Baron, 'Regulars rally to save UK's oldest working men's club', The Guardian (31 May 2013).Jeremy Morton, 'Broadcast Bartender debates a South Leeds culture', South Leeds Life (18 October 2016). By 2018 the volunteer-run club was thriving.Mark Lavery, 'Leeds community rallies to support UK‚Äôs oldest working men‚Äôs club', Yorkshire Evening Post (7 May 2018).

Family and home life Ruth Wilson is the daughter of Ian and Nesta Wilson. Her mother was born in Wellingborough on 1 May 1948 and was given the name Nesta Landeg by her adoptive parents. Ian and Nesta were married in 1976 in Newport. When Wilson was four years old and her sister, Jenny, was a few months old, Nesta died. According to the story told to Wilson by the family, Nesta's death was a result of an accidental fall down stairs, but her death certificate recorded her cause of death as suicide. The death certificate states that Nesta died by hanging on 10 December 1982. Unbeknownst to her family, Wilson became aware of the true nature of her mother's death before she disappeared. Wilson's father, Ian G. Wilson, married Karen I. Bowerman in the last quarter of 1983 in Surrey. Both Wilson's father and step-mother worked as teachers. Ian also served as a local parish councillor. Wilson enjoyed reading, going on bike rides and music. She played the electric guitar and piano. She also had a Saturday job working in a music shop and was a popular local babysitter. She was studying for her A levels at The Ashcombe School Sixth Form when she disappeared. She attended her local church, St Michael‚Äôs. She was a member of the choir, played the organ and enjoyed bell-ringing. Around October 1995, according to Catherine Mair, a friend, Wilson developed the belief that her biological mother's death was not as she had been told. She travelled to London to examine Nesta's death certificate. Ben Anderton, a schoolfriend of Wilson's, says she ran away from home a month before her final disappearance and hid at his house in Betchworth. Mair was due to move to Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and Wilson had asked if she could come with her once she was settled. Wilson went missing a few weeks after Mair moved. Mair's mother recalled that Wilson had slept over not long before she disappeared and had been adamant that she did not want to go back home. Wilson did not explain why. Mair has stated that Wilson had talked about running away but not suicide. Wilson's parents have refuted claims that her home life was unhappy. Events On the Saturday before her disappearance, Wilson worked her usual job in a music shop in Dorking, then went for a meal with her ex-boyfriend, Will Kennedy, and another friend, Neil Phillipson. Kennedy and Phillipson both stated that Wilson paid for the meal and told them it would be ‚Äòsomething to remember her by‚Äô. Wilson went for handbell practice at the local church on Sunday, then went to a youth group in Dorking, then back to Kennedy's for supper. His mother gave her some old clothing. Her family remembered her being relaxed. =Disappearance= Wilson's parents left early for work on the day of her disappearance, leaving Wilson and her sister Jenny to catch the school bus. At the last moment Wilson told Jenny that she wasn't going with her on the bus. Jenny wasn't surprised as Wilson was in the Sixth form and didn't always come in for the whole day, though she was surprised that her sister left it so late to tell her before the arrival of the bus. Shortly after Jenny left for school, Kennedy appeared with his car and offered Ruth a lift. She declined, saying she would meet up later. She did not attend school at all that day. At around 11.30 am, Wilson took a taxi into Dorking. Around midday, she ordered flowers for her stepmother from Thistles Florists at 257 Dorking High Street. Wilson asked that they not be delivered until the following Wednesday. Wilson spent the afternoon in Dorking Library. Around 4 pm she took a taxi from Dorking railway station to Box Hill. She was dropped off on a bridleway a short way from the Hand in Hand pub (now The Box Tree) on Box Hill. The taxi driver stated that Wilson displayed unusual behaviour in that she simply stood still in the rain as he drove off. This was notable as the taxi driver observed that people typically walk away after they have been dropped off. In other reports the taxi driver stated that Ruth appeared to be looking round for someone. The taxi driver was the last person to see her at 4.30 pm. At the time of her disappearance Ruth was wearing a red knitted jumper, black velvet trousers, black pixie boots and a small lady's watch on her left wrist. She had a small blue duffel bag with a personal stereo and tapes. Liam McAuley, a 58-year-old retired police officer investigating the disappearance observed that Wilson was 'dressed to get into another car' implying that a third party may have been involved and running away seemed more likely than suicide. McAuley also stated that disappearing completely would be ‚Äòvery difficult‚Äô. Wilson disappeared 14 days before the 13th anniversary of her mother's death. =Aftermath= That night Surrey Police organised a search for Wilson with a helicopter, police dogs and heat seeking equipment. They searched the Box Hill area but found no solid clues as to her whereabouts. It was subsequently discovered that she frequently went to Box Hill after school. She was also concerned about her performance at school and had kept a school report from her parents that weekend. On 29 November (2 days after the disappearance), the flowers ordered by Wilson were delivered to her step mother Karen. The flowers were described by Ian Wilson as ‚Äòan expensive bouquet‚Äô in subsequent reports. There was no note attached to the flowers. Wilson's friend Mair interpreted this gesture as 'sticking two fingers up' to her step mother. On Friday 1 December (4 days after the disappearance), as reported in The Times newspaper (29 December 1995) police found three notes hidden under a bush in the undergrowth at the top edge of Betchworth Quarry on Box Hill. The notes amounted to farewells to her parents, her best friend and a teenage boy she knew. Nearby were found empty packets of paracetamol tablets and a half empty bottle of Vermouth. The police have never divulged the contents of the notes to the public. On Saturday 2 December (5 days after the disappearance) a large scale search was organised by the police and fire and rescue services which included 60 volunteers comprising local members of the public, school friends, colleagues and wardens from the National Trust. The search utilised a police helicopter, tracker dogs and thermal imaging equipment. A detailed search of the Betchworth Quarry end of Box Hill was undertaken by a trained search and rescue team along with employees of the owners of the quarry Nionisle Ltd. Mark Williams-Thomas, who was the family liaison officer for Wilson's case, stated that extensive searches across Box Hill had yielded no evidence to suggest she was killed or committed suicide. He also stated that he was sure Wilson was not abducted by a stranger. Williams-Thomas also stated that \\"From the experience I have had, I would suggest one of two things occurred. She either went up there to meet someone and has subsequently gone away, or she went there and died in some way.\\" On Friday 8 December 1995 Ian and Karen Wilson appeared on the Granada TV breakfast programme This Morning to appeal for information. They stated that they believed that Ruth was still alive but afraid to come home. Eight months after the disappearance, Catherine Mair was visited at her new home in Sheffield by the police. The officers broke off from questioning her to look in her wardrobe, as if she might have been harbouring Wilson. The Police assigned the code name Operation Scholar to the case. The unsolved missing persons case is reviewed on a regular basis and is being led by DCI Alex Geldart. Surrey Police have stated that the investigation would be re-opened if any new evidence or lines of enquiry came to light.  Possible sightings  On 6 October 1996 Stuart Qualtrough wrote in The People newspaper: It is believed Ruth was spotted on the outskirts of London on Tuesday (1 October 1996) after cable station L!VE TV appealed for help on their Missing Persons' programme. On the first anniversary of the disappearance a person thought to resemble Wilson was captured on CCTV at a Dorking newsagent's shop two miles from Box Hill. The female teenager was distressed and requested a copy of each of the local newspapers and became visibly upset when she was told that one had sold out. The newspaper shop owner reported the encounter to the police and saved the CCTV footage. The local newspapers featured reference to Wilson‚Äôs disappearance. Ruth's parents stated in an article in The Times on 2 January 1997 that they believed the girl in the video was Ruth. Speaking on the tenth anniversary of Wilson's disappearance, Sgt Shane Craven, head of East Surrey police's missing persons team, stated that \\"In the weeks following Ruth‚Äôs disappearance there were some fairly reliable sightings of her in the Dorking area by people who knew her well\\". Sightings have been reported as far afield as Canada. A Surrey Advertiser article by Rebecca Younger (dated 9 December 2008) announced an appeal to mark the 13th anniversary of the disappearance. In this appeal Surrey Police revealed that they were investigating a posting on a MySpace site about a possible sighting in Canada. The missing persons team have stated that they followed up every lead. In 2018, a local newspaper sent out an appeal to anyone who had known Wilson at the time to come forward with any information that could shed light on the disappearance. Roxy Birch, who had known Wilson at school and portrayed her in a police reconstruction video, claimed that Wilson didn't drive and didn't own a passport at the time of her disappearance, which would have made long distance and international travel more difficult. Another friend Kay Blenard stated 'My belief is that she had planned to do something. I don‚Äôt know whether that would be permanent or temporary. I‚Äôd also like to believe that someone knows what happened' The same year, Jon Savell, the chief superintendent of public protection at Surrey police gave a review of the case in which he stated; ‚ÄúThere are five explanations for Ruth Wilson‚Äôs disappearance; A tragic accident, abduction, suicide, murder, or that she had absented herself to start a new life.‚Äù Documentary A documentary film about the case titled Vanished: the Surrey Schoolgirl was produced in 2018. It introduced some new witnesses, mainly friends of the missing girl. Wilson's parents were asked if they wanted to be involved but declined the offer.

Lancaster, on alto sax and flute, would go on to play with outsider luminaries like Sun Ra, Bill Dixon, and Fred Hopkins. Sharrock's violently strummed strings on Black Woman and Monkey-Pockie-Boo led to the vortices of Sonic Youth, Fugazi, and pretty much all future physical guitarists.

The first, of course, is because it contains a wide range of outstanding music. From the jaunty, plaintive flute lines of the title track to the abstract rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and the aggressive guitar trills of the album's dark conclusion, \\"Satan,\\" every note rings with honesty. The second reason is that it's an education in the evolution of studio tools as compositional devices.

She was educated in Saint Petersburg (Russia), La Chapelle-Montligeon (France), and Ingenbohl (Switzerland). After the death of her fiance poet Pranas Vaiƒçaitis in 1901, she moved to United States where she collaborated with priest Antanas Milukas and edited the Catholic-minded magazine ' until her death. Using her personal funds, she published about 35 Lithuanian books. Together with Milukas, she published about a hundred books. She translated religious texts from French and wrote travel books on her journey to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Caucasus (published in 1914), Lithuania (1928), Spain (1932). She died in poverty and obscurity in 1944. Early life and education Pranaitytƒó was the 8th child in a family of well-off Lithuanian farmers in the village near Gri≈°kab≈´dis, Suwa≈Çki Governorate, Congress Poland. After attending a local primary school, her elder brother priest Justinas Pranaitis took her with him to Saint Petersburg to attend the girls' gymnasium attached to the Catholic Church of St. Catherine. She sang at the church choir, directed by Lithuanian ƒåeslovas Sasnauskas. In summer 1896, Pranaitytƒó met Pranas Vaiƒçaitis at the home of her brother-in-law Saliamonas Banaitis. At the time, Vaiƒçaitis was a law student at the Saint Petersburg University and they developed a close friendship that culminated in their engagement. Upon graduation in 1896, Pranaitytƒó attended a school in La Chapelle-Montligeon that, upon graduation, granted the right to teach French in schools. In France, she started contributing to Lithuanian press ‚Äì she wrote articles for Varpas, Tƒóvynƒós sargas, Vienybƒó Lietuvnink≈≥. She also published nine issues of a religious bulletin translated from French. In 1901, during her summer vacation, she cared for her terminally ill fiance Vaiƒçaitis who had returned to his native near Sintautai. Despite her efforts, Vaiƒçaitis died of tuberculosis on 21 September 1901. It was a severe emotional loss for Pranaitytƒó and she remained unmarried. In United States Encouraged by her brother, Pranaitytƒó continued her French studies at Ingenbohl, Switzerland, where she met priest Antanas Milukas, studying canon law at the University of Fribourg. Their friendship and collaboration continued for the rest of their lives. Milukas, active in Lithuanian American press, invited Pranaitytƒó to move to United States. Towards the end of 1902, she arrived to Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, a coal mining town with a large Lithuanian population. There she was employed by Milukas as editor of the Catholic-minded magazine ' (Star). She also edited various books published by ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó Press and personally financed about thirty books, including poetry collection of Pranas Vaiƒçaitis (1903), biography of priest Motiejus Gustaitis, works of bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius. In addition, she translated French religious books into Lithuanian often signing as Pranaiƒçi≈≥ Julƒó. She studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1909. Pranaitytƒó visited Lithuania three times. In 1911, she visited the grave of Vaiƒçaitis and persuaded his brother Jonas to name his newborn son Pranas in Vaiƒçaitis' honor and memory. From there, she traveled to Tashkent where her brother Justinas Pranaitis worked as a missionary. She also visited Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv, Krasnovodsk, Baku, Tbilisi, traveled via the Georgian Military Road to Vladikavkaz. She published a 370-page book on the journey in 1914. She visited Lithuania again in 1923. A surviving photograph shows her and professor Eduards Volters, who supported Vaiƒçaitis during his university studies, standing by the grave of Vaiƒçaitis. She toured Lithuania, including the seaside, and again published her two-volume travel memoirs in 1928. Pranaitytƒó visited Spain and published a travel book in 1932. She returned to Lithuania again in 1932 to an official reception to honor Milukas' 40-year and her 30-year work for the Lithuanian press. The reception featured speeches by Adomas Dambrauskas-Jak≈°tas, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Kazys Bizauskas, Jonas Vilei≈°is, and others. She wrote and published Milukas' biography in 1931. Pranaitytƒó continued to edit ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó and publish books, but it was not a profitable activity and she suffered severe financial hardship. In 1938, the Lithuanian government allotted her a special 250 litas monthly pension. However, it stopped after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. After Milukas' death in 1943, she inherited his archive, but it was lost after her death on 29 January 1944. She was buried in an unmarked grave in one of the cemeteries of Philadelphia.

It is 16 kilometers to the north from the border with Argentina (Landmark IV-0-B), and is a key point on the tourist route Villa O'Higgins - El Chalt√©n.La ruta que est√° de moda en la Patagonia - LaTercera The settlement is connected to the rest of Chile via ferry to Villa O'Higgins where Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) ends. In the place lives only a family of Chilean settlers and a some of Carabineros that are border guards. The town receives its name from the pioneer Jos√© Candelario Mancilla Uribe, who came to settle the lake O'Higgins in 1927. Formerly, this settlement received several expeditions of climbers and scientists who roamed the area or moved towards the great glaciers of the lake. In November 2001, the border crossing \\"Dos Lagunas\\" was opened between Chile and Argentina, which has increased tourism progressively in the area. Currently, around 2,000 tourists pass through the settlement each year.De dos personas nace un pueblo - La Tercera The place is near the Del Desierto Lake, a place where Chile & Argentina had a border dispute until 1994. In 1965 an incident occurred where the Chilean Carabinero, Hern√°n Merino Correa, died after a battle with the Argentine Gendarmerie.  History  Jos√© Candelario Mancilla Uribe (1900-1967) was a Chilean inhabitant of Lake O'Higgins who arrived in the area in 1927 together with his wife, Teresa Mancilla Oyarz√∫n (1906-1992). Both had emigrated from the city of Puerto Montt to Punta Arenas. After their marriage in 1921, they worked in estancias of the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, until finally arriving at Lake O'Higgins/San Mart√≠n in 1927. The couple had six children, all born in Lake O'Higgins and one in Comandante Luis Piedrabuena, Argentina. The place where Candelario Mancilla is located was first populated by British immigrants, and since 1933 by the family of Mancilla, who carried out a hard work of colonization, along with dozens of families scattered by other sectors of Lake O'Higgins. Jos√© Candelario Mancilla, like the inhabitants of the lake, demanded from the first years of the settlement state support for their families, however this was always null, having to get ahead with their own effort. One action that has received national recognition was the construction of the landing track in the sector of Ventisquero Chico, in 1956, which allowed the arrival of flights of sovereignty of the Chilean Air Force, the first support from the state to the pioneer settlement of the lake. In 1961, a detachment of Carabineros de Chile was installed on lands ceded by Mancilla, and years later serious border incidents took place between the Chilean and Argentine police forces due to the sovereignty of the area of Laguna del Desierto, where Mancilla makes an active support to the Chilean units that are worth the recognition of the presidential authority of the time. It was Candelario Mancilla's own family who gave the name to the place, which is recognized for the first time with the construction of the wharf in 1992. Subsequently, travel guides and tourism have given it recognition, as a must for travelers and adventurers from all over the world.  Current status  Today, the only settlers in the place are the descendants of Candelario Mancilla who reside in the cattle ranch and tourist \\"Santa Teresita\\", and the police endowment of the Carabineros de Chile settlement called \\"Hern√°n Merino Correa\\". The Regional Government of Ays√©n preliminarily projected the year 2012 the idea of expanding the settlement of Candelario Mancilla by including it in the Regional Policy of Isolated Areas.Pol√≠tica Regional de Localidades Aisladas.

Located across the street from the Mission San Buenaventura, the red brick structure was built in 1877 and has ornamental relief brickwork and a mansard, Spanish revival tile roof. The building housed a general merchandise store and later, a grocery store operated by the Peirano family for more than 100 years from the 1880s to the 1980s. The building was designated in 1978 as City of Ventura Historic Landmark No. 32. In 1991, archaeological remains of the San Buenaventura Mission Lavanderia were discovered beneath the building and were designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 85. The building is also a contributing property within the Mission San Buenaventura Historic District. The Peirano Market building was acquired in 1987 by the San Buenaventura Redevelopment Agency and was unoccupied for more than 10 years. From August 1998 until January 2016, the building housed Jonathan's at Peirano's and later Peirano's Restaurant and the Red Room. The building has been vacant since January 2016 but is scheduled to re-open in 2018 as Peirano's Market & Delicatessen. Construction and early uses =Construction and operation by Gandolfo= In 1877, J. J. Mahoney constructed the building for Blackburn and Brooks. Mahoney was a prominent Ventura builder during the 1870s; his other works are believed to include the Emmanuel Franz House and the Schiappapietra house.National Register of Historic Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form for the Emmanuel Franz House, 1982. Alex Gandolfo, an Italian immigrant, was the first tenant of the building.Foster and Greenwood p. 3.Accounts in the clippings found in the \\"Peierano Family\\" biography file at The Museum of Ventura differ as to whether Gandolfo was the proprietor of the business at the outset. According to a 1939 paper in the file, Gandolfo began as a clerk for a man named Beronio. Gandolfo operated a general merchandise and grocery store in the building. An announcement in the Ventura Signal noted that Gandolfo moved into the store in December 1877. Gandolfo was part of a wave of Italian immigration to Ventura in the 1870s that also included the Lagomarsino, Faio, Shiappapietra, and Ferro families. =Nick Peirano Sr.= The Nicola Peirano residence built in 1897 In the early 1880s, Nicola \\"Nick Sr.\\" Peirano (1862-1937), a nephew of Alex Gandolfo,Note: Some clippings in the \\"Peirano Family\\" biography file at The Museum of Ventura County state that Nicola Peirano and Alex Ganfolfo were cousins. immigrated from Genoa, Italy.Sources disagree as to the year when Nicola immigrated. Some place it as 1880; others at 1882. The 1900 Census entry for Nicola Peirano states that he immigrated to the United States in 1880. Nick worked in Gandolfo's store, slept in a loft at the site, and took over the business in approximately 1888 when Gandolfo left Ventura. In its early years, the store sold everything from groceries to farm implements, wine, liquor, cigars, hardware, bailing wire, shotgun shells, and black powder. Nick Sr. was married in 1897 to Clara Raffetto, also an Italian immigrant. They had six children, Elvira, Cecilia, Victor, Lester, Elvinia, and Nicholas (Nick Jr.)1900, 1910, and 1920 U.S. Census entries for Nicola Peirano. They raised their family in the Queen Anne style Peirano residence at 107 South Figueroa Street, built for Peirano in 1897 and located one block south of the store. =The Peirano brothers= In 1931, Nick Jr. (1907-1994) and Victor (1903-1965) took over the business. Under their management, the store moved away from general merchandise and hardware sales and specialized in groceries, adding a home delivery service. Over the years, the Peirano brothers further specialized in Italian groceries, including many varieties of pasta, salami, aged cheeses, semolina flower, Petri cigars, olives, hard beans, and imported canned goods. Customers reportedly drove from three counties to purchase Italian groceries at the store. Nick Sr. died in 1937, and Victor continued to live in the Peirano residence on Figueroa Street with his mother. The Peirano family owned the residence until 1978. Nick Jr. married Ruby Bounds and moved to a home in Oak View. In 1965, Victor Peirano died, and Nick Jr. continued to operate the business on his own. =One of the last old-time grocery stores= The Peirano Market suffered as supermarkets opened and the city's population moved east, but Nick Jr. decided to stay put. He recalled: \\"That was what was so unique about our store. We didn't change.\\" The business remained popular for its old-fashioned feel, including wallpaper dating to the turn of the 20th century, original sugar-pine flooring, gunny sacks full of fava beans and other staple foods, and a glass case with various pastas. The store was decorated with old cans and bottles, a vintage mail saddlebag behind the meat counter, an antique grandfather's clock received by Nick Sr. in 1904 as a premium for buying five cases of tobacco, a large kerosene lamp with brass shade hanging from the ceiling, a Model T lantern from the store's first delivery truck, and an old fire nozzle. A 1973 story on the market opened: \\"Nostalgia and Italian delicacies are featured at the corner of Main and Figueroa streets in downtown Ventura.\\" In 1978, the City of Ventura designated the shop and the Peirano residence (one block south of the shop) as Ventura Historic Landmark Nos. 32 and 33. Nick Jr. had not sought the designation and noted: \\"I didn't want it to begin with. Now I can't sell the store without giving them 180 days notice. It's just more red tape.\\" The Ventura County Star-Free Press described Nick Jr. himself as \\"a kind of walking, talking historical landmark in Ventura.\\" In July 1986, Nick Jr. retired and closed the store. Government acquisition and archaeological study =Purchase by Redevelopment Agency and installation of murals= In 1986, the City of Ventura commissioned Linda Lorr (later known as Linda Taylor), an art teacher at Nordhoff High School, to paint large-scale murals in the style of late 19th century advertisements on the building's west-facing exterior wall. Nick Jr. recalled that, in his father's day, the wall was freshly painted every year or so with new advertising, accounting for \\"the layer-cake of colors\\" revealed by Lorr's preparation of the wall for her murals. Lorr's murals of advertisements for Ghirardelli chocolate and Borax remain on the west-facing wall. In 1987, after several months of discussions, the San Buenaventura Redevelopment Agency purchased the building with $83,500 of the agency's funds and a $100,000 grant from the California Office of Historic Preservation. The City and Redevelopment Agency solicited proposals from prospective purchasers or tenants, but its efforts were initially stymied by the cost of earthquake reinforcement work. =Archaeological excavation and assessment= In 1991, the Redevelopment Agency retained archaeologist Roberta Greenwood of Greenwood and Associates to conduct an archaeological excavation and assessment beneath the Peirano's store and the adjacent Wilson Studio building. After digging a trench below the structures, Greenwood and her colleagues discovered remains of the San Buenaventura Mission Lavanderia.Foster and Greenwood, Bricks, Bottles, and Bamboo: Cultural Resources Below the Peirano-Wilson Building. The Lavanderia, since designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 85, was a place where Mission Chumash washed clothes and directed water to the nearby gardens. The Lavanderia consisted of a central tank for holding water, buttresses on the sides of the tank, and a complex of drains, gutters, and aqueducts for carrying water to and from the laundry facility.Foster and Greenwood pp. 14-22. The archaeologists also discovered an abundance of artifacts, including Euroamerican and Mexican ceramics, bottles and glassware, ammunition, and Chinese artifacts, including opium pipes and paraphernalia.Foster and Greenwood pp. 27-43. In her report, Greenwood stated: \\"It would be difficult overstate the quantity and diversity of the materials observed.\\"Foster and Greenwood p. 1. The only Native American artifacts discovered were two fragments of stone bowls.Foster and Greenwood, p. 42. The discovery of the Lavanderia and other artifacts underneath the building raised questions as to the relative historical importance of the Lavanderia and the Peirano Market and further complicated the City's redevelopment efforts. Subsequent development and use =Lengthy vacancy= In 1993, Ventura Realty Co. proposed razing the building, contending that seismic retrofitting would be too expensive. A local artist, Richard Peterson, began a \\"Save Peirano's\\" campaign and advanced an alternative plan to convert the building into a museum, art gallery, gift shop, coffee house, deli, and tourist center. Neither proposal came to fruition, and a debate continued as to whether the City should invest substantial funds to retrofit and renovate the building or permit it to be razed as part of a redevelopment effort. The building remained vacant for more than a decade, and concerns grew as the City's homeless population began sneaking into the building at night. These concerns were exacerbated in August 1996 when a fire broke out in an upstairs storage area. The fire was labeled \\"suspicious\\" by the fire department. =Restaurant uses from 1998 to 2016= In 1997, KL Associates of Oxnard purchased the building and spent $720,000 to refurbish it, including seismic work. The exterior of the buildings was preserved and restored, but the interior was not preserved, with the exception of the original wood flooring. The Lavanderia was not part of the new development and was, instead, reinforced with steel beams and buried in sand for preservation. In August 1998, after sitting idle for more than 10 years, a Mediterranean restaurant, Jonathan's at Peirano's (operated by Jonathan and Sharon Enabnit), opened at the site. In 2011, ownership was transferred to Sanaa Dugan who operated the site as Peirano's Restaurant and the Red Room. Dugan sold the building in October 2015, and the restaurant closed in January 2016. =Planned re-opening= Peirano Market undergoing renovation, April 2018 In 2017 and early 2018, the building's interior was renovated for the planned opening of a new Peirano's Market & Delicatessen to include a coffee and juice bar, delicatessen, fresh pastries, a meat and fish counter, and a salad bar, with patio seating in the adjacent Figueroa Plaza.

He was assigned to NATO Role 3 MMU, and was appointed head of the trauma department. The unit received a commendation from the Romanian Land Forces for saving the life of a Romanian soldier injured by an improvised explosive device in 2014. He served as the research director at Portsmouth Navy Department of Emergency Medicine prior to his assignment to the White House Medical Unit. =Physician to the President= Conley became the physician to the president upon the nomination of the previous physician, Ronny Jackson, for Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He became the acting White House physician on March 28, 2018 and on May 4, 2018 became the physician to the president. On May 18, 2020, President Donald Trump surprised listeners when he revealed he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19. He confirmed that he was taking it under the guidance of Conley, who later issued a confirmation. Several medical warnings had been issued on its use for treating COVID-19 and scant research for its use in its prevention. 'Sean Conley, Physician to the President, Provides an Update on President Trump' ‚Äì video courtesy of the White House. In the early morning of October 2, 2020, the White House announced that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19 after they were tested as a precaution when Trump's top aide, Hope Hicks, tested positive herself. At first, Trump began self-isolating in the White House, but under the recommendation of Conley, he was transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In contradiction to Conley's previous statements surrounding hydroxychloroquine, he released a statement to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany that he had decided to place Trump under an antiviral therapy, specifically remdesivir. Conley described Trump's symptoms on the day of the announcement as \\"fatigued but in good spirits\\". Conley incorrectly identified a Regeneron product of monoclonal antibodies as a polyclonal antibody cocktail in a press release. and Later, he updated Trump's symptoms as \\"nasal congestion and a cough and fatigue.\\" In regard to the first lady, Conley described her as \\"well with only a mild cough and headache.\\" On the morning of October 3, Conley gave a press briefing regarding Trump's health, stating that he and his team of physicians were \\"extremely happy\\" with the president's condition, and noting that most of the president's symptoms had subsided. However, Conley stated that Trump was \\"72 hours into this diagnosis\\" which implied that Trump had attended a rally in Minnesota, knowing he was a potential COVID-19 vector at the time. The 72 hour remark was quickly corrected by a press release indicating that the president was diagnosed the evening of October 1. On the evening of October 3, Conley warned that Trump was \\"not yet out of the woods\\" with regard to his condition. In an October 4 press conference, Trump's medical team said that he was \\"doing really well\\" after his oxygen level dipped the day before and after he was given the steroid dexamethasone, which works by reducing inflammation in the lungs. Asked if CT scans showed pneumonia or lung damage, Conley said, \\"There's some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.\\" He declined to say what was found, citing HIPAA guidelines that ensure patient privacy. When asked why he was reluctant to disclose that Trump had been given oxygen during the October 3 briefing, Conley stated that he did not want to \\"give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction\\" and \\"it came off that we're trying to hide something, which wasn't necessarily true.\\" White House director of strategic communications Alyssa Farah later stated that it was \\"a common medical practice that you want to convey confidence, and you want to raise the spirits of the person you're treating,\\" while also asserting that Meadows' anonymous statement to reporters was intended to \\"give you guys more information just to try to be as transparent as we can\\". At 2:37 p.m. EDT on October 5, Trump tweeted that he would be discharged from the hospital at 6:30 p.m. that day. However, doctors said in an afternoon news briefing that Trump continued to be treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir. The prospect of Trump's early release astonished infectious-disease experts, who noted that Trump planned to be discharged in a period when COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable (7‚Äì10 days after symptoms first appear) to unpredictable and rapid declines in condition. Outside physicians stated that the depiction of Trump's illness as relatively mild was inconsistent with the aggressive treatment he was receiving. Trump's medical team made cryptic remarks about his status and declined to say whether Trump's CT scans contained indications of pneumonia or lung damage. In the White House, Trump continued to receive dexamethasone and remdesivir. He conducted business without wearing a mask. Conley said in a memo that Trump has \\"no symptoms\\" and is doing \\"extremely well.\\" References External links * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American military doctors Category:American osteopathic physicians Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Military personnel from Pennsylvania Category:People from Doylestown, Pennsylvania Category:Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine alumni Category:Physicians from Pennsylvania Category:Physicians to the President Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Navy officers Category:University of Notre Dame alumni ","title":"Sean Conley"},{"id":"57278706","text":"Myron Lynn Lapka (born May 10, 1956 in Van Nuys, California) is a former American football defensive tackle in the National Football League.

Firefighters arrived at the Freeman home shortly after 5:30 a.m. on December 30, when a passerby reported a fire at the residence. After the fire had been extinguished, the bodies of Freeman's parents, Danny and Kathy, were recovered. Both had been shot to death at close range. However, law enforcement was unable to find any trace of Bible or Freeman in the rubble of the home. On April 26, 2018, it was reported that Ronnie Dean Busick () was being charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the killings of Bible and of the Freeman family. Disappearance On December 29, 1999, high school friends Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman spent the evening together celebrating Freeman's sixteenth birthday. Bible received permission from her parents to spend the night at Freeman's home. Earlier that day, the girls had spent time at a local pizzeria with Freeman's mother, Kathy. At approximately 5:30 a.m. on December 30, 1999, a passerby called reporting that the Freeman home was engulfed in flames. Law enforcement determined the fire had been an arson. Inside the home, the charred remains of Kathy were discovered lying on the floor of her bedroom; she had been shot in the head. Initially, no other remains were located, leading local law enforcement to extrapolate that Ashley's father, Danny Freeman, had slain his wife and fled with both girls. Bible's parked car was in the driveway of the home with the keys in the ignition. On December 31, Bible's parents Lorene and Jay returned to the scene, hoping to find any additional clues that law enforcement may have missed. Amidst walking around the extensive rubble, they discovered what appeared to be another body and notified the police. The second body was determined to be that of Danny; like his wife, he had also been shot in the head execution-style. Following this discovery, the crime scene was reexamined, yet no sign of Bible or Freeman was found. In 2010, the Freeman family initiated court proceedings to have Ashley declared legally dead. Investigation =Suspects and confessions= In the decade following the disappearance of Bible and Freeman, two convicted killers‚ÄîTommy Lynn Sells and Jeremy Jones‚Äîconfessed to murdering them, but subsequently recanted their admissions. Jones had claimed that he murdered Freeman's parents as a favor for a friend over drug debt, then took the girls to Kansas, where he shot them and threw their bodies into an abandoned mine. Searches of the mine Jones identified proved unfruitful, however, and Jones subsequently admitted he had fabricated the story in order to get better food and additional phone privileges in prison. In a 2001 profile on Unsolved Mysteries, it was mentioned that rumors had circulated among locals that the Craig County Police Department had been feuding with the Freemans at the time over the death of their son, Shane, who was shot by a deputy after stealing a car. While his death was ruled justifiable, the Freemans had threatened to file a wrongful death lawsuit. Danny's brother, Dwayne, claimed that Danny had confided that deputies had tried to intimidate him. =2018 arrest of Ronnie Busick= In April 2018, it was reported that Ronnie Dean Busick, age 66, had been arrested and charged with four counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Bible and the Freeman family. Two other suspects‚ÄîWarren Phillip \\"Phil\\" Welch II (died 2007) and David Pennington (died 2015)‚Äîwere also identified. According to The Washington Post, \\"at least a dozen\\" witnesses claimed all three men bragged about raping and murdering Bible and Freeman, and went so far as taking Polaroid photographs of them. Several witnesses alleged that the three men killed the Freemans over drug money, and that the girls were held captive in Welch's trailer for several days before being murdered. A female witness who lived with Welch a short time after the disappearances provided a sworn affidavit that \\"she heard conversations between the three men where they disclosed that the murder victims had owed them money,\\" and that Welch kept a briefcase containing the Polaroid photos which showed both girls \\"bound and gagged with duct tape and lying on a bed,\\" with Welch lying next to the girls in some of the photographs. According to the affidavit, Welch, Pennington, and Busick had claimed to have raped and tortured the girls before disposing of their remains \\"in a pit\\" or mine shaft in Picher, Oklahoma. Law enforcement also stated they believed the girls' remains could have been \\"dumped in a cellar that was later covered in concrete.\\" In a public address, the Bible family issued a statement in which they stated they had been aware of the alleged photographs \\"for years,\\" and that \\"At this time all focus is on finding Lauria and Ashley. We welcome all information leading to their recovery. Until they are home with us, this will never be over.\\" After his arrest, Busick told reporters he wished to speak to the Bibles. On April 26, 2018, Bible's mother, Lorene, confirmed she spoke with Busick, but that he denied knowing the whereabouts of her daughter or Freeman. Media coverage The disappearances of Bible and Freeman were profiled on America's Most Wanted in 2000, and on Unsolved Mysteries in 2001. The case was later featured on the series Vanished with Beth Holloway. In 2013, it was profiled on the documentary series Disappeared on Investigation Discovery. In September 2018, one of the main witnesses in the case against Ronnie Busick, as well as the cold case investigators who filed the charges, gave their first interviews to the Tulsa World for a special report. The case was featured in a new four-part series on HLN titled Hell In The Heartland starting June 2, 2019, which hoped to shed more light on the disappearances of the girls and the main suspects. The show was hosted by the creator of the show and crime writer Jax Miller, who also wrote a book on the girls' disappearances.

In World War II, Tingley was the official cartoonist for the Canadian Army magazine, Khaki, and a contributor for the overseas army newspaper, The Maple Leaf. After his discharge, Tingley toured the country on his motorcycle hoping to find work as a cartoonist only to have the various newspapers in applied at turn him down. When Tingley reached London, Ontario, he was out of funds and had to gain a menial job at the London Free Press with a friend's help. However, Tingley's fortunes improved when an editor on that paper noticed a cartoon Tingley drew of the mayor during the municipal election. The editor was impressed enough with that work to arrange to have Tingley become the resident editorial cartoonist. Tingley's mascot was a worm character called Luke Worm who usually was present in each of his cartoons. Tingley's honours include the National Newspaper Award for editorial cartooning in 1955, National Headliner Award for Editorial Cartoon year for 1965 and induction into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame in 2015.

He attended meetings of the Communist Party and worked on union organizing. Both he and Joseph Papp worked on behalf of Vice President Henry A. Wallace‚Äôs unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1948 (as the candidate of the Progressive Party). He was also active on behalf of the plight of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. In time, Gersten was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Commission and was required to appear before the committee in 1958. Gersten pled the 5th. (Papp was also brought before the committee.) Though he was threatened with dismissal, Gersten did not lose his job because both John Houseman and Katharine Hepburn spoke on his behalf.Epstein, Helen (1994). ‚Äò‚ÄôJoe Papp: An American Life‚Äô‚Äô. Little Brown Boston, Massachusetts. New York Shakespeare Festival In 1960, Joseph Papp invited Gersten to work with him at the New York Shakespeare Festival. The job as associate producer became a full-time job in 1964. This began a long partnership during which Papp and Gersten established the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) at the old Astor Library downtown while presenting a series of significant productions. During his tenure at the NYSF, it would become the pre-eminent non-profit theater in the United States. (Gersten would also produce at Lincoln Center‚Äôs Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi E. Newhouse (prior to 1973 the Forum) theaters during NYSF‚Äôs tenure there between 1974 and 1977.) The eighteen year Papp/Gersten regime at the NYSF would usher in a bold new era of playwriting and musical theater. Significant dramatists such as Liz Swados, David Rabe, Sam Shepard, Michael Bennett, Richard Foreman and John Guare as well as major stage stars including James Earl Jones, Meryl Streep, Sam Waterston Edward Herrmann and Al Pacino, George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst (not to mention the visual artist Paul Davis), got their first national attention at the NYSF. Productions during this period alo included dozens of plays by William Shakespeare and free theater in Central Park. Notable productions during the Papp/Gersten era include an adaptation of Shakespeare‚Äôs Two Gentlemen of Verona, Hair, That Championship Season, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf, Streamers, Buried Child and the crowning achievement of the NYSF during this period: the musical: A Chorus Line. In 1968, Gersten married Cora Cahan, at the time touring as a dancer with various modern dance companies. (With Eliot Feld, Cora Cahan would establish and serve as executive director of Eliot Feld's dance company, Feld Ballet. In 1982, Cora and Eliot conceived and created the Joyce Theater. Since 1990, Cora has been President of The New 42nd Street, a non-profit organization generated by the city and the state as part of the 42nd Street Redevelopment Project.) The Gerstens have two children, Jenny Cahan Gersten and Jilian Cahan Gersten. Perhaps Gersten's most significant contribution to the American theater was his realization that a non-profit theater could produce commercially. In what he has described as a ‚Äòeureka moment‚Äô he found a way to free the New York Shakespeare Festival and later the Lincoln Center Theater from dependency on commercial producers when moving a show to Broadway. Through this innovative approach to underwriting production, beginning with moving Two Gentlemen of Verona to Broadway in 1971, (and particularly with the success of A Chorus Line), the fortunes of the New York Shakespeare Festival grew enormously. Gersten's approach would change the course of non-profit institutions nationally and especially in New York City. In 1978, Gersten and Papp went their separate ways when Gersten insisted that the NYSF produce Michael Bennett‚Äôs Ballroom. Papp fired Gersten, whereupon Gersten went on to independently produce Ballroom (as well as John Guare‚Äôs Bosoms and Neglect) on Broadway later that year. Zoetrope and Radio City Music Hall In 1979, Gersten was invited by Francis Ford Coppola to come work for his new Zoetrope Studios as Executive Vice President of Creative Affairs. During his tenure at Zoetrope, Gersten would serve as Executive Producer of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs One From the Heart, as well as three other films. He also acted as Co-Producer of the live-orchestra presentations throughout the world of Abel Gance‚Äôs film Napol√©on. After leaving Zoetrope, Gersten was recruited by Radio City Music Hall to serve as their Vice President to produce live original content. A highlight of his two and a quarter year tenure, was a massive production of Porgy and Bess, (featuring a 90-strong company). Lincoln Center Theater In 1984, the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a component of the larger Lincoln Center performing arts complex, had been dark for four years. A board of directors headed by former New York Mayor John V. Lindsay decided to try one more time to activate the theater which had been built and established in the mid-sixties, but failed to establish itself as a viable theatrical venue. (This period includes the four years in which the NYSF produced at Lincoln Center.) Gersten, at the time working for Alexander Cohen on Broadway and teaching as an adjunct professor of theater administration at Columbia University, was invited to act as a consultant on the board. He proposed a way to organize the Beaumont and was hired as Executive Producer alongside Gregory Mosher who was hired as Artistic Director to lead the new entity ‚ÄúLincoln Center Theater‚Äù. Under Mosher and Gersten, the Vivian Beaumont and the Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters, moribund for nearly a decade, flourished. More than twenty productions followed in quick succession over the next five years, including several major successes (see Lincoln Center Theater). In 1991, Mr. Mosher announced that he would leave LCT to pursue other projects. In 1991, Gersten invited Andre Bishop to take over as Artistic Director. (Bishop's tenure would begin in 1992). (After Gersten's retirement, Bishop would have the title of Producing Artistic Director). The long list of successes at Lincoln Center Theater would grow under their partnership. For almost twenty years, Mr. Gersten and Mr. Bishop produced an award-winning series of top shelf theatrical productions, sparing no expense to achieve the most exacting artistic results. A number of plays produced at Lincoln Center Theater, would move to Broadway (or be produced directly for Broadway). Muscular, precise, and visually striking theater became the hallmark of Lincoln Center Theater. Bernard Gersten produced over 150 productions at LCT, including a revival of John Guare‚Äôs House of Blue Leaves and premiere of Six Degrees of Separation, Wendy Wasserstein‚Äôs Sisters Rosenzweig, Edward Albee‚Äôs A Delicate Balance, Ngema's Sarafina, David Mamet‚Äôs Speed the Plow, Tom Stoppard‚Äôs The Coast of Utopia and a revival of South Pacific. Under Gersten, the Lincoln Center Theater championed the work of Spalding Gray, John Guare, Edward Albee, Tom Stoppard and Wendy Wasserstein among the dozens of playwrights, composers, and directors who worked there, including Gerald Gutierrez, Jerry Zaks, Susan Stroman, Daniel Sullivan, Bartlett Sher and Graciele Daniele. Prior to retirement from LCT, Gersten helped implement the fundraising, design, and construction of the new Claire Tow Theater atop the Vivian Beaumont. Gersten implemented a new custom license plate for New York State featuring the slogan ‚ÄòState of the Arts.‚Äô Income from this custom license plate supports the New York State Council on the Arts.

It was an ABC Movie of the Week. Plot A violent inmate, whose face is not shown, escapes from a state mental facility. He makes his way to a private beach, drowns a man relaxing on the shore, and steals his work uniform. Five young women meet, they are having their 5-year college reunion at an exclusive mansion on an isolated island that does not have phone contact with the mainland. Several of the women have personal issues. Meeker is the captain of the small boat that takes the women to the island. Wylie is the mansion's caretaker. They argue, both with the women around and in private. The next morning the island's dog is found dead. Later that day four of the women return from the beach to discover that the fifth has been strangled to death. They surmise it must be Meeker or Wylie who killed her. The women plan to get on the boat and sail off, or at least to use its radio to call for help, but as they approach the boat it explodes. The four women lock the men out of the mansion and agree to not leave each other alone for the rest of the night. The men, when told (through the locked door) that one of the women has been killed, both say they have no knowledge of it. They tell the women a supply ship will be arriving in the morning, and leave them in the mansion. The women discuss which of Meeker or Wylie they think is the murderer. In the company cabin, the two men are suspicious of each other and both resolve not to let the other out of his sight. They discuss the possibility that someone else might be on the island. Later that night Meeker says he wants to go out to get some air, and when Wylie tries to stop him, they fight. Meeker beats up Wylie and runs away. The next morning Meeker and Wylie have a confrontation that reveals which of them is the murderer. The killer persuades the women the other man, who is now dead, was responsible, and that they are all now safe. Later, when the supply ship is due, one of the women goes off to thank the surviving man for his help. The other women wander the beach while waiting, and come across information that proves the killer is the man they have come to trust. They rush off to warn their friend. The lone woman, while talking to the man, comes to the realization that he is unbalanced. Just then the three women approach calling out her name. She runs off but he catches her and chokes her. Her friends, after at first being fearful of getting too close to the attack, are able to save her by knocking the killer over the head with a rock, which kills him. Gasping and in shock they make their way to the island's pier.

It exercises the state legislation (legislature). The seat of the Landtag is in St. P√∂lten in the Landhausviertel. The Lower Austrian Parliament is composed of 56 members of parliament. The term of office is five years. Elections are held in accordance with the Lower Austrian Landtag election regulations of 1992. 21 constituencies in Lower Austria correspond to the political districts. The statutory cities belong to the district of the same name or the surrounding district. The number of deputies corresponds to the number of inhabitants. To be eligible to stand as a candidate, a candidate must be 18 years of age (on election day) and have at least 50 declarations of consent. They are nominated by a political party. In order to enter the state parliament, one party must reach the four percent hurdle or obtain a mandate in a constituency. The most recent elections to the Landtag of Lower Austria were held on 28 January 2018. History The Lower Austrian parliament dates back to the medieval meetings of the estates, the so-called Landtaidinge. These were the prelates (ecclesiastical nobility), the lords (high secular nobility), the knighthood (low secular nobility) and the status of the princely towns and markets. In other words, the peasantry in particular, i.e. the majority of the population, were not represented. In 1513, a building was purchased in what is now Herrengasse in Vienna, the so-called Palais Nieder√∂sterreich, where the state parliament met until 1997. The great power of the estates in the 16th century was pushed back more and more in the age of absolutism, but the state parliament was never abolished. Its last meeting in its old form took place on 13 March 1848 - the presentation of a petition to the Lower Austrian estates regarding riots was the trigger for the March Revolution. The constitutions and draft constitutions of the following years regularly provided for a state parliament for Lower Austria, but it only became reality in 1861 with the February Patent. According to the \\"Landes- Ordnung f√ºr das Erzherzogthum Oesterreich unter der Enns\\", which was issued by this patent and was valid until 1918, the Landtag should consist of 66 members, namely: the Archbishop of Vienna, the Bishop of St. P√∂lten, the Rector of the University of Vienna, furthermore 15 members of the Gro√ügrundbesitz, 28 members of the towns and markets as well as of the chambers of commerce and trade and twenty members of the rural communities. As a result of this curia system, the right to vote was extremely unequal and, moreover, limited to about 7% of the population due to a census voting law in place for towns and rural communities, i.e. eligibility to vote was subject to a certain tax payment by the voter. A remarkable step backwards was taken in 1888 with the explicit abolition of the previously upright right to vote for women. On 20 March 1919, a new electoral law was enacted which introduced universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage for all citizens residing in Lower Austria without distinction of sex. For Vienna, which at that time still belonged to Lower Austria, 68 of the 120 mandates were planned. The first election after this right to vote took place on 4 May 1919 and brought an absolute majority for the Social Democratic Workers Party. In 1919-1920, tendencies, some of which had already been expressed in the monarchy, to separate Vienna from Lower Austria became stronger. In the monarchy, Vienna was considered to be an imperial city, with the k.k. Government for Cisleithania, it was now a question of making Vienna a federal province. To the other six provinces, which existed at that time, one province of Lower Austria including Vienna seemed to be too powerful a partner in the desired federalism, since about half of all Austrians lived in this province. Moreover, Lower Austrian farmers did not want to be governed by the social democratic Viennese, and the social democratic Viennese did not want to be hindered in left-wing politics by conservative Lower Austrians. For this reason, the separation of Vienna and Lower Austria was agreed in the Grand Coalition and adopted by the Constituent National Assembly on 1 October 1920. On the day the Federal Constitutional Law came into force, on 10 November 1920, the Gemeinderat of Vienna met for the first time as the Landtag of Vienna and adopted the Vienna City Constitution, which came into force on 18 November 1920. The new Lower Austria without Vienna adopted the Constitution of the Land of Lower Austria on 30 November 1920. In order to coordinate the division of the previous state property, the joint Lower Austrian parliament, if necessary divided into the two curia Vienna and Lower Austria Land, was formally preserved until the end of 1921, but had almost nothing more to decide, since the leading politicians of the two new Landtags did not want to maintain the commonality in part legally either. The abolition of the remaining commonalities was decided in Vienna and Lower Austria by their new legislative bodies at the end of 1921. From 1 January 1922, the two new Landtags were legally completely separated. However, it had been agreed that the seat of the Lower Austrian parliament and the Lower Austrian government would remain in the Landhaus in Vienna; Vienna's half share in the building would only be beaten if the Landtag moved out of the Landhaus. By 1932, the state parliament had 60 members elected in four constituencies. In 1932 the electoral law was reformed and the number of members reduced to 56, while the number of constituencies was increased to eight to make it more difficult for smaller parties, especially the NSDAP, to move in. In 1933, the Dollfuss government took out the National Council, but the Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Workers Party (SDAP) jointly passed the prohibition law for the NSDAP in the Lower Austrian Landtag. On February 12, 1934, the Dollfuss dictatorship banned Austrian social democracy, thus depriving the Lower Austrian parliament of its democratic basis. On 1 July 1934, the Landtag was dictatorially transformed into a Parliament of Estates, consisting of 36 mandataries sent in by the professions. With the Anschluss in 1938, the state parliament was dissolved. The administration of the Reichsgau Niederdonau was headed by a Gauleiter appointed by Adolf Hitler. After the end of the Second World War, state laws were passed by the provisional state government from April 27, 1945; and on December 12, the state parliament was reconstituted and on the same day elected the Reither government as the first elected government of the Second Republic. As a result of the vote on its own state capital, the Landtag moved to St. P√∂lten on 21 May 1997. Subsequently, the building in Vienna, which for centuries had been known as a Landhaus, was renamed to Palais Nieder√∂sterreich to facilitate the use of the building for non- political purposes.

It stars Hannah Emily Anderson and Brittany Allen and follows a young woman fighting for her life as her wife's murderous intentions become evident.  Plot  Jackie takes her wife Jules to a remote cabin to celebrate their first anniversary. Jules becomes suspicious when Jackie's childhood friend, Sarah, visits and addresses Jackie as \\"Megan\\". Jackie explains that she changed her name by choice but Jules isn't satisfied and visits Sarah and her husband Daniel. Sarah explains that Jenny, a girl who was friends with her and Jackie, accidentally drowned in the lake when they were young and expresses surprise that Jackie never mentioned this. Jackie later claims that she failed to mention Jenny because she believed the accident was her fault, although the police cleared her of any wrongdoing. Jules embraces her wife, consoling her. Moments later, while admiring the view of the wilderness, Jackie shoves Jules off the edge of a cliff. Jackie returns to the cabin, practicing the tearful phone call she's going to make to the police, reporting Jules' death. But Jules, while seriously hurt, is still alive. When Jackie discovers her wife has left, she searches the forest for her, sobbing and begging Jules for forgiveness. Jules is tempted to show herself until Jackie, unaware she's being watched, reveals her concern is an act. Jules flees, makes it to the house, and tends to her injuries. She then makes it halfway across the lake on a boat before Jackie catches up to her. Daniel sees the pair and, despite Jackie's threats, Jules arranges for them to come for dinner that evening. Jackie reveals that she never loved Jules and intends to kill her to cash in on her life insurance policy. It's also implied that Jackie was responsible for Jenny's death. Sarah is suspicious of Jackie. Having threatened to kill both Sarah and Daniel, Jackie forces Jules to pretend everything is normal but catches Jules trying to get help from Sarah. She slits Daniel's throat outside, chases Sarah upstairs and fatally stabs her numerous times. Jackie then forces Jules to help her dispose of the bodies. When asked how she became this way, Jackie reveals that she has simply always been devoid of sentiments or a conscience, saying it was \\"nature, not nurture\\". Jules peeks behind the stuffed head of a bear that Jackie supposedly killed as a child, and discovers a box containing necklaces that Jackie had given to her previous wives, all of whom she killed. Jackie drives Jules back to the cliffs edge where she intends to push her wife off again, but Jules manages to escape by stabbing her with a tranquilizer dart. Jules flees in the car, but returns to confront Jackie. The two fight and Jackie eventually gets the upper hand, knocking her out, and finally throwing her over the same cliff as earlier. Confident that Jules is now dead, she calls the police. Jackie (who is diabetic), injects herself with insulin but starts to feel woozy. She discovers through a video Jules had made prior to their confrontation that the insulin is spiked with hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide causes blood clots in Jackie's system, and after wandering in the woods, she collapses and dies of a stroke. Back at the bottom of the cliff, Jules lies, eyes wide open, presumably dead. As the film rolls over a sea of trees, a sharp intake of breath is heard, suggesting Jules survived the fall.

It was introduced on June 7, 2018 by Senators Cory Gardner (Republican from Colorado) and Elizabeth Warren (Democrat from Massachusetts). A companion bill was introduced the same day in the House of Representatives, sponsored by Earl Blumenauer (Democrat from Oregon) and David Joyce (Republican from Ohio). The act would amend the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 to exempt from federal enforcement individuals or corporations in states who are in compliance with U.S. state, U.S. territory and the District of Columbia, or tribal law on cannabis, with certain additional provisions such as minimum ages. The banking provisions of the STATES Act have been reintroduced as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act of 2019 in the 116th U.S. Congress by Ed Perlmutter (Democrat from Colorado) in the House, and by Jeff Merkley (Democrat from Oregon) in the Senate. , the House bill had 206 cosponsors, and the Senate bill had 33 cosponsors. History According to Voice of America, \\"The impetus for the legislation was a decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January to rescind Obama-era Justice Department guidelines that encouraged prosecutors to adopt a hands-off approach to marijuana law enforcement in states where the substance was legal\\", referring to the Cole Memorandum provisions rescinded on January 4, 2018. On April 25, 2018, Senators Cory Gardner and Elizabeth Warren announced that they would introduce a bipartisan bill to prevent Federal interference with states that had legalized marijuana. The announcement came a few days after Senator Gardner spoke with President Trump and announced that he had received assurances that the President would support such legislation. As of late April, the details of the bill were unannounced but analysts said it \\"would not legalize cannabis nationally, but would allow each state the options of legalizing recreational or medical cannabis, or to continue to prohibit the plant entirely\\" and had announced the name of the bill. On June 7, 2018, Warren introduced the bill in the U.S. Senate and Representative David Joyce introduced a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Senate bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. In December 2018, Gardner attempted to attach the bill as an amendment to the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill being debated in the Senate during the lame-duck session of the 115th U.S. Congress, but was blocked by a procedural maneuver from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The STATES Act was reintroduced in the 116th Congress on April 4, 2019, in both the House and the Senate. Cosponsors and support =Senate= # Sen.

The same day, twelve governors, from West Coast states that had legalized cannabis for adult use, plus Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota and Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Congress urging passage of the measure. The Los Angeles Timess editorial board endorsed the proposal under a headline that said it was \\"kickstarting Congress' effort to legalize marijuana\\". A spokesperson for the Marijuana Policy Project called the STATES Act \\"the most significant piece of marijuana-related legislation ever introduced in Congress.\\" The Suquamish Tribe in Washington State, one of the first tribes with legal cannabis sales, indicated support for the bill. Writing for Above the Law, a legal analysis website for attorneys, cannabis law specialist Hilary Bricken wrote that it was \\"for the first time ever, a real and legitimate bipartisan 'respect states' rights' effort\\" on \\"meaningful marijuana law reform at the Congressional level\\". In testimony to the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 10, 2019, Attorney General William Barr said he preferred the legislation over the \\"intolerable\\" status quo of conflicting state and federal laws. According to NORML political director Justin Strekal, as of 2019 the STATES Act is looking basic and dated compared to newer legislation that goes beyond carving out exceptions to prohibition to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely, take steps to repair prohibition's harms, forgive past criminal convictions, and build an equitable industry.https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/cannabis-legalization-bills-in- congress-which-really-matters  See also   SAFE Banking Act  References   Further reading  * Dean M.

A long-time deputy to Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, he was appointed Acting Minister of Foreign Trade in February 1965 after Ye was incapacitated by a stroke. He served in the position for five years, mostly during the chaotic Cultural Revolution. He attempted to maintain economic order, but was attacked by the Red Guards and dismissed in July 1970.  Republic of China  Lin was born in 1911 in Longyan, Fujian Province. He enlisted in the Chinese Red Army in October 1932 and served in the Fujian Soviet. In October 1934, he joined the Communist Party of China and participated in the Red Army's Long March to Shaanbei. He studied at the Red Army University after arriving at the Shaanbei Communist base. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, he served in the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. In August 1940, he began working in the economic field, serving as a bank manager and head of the industry and commerce administration in Southern Hebei and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border region. After the end of World War II in 1945, he served as general manager of the South Hebei Regional Bank, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce of North China People's Government, and General Manager of North China Trading Corporation.  People's Republic of China  After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Lin served in various positions in the Ministry of Trade (Ministry of Foreign Trade after 1952). In September 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai appointed Lin Director of the General Administration of Customs. He also served as a long-time deputy to Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade. After Ye became incapacitated by a stroke in 1964, Lin was named \\"permanent\\" Acting Minister of Foreign Trade on 7 February 1965. Ye later died in June 1967. China descended into chaos when the Cultural Revolution erupted in May 1966, a few months before the autumn Canton Fair was scheduled to begin. Lin used his position to restrain the Red Guards and maintained order in Guangzhou to ensure the Canton Fair was not disrupted. As a result, the fair was held successfully and earned export revenues of US$480 million. However, the Ministry of Foreign Trade was later attacked and besieged by the Rebel Faction of the Red Guards as the \\"black headquarters\\" of Revisionism. Zhou Enlai sent men to rescue Lin from the attack and protected him in the Zhongnanhai compound. In July 1970, Bai Xiangguo, a military officer, was appointed Minister of Foreign Trade, and Lin disappeared from politics until his reemergence as a State Council cadre in May 1973. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lin was appointed Deputy Director of the Finance and Commerce Leading Group of the State Council in December 1977, and became Executive Deputy Director after 1978. Lin died in Beijing on 7 January 2007, at the age of 96.

The battle was a limited engagement between Union Army units of the Army of the Tennessee and Confederate States Army units of the Army of Tennessee in the aftermath of the Battle of Resaca, Georgia. The Battle of Rome Cross Roads ended inconclusively with the Confederate Army units withdrawing. However, the Confederate force achieved the tactical objective of delaying Union Army pursuit.

Dodge's XVI Corps, was the leading unit of the Army of the Tennessee in pursuit of the retreating Confederates of Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corp. The 2nd Division of the XVI Corps moved toward the intersection of the Rome-Calhoun Road and the Sugar Valley- Adairsville Road, near Calhoun, Georgia, in an attempt to cut off Hardee's Corps, including Confederate wagon trains.

As he organized the Union regiments, Burke was mortally wounded by a bullet which shattered the bone in his left leg. Lieutenant Colonel Robert N.

His son Hellick Tostenson bought the farm in 1874 and by 1877 it totaled 198 acres. (Note that these immigrants were so fresh that they named Hellick following the old Scandinavian system where his surname was his father's name followed by 'son,' rather than a family name.) Starting around the time of the Civil War, the farm began shifting from wheat to dairy, expanding the herd of cows. In 1883 Hellick built the current barn, with a limestone basement wall and cedar board and batten walls above. The barn had modern features for the time: two interior wood-stave silos, built in the year that the UW College of Agriculture first recommended silos for winter feeding. The barn also had calving pens, a gravity-driven water system, a manure disposal system, and ventilators. Those features remain largely unchanged, and were used into the 1960s. Also in 1883, the north-south ell of the house was added to make space for another family hired to help work the farm. In 1889 Hellick's sister Anna and her husband Anton Olson, another Norwegian immigrant, bought the farm. By this time tobacco production was becoming a significant part of the business, with about 15 acres in cultivation - the broad-leafed variety used for cigar wrappers that is commonly grown around Dane County. In 1890 they built what is now the northernmost tobacco-curing shed near the field north of the buildings. Every third board on the side is hinged, which let the farmer control the amount of air reaching the curing leaves hanging inside. Two other old curing sheds were moved nearby in 1906 and 1908. A stripping shed was built nearby in 1910, where the workers stripped the cured leaves from the stalks and packed them into crates to be sold. Henry and Martin Olson, sons of Anton and Anna, bought the farm in 1918, and farmed there into the 1970s. The old brothers changed the farm very little over the years. Other combination dairy/tobacco farms remain in the area, but this one is different in that it retains a full set of buildings from the late 1800s/early 1900s without newer buildings added.

Background The 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division was responsible for the security of Long An Province, southwest of Saigon. Long An Province was the gateway to the Mekong Delta the \\"rice-basket\\" of South Vietnam, in addition to producing over 280,000 tons of rice per year itself. The province contained vital transport links namely Route 4 which connected Saigon to An Xuy√™n Province and the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng and V√†m C·ªè Tay rivers which flowed southeast from the Parrot's Beak, Cambodia to the Saigon River. The V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng and V√†m C·ªè Tay rivers also served as vital supply lines for the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) linking their sanctuaries in Cambodia with their operational areas around Saigon and in the Mekong Delta. Long An Province was believed to shelter the 267th, 269th, and 6th B√¨nh T√¢n Battalions in the west and the 506th, 508th, 5th Nh√† B√® and Phu Loi II Battalions in the east. The VC had successfully established control over most of the province with the result that South Vietnamese Government control was limited to the major towns and outposts along Route 4. At the commencement of the operation in February 1967 the South Vietnamese Government controlled less than a quarter of the population and only 4 percent of the province was considered physically secure. The ambitious objectives of Operation Enterprise were \\"to achieve military pacification by destroying the enemy; eliminating his infrastructure; denying him use of lines of communications; and extending government of Vietnam control through the support of Revolutionary Development.‚Äù Operation The 3rd Brigade kept its headquarters at T√¢n An the provincial capital, 47km southwest of Saigon on Route 4 and the V√†m C·ªè Tay river. The 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment operated from T√¢n Tr·ª•, 7km east of T√¢n An and was responsible for patrolling the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng river using Boston Whaler boats. The 3rd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment, was based at Rach Kien with one company in the town of C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc and another company 15km southeast of Rach Kien, where the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng merged with the Saigon River. Highway 5A passed through C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc District, connecting Saigon with G√≤ C√¥ng Province. The 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), was based in B√¨nh Ph∆∞·ªõc 10km southeast of Tan An and was responsible for patrolling Highway 4 between Saigon and ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp and protecting the daily supply convoys between Long Binh Post and T√¢n An. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 25th Division kept 2 regiments in Long An Province: the 46th Regiment was based in C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc and the 50th Regiment was based in B·∫øn L·ª©c, 12km northeast of T√¢n An. In addition the ARVN maintained various Regional Foreces and Popular Forces throughout the province. In order to maximize coverage of the province, the 3rd Brigade used ‚Äújitterbug‚Äù missions, landing several companies from the 3/39th Infantry and 2/60th Infantry by helicopter for short searches of tree lines or canals and then redeploying to another location if no PAVN/VC were located. Night ambushes were also regularly placed along likely infiltration routes and staging areas. More than 30 percent of all operations were combined operations with ARVN forces. By September 1967 the 3rd Brigade's tactics had forced the PAVN/VC to operate in smaller units along the eastern and western borders of the province. In October 1967 Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support embarked on a new pacification programme to secure Route 4 while at the same time Central Office for South Vietnam ordered a renewed effort to close Route 4. Between 24 and 27 October, PAVN/VC forces used explosives and shovels to crater Route 4 in almost fifty places between M·ªπ Tho and Saigon, however this only succeeded in closing the road for a few hours. In late October 5/60th Infantry (Mechanized) patrols succeeded in killing several PAVN/VC mine-laying teams and by early November interdiction of the road had dropped back to normal levels. Meanwhile the South Vietnamese government had established a Revolutionary Development zone along the northeastern edge of Long An linking the government-controlled hamlets that lined Highways 4 and 5A creating a security barrier on the southern approach to Gia ƒê·ªãnh Province and Saigon. On the night of 10 December, the VC 508th Battalion and elements of the 5th Nh√† B√® Battalion attacked a Company A, 2/60th Infantry position at An Nhut Tan, on the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng River. The VC overran three perimeter bunkers as well as the mortar pit. The attack was eventually repulsed for the loss of 7 U.S. killed and 35 VC killed. A subsequent investigation found that the perimeter defenses were inadequate with the Concertina wire too loose and rusty and many of the trip flares and claymore mines deteriorated and inoperative and that several of the sentries had been asleep. Other than this attack, most of the action in the province during November and December was limited to small skirmishes and attacks by fire. In addition to offensive operations the 3rd Brigade also conducted training and numerous civic actions to support pacification. Between 1 November 1967 and 30 January 1968, brigade medics treated 44,394 civilians and taught first aid to Vietnamese assigned to village dispensaries. A 7-man team taught a six-week refresher course to an ARVN battalion, while three Mobile Advisory Teams trained Regional and Popular Forces and several Improvement Action Teams made weekly visits to Regional and Popular Force outposts. Aftermath Between 1 November 1967 and 30 January 1968, the 3rd Brigade killed 241 PAVN/VC, captured 21 PAVN/VC and received 80 defectors and captured 14 crew-served weapons and 65 rifles for the loss of 31 U.S. dead. During the same period, provincial officials reported killing 43 PAVN/VC, capturing 37 and receiving 35 defectors. On 10 March 1968 II Field Force, Vietnam commander LG Frederick C. Weyand ordered an end to Operation Enterprise to free up forces to participate in Operation Quyet Thang.
