In such \\"reeducation camps\\", the government imprisoned up to 300,000 former military officers, government workers and supporters of the former government of South Vietnam as well as civilians, except some famous ARVN generals who committed suicide shortly after hearing President Duong Van Minh surrendered. Other estimates put the number of inmates as high as 500,000 to 1 million. Reeducation as it was implemented in Vietnam was seen as both a means of revenge and a sophisticated technique of repression and indoctrination, which developed following the 1975 Fall of Saigon. Thousands were tortured and abused. Prisoners were incarcerated for as long as 17 years, with most terms ranging from three to 10 years. Meaning of h·ªçc t·∫≠p c·∫£i t·∫°o The term reeducation, with its pedagogical overtones, does not quite convey the quasi- mystical resonance of h·ªçc t·∫≠p c·∫£i t·∫°o in Vietnamese. C·∫£i (\\"to transform\\", from Sino-Vietnamese Êîπ) and t·∫°o (\\"to create\\", from Sino-Vietnamese ÈÄ†) combine to literally mean an attempt at re-creation, and making over sinful or incomplete individuals. Historical background In South Vietnam, the government of Ngo Dinh Diem countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \\"political reeducation centers.\\" This was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that over 65,000 individuals were incarcerated and 2,148 individuals were killed in the process by November 1957, although these figures may be exaggerated. After the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese men, from former officers in the armed forces, to religious leaders, to employees of the Americans or the old government, were rounded up in re-education camps to \\"learn about the ways of the new government.\\" They were never tried, judged or convicted of any crime. Many South Vietnamese men chose to flee on boats, but others had established lives and loved ones in Vietnam, so they did not flee, but entered these camps in hope of quickly reconciling with the new government and continuing their lives peacefully. Some ARVN generals and officers, such as General L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞ng (known as hero of fighting for three months at An Loc) and General Nguy·ªÖn Khoa Nam (the last major general of IV Corps) who protect Can Tho and other Mekong provinces to keep under control of higher army morale, chose to sacrifice by suicide rather than fleeing overseas or risking for re-education camp. The hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who were imprisoned in re-education camps from 1975 basically fell into two categories: 1) Those who were detained in re-education camps from 1975 because they collaborated with the other side during the war, and 2) Those who were arrested in the years after 1975 for attempting to exercise such democratic freedoms as those mentioned in Article 11 of the 1973 Paris Agreements. In other words, both categories of prisoners were held in direct violation of Article 11 of the 1973 Paris Agreements, an international treaty, and therefore of international law. Government view of the reeducation camps Officially, the Vietnamese government does not consider the reeducation camps to be prisons; instead, it views them as places where individuals can be rehabilitated into society through education and socially constructive labor. The Hanoi government defended the reeducation camps by placing the \\"war criminal\\" label on the prisoners. A 1981 memorandum of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to Amnesty International claimed that all those in the reeducation camps were guilty of acts of national treason as defined in Article 3 of the 30 October 1967 Law on Counter-revolutionary Crimes (enacted for the government of North Vietnam), which specifies punishments ranging from 20 years to life in prison or the death penalty. However, it was instead allowing the prisoners to experience \\"reeducation,\\" which is applied in Vietnam because Vietnam says it is the most \\"humanitarian\\" system and because it is the most advantageous punishment for law breakers. Registration and arrest In May 1975, specific groups of Vietnamese were ordered to register with the new government that had established control over the South on April 30, 1975. Then, in June, the new government issued orders instructing those who had registered in May to report to various places for reeducation. Soldiers, noncommissioned officers and rank-and-file personnel of the former South Vietnamese government were to undergo a three-day \\"reform study,\\" June 11‚Äì13, which they would attend during the day and they would go home at night. The others who had been ordered to report for \\"reform study\\" were not allowed the same arrangement of attending during the day and going home at night, but were instead to be confined to their sites of \\"reform study\\" until the course ended. Nevertheless, there was some hope, for the government gave the clear impression that reform study would last no more than a month for even the highest-ranking officers and officials of the former government in South Vietnam, and ten days for lower-ranking officers and officials. Thus, officers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces from the rank of second lieutenant to captain, along with low-ranking police officers and intelligence cadres, were ordered to report to various sites, bringing along \\"enough paper, pens, clothes, mosquito nets, personal effects, food or money to last ten days beginning from the day of their arrival.\\" High-ranking military and police officers of the ARVN, from major to general, along with mid and high-ranking intelligence officers, members of the ARVN executive, judicial and legislative branches, including all elected members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and, finally, leaders of \\"reactionary\\" (i.e. non-communist) political parties in South Vietnam, were ordered to report to various sites bringing enough \\"paper, pens, clothes, mosquito-nets, personal effects, food or money to last a month beginning from the day of their first meeting.\\" The new government announced that there would be three days of reeducation for ARVN soldiers, ten days for low-ranking officers and officials, and one month for high-ranking ARVN officers and officials. Many teachers reported for reeducation, assuming that they would have to undergo it sooner or later anyway. Sick people also reported for reeducation, assured by the government that there would be doctors and medical facilities in the schools and that the patients would be well treated. However, the re-education camp lasted sometimes more than 10 years for some higher ranks ARVN generals and officers. The camps =Indoctrination and forced confessions= During the early phase of reeducation, lasting from a few weeks to a few months, inmates were subjected to intensive political indoctrination. Subjects' studies included the exploitation by American imperialism of workers in other countries, the glory of labor, the inevitable victory of Vietnam, led by the Communist Party, over the U.S., and the generosity of the new government toward the \\"rebels\\" (those who fought on the other side during the war). Another feature emphasized during the early stage of reeducation, but continued throughout one's imprisonment, was the confession of one's alleged misdeeds in the past. All prisoners in the camps were required to write confessions, no matter how trivial their alleged crimes might have been. Some prisoners of former ARVN generals wrote confessions about several battle and military campaign tactics before 1975. Mail clerks, for example, were told that they were guilty of aiding the \\"puppet war machinery\\" through circulating the mail, while religious chaplains were found guilty of providing spiritual comfort and encouragement to enemy troops. =The work= In the reeducation camps much emphasis was placed on \\"productive labor.\\" Such labor was described by SRV spokesman Hoang Son as \\"absolutely necessary\\" for reeducation because \\"under the former government, they (the prisoners) represented the upper strata of society and got rich under U.S. patronage. They could scorn the working people. Now the former social order has been turned upside down, and after they have finished their stay in camps they have to earn their living by their own labour and live in a society where work is held in honor.\\" Thus, in the eyes of the Vietnamese rulers, \\"productive labor\\" was a necessary aspect in the overturning of the social order. Yet in examining the conditions under which this labor took place, it seems that there was also an element of revenge. The labor was mostly hard physical work, some of it very dangerous, such as mine field sweeping. No technical equipment was provided for this extremely risky work, and as a result, many prisoners were killed or wounded in mine field explosions. Other kinds of work included cutting trees, planting corn and root crops, clearing the jungle, digging wells, latrines and garbage pits, and constructing barracks within the camp and fences around it. The inmates were generally organized into platoons and work units, where they were forced to compete with each other for better records and work achievements. This often pushed inmates to exhaustion and nervousness with each person and group striving to surpass or at least fulfill the norms set by camp authorities, or they would be classified as 'lazy' and ordered to do 'compensation work' on Sundays. North Vietnamese children were brought in to routinely pester prisoners, teenage girls stomping on the bare feet of former ARVN army officers as they marched to work. Sometimes prisoners who missed their quota were shackled and placed in solitary confinement cells. Deaths from starvation and disease occurred frequently and bodies were often buried in graves on site which were later abandoned. The work was done in the hot tropical sun, by prisoners who were poorly nourished and received little or no medical care. The poor health, combined with hard work, mandatory confessions and political indoctrination, made life very difficult for prisoners in Vietnam, and contributed to a high death rate in the camps. Former prisoners describe the constant hunger that resulted from a lack of food while they were in the camps. The government deliberately kept the prisoners on low rations. The lack of food caused severe malnutrition for many prisoners and weakened their resistance to various diseases. Most common among the diseases were malaria, beriberi and dysentery. Tuberculosis was also widespread in some of the camps. Medical supplies were generally nonexistent in the camps and medical care was very inadequate, usually limited to a poorly trained medic and perhaps a few prisoners who had formerly been medical doctors. The result was a high death rate from diseases. =Rules and regulations= The authorities sought to maintain strict control over the thoughts of the prisoners, and forbade prisoners from keeping and reading books or magazines of the former government, reminiscing in conversation about \\"imperialism and the puppet south,\\" singing old patriotic and love songs from the former government, discussing political questions (outside authorized discussions), harboring \\"reactionary\\" thoughts or possessing \\"superstitious\\" beliefs. It has been acknowledged by Hanoi that violence has in fact been directed against the prisoners, although it maintains that these are isolated cases and not indicative of general camp policy. Former prisoners, on the other hand, report frequent beatings for minor infractions, such as missing work because of illness. Violations of rules led to various forms of punishment, including being tied up in contorted positions, shackled in conex boxes or dark cells, forced to work extra hours or receiving reduced food rations. Many prisoners were beaten, some to death, or subjected to very harsh forms of punishment due to the cruelty of certain camp officials and guards. Some were executed, especially for attempting to escape. It was also forbidden to be impolite to the cadres of the camp, and this rule was sometimes abused to the point where the slightest indication of a lack of deference to the cadres had been interpreted as rudeness and was therefore harshly punished. Longtime anti- Vietnam war and human rights activist Ginetta Sagan described conditions in the camps in 1982: > During the last three years friends and I have interviewed several hundred > former prisoners, read newspaper articles on the camps as well as various > reports of Amnesty International, and have studied official statements from > the Vietnamese Government and its press on the re-education camps.

None of them survived.\\"Sagan, > Ginetta, \\"Vietnam‚Äôs Postwar Hell,\\" Newsweek, May 3, 1982, p. 13. =Visitation= As of 1980, official regulations stated that prisoners in the camps could be visited by their immediate family once every three months. Family visits were important not only because of the personal need for prisoners and their loved ones to have contact with each other but also because the families could bring food to their relatives in some of the camps. It has been reported that the prisoners in these camps would not have survived without such food. The duration of the visits was not long, reported by former prisoners to last from 15 to 30 minutes. Moreover, family visits would be suspended for prisoners who broke the rules, and it has also been said that only families who had proven their loyalty to the government were allowed visiting privileges. Most former prisoners who were interviewed have been in between three and five different reeducation camps. It is believed that the movement of prisoners from one camp to another was intended to prevent both the inmates and their relatives from knowing a specific camp's real location. That way, escapes from prison could be prevented, and prisoners' relatives could be prevented from visiting them. The release of prisoners In June 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, in one of its last policy announcements before the official reunification of Vietnam, stated that those in the camps would either be tried or released after three years of imprisonment. But this promise was broken. The policy announced that those still in the camps would stay there for three years, but they would be released early if they made \\"real progress, confess their crimes and score merits\\". Since there were no clear criteria for releasing the inmates from the camps, bribery and family connections with high-ranking officials were more likely to speed up release than the prisoner's good behavior. Released prisoners were put on probation and placed under surveillance for six months to one year, and during that time they had no official status, no exit visas, no access to government food rations and no right to send their children to school. If the progress of the former prisoners was judged unsatisfactory during this period, they could be fired from their jobs, be put under surveillance for another six months to a year, or be sent back to the reeducation camps. Faced with these challenges, many chose to flee the country and became boat people. Some prisoners who had been imprisoned since the Fall of Saigon were released as recently as the year 2000. \\" It also said that some Vietnamese would be brought to trial, including those who deserted the NLF during the war, those who owed \\"many blood debts\\" to the people and those who fled to \\"foreign countries with their U.S. masters.\\" The U.S. government considers re-education camp inmates to be political prisoners. In 1989, the Reagan administration entered into an agreement with the Vietnamese government, pursuant to which Vietnam would free all former ARVN soldiers and officials held in re-education camps and allow them to emigrate to the United States. Thus began the third large influx of Vietnamese immigrants into the country. The Vietnamese American Foundation began a program called \\"The Returning Casualty\\" in early 2006. It attempts to locate the graves of people who died in the camps, identify their remains and deliver them to their loved ones.Excavations of Burial Sites at Vietnamese Re-Education Camps by The Returning Casualty, Julie Martin, MSc in Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology candidate, Cranfield University UK, from southeastasianarchaeology.com  Partial list of camps Lang Da, NW of Hanoi *H·ªèa L√≤ Prison in Hanoi, reported by former prisoner Nguy·ªÖn Ch√≠ Thi·ªán *LƒÉng C√¥, Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø *Unnamed temporary camp, Phu Yen Province * C√† Mau Prison Camp, Tan Anh Camp, Kien Vang Camp, B·∫°c Li√™u Prison Camp, Ganh-Hao Labour Camp, Chi-Lang Camp, Vuon-Dao Camp.

Tribal members are direct lineal descendants of Mdewakanton Dakota people who resided in villages near the banks of the lower Minnesota River. A line of leaders known as Chief Sakpe were spokesmen for their village. The first Sakpe [pronounced Shock-pay], meaning \\"six,\\" was named by his people as such after his wife bore sextuplets. The second Sakpe, also known as the Eaglehead, was one of twin sons of an Ojibwe chief, who gave him to this band so that they might have a leader, and he was adopted by the first Sakpe as his son. He signed several treaties with the US during the 19th century. The City of Shakopee later developed near this site and was named for these prominent leaders. The town of Shakopee was named after Sakpe as well. Tribal government The SMSC is governed by the General Council, consisting of all enrolled SMSC members ages 18 and older. The Business Council consists of three members elected every four years by the General Council. The Business Council is responsible for day-to-day operations of the tribe/reservation and implementing General Council decisions. The present Business Council consists of Chairman Keith Anderson, Vice-Chairman Cole Miller, and Secretary/Treasurer Rebecca Crooks-Stratton. History The Dakota people have lived in the Minnesota River Valley for centuries. Historically they fished in the river, gathered wild rice from river's edge beds, as well as nuts and roots, and hunted game. =Chief Sakpe= Chief Sakpe (Shock-pay), which means \\"number six\\" in the Dakota language, was the name of a line of chiefs of a village in this area. The city of Shakopee later developed near this site and was named for the chiefs. Chief Sakpe I ( 1750 ‚Äì 1827) received the name \\"Sakpe\\" because his wife gave birth to sextuplet boys. Chief Sakpe II () signed the 1851 Treaties with the United States on behalf of the Dakota at Traverse Des Sioux and Mendota; he traveled to Washington, DC to sign the 1858 Treaty on behalf of the Dakota.\\"Minnesota Treaty\\", US-Dakota War website, Retrieved 2013-10-29. Chief Sakpe III (1811‚Äì1865) was a leader during the US-Dakota War of 1862. When the Dakota people were exiled after the war, Sakpe fled to Canada. Later he was turned over to U.S. forces. Reportedly as he was preparing to be hanged on November 11, 1865, he heard a train whistle and said, \\"As the white man comes in, the Indian goes out.\\", US-Dakota War; Retrieved 2013-10-29. =US-Dakota War of 1862= When European-American settlers migrated into their territory in the 1800s, the Dakota people did not have a concept of permanent and exclusive ownership of land. Their conception of land use was that different peoples might live on it and share its resources. The era of settlement in Minnesota was accompanied by the United States forcing the Dakota to cede land forever, diminishing their homeland and their ability to continue their traditional way of life. The new settlers disrupted hunting grounds and restricted fishing on \\"their\\" lands. Unable to hunt, fish and gather resources adequately, the Dakota were forced to depend increasingly on the federal government's promises and provisions, often late or spoiled. The federal government's failure to deliver on these promises brought near-starvation and growing anger among the Dakota. Their resentment broke out in the US-Dakota War of 1862.\\"About\\", US-Dakota War website; Retrieved 2013-10-29. =Mass execution and hardship= The US Army suppressed and defeated the Dakota warriors. It conducted the largest mass execution in United States history, executing by hanging 38 Dakota men in Mankato, Minnesota, on December 26, 1862. The remaining Dakota were forced to walk more than 100 miles to Fort Snelling, where they were held in a concentration camp through the winter. In 1863 Congress rescinded all treaties with the Dakota and ordered their removal from Minnesota. Finally, in 1886, Congress established the Shakopee Mdewakanton Reservation, Prairie Island Indian Community Reservation, Upper Sioux Indian Reservation, and Lower Sioux Indian Reservation for the Dakota who never left Minnesota. But for the next century, life for the Dakota people was one of poverty and hardship.\\"Shakopee Dakota\\", official website; Retrieved 2013-10-29. =Mid-20th century to present: Revitalization= In 1969 the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community gained federal recognition as a tribe. They created a government and developed an economic system. In 1982 the tribe opened Little Six Bingo Palace (later Little Six Casino) after Indian gaming was allowed on reservation lands in states that had gaming laws. In 1992 it opened the Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. These enterprises have generated revenues that the tribe has invested in other economic development, tribal welfare, and philanthropy.

Charitable giving and loans Guided by the Dakota tradition of helpfulness, the SMSC is committed to sharing its resources. The tribe has donated more than $350 million to organizations and causes, and is the single- largest philanthropic benefactor for Indian Country nationally. In 2015, the SMSC launched Seeds of Native Health, a five-year, $11 million campaign that represents the single-largest coordinated philanthropic effort in American history focused on improving Native American nutrition. Launched in 2019, the tribe‚Äôs latest charitable campaign is Understand Native Minnesota, a three- year, $5 million strategic philanthropic initiative to improve the Native American narrative in Minnesota schools. In addition to charitable giving, the tribe has provided $500 million in economic development loans to fellow tribes. The SMSC made a $31 million loan to Red Lake Nation in 2010, and a $27 million loan in 2013, the latter so that the Red Lake Tribe could construct and operate a gaming casino to generate revenues.

Essentially, a company uses income from advertising placed on members' screens to pay them for time spent browsing the web.  Process  A PTS company would provide a smaller program to be installed on a member's computer. Advertisers' banner ads were then displayed while the member was browsing the web. Since the company's Viewbar software tracked websites that the user visited, the PTS company was able to deliver targeted ads for their advertisers. Advertisers paid the company a small amount (typically US$0.50) for every hour of a member's surfing. Members were usually limited on the amount of time per month for which they would be paid to surf (typically 20 hours). However, PTS companies also paid their members for each new user referred to the company (typically US$0.05 - US$0.10 per recruit). Thus, it was profitable for a member to garner as many referrals as possible, encouraging some users to recruit members using spam, though officially forbidden by the user's agreement. Minors, many of whom flocked to these business models as an easy source of income, were required to obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian.  PTS companies  The most well-known PTS company was AllAdvantage. It launched in March 1999 and grew to 13 million members in little over a year with the multi-level marketing system of recruiting new members. The scheme capitalized on the notion that anyone could make money on the internet without much effort. By late 2001, with the dot-com bubble's collapse, very few PTS companies remained. This is not surprising since 100% of the revenue came from internet advertising, which was the area hardest hit. As with many Internet business models, PTS companies attracted people trying to defraud the company out of money. The companies had to deal with spammers, often having to terminate member accounts. Software utilities started appearing which allowed users to simulate surfing activity. Some users even created mechanical mouse-moving devices which ran around their desks (i.e. \\"JiggyMouse\\"). These programs and devices allowed users to get paid simply for leaving their computers on. This began an arms race between the PTS companies who built fraud-prevention software and fraud program developers, with each releasing increasingly sophisticated versions of their software. Today, there are still few surviving PTS companies but these are often rewards-based wherein users are given reward points, which can be exchanged for gifts, when surfing the web or doing tasks such as answering marketing email and shopping at specific stores. Another version rehashed the concept as \\"pay-you-for-your-attention\\" scheme wherein an Internet user is paid in exchange for the surfing interruption or paid in exchange for information about themselves and their Internet habits.

Carl Vilhelm Dencker-Rasmussen, on purchasing the Hacienda, experimented in rubber planting, tobacco growing and rice planting. The rice planting was done at a strategically important time of the year when the rains came. Channels were dug like the rice fields Dencker-Rasmussen had seen in Malaysia many years before, resulting in successful crops.

Bromiley 1997 page 210 In her book The Interior Castle (Mansions 6, Chapter 7) Saint Teresa of Avila defined Christian meditation as follows: > By meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this > way. We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving > us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the > mysteries of His whole glorious life.This Is Your Mother: The Scriptural > Roots of the Rosary by Ronald Walls, 2003 page 4 Gospel of Matthew, c. 1700 Quoting the Gospel of Matthew: \\"No one knows the Father but only the Son and anyone whom the Son wants to reveal him\\" and I Corinthians: \\"But we have received the Spirit who is from God so that we may realize what God has freely given us\\", theologian Hans von Balthasar explained the context of Christian meditation as follows: > The dimensions of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed > his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of his own, and speaking > as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man.... And this > meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus > Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join > in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.Hans Urs von > Balthasar, 1989 Christian meditation Ignatius Press pages 9-10 Building on that theme, E. P. Clowney explained that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The first is that Christian meditation is grounded in the Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the love of God, as in I John : \\"We love, for he first loved us\\". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in praise. Thomas Merton characterized the goal of Christian meditation as follows: \\"The true end of Christian meditation is practically the same as the end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ.\\"Spiritual direction and meditation by Thomas Merton 1960 page 105 While Protestants view salvation in terms of faith and grace alone (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption.Christian spirituality: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath 1999 pages 67-72 Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans that salvation only comes from \\"God that hath mercy\\".Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 page 48 The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 page 27-28 =Role of the Holy Spirit= In Western Christian teachings, meditation is usually believed to involve the inherent action of the Holy Spirit to help the meditating Christian understand the deeper meanings of the Word of God.Lectio Divina by Christine Valters Paintner, Lucy Wynkoop 2008 page 36 In the 12th century, decades before Guigo II's the Ladder of the Monk, one of his predecessors, Guigo I, emphasized this belief by stating that when earnest meditation begins, the Holy Spirit enters the soul of the meditator, \\"turns water into wine\\" and shows the path towards contemplation and a better understanding of God.Carthusian spirituality: the writings of Hugh of Balma and Guigo de Ponte by Hugh of Balma, Guigo de Ponte and Dennis D. Martin (Translator) 1996 pages 184‚Äì187 In the 19th century, Charles Spurgeon affirmed this belief within the Protestant tradition and wrote: \\"The Spirit has taught us in meditation to ponder its message, to put aside, if we will, the responsibility of preparing the message we've got to give. Just trust God for that.\\"Christian spirituality: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath 1999 pages 84-87 In the 20th century, Hans Urs von Balthasar paraphrased this teaching as follows:Hans Urs von Balthasar, 1989 Christian meditation Ignatius Press pages 27‚Äì30 > The vistas of God's Word unfold to the meditating Christian solely through > the gift of the Divine Spirit. How could we understand what is within God > and is disclosed to us except through the Spirit of God who is communicated > to us? As a biblical basis for this teaching, von Balthasar referred to 1 Corinthians 2:9-10: \\"these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God\\".: =Distinction from non- Christian meditation= A monk walking in a Benedictine monastery Christian meditation is generally held to be distinct from the styles of meditations performed in Eastern religions (such as Buddhism) or in the context of the New Age.How to pray by Elmer L. Towns 2006 page 178Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 pages 7‚Äì13 While other types of meditation may suggest approaches to disengage the mind, Christian meditation aims to fill the mind with thoughts related to Biblical passages or Christian devotions.Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Donald S. Whitney 1997 Chapter 3, Part2: Meditating on God's Word Although some mystics in both the Western and Eastern churches have associated feelings of ecstasy with meditation, (e.g. St. Teresa of Avila's legendary meditative ecstasy),A history of Christian spirituality: an analytical introduction by Urban Tigner Holmes, 2002 page 98An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 page 311 St. Gregory of Sinai, one of the originators of Hesychasm, stated that the goal of Christian meditation is \\"seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, beyond the minor phenomenon of ecstasy\\".Encyclopedia of Christian Theology, Volume 1 edited by Jean-Yves Lacoste 2004 page 695 Modern Christian teachings on meditation at times include specific criticism of the transcendental styles of meditation, e.g. John Bertram Phillips stated that Christian meditation involves the action of the Holy Spirit on Biblical passages and warned of approaches that \\"disengage the mind\\" from scripture.Exploring Psalms by John Phillips, 2002 page 19 According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of oriental meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with discussions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 page 12 Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. According to Clowney it is the search for wisdom, not ecstasy, that marks the path of Christian meditation, a wisdom sought in the \\"Christ of Scripture and the Scripture of Christ\\".Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 page 29 A 1989 document generally known as Aspects of Christian meditation set forth the position of the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation.Vatican website: Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation (in German), October 15, 1989EWTN: Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation (in English), October 15, 1989Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions by Wayne Teasdale 2004 Page 74 The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self- absorption. Some authors, however, have emphasized similarities between Christian meditation and non-Christian meditation. Psychologist Daniel Goleman gives an overview of many styles of meditation in The Varieties of the Meditative Experience, and includes a section on what he believes are key commonalities (as well as differences); he argues that all share the goal of the cultivation of attention.Daniel Goleman, The Varieties of Meditative Experience. New York: Tarcher. . p. 104-113. Thomas Merton, an American Catholic monk, believed Christianity had forsaken its mystical tradition in favor of Cartesian emphasis on rationality and concepts.Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander p. 285. Eastern traditions, for Merton, were mostly untainted by this type of thinking and thus had much to offer in terms of how to think of and understand oneself. Having studied the Desert Fathers and other Christian mystics, Merton found many parallels between the language of these Christian mystics and the language of Zen philosophy.Solitary Explorer: Thomas Merton's Transforming Journey p. 105. This said, Merton felt non-Christian religions had little or nothing to contribute in terms of doctrine. Old Testament references In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: hƒÅg√¢ (), which means to sigh or murmur, but also to meditate, and s√Æ·∏•√¢ (), which means to muse, or rehearse in one's mind. When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, hƒÅg√¢ became the Greek melete which emphasized meditation's movement in the depth of the human heart. Melete was a reminder that one should never let meditation be a formality. The Latin Bible then translated hƒÅg√¢/melete into meditatio.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 page 88 The Bible mentions meditate or meditation 23 times, 19 times in the Book of Psalms alone. When the Bible mentions meditation, it often mentions obedience in the next breath. An example is the Book of Joshua: \\"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success..\\" History During the Middle Ages, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.Globalization of Hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer: Contesting Contemplation by Christopher D. L. Johnson 2010 pages 31‚Äì38Reading with God: Lectio Divina by David Foster 2006 page 44 The four movements of Lectio divina: read, meditate, pray, contemplate The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 pages 38‚Äì39 Guigo II's book The Ladder of Monks is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 pages 207‚Äì208 In Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of \\"constant prayer\\" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book The Ladder of Divine Ascent by the 7th century.Orthodox Church: Its Past and Its Role in the World Today by John Meyendorff 1981 page These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century. The methods of \\"methodical prayer\\" as taught by the Devotio Moderna group in northern Europe had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century.Teresa of Avila's autobiography by Elena Carrera 2004 page 28 The book The Imitation of Christ which was known in Spain as Contemptus mundi became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied. Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina. By the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had also been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, some components of meditation had started to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.Reading to live: the evolving practice of Lectio divina by Raymond Studzinski 2010 pages 188‚Äì195 However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century. In 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution Dei verbum (Latin for Word of God), emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of Dei verbum in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.Vatican website Address at the 40th anniversary of DEI VERBUM, Friday, 16 September 2005 Approaches to meditation A number of saints and historical figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, with the goal of knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues to be used in the Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453 by Donald MacGillivray Nicol 2008 page 211 =St. Ignatius of Loyola= The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), the founder of the Jesuits, contain numerous meditative exercises. To this day, the Spiritual Exercises remain an integral part of the Novitiate training period of the Roman Catholic religious order of Jesuits.The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola by St Ignatius Loyola 2007 page 15 The exercises are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through an experience of Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with a consideration of the purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.2000 Years of Prayer by Michael Counsell 2004 page 203 The exercises often involve imagery in which one enters a biblical scene. For example, the practitioner is encouraged to visualize and meditate upon scenes from the life of Christ, at times asking questions from Christ on the cross, during crucifixion.Ignatius de Loyola, powers of imagining 1986 by Antonio T. de Nicol√°s, pages 123-125 =St. Teresa of Avila= Saint Teresa of Avila depicted by Rubens, 1615. She is often considered one of the most important Christian mystics.An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 page 413 St. Teresa of √Åvila (1515-1582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative prayer for periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa believed that no one who was faithful to the practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul.Spiritual direction and meditation by Thomas Merton 1960 page 108 Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.Teresa of Avila by Rowan Williams 1991 page vii St. Teresa taught her nuns to meditate on specific prayers. Her prayers described in The Way of Perfection involve meditation on a mystery in the life of Jesus and are based on the faith that \\"God is within\\", a truth that Teresa said she learned from St. Augustine.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 page 96 In her Life, she wrote that she taught herself from the instructions given in the book, The Third Spiritual Alphabet - by Francisco de Osuna - which relates to Franciscan mysticism.Teresa of Avila: The Book of My Life by Tessa Bielecki, Mirabai Starr 2008 page 20An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 pages 413-415Teresa of Avila by Rowan Williams 1991 page 4 Her starting point was the practice of \\"recollection\\", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In The Way of Perfection she wrote: \\"It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God\\".The Way of Perfection by St Teresa of Avila 2007 page 160 She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to remind her to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.Teresa, a woman: a biography of Teresa of Avila by Victoria Lincoln 1995 page xviiTeresa of Avila by Rowan Williams 1991 page 66Teresa of Avila: The Progress of a Soul by Cathleen Medwick 2001 page 64 St. Theresa viewed Christian meditation as the first of four steps in achieving \\"union with God\\", and used the analogy of watering the garden. She compared basic meditation to watering a garden with a bucket, Recollection to the water wheel, Quiet (contemplation) to a spring of water and Union to drenching rain. Early studies on states of consciousness by Roland Fischer found evidence of mystical experience in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila.Roland Fischer (1971), A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States. In Science, Vol 174 Num 4012 26 November 1971 In her autobiography she writes that, at the peak of a praying experience \\"... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place\\".Saint Teresa, The Life of Saint Teresa, J.M. Cohen, Transl. (Penquin, Baltimore, 1957), p. 142. This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, \\"Devotion of Ecstasy\\", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer. =Saint Francis de Sales= Saint Francis de Sales Saint Francis de Sales (1576-1622) used a four-part approach to Christian meditation based on \\"preparation\\", \\"consideration\\", \\"affections and resolutions\\" and \\"conclusions\\":An introduction to Christian spirituality by F. Antonisamy, 2000 pages 77-78 * In the preparation part, one places oneself in the presence of God and asks the Holy Spirit to direct the prayer, as in the Epistle to the Romans: \\"The Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words.\\" * In the consideration part, one focuses on a specific topic, e.g. a passage from the Bible. * In the affections and resolutions part, one focuses on feelings and makes a resolution or decision. For instance, when meditating on the Parable of the Good Samaritan one may decide to visit someone sick and be kind to them. * In the conclusion part, one gives thanks and praise to God for the considerations and asks for the grace to stand by the resolution. =Other approaches= John Main OSB (1926-1982) was a Benedictine monk and priest who presented a way of Christian meditation which used a prayer-phrase or mantra. This approach was then used by groups which then become the World Community for Christian Meditation.Jesus: The Teacher Within by Laurence Freeman, 2001 page 24 By denomination =Catholic Church= Saint Padre Pio stated: \\"Through the study of books one seeks God; by meditation one finds him\\".The Rosary: A Path Into Prayer by Liz Kelly 2004 pages 79 and 86 Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274) said that meditation is necessary for devotion, and the Second Vatican Council called for \\"faithful meditation on God's word\\" as part of the spiritual formation of seminarians.The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults by Donald W. Wuerl, Ronald Lawler 2004 page 350 Saint John of the Cross (1542‚Äì1591), a close friend of St. Teresa of Avila, viewed Christian meditation as a necessary step toward union with God, and wrote that even the most spiritually advanced persons always needed to regularly return to meditation.St. John of the Cross: an appreciation by Daniel A. Dombrowski 1992 page 168 The Catechism of the Catholic Church encourages meditation as a form of prayer: \\"Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking\\" (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing union with God, it states: \\"Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him\\" (#2708).Catechism of the Catholic Church by David Bordwell 2002 pages 570‚Äì615 Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724). Eucharistic meditation Eucharistic adoration and meditation, Cathedral of Chihuahua, Mexico Christian meditation performed with Eucharistic adoration outside the context of the Mass has inspired extensive Catholic writing and inspirational literature, especially since the 18th century. The Eucharistic meditations of Saints Pierre Julien Eymard and Jean Vianney (both promoters of the Eucharist) were published as books.The Real Presence: Eucharistic Meditations by Saint Pierre Julien Eymard, Sentinel Press, 1938 ASIN B00087ST7QThe Eucharistic Meditations of the Cur√© d'Ars by Saint Jean Baptiste Marie Vianney Carmelite Publications (1961) ASIN B0007IVDMYEucharistic Meditations: Extracts from the Writings and Instructions of Saint John Vianney by H.

I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel Similarly, in her book Eucharist: True Jewel of Eucharistic Spirituality, Maria Candida of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on Eucharistic meditation.Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac by Matthew Bunson 2008 page 255Vatican Website Rosary meditations Meditation is an integral part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries.Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion by John D. Miller 2002 page 200 The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large.William M. Johnston, Encyclopedia of monasticism, Volume 1, 2000 page 246 By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.Music in the collective experience in sixteenth-century Milan by Christine Suzanne Getz, 2006 page 261 Saint Teresa of Avila's meditative approach of focusing on \\"the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son\\" can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations. In his 2002 encyclical Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II placed the rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality.The Rosary with John Paul II by George Madore, 2004, Alba House, page 18 Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or \\"transfigured\\", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us and for us.The Rosary with John Paul II by George Madore, 2004, page 19 and stated that: \\"To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ.\\"Rosarium Virginis Mariae, #3 =Eastern Christianity= Simonopetra monastery on Mount Athos During the Byzantine Empire, between the 10th and 14th centuries, a tradition of prayer called hesychasm developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present. St. Gregory of Sinai is considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer. This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the 'Jesus Prayer') giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches. \\"While some might compare it [hesychastic prayer] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose. One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary. Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition.\\" Rather, it is to be in the spirit of a true mantra. This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by Barlam in Calabria, but was defended by Saint Gregory Palamas. Coming from hesychia (\\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\\"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Churches of the Byzantine Rite.Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity page 230 Hesychasm has not gained significance in neither the Western Christian Churches nor the Oriental Christian Churches.OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history by Matthew Bunson 2004 page 433 In hesychasm, the Jesus prayer, consisting of the phrase: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me\\" is repeated either for a set period of time or a set number of times. Hesychasm is contrasted with the more mental or imaginative forms of Christian meditation in which a person is encouraged to imagine or think of events from the life of Jesus or sayings from the Gospel. Sometimes hesychasm has been compared to the meditative techniques of oriental religions and it is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and Sufis, but this has not been proven.An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches by John Binns 2002 page 128  See  Christian meditation music * Christian contemplation * Daily devotional * Prayer, meditation and contemplation in Christianity * The Cloud of Unknowing Notes  External links World Community for Christian Meditation *Center for Action and Contemplation *The Interior Castle by St. Teresa of Avila online (CCEL) *Instructions on Meditation & Guided Meditations by the Saints *Contemplative Outreach - Thomas Keating OCSO *The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola (tr.

It is the sequel to the 1996 Team Fortress mod for Quake and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic. It was released in October 2007 as part of The Orange Box video game bundle for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 version followed in December 2007 when The Orange Box was ported to the system. Later in development, the game was released as a standalone title for Windows in April 2008, and was updated to support Mac OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013. It is distributed online through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with Electronic Arts handling all physical and console ports of the game. The player can join one of two teams, RED or BLU, and choose one of 9 character classes to battle in game modes such as capture the flag and king of the hill. Development of the game was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the developers of the original Team Fortress mod. Team Fortress 2 was first announced in 1998 under the name Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms. Initially, the game had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed over the protracted nine-year development. After Valve released no information for six years, Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News annual vaporware list among other ignominies. The finished Team Fortress 2 has cartoon-like visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, Video summary (WMV, 75.4MB) and uses Valve's Source game engine. Team Fortress 2 received critical acclaim for its art direction, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a multiplayer-only game. Valve continues to release new content in the form of submissions made through the Steam Workshop. In June 2011, it became free-to-play, supported by microtransactions for in-game cosmetics. A 'drop system' was also added and refined, allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive game equipment and items by use of a random number generator. Though the game had an unofficial competitive scene for many years, both support for official competitive play through ranked matchmaking and an overhauled casual experience were added in July 2016.  Gameplay  A group of RED players attack a BLU base on the map \\"cp_well\\" In Team Fortress 2, two teams compete for a combat-based objective. In the game's storyline, the teams are composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names of these companies: Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a team-based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon. The game was released with six official maps, although over 100 maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including competitive remakes of older maps and community-assembled maps. When players choose a gamemode for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, the \\"Administrator\\", a woman voiced by Ellen McLain, announces various game events over loudspeakers. The player limit is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On the PC, in 2008 Valve updated the game to include a server variable that allows up to 32 players. Team Fortress 2 is the first of Valve's multiplayer games to provide detailed statistics for individual players. They include: time spent playing as each class, most points obtained, most captures or objectives achieved in a single life, and many other things. Persistent statistics tell the player how he or she is improving in relation to these statistics, such as if a player comes close to his or her record for the damage inflicted in a round. Team Fortress 2 also features numerous \\"achievements\\" for carrying out certain tasks, such as scoring a certain number of kills or completing a round within a certain time. New sets of class-specific achievements have been added in updates, which add new abilities and weapons to each class once unlocked by the player. This unlockable system has since been expanded into a random-chance system, where the player can also obtain the items simply by playing the game. = Game modes =  Core modes  Team Fortress 2 contains five core game modes. * Attack/Defend is a timed game mode that has the BLU team capturing RED control points. This amount of control points varies from map to map, and must be captured by the BLU team in respective order. Once a control point is captured by the BLU team, it cannot be re-captured by the RED team. The RED team's job is to prevent the BLU team from capturing all the control points before the time limit ends. Once a point is captured, the time limit will extend. * Capture the Flag is a mode which revolves around the BLU and RED teams attempting to steal and capture the opposing team's flag, represented in-game as an intelligence briefcase. At the same time, both teams must defend their own intelligence. When the intelligence is dropped by the carrier either dying or dropping it manually, it will stay on the ground for 1 minute before returning to its original location if it is not picked up again. The intelligence can only be carried by the opposing team. The first team to capture the enemy's intelligence three times wins. * Control Points is a timed game mode where there are several control points placed around the map, with 3 or 5 control points in total depending on the map. These are referred to as \\"3CP\\" and \\"5CP,\\" respectively. For a team to win, they must capture all the control points within the time limit. The time limit is extended on the capture of a control point by either team. The game will start off with only the middle control point being available for capture, with the other control points belonging to their respective teams. Once this middle control point is captured, a team can begin capturing the other points in order. To capture a control point, a player must stand on it for a certain amount of time without being interrupted by an opposing team member. This process can be sped up by more players on one team capturing a single point. * King of the Hill is a timed game mode that contains a single control point that can be captured by both RED and BLU. Upon the capture of the control point, a team-specific counter starts counting down and stops upon being captured by the opposing team. The first team to have their timer count down to 0 wins. * Payload is a timed game mode where the BLU team must push a cart containing a large bomb along a track, with the RED team preventing the cart from reaching their base. Payload maps have multiple \\"checkpoints\\" along the track. Once these checkpoints are captured, they may change a team's spawn room to be closer to that checkpoint. Capturing a checkpoint will also increase the time limit. To push the cart, the BLU team must stay within the range of the cart, which dispenses health continuously and ammo every few seconds. Pushing becomes an easier task with more BLU players pushing the cart, but the speed cannot be increased further with more than 3 BLU players pushing it. If the cart is not pushed by the BLU team for 20 seconds, it will begin to move back to the last captured checkpoint, where it will stop. To stop the cart from being pushed, the RED team must also be within the cart's range. The RED team wins by preventing the cart from reaching the final checkpoint within the time limit.  Alternative modes  There are several alternative game modes in Team Fortress 2. These modes consist of a small amount of maps and detach from the core game modes in some way. * Payload Race, like Payload, has the main objective being to push a cart to a final checkpoint. However, both the RED and BLU teams are fighting to push their cart to the final checkpoint. Unlike Payload, there is only one checkpoint at the end of the track and there is no timer. The team to reach their checkpoint first wins. * Territory Control consists of several capture points spread out across a single map. Like Control Point each point can be captured by either the RED or BLU teams. Unlike Control Point only two points are accessible at a single time, upon a team's successful capture of a point the \\"stage\\" ends and the accessible capture points change. When a team only has control of a single control point they are blocked from capturing the opposing team's control point, and the team must wait until the time limit is up and the accessible capture points change. A team wins by capturing all the control points. * Special Delivery is like Capture the Flag, but there is only one briefcase that can initially be picked up by either the RED or BLU team. Upon a team picking up the briefcase, the opposing team is now unable to pick the briefcase up until it has stayed on the ground for 45 seconds and respawned at its original location. A team wins by holding the briefcase on a loading platform until they reach the top of the platform. * Arena is a special game mode in which players do not re- spawn upon death. A team can win either by eliminating all opposing players, or by claiming a single capture point that opens after a certain time has elapsed. * Mannpower is a mode similar to Capture the Flag in which players have access to a grappling hook and assorted power-ups laid around the map that grant unique abilities. * Player Destruction is a unique game mode in which a player's death causes a pickup to appear. The first team to collect a set number of pickups and deliver them to a drop-off point wins the game. The player on each team with the most pickups is highlighted for everyone to see, and gains passive healing for him/herself and any nearby teammates. * PASS Time is a unique game mode inspired by rugby, developed by Valve, Bad Robot Interactive, and Escalation Studios. To win each team must score five goals or have the most goals at the end of the timer. To score a goal, a single ball, the \\"jack\\", can be picked up and thrown. * Medieval is a variation on the Attack/Defend game mode in which players may use only melee weapons and medieval-themed items.  Special modes  Mann vs Machine (MvM) is a cooperative game mode where players must defend their base from waves of robots modelled after all the nine playable classes, and slow-moving tanks carrying bombs. Robots and tanks drop credits upon their death, which players can use to buy upgrades for themselves or their weapons. The players win upon successfully defending their base from the bomb until the last wave. A paid version of this game mode called \\"Mann Up\\" is also available, where players buy tickets to play \\"tours\\", with the chance to win unique cosmetics and weapon skins upon completion. There also exists a Training mode and a Practice mode. Training mode exists to help new players get acquainted with basic controls, and teaches them the basics of four of the nine classes. It uses wooden dummies and bots to teach players. Practice mode is just like any other multiplayer match, but only consists of the player and bots. The number of bots, their difficulty, and the map can all be adjusted to a player's preference, though not all the maps are available in training. Since 2009, there is typically also a Halloween-themed variation on one or more of the above modes during the weeks around the holiday, with maps or modes updated to include themed decorations and often a more difficult challenge to the players. For example, Halloween 2012 included an extremely difficult Mann vs. Machine round involving destroying more than 800 enemy forces. Due to popular demand of the Halloween events, Valve added Full Moon, the ability to play these events on the few days around the full moon throughout the year, and later Eternaween, the ability for players to vote to play the themed events for a two-hour block at any other time. = Classes and characters = From left to right: Pyro, Engineer, Spy, Heavy, Sniper, Scout, Soldier, Demoman, and Medic Team Fortress 2 features nine playable classes, categorized into the roles \\"Offense\\", \\"Defense\\", and \\"Support\\". Each class has strengths and weaknesses and must work with other classes to be efficient, encouraging strategy and teamwork. Each class has at least three weapons: a unique primary weapon, a common or unique secondary weapon, and a unique melee weapon.  Offense  The Scout (Nathan Vetterlein) is a cocky, fast-talking American baseball fan and street runner from Boston, Massachusetts, who practiced running to \\"beat his mad dog siblings to the fray.\\" He is a fast, agile character, who is armed by default with a scattergun, a pistol, and an aluminum baseball bat. The Scout can double jump and counts as two people when capturing control points and pushing payloads. * The Soldier (Rick May) is a jingoistic American military man hailing from the Midwest (despite the fact that he was never actually in the Army), the Soldier is armed by default with a rocket launcher, shotgun, and a folding shovel. He is both the second- slowest class in the game and the class with the second-highest health (after the Heavy Weapons Guy). The Soldier can use his rocket launcher to rocket jump to higher positions at the cost of some health. * The Pyro (Dennis Bateman) is a person of unknown gender or origin, clad in a fire-retardant suit and a voice-muffling gas mask. By default, the Pyro is armed with a homemade flamethrower that can set players on fire, a shotgun, and a fire axe. The Pyro's flamethrower can also produce a blast of compressed air that knocks away nearby enemies and projectiles, and extinguishes burning teammates.  Defense  The Demoman (Gary Schwartz) is a black Scottish, one-eyed alcoholic from Ullapool, Scotland. Armed by default with a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher, and a glass bottle of scrumpy, the Demoman can use his explosives to provide indirect fire and set traps. The Demoman, much like the Soldier with his rocket launcher, is capable of using his sticky bomb launcher to \\"sticky jump\\" at the cost of some health. * The Heavy Weapons Guy, or simply the Heavy, (Schwartz) is a large Russian from the Dzhugdzhur Mountains of the USSR, heavy in stature and accent, and obsessed with firepower. Though he is the slowest class, he can sustain and deal immense amounts of damage. His default weapons consist of an enormous minigun that he affectionately refers to as \\"Sasha\\", a shotgun, and his fists. * The Engineer (Grant Goodeve) is an American, relaxed, and intellectual \\"good ol' boy\\" from Bee Cave, Texas. The Engineer can build structures to support his team: a sentry gun for defending key points, a health and ammunition dispenser, and a pair of teleporter modules (one entrance and one exit). The Engineer's default weapons are a standard shotgun, a pistol, and a wrench that he can use either as a melee weapon or to speed up the construction on buildings created by him or other Engineers. He has separate PDAs that must be used in order to construct and destroy his buildings.  Support  The Medic (Robin Atkin Downes) is a German doctor from Stuttgart with little regard for the Hippocratic Oath. He has no long-range weapons, but is equipped with a \\"Medigun\\" emitter that can restore health to injured teammates and gradually build \\"√úberCharge\\" power with repeated use. At full capacity, the √úberCharge grants boosts that include temporary invulnerability to the Medic and his patient and a large increase in the damage inflicted by the patient's weapons. The Medic is also equipped with an air-powered syringe gun and bonesaw for situations in which he must fight without his teammates' protection. He keeps doves as pets, one of which is named Archimedes. * The Sniper (John Patrick Lowrie) is an eccentric New Zealand ocker-style character raised in the Australian outback, equipped by default with a laser-sighted sniper rifle to shoot enemies from afar, with the potential to cause severe damage or an instant kill depending on how he aims and fires. By default, he also carries a submachine gun and a kukri for close combat. * The Spy (Bateman) is a French covert operative whose equipment is designed for stealth and infiltration, including a cloaking device disguised as a watch, an electronic sapper used to sabotage and destroy enemy Engineers' buildings, and a device hidden in his cigarette case that enables him to disguise himself as enemy players. He does not carry any long-range weapons, but is armed with a revolver and a butterfly knife, able to use the latter to instantly kill enemies by stabbing them in the back or side. He is the only character who does not wear any clothing in his team's bright color or a patch denoting his specialty, instead preferring a balaclava, business suit, necktie, and gloves in muted team-color hues.  Non-playable characters  Other characters include the Administrator (voiced by Ellen McLain), an unseen announcer who provides information about time limits and objectives to players, and her assistant Miss Pauling (Ashly Burch). The cast has expanded with Halloween updates, including the characters of Merasmus, the Bombinomicon, the Horseless Headless Horsemann, Monoculus, and the Mann Brothers (all voiced by Nolan North). In the video announcement for the \\"Jungle Inferno\\" update, Mann Co. CEO Saxton Hale is voiced by JB Blanc. = Competitive play = Team Fortress 2 is played competitively, through multiple leagues. The North American league, ESEA, supports a paid Team Fortress 2 league, with $42,000 in prizes for the top teams in 2017. Team Fortress 2 is played competitively in many formats, such as Highlander (nine players per team, one of each class), 7v7 and 6v6. While formalized competitive gameplay is very different from normal Team Fortress 2, it offers an environment with a much higher level of teamwork than in public servers. Most teams use voice chat to communicate, and use a combination of strategy, communication, and aiming ability to win against other teams. Community-run competitive leagues also tend to feature restrictions such as item bans and class limits. These leagues are often supported by Valve via in-game medals, which are submitted on the Steam Workshop, and announcements on the official blog. In April 2015, Valve announced that a dedicated competitive mode would be added to Team Fortress 2, utilizing skill-based matchmaking; closed beta testing began in the following year. The competitive mode was added in the \\"Meet Your Match\\" update, released on July 7, 2016. Ranked matches are played six-vs-six, with players ranked in thirteen tiers based on win/losses and an assessment of their skills. Ranked matchmaking will balance players based on their tiers and rating. A similar matchmaking approach has been added for casual games for matches of 12-vs-12 players. In order to join competitive matchmaking, players must have associated their Steam account with the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, as well as having a Team Fortress 2 \\"premium account\\", which is unlocked by either having bought the game before it went free-to-play or by having made an in-game item purchase since.  Development  = Origins and early development = The original Team Fortress was developed by Robin Walker and John Cook as a free mod for the 1996 PC game Quake. In 1998, Walker and Cook were employed by Valve, which had just released its first game, Half- Life. Valve began developing Team Fortress 2 as a standalone retail game using Valve's GoldSrc engine. In 1999, Valve released Team Fortress Classic, a port of the original Team Fortress, as a free Half-Life mod. Team Fortress Classic was developed using the publicly available Half-Life software development kit as an example to the community and industry of its flexibility. Team Fortress 2 originally featured a realistic visual style In contrast to the original Team Fortress, Valve originally planned Team Fortress 2 to have a modern war aesthetic. It would feature a command hierarchy including a Commander class, parachute drops over enemy territory, networked voice communication, and numerous other innovations. The Commander class played similarly to a real- time strategy game, with the player viewing the game from a bird's-eye perspective and issuing orders to players and AI-controlled soldiers. Team Fortress 2 was first shown at E3 1999, where Valve showcased new technologies including parametric animation, which blended animations for smoother, more lifelike movement, and Intel's multi-resolution mesh technology, which dynamically reduced the detail of distant on-screen elements to improve performance. The game earned several awards including Best Online Game and Best Action Game. In mid-2000, Valve announced that Team Fortress 2 had been delayed for a second time. They attributed the delay to development switching to an in-house engine, the Source engine. Following the announcement, Valve stopped releasing information about Team Fortress 2 and the game entered six years of silent development. Walker and Cook worked on various other Valve projects; Walker was project lead on Half-Life 2: Episode One and Cook became a Steam developer. Team Fortress 2 became a prominent example of vaporware, a long-anticipated game that had seen years of development, and was often mentioned alongside another much-delayed game, Duke Nukem Forever. Walker later stated that Valve built \\"three to four\\" different versions of Team Fortress 2 before settling on their final design. Shortly before the release of Half-Life 2 in 2004, Valve's marketing director Doug Lombardi confirmed that Team Fortress 2 was still in development. Valve reintroduced Team Fortress 2 at the July 2006 EA Summer Showcase event with a drastically different visual design. = Final design = Departing from the realistic visual design of Valve games such as Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, Team Fortress 2 features a cartoon-like visual style influenced by 20th-century commercial illustrations and the artwork of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, achieved through Gooch shading. The game debuted with the Source engine's new dynamic lighting, shadowing and soft particle technologies alongside Half-Life 2: Episode Two. It was the first game to implement the Source engine's new Facial Animation 3 features. Valve abandoned the realistic style when it became impossible to reconcile it with the unrealistic gameplay, with opposing armies having constructed elaborate bases directly next to each other. The Commander class was abandoned as players would simply refuse to follow the player's orders. Valve designed each character, team, and equipped weapon to be visually distinct, even at range; for example, the coloring draws attention to the chest area, bringing focus on the equipped weapon. The voices for each of the classes were based on imagining what people from the 1960s would expect the classes to have sounded like, according to writer Chet Faliszek. The map design has an \\"evil genius\\" theme with archetypical spy fortresses, concealed within inconspicuous buildings such as industrial warehouses and farms to give plausibility to their close proximities; these bases are usually separated by a neutrally themed space. The bases hide exaggerated super weapons such as laser cannons, nuclear warheads, and missile launch facilities, taking the role of objectives. The maps have little visual clutter and stylized, almost impressionistic modeling, to allow enemies to be spotted more easily. The impressionistic design approach also affects textures, which are based on photos that are filtered and improved by hand, giving them a tactile quality and giving Team Fortress 2 its distinct look. The bases are designed to let players immediately know where they are. RED bases use warm colors, natural materials, and angular shapes, while BLU bases use cool colors, industrial materials, and orthogonal shapes. = Release = During the July 2006 Electronic Arts press conference, Valve revealed that Team Fortress 2 would ship as the multiplayer component of The Orange Box. A conference trailer showcasing all nine of the classes demonstrated for the first time the game's whimsical new visual style. Managing director of Valve Gabe Newell said that the company's goal was to create \\"the best looking and best-playing class- based multiplayer game\\". A beta release of the entire game was made on Steam on September 17, 2007, for customers who had pre-purchased The Orange Box, who had activated their Black Box coupon, which was included with the ATI HD 2900XT Graphics cards, and for members of Valve's Cyber Caf√© Program. The beta continued until the game's final release. The game was released on October 10, 2007, both as a standalone product via Steam and at retail stores as part of The Orange Box compilation pack, priced at each gaming platform's recommended retail price. The Orange Box also contains Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal. Valve offered The Orange Box at a ten percent discount for those who pre-purchased it via Steam before the October 10 release, as well as the opportunity to participate in the beta test. = Post-release = Since the release of Team Fortress 2, Valve has continually released free updates and patches through Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux users; though most patches are used for improving the reliability of the software or to tweak gameplay changes, several patches have been used to introduce new features and gameplay modes, and are often associated with marketing materials such as comics or videos offered on the Team Fortress 2 website; this blog is also used to keep players up to date with the ongoing developments in Team Fortress 2. As of July 2012, each class has been given a dedicated patch that provides new weapons, items, and other gameplay changes; these class patches typically included the release of the class's \\"Meet the Team\\" video. Other major patches have included new gameplay modes including the Payload, Payload Race, Training, Highlander, Medieval, and Mann vs. Machine modes. Themed patches have also been released, such as a yearly Halloween-themed event called \\"Scream Fortress\\", where players may obtain unique items available only during a set period around the holiday. Other new features have given players the ability to craft items within the game from other items, trade items with other players, purchase in-game items through funds in Steam, and save and edit replay videos that can be posted to YouTube. Valve has released tools to allow users to create maps, weapons, and cosmetic items through a contribution site; the most popular are added as official content for the game. This approach has subsequently created the basis for the Steam Workshop functionality of the software client. In one case, more than fifty users from the content-creation community worked with Valve to release an official content update in May 2013, with all of the content generated by these players. Valve reported that as of June 2013, over $10 million has been paid back to over 400 community members that have helped to contribute content to the game, including a total of $250,000 for the participants in the May 2013 patch. To help promote community-made features, Valve has released limited-time events, such as the \\"Gun Mettle\\" or \\"Invasion\\" events in the second half of 2015, also including the \\"Tough Break\\" update in December 2015, in which players can spend a small amount of money which is paid back to the community developers for the ability to gain unique items offered while playing on community-made maps during the event. Development of the new content had been confirmed (but later quietly cancelled) for the Xbox 360, while development for the PlayStation 3 was deemed \\"uncertain\\" by Valve. However, the PlayStation 3 version of Team Fortress 2 received an update that repaired some of the issues found within the game, ranging from graphical issues to online connectivity problems; this update was included in a patch that also repaired issues found in the other games within The Orange Box. The updates released on PC and planned for later release on Xbox 360 include new official maps and game modes, as well as tweaks to classes and new weapons that can be unlocked through the game's achievement system. The developers attempted to negotiate with Xbox 360 developer Microsoft to keep the Xbox 360 releases of these updates free, but Microsoft refused and Valve announced that they would release bundles of several updates together to justify the price. Because of the cost of patching during the seventh generation of video game consoles, Valve has been unable to provide additional patches to the Xbox 360 version since 2009, effectively cancelling development of the console versions. On June 10, 2010, Team Fortress 2 was released for OS X, shortly after the release of Steam for OS X. The release was teased by way of an image similar to early iPod advertising, showing a dark silhouette of the Heavy on a bright green background, his Sandvich highlighted in his hand. Virtual earbuds, which can be worn when playing on either OS X or Windows once acquired, were given to players playing the game on OS X before June 14, though the giveaway period was later extended to August 16. On November 6, 2012, Valve announced the release of Team Fortress 2 for Linux as part of a restricted beta launch of Steam on the platform. This initial release of Steam and Team Fortress 2 was targeted at Ubuntu with support for other distributions planned for the future. Later, on December 20, 2012, Valve opened up access to the beta, including Team Fortress 2, to all Steam users without the need to wait for an invitation. On February 14, 2013, Valve announced the full release of Team Fortress 2 for Linux. From then to March 1, anyone who played the game on Linux would receive a free Tux penguin, which can be equipped in-game. Team Fortress 2 was announced in March 2013 to be the first game to officially support the Oculus Rift, a consumer-grade virtual reality headset. A patch will be made to the client to include a \\"VR Mode\\" that can be used with the headset on any public server. In April 2020, source code for 2018 versions Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive leaked online. This created fears that malicious users would use the code to make remote code execution software and attack servers or players' computers. Several fan projects halted development until the impact of the leak could be determined. Valve confirmed the legitimacy of the code leaks, but stated they do not believe it affects servers and clients running the latest official builds of either game. On May 1, 2020, a few weeks after the death of the voice actor of the Soldier, Rick May, Valve released an update to Team Fortress 2, adding a tribute to his voicework as the Soldier in the form of a new main menu theme (a rendition of Taps), as well as statues of the Soldier saluting, added to most of the official in-game maps. These statues all feature a commemorative plaque dedicated to May and lasted through the end of the month.  Trading  In Team Fortress 2 players can trade with other users for items such as weapons, cosmetics, taunts, weapon skins, and utilities. Weapons and utilities can change and affect gameplay in different ways, the main being that some weapons have different stats than others and thus allow a different play style. Cosmetic items, on the other hand, do not change gameplay at all and simply change an in-game character's appearance. In late 2011, the gaming site Kotaku reported that the Team Fortress 2s trading economy was worth over $50 million. Additionally, many of the individual items have reached immense levels of real-world value, with one character hat in particular being sold for over AU$24,000 (over US$18,000). Third-party websites have been set up to help users trade, as well as track the value of the many in-game items within the Team Fortress 2 economy. Crate keys, crafting metal, and Earbuds (an in-game cosmetic item) have all been used as currency for other items such as weapons, cosmetics, and taunts due to their values. On July 25, 2019, a bug was accidentally left in an update for the game that guaranteed players an unusual hat, one of the rarest types of items in the game that a user would normally have a 1% chance of getting if they unboxed a crate, if they unboxed certain older series of crates. This damaged the in-game economy, causing unusual hats able to be unboxed from these crates to drop tremendously in value. The incident has been nicknamed \\"The Crate Depression\\" by fans, as a pun on \\"crate\\" and the Great Depression. Valve patched this bug the next day, as well as temporarily blocking users who unboxed any unusual hats using the exploit from trading them. They later announced in an official statement on August 2, 2019 that the first unusual hat unboxed using the exploit by any user will become tradable, while any other unusual hats the user unboxed with the exploit would be permanently untradable and only usable by the user who unboxed them.  Free-to-play  The logo for the in-game company, Mann Co. On June 23, 2011, Valve announced that Team Fortress 2 would become free to play. Unique equipment including weapons and outfits would be available as microtransactions through the in-game store, tied through Steam. Walker stated that Valve would continue to provide new features and items free. Walker stated that Valve had learned that the more players Team Fortress 2 had, the more value it had for each player. The move came a week after Valve introduced several third-party free- to-play games to Steam and stated they were working on a new free-to-play game. Within nine months of becoming free to play, Valve reported that revenue from Team Fortress 2 had increased by a factor of twelve.  Marketing  Valve released promotional videos introducing the in-game characters. Shown here is the Scout's video. To promote the game, Valve released a ten-video advertisement series, \\"Meet the Team\\", starting in May 2007. Constructed using the game engine and using slightly more detailed character models, the series consists of short videos on individual characters, displaying their personalities and tactics. The videos are usually interspersed with clips of the character in combat in the game. The manners which these are presented have varied drastically: the first installment, \\"Meet the Heavy\\", depicted an interview with the gun-obsessed Russian, while \\"Meet the Soldier\\" showed the Soldier giving a misinformed lecture on Sun Tzu, a master combatant who supposedly \\"invented [fighting]\\" (a story further confused with the story of Noah and his Ark) to a collection of severed heads as if to raw recruits. The videos are generally released through Valve's services, though in one notable exception, the \\"Meet the Spy\\" video was leaked on YouTube during the \\"Sniper vs. Spy\\" update week. The \\"Meet the Team\\" videos are based on the audition scripts used for the voice actors for each of the classes; the \\"Meet the Heavy\\" script is nearly word-for-word a copy of the Heavy's script. More recent videos, such as \\"Meet the Sniper\\", contain more original material. The videos have been used by Valve to help improve the technology for the game, specifically improving the facial animations, as well as a source of new gameplay elements, such as the Heavy's \\"Sandvich\\" or the Sniper's \\"Jarate\\". The final video in the Meet the Team series, \\"Meet the Pyro\\", was released on June 27, 2012. Newell has stated that Valve is using the \\"Meet the Team\\" shorts as a means of exploring the possibilities of making feature film movies themselves. He believes that only game developers themselves have the ability to bring the interesting parts of a game to a film, and suggested that this would be the only manner through which a Half-Life-based movie would be made. A fifteen-minute short, \\"Expiration Date\\", was released on June 17, 2014. The shorts were made using Source Filmmaker, which was officially released and has been in open beta as of July 11, 2012. In more recent major updates to the game, Valve has presented teaser images and online comic books that expand the fictional history of the Team Fortress 2, as part of the expansion of the \\"cross-media property\\", according to Newell. In August 2009, Valve brought aboard American comic writer Michael Avon Oeming to teach Valve \\"about what it means to have a character and do character development in a comic format, how you do storytelling\\". \\"Loose Canon\\", a comic associated with the Engineer Update, establishes the history of RED versus BLU as a result of the last will and testament of Zepheniah Mann in 1890, forcing his two bickering sons Blutarch and Redmond to vie for control of Zepheniah's lands between them; both have engineered ways of maintaining their mortality to the present, waiting to outlast the other while employing separate forces to try to wrest control of the land. This and other comics also establish other background characters such as Saxton Hale, the CEO of Mann Co., the company that provides the weapons for the two sides and was bequeathed to one of Hale's ancestors by Zepheniah, and the Administrator, the game's announcer, that watches over, encourages the RED/BLU conflict, and keeps each side from winning. The collected comics were published by Dark Horse Comics in Valve Presents: The Sacrifice and Other Steam-Powered Stories, a volume along with other comics created by Valve for Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead, and released in November 2011. Cumulative details in updates both in-game and on Valve's sites from 2010 through 2012 were part of a larger alternate reality game preceding the reveal of the Mann vs. Machine mode, which was revealed as a co-op mode on August 15, 2012. Valve had provided other promotions to draw players into the game. Valve has held weekends of free play for Team Fortress 2 before the game was made free-to-play. Through various updates, hats and accessories can be worn by any of the classes, giving players an ability to customize the look of their character, and extremely rare hats named \\"Unusuals\\" have particle effects attached to it are and are only obtainable through opening \\"crates\\" or trading with other players. New weapons were added in updates to allow the player to choose a loadout and play style that best suits them. Hats and weapons can be gained as a random drop, through the crafting/trading systems, or via cross- promotion: Limited-edition hats and weapons have been awarded for pre-ordering or gaining Achievements in other content from Steam, both from Valve (such as Left 4 Dead 2 and Alien Swarm) or other third-party games such as Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, Worms Reloaded, Killing Floor, or Poker Night at the Inventory (which features the Heavy class as a character). According to Robin Walker, Valve introduced these additional hats as an indirect means for players to show status within the game or their affiliation with another game series simply by visual appearance. The Red Pyro, Heavy, and Spy all function as a single playable character in the PC release of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. The game's first television ad premiered during the first episode of the fifth season of The Venture Bros. in June 2013, featuring in-game accessories that were created with the help of Adult Swim.  Reception  Team Fortress 2 received widespread critical acclaim, with overall scores of 92/100 \\"universal acclaim\\" on Metacritic. Many reviewers praised the cartoon- styled graphics, and the resulting light-hearted gameplay, and the use of distinct personalities and appearances for the classes impressed a number of critics, with PC Gamer UK stating that \\"until now multiplayer games just haven't had it.\\" Similarly, the game modes were received well, GamePro described the settings as focusing \\"on just simple fun\\", while several reviewers praised Valve for the map \\"Hydro\\" and its attempts to create a game mode with variety in each map. Additional praise was bestowed on the game's level design, game balance and teamwork promotion. Team Fortress 2 has received several awards individually for its multiplayer gameplay and its graphical style, as well as having received a number of \\"game of the year\\" awards as part of The Orange Box. Although Team Fortress 2 was well received, its removal of class-specific grenades, a feature of previous Team Fortress incarnations, was controversial amongst reviewers. IGN expressed some disappointment over this, while conversely, PC Gamer UK approved, stating \\"grenades have been removed entirely‚Äîthank God\\". Some further criticism came over a variety of issues, such as the lack of extra content such as bots (although Valve has since added bots in an update), problems of players finding their way around maps due to the lack of a minimap, and some criticism of the Medic class being too passive and repetitive in his nature. The Medic class has since been re-tooled by Valve, giving it new unlockable weapons and abilities. With the \\"Gold Rush Update\\" in April 2008, Valve had started to add fundamentals of character customization through unlockable weapons for each class, which continued in subsequent updates, most notably the \\"Sniper vs. Spy Update\\" in April 2009, which introduced unlockable cosmetic items into the game. Further updates expanded the number of weapons and cosmetics available, but also introduced monetization options, eventually allowing it to go free- to-play. To this end, Team Fortress 2 is considered one of the first games to offer games as a service which would become more prevalent in the 2010s.

This design accommodates the AAR coupler. Energy-absorbing buffer stop in France This buffer stop is designed to move up to to slow down an passenger train from without damaging the train or injuring passengers. A buffer stop or sand drag on the Montreal Metro Bumper at the end of a newer tunnel in the Toronto subway system beyond a terminal station A buffer stop, bumper, bumping post, bumper block or stopblock (US), is a device to prevent railway vehicles from going past the end of a physical section of track. The design of the buffer stop is dependent, in part, on the kind of couplings that the railway uses, since the coupling gear is the first part of the vehicle that the buffer stop touches. The term \\"buffer stop\\" is of British origin, since railways in Great Britain principally use buffer-and-screw couplings between vehicles.  Types  Several different types of buffer stop have been developed. They differ depending on the type of coupler used and on the intended application. * Buffer stops with anticlimbers. These are particularly important for passenger railway applications, because the anticlimbers prevent telescoping of the railroad cars during a head-on impact. * Buffer stops for a knuckle coupler or an SA3 coupler (centrally positioned between the two rails) * Buffer stops with traditional \\"buffers\\" on either side * Hydraulic buffer stops * Friction buffer stops (bolted down to the rail) If there is extra room behind the bumper block, there is usually a sand or ballast drag that is designed to further retard a runaway train. One such accident occurred when a Northern City Line train powered past the bumper block at Moorgate station in 1975 on the London Underground system. = Energy-absorbing = Largely because of its mass, a train transfers an enormous amount of kinetic energy in a collision with a buffer stop. Rigid buffers can safely cope only with very low-speed impacts (i.e., nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or friction. Following a buffer stop accident at Frankfurt am Main in 1902, the Rawie company developed a large range of energy-absorbing buffer stops. Similar hydraulic buffer stops were developed by Ransomes & Rapier in the UK. = Dowty retarders = When it is desired to slow or stop moving trains, without erecting a solid buffer stop, dowty retarders may be employed. They press upwards against the wheels, and may optionally be turned off as required.  Examples  Raja Trains Depot in Tehran  Stopping speed:  Stopping distance: . = Wheel stop = Wheel stops or car stops are used to stop small numbers of light vehicles at the end of level storage tracks or to chock individual vehicles on shallow grades.

The Upper Sioux Indian Reservation is located in Minnesota Falls Township along the Minnesota River in eastern Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, south of Granite Falls. It was created in 1938 when of land were returned to the tribe by the federal government, under the Indian Reorganization Act encouraging tribal self- government. As of the 2000 census, the reservation recorded a resident population of 57 persons. Its land area is currently . The tribe operates the Prairie's Edge Casino Resort. Every August, the Upper Sioux community holds its Pejhutazizi Oyate traditional wacipi (pow-wow).\\"Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota\\", Our Story: Minnesota; Accessed 14 September 2013 History This reservation was originally established for the Wahpeton and Sisseton bands of the Upper Dakota. Under the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux of 1851 with the United States, it encompassed an area about wide and long along the Minnesota River. Following the Dakota War of 1862, the federal government punished the Dakota by drastically reducing the sizes of two reservations along the river, in an attempt to force the Dakota out of the area. Many of the people did move westward, past the Mississippi River, and many of their descendants live on reservations in South Dakota. In 1938 the federal government returned of land to the tribe, who were mostly landless, under the Indian Reorganization Act of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. It also encouraged tribes to revive their self-government. =Termination efforts= A decade later, the federal government began to promote the Indian termination policy, to end recognition of tribes they thought could successfully assimilate to mainstream society. Such termination would allocate their communal lands among individual households and end federal benefits associated with federal recognition. This policy was followed by the US government from the 1940s to the 1960s. The Department of Interior issued a memo dated 19 January 1955 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) indicating that terminations were being reviewed in proposed legislation for four Indian communities of southwestern Minnesota, including the Lower Sioux Community in Redwood and Scott counties, the New Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County, the Prairie Island Community in Goodhue County, and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County. Discussions between the BIA and the Indians in the identified tribes had begun in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Although the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements to divide communal lands into plots with individual land ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed tribal lands being divided under fee-simple title. On 26 January 1955, US Senator Edward Thye introduced a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the named tribes. In addition to resistance within the tribes, non-Native American residents of the area opposed termination, as they realized state expenditures might increase to accommodate services to those who would be classified as new residents, and they expressed their opposition to the committee reviewing the bill. The Minnesota Governor's Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would \\"not adequately protect the interests of the Indians...\\" The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.

It is part of the Bismarck Range and the peak is the point where three provinces, Simbu, Jiwaka and Madang, meet. The peak is also known as Enduwa Kombuglu, or Kombugl'o Dimbin, in the local Kuman. The mountain is on the island of New Guinea, which incorporates Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian province of Papua. It is surpassed by Puncak Jaya, , and several other peaks in Indonesian Papua. Mount Wilhelm may be considered the highest mountain in Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand). A Seven Summits list may therefore sometimes include Mount Wilhelm. History =Discovery= Mount Wilhelm received its name in 1888 when a German newspaper correspondent, Hugo Z√∂ller, climbed the Finisterre Range, south-east of Madang, and named the Bismarck Range after the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, and the four highest peaks of the range after him and his children: Ottoberg, Herbert-berg, Marienberg and Wilhelm-berg. Otto-berg seemed to Z√∂ller to be the highest of the range, but it was later discovered to be only and the distant Wilhelmberg was much taller. It was not until August 1938 when Leigh Vial, a government patrol officer, and two Niu Ginians, his \\"Mangi mastas\\", \\"Namba Wan Bare Kuakawa\\" (Kugl'kane) and \\"Gend\\" (\\"Mondia Nigle\\"), made the first recorded ascent. It was noted by Vial that even though the mountain was close to the equator, snow existed on top of the mountain at the time of ascent. =WWII bomber crash= A wing from the wreckage of a US Air Force plane that crashed into Mount Wilhelm During the Second World War in the early hours of May 22, 1944, an American F-7A (a converted B-24 Liberator) named \\"Under Exposed\\" crashed into the mountain while flying too low. The aircraft left from Nadzab airbase, close to Lae, and had been assigned for a reconnaissance mission to photograph Padaidori Island in Dutch New Guinea. Around 0400 the plane crashed into Wilhelm at about above the twin lakes. All crew were killed and most of the wreckage landed in the topmost lake although some can still be seen today. The only remains at the site are from the plane, as all bodies have been recovered. =Climbing deaths= A number of people have died trying to climb the mountain. An Australian Army Sergeant, Christopher Donnan, died in December 1971 when he fell down a steep slope. There is a plaque at the point where he was last seen. In August 1995 an Israeli backpacker died after he sprained his ankle and stayed behind while his group continued. He subsequently wandered off the track and fell into a ravine in the pre-dawn darkness. His body was found about a week later. On July 30, 2005, 58-year-old Bob Martin, a marketing manager at Air Niugini, suffered a heart attack and died near the summit.TPA Monthly Newsletter Update ISSUE 17 - July - August 2005 In 2001, a student from Muaina High School (Muaina High school Mt Wilhelm Expedition) died at Piunde-foot of Mt Wilhelm. He was later found to be an asthmatic patient. Another, local Papua New Guinean, from Tari in the Southern Highlands Province, died in 2007 a few meters south of the Christopher Donnan plaque. Local sources revealed that the deceased was unaware of the warning and was wearing only his sporting suit, T-shirt and Dunlop shoes. He was covered by debris and fallen rock fragments, forming a talus at the base of the southern tip of the Christopher Donnan section.  Ascending  Dawn breaking on top of Mount Wilhelm NASA Landsat image of Mount Wilhelm Mount Wilhelm is the most accessible mountain to climb in Papua New Guinea. Climbers have a choice of two different routes to the top. The most common route starts from the village of Keglsugl at the end of the road from Kundiawa in Simbu province. A harder hike and climb starts from the village of Ambullua in Western Highlands province. The Keglsugl route involves climbing up and through a mountain rain forest and then along an alpine grassland glacial valley to the twin lakes of Piunde and Aunde. At Piunde there are two huts, one being an old Australian National University monitoring station and the other an 'A-Frame' hut. Though not a technical climb, various sections can be treacherous in wet weather. The climb is usually started during the night; the ascent and subsequent descent can take anywhere from nine to 24 hours. Reaching the peak at dawn allows a better chance of clear weather. The other route from Ambullua is a much more challenging 4-day hike.

On 4 September 2012, Hammond was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, with responsibility for buses, rail and shipping. He lost his ministerial post in the reshuffle on 15 July 2014 and was succeeded by Claire Perry. He became Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party for London on 20 July 2017 and was sacked the following 16 December after participating in a Brexit rebellion against the government of Theresa May three days earlier. Hammond was however appointed to be a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Care on 16 November 2018, following the promotion of Stephen Barclay to the position of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. On 3 September 2019, he had the whip removed after voting for a bill ruling out leaving the European Union without a deal. However, on 29 October he was one of ten Conservative MPs to have the whip restored.https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-29/whip-restored-to-10-conservative- mps-who-rebelled-against-government-over-brexit/ Early life and business career Hammond was born in Southampton and privately educated at the city's King Edward VI School before reading Economics at Queen Mary University of London. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree, he began a career in finance at a leading fund management house and subsequently worked for major investment banks. Hammond was appointed a Director of the Equities division of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in 1994 and four years later joined Commerzbank Securities. In 2000 he was promoted to Director, Pan European Research, with responsibility for seventy professionals based in London and across Europe. Political career Hammond first stood for Parliament for North Warwickshire at the 1997 general election, being comfortably defeated by Labour's Mike O'Brien. Contesting Wimbledon in 2001 general election, he failed to regain what had been a safe seat for the Conservatives before Labour's 1997 landslide and was defeated by the Labour incumbent, Roger Casale. He was elected a councillor for the Village ward in the London Borough of Merton election in 2002 and subsequently became Deputy Leader of the Conservative Group on Merton Council. Hammond was the successful parliamentary candidate for Wimbledon at the 2005 general election, gaining a 7.2% swing to the Conservatives. In December 2005, David Cameron, then the new Conservative Leader, appointed him as Shadow Minister for Transport on the Opposition front bench. On 6 May 2010, Hammond was reelected as the MP for Wimbledon. Following that election, Hammond became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. On 4 September 2012, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. He was removed from that post following a Cabinet reshuffle in July 2014. In 2012, Hammond was the subject of a parliamentary investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose investments in Harwood Film partnership, a legal investment scheme which permitted the deferral of tax payments, in the Register of Members' Interests. He subsequently apologised for the \\"oversight\\" in not registering the financial interest but was cleared of any wrongdoing. In 2013, Hammond consistently voted in favour of allowing same-sex couples to marry.https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11927/stephen_hammond/wimbledon/divisions?policy=6686 Following the confidence and supply arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP after 2017 general election, Hammond promised to stand up and protect LGBT and Women‚Äôs rights from any potential dilution.https://www.stephenhammond.net/news/agreement-dup In 2019, he voted to extend abortion and same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11927/stephen_hammond/wimbledon/divisions?policy=6686 In December 2014, Hammond assumed a second job as an adviser to Inmarsat; he was cleared to do so by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. He had been criticised earlier that year for having been the fourth most frequent user of ministerial chauffeur-driven \\"top up\\" cars, at 138 uses per year, during his time in office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. Hammond had previously criticised Ken Livingstone in the House of Commons for setting up companies to reduce his tax bill. The Daily Telegraph subsequently alleged that Hammond had sought to avoid tax by registering the ownership of his Portuguese villa through an offshore-registered company, which his lawyers described as a \\"normal\\" arrangement that \\"did not result in tax benefits for him or his wife\\". The article about Stephen Hammond on Wikipedia was one of a number edited in May 2015 by computers owned by Parliament in what The Daily Telegraph described as \\"a deliberate attempt to hide embarrassing information from the electorate.\\" The deleted information concerned his frequent use of chauffeur-driven cars while in government. Hammond announced in early 2016 that he would wait until Cameron's renegotiations before endorsing either a Remain vote or a Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. On 14 June 2016, he endorsed a vote to remain in the European Union. On 13 December 2017, Hammond was involved in a rebellion against the government of Theresa May in which the government suffered a defeat on a key Brexit vote about granting MPs a 'meaningful vote' in Parliament. He was subsequently dismissed as the Conservative party vice-chairman over the incident. In the 2019 Conservative leadership election, Hammond endorsed Matt Hancock's bid for the party leadership. Hammond lost the party whip during the September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs. Despite this, he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the next general election. Hammond was reelected at the 2019 general election with a much reduced majority. = Summer-born campaign = In Parliament, Hammond has been an advocate of giving summer-born and premature children the right to start school a year later, to give them extra time for development. In October 2015 he held an adjournment debate on this issue, arguing that \\"summer-born children can suffer from long-term development issues and a lag in educational standards\\". and highlighting the inconsistent treatment of these children by Councils. In response, Nick Gibb MP, the Minister of State for Schools, set out plans in a letter to all schools to change the school admissions code to allow summer-born children to start reception class at the age of 5. In October 2016, Hammond held another adjournment debate on this topic, urging the Government to take action more quickly and to provide a timetable for the changes. Personal life Hammond has been married to Sally Hammond since 1991. The couple live in Wimbledon Park with two pets and they have one daughter. He employs his wife as his Office Manager on an annual salary of over ¬£45,000. Hammond, a keen sportsman, used to play hockey for a National League team and for his county.

Maynard Gwalter Krebs is the \\"beatnik\\" sidekick of the title character in the U.S. television sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, which aired on CBS from 1959 to 1963. The Krebs character, portrayed by actor Bob Denver, begins the series as a stereotypical beatnik, with a goatee, \\"hip\\" (slang) language, and a generally unkempt, bohemian appearance. He is always banging out a modern jazz beat with his hands, to music in his head, and he also plays jazz pianoseason 1 many episodes and bebop trumpet.season 2 episode 1 His abhorrence of conventional social forms is signified by comical reactions to three words: \\"work\\", \\"marriage\\", and \\"police\\". For example, whenever the word \\"work\\" is mentioned, even in passing, he yelps \\"Work?!\\" and jumps with fear or even faints. He serves as a foil to the well-groomed, well- dressed, strait-laced Dobie, who also hates to work, and the contrast between the two friends provides much of the humor of the series. By the third season of Dobie Gillis, Maynard becomes less of the stereotypical beatnik and more a free soul who \\"does his own thing,\\" as he might say‚Äîincluding collecting tinfoil or petrified frogs, seeing the old Endicott Building get torn down and going to see the movie The Monster That Devoured Cleveland, which perpetually ran at the Central City Bijou throughout the entire series run. In one episode, he invites Dobie to accompany him to a double-feature of the film and its sequel, Son of the Monster that Devoured Cleveland. Maynard may be described as the prototype of the late-1960s hippie. Many of the later episodes center around Maynard, with Dobie more of an observer, but always as narrator.

It participated in battles on both the Eastern and Western Fronts.Reynolds P.3-312 The division was activated in December 1942.Reynolds P.1 Many of the men of the division were young German conscripts, with a cadre of NCOs and staff from the SS Division Leibstandarte and other Waffen SS divisions.Reynolds P.2 Hohenstaufen took part in the relief of German forces in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket, the Normandy battles, Operation Market Garden, the Ardennes Offensive and Operation Spring Awakening.Reynolds P.4,90,262 The division surrendered to the United States Army on 8 May 1945, at Steyr.Windrow & Burn, p.15 Formation and Eastern Front The SS Division Hohenstaufen was formed, along with its sister formation 10th SS Division Frundsberg, in France in February 1943. The division was mainly formed from Reich Labour Service conscripts. Originally, Hohenstaufen was designated as a Panzergrenadier division, but in October 1943 it was upgraded to Panzer division status, with an estimated manpower of about 19,000. At its formation, Hohenstaufen was commanded by SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Bittrich. The title Hohenstaufen came from the Hohenstaufen dynasty, a German noble family who produced a number of kings and emperors in the 12th and 13th centuries AD.DiNardo, p.37 After the encirclement of General Hans- Valentin Hube's 1st Panzer Army in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket in Ukraine, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein requested that the Hohenstaufen and Frundsberg divisions be sent to attempt to link up with the encircled force.Ripley, pp. 181‚Äì182 Arriving in late March 1944, the divisions were formed into the II SS Panzer Corps and were sent into the attack near the town of Tarnopol.Ripley, p. 182 In three days of combat, the Hohenstaufen destroyed 74 Soviet tanks, 84 self propelled assault guns, 21 anti tank guns, and 12 mortars.Reynolds P.11 After heavy fighting in the season of rasputitsa (\\"roadlessness\\"), the division effected a link-up with Hube's forces near the town of Buchach. The division's actions helped prevent the encirclement of the 1st Panzer Army. During these battles, Hohenstaufen had suffered 1,011 casualties.Reynolds P.12 The II SS Panzer Corps was to act as reserve for Army Group North Ukraine. After the Allied invasion of northern France on 6 June 1944, the II SS Panzer Corps, including Hohenstaufen, was sent west on 12 June, to defend Caen in Normandy. Western Front =Normandy= Hohenstaufen suffered losses from Allied fighter bombers during its move to Normandy, delaying its arrival until 26 June 1944.Reynolds P.17 Approximately 50% of the division's tanks broke down during its movement to Normandy. The division's armored forces would be reinforced by the newly attached 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. This would provide Hohenstaufen with 127 additional combat vehicles including 79 Panther tanks. The original plan for Hohenstaufen to attack towards the Allied beachhead was made impossible by a British offensive to take Caen. The II SS Panzer Corps was instead put into the line to support the weakened forces defending Caen, where Hohenstaufen suffered 1,891 casualties.Reynolds P.43 On 10 July, the division was pulled back into reserve, to be replaced by the 277th Infantry Division. The division's depleted Panzergrenadier regiments were eventually merged to form Panzergrenadier Regiment Hohenstaufen. The division saw much action defending against British armour during Operation Goodwood.Reynolds P.52 During Operation Jupiter Hohenstaufen destroyed 58 British tanks with many of them being Churchill tanks.Reynolds P.48,49 After the launch of the Canadian Operation Totalize, Hohenstaufen avoided encirclement in the Falaise pocket and kept the narrow escape route from this pocket open. By 21 August, the Battle of Normandy was over, and the German forces were in full retreat. Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Walter Harzer was placed in command of the division. It fought several rearguard actions during the retreat through France and Belgium and in early September 1944, the exhausted formation was pulled out of the line for rest and refit near the Dutch city of Arnhem. By this time, Hohenstaufen was down to approximately 7,000 men, from 15,900 at the end of June. Soldiers ride a Sturmgesch√ºtz III through the streets of Arnhem shortly after Market Garden =Arnhem= Upon arriving in the Arnhem area, the majority of the remaining armoured vehicles were loaded onto trains in preparation for transport to repair depots in Germany. On Sunday, 17 September 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market-Garden, and the division fought in the Battle of Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division was dropped in Oosterbeek, to the west of Arnhem. Only the division's reconnaissance battalion, equipped mostly with wheeled and half tracked vehicles, was ready for action. Members of the 9. SS Div. captured by British forces after the Battle of Arnhem Bittrich ordered Hohenstaufen to occupy Arnhem and secure a vital metal girder bridge (later torn down, rebuilt in concrete and named John Frost Bridge).Reynolds P.66-81 The division encountered stiff resistance from the British Rote Teufeln (Eng. \\"Red Devils\\") 1st Airborne Division.Reynolds P.67 The Reconnaissance Battalion, a 40-vehicle unit commanded by Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Viktor Eberhard Gr√§bner, was sent south over the bridge to scout the area around Nijmegen.Reynolds P.72 The bridge had already been captured by the Germans. Meanwhile, Colonel John Frost's 2nd Battalion of the British 1st Airborne Division had advanced into Arnhem and prepared defensive positions at the northern end of the bridge. They destroyed Gr√§bner's unit, which lost 12 vehicles out of 22 in the assault and around 70 men killed, including Gr√§bner. In all, the British 1st Airborne Division suffered 7,167 casualties out of 10,095 men.Reynolds P.77 This action is depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far. =Ardennes Offensive= After the battle of Arnhem, Hohenstaufen moved to Paderborn for a much-needed rest and refit. On 12 December 1944, the division moved south to the Munstereifel. It was to act as a reserve for Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army, a part of the Ardennes offensive (Unternehmen: Wacht am Rhein). The 6th Panzer Army was to attack in the north, along the line St. Vith‚ÄìVielsalm. Initially, only the divisional reconnaissance and artillery units were involved in the fighting but on 21 December, the entire division was committed. The 9th SS Division tried to breakthrough defensive positions of the 82nd Airborne Division but failed.LoFaro G., ‚ÄúThe Sword of St. Michael: The 82nd Airborne Division in World War II‚Äù 2011, p. 481 When the attack in the north stalled, the division was sent south to assist in the attacks on Bastogne, where it took heavy casualties from the American defenders and lost much of its equipment to Allied ground attack aircraft. On 7 January 1945, Hitler called off the operation and ordered all forces to concentrate around Longchamps, Belgium. Hungary and surrender Throughout the rest of January 1945, Hohenstaufen retreated to the German border. At the end of the month, the division was transferred to the Kaifenheim-Mayen area to be refitted. At the end of February, the division was sent east to Hungary as a part of the reformed 6th SS Panzer Army under Sepp Dietrich. The division, along with the majority of the SS Panzer units available, was to take part in Operation Spring Awakening, the offensive near Lake Balaton, which was aimed at relieving the forces encircled in Budapest by the Red Army.Reynolds P.262-277 The attack got under way on 6 March 1945. Due to the condition of the roads, the division had not reached its jump-off position when the attack began. A combination of mud and stiff Soviet resistance brought the offensive to a halt and on 16 March a Soviet counter-offensive threatened to cut off the 6th SS Panzer Army. Hohenstaufen was involved in the fighting to escape the Soviet encirclement.Reynolds P.284-285 During these actions, Hohenstaufen destroyed 80 Soviet T-34 and IS tanks. On 1 May, the greatly depleted division was moved west to the Steyr‚ÄìAmstetten area. On 8 May 1945, Hohenstaufen surrendered to the Americans.

He is famous for his work on Bronze Age sites around the Mediterranean, such as Tiryns and Hisarlik (the site of the legendary city of Troy), where he continued Heinrich Schliemann's excavations. Like Schliemann, D√∂rpfeld was an advocate of the historical reality of places mentioned in the works of Homer. While the details of his claims regarding locations mentioned in Homer's writings are not considered accurate by later archaeologists, his fundamental idea that they correspond to real places is accepted. Thus, his work greatly contributed to not only scientific techniques and study of these historically significant sites but also a renewed public interest in the culture and the mythology of Ancient Greece. Life He was born in Barmen, Rhenish Prussia, the son of Christine and Friedrich William D√∂rpfeld. His father, a convinced Evangelist Christian and a famous pedagogue, tried to bestow deep religious sentiment to his family so D√∂rpfeld attended religious schools, where he received basic education in Latin and Greek. He graduated from Barmer High School in 1872, the year after his mother died. In 1873, D√∂rpfeld enrolled in architectural studies in Berlin, into the famous Academy of Architecture (Bauakademie). At the same time, he started to work for the Bergisch-Maerki industrial company. His father could not finance his studies and so his sister, Anna, lent him money. During holiday breaks, D√∂rpfeld worked for the Rheine railway company, drawing sketches of buildings and different architectural objects. D√∂rpfeld graduated with honours in 1876. In 1877, D√∂rpfeld became an assistant at the excavations of Ancient Olympia, Greece, conducted under Richard Bohn, Friedrich Adler, and Ernst Curtius. He later became the technical manager of the project. The group uncovered, among other artifacts, an intact statue of Hermes by Praxiteles. The excavations revived the memory of the ancient Olympic Games and contributed toward the establishment of the modern Olympic Games, in 1896. After his return from Olympia, D√∂rpfeld intended to take his architectural exam and settle down in Berlin. He needed a permanent source of income, as he prepared for the family life. In February 1883, he married Anne Adler, the daughter of his university professor Friedrich Adler. The couple had three children. Around the same time, he met Heinrich Schliemann, who persuaded him to join his archaeological expedition. In 1882, D√∂rpfeld joined Schliemann, who was then excavating Troy. The two eventually became good friends and continued their collaboration on other projects as well. They excavated in Tiryns, from 1884 to 1885, and at Troy again from 1888 to 1890. D√∂rpfeld also excavated at the Acropolis of Athens from 1885 to 1890, where he unearthed the Hekatompedon temple (the pre-Classical Parthenon). He continued excavations at Pergamon (1900‚Äì1913, with Alexander Conze) and in 1931 in the Agora of Athens. In 1886, D√∂rpfeld founded the German School of Athens, which was later named after him, as the D√∂rpfeld Gymnasium. From 1887 to 1912, he was the director of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. He published, in 1896, Das griechische Theater, the first study of Greek theatre construction. After his retirement in 1912, D√∂rpfeld engaged in numerous academic debates on different archaeological topics. For example, in the mid-1930s, he took part in a celebrated debate with American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor on the nature of configuration of the three phases of the Parthenon. At the beginning of the 1920s, he started to lecture at the University of Jena but was not satisfied with teaching as a profession and so returned to Greece. D√∂rpfeld died in 1940 on the island of Lefkada, Greece, where he had a house, believing that the bay of Nidri on the eastern coast of Lefkada was the historical Ithaca, home of Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey. Work The \\"Treasury of Atreus\\" is the most impressive of the \\"tholos\\" tombs at Mycenae He developed a method of dating archaeological sites by the strata in which objects were found and the type of materials used for the buildings. He corrected many of Schliemann's previous conclusions, including the shaft burial sites at Mycenae. D√∂rpfeld realized that the site was a \\"tholos\\" tomb, not the \\"Treasury of Atreus\\", as Schliemann claimed. During the Kavvadias's excavations, D√∂rpfeld was instrumental in correcting the previous belief that the temple of Athena, destroyed by the Persians in 480 BCE, was not beneath the Parthenon but to the north of it. He suggested the three different structures were built in the same place and spoke thus of Parthenon I, Parthenon II, and Parthenon III, applying the last term to the temple which is now there. Besides suggesting the existence of the two previous proto- Parthenons, he was able to reconstruct the dimensions of their ground plans. After Schliemann's death in 1890, his widow hired D√∂rpfeld to continue from where Schliemann had stopped in his excavations of Troy. D√∂rpfeld found nine separate cities, one atop the other, at the Hisarlik site. He argued that the sixth was the legendary Troy because it was larger than the first five cities and had high limestone walls, surrounding the city. D√∂rpfeld also found evidence for his claims in Mycenaean pottery, which he found in the same strata. Modern archaeologists, however, think that Homer wrote about Troy VII instead. Map of Homer's Ithaca according to D√∂rpfeld's theory D√∂rpfeld spent a lot of time and energy trying to prove that Homer's epics were based on historical facts. He proposed that the bay of Nidri, on the eastern coast of Lefkada, was Ithaca, home of Odysseus. D√∂rpfeld compared several passages from the Odyssey to the actual geographical location of Lefkada, and he concluded that it must be the Homeric Ithaca. He was especially convinced by the passage: :I dwell in shining Ithaca. There is a mountain there, :high Neriton, covered in forests. Many islands :lie around it, very close to each other, :Doulichion, Same, and wooded Zacynthos‚Äî :but low-lying Ithaca is farthest out to sea, :towards the sunset, and the others are apart, towards the dawn and sun. :It is rough, but it raises good men.\\" Homer, Odyssey 9.1: Lefkada is connected today to Mainland Greece by a causeway and floating bridge, but in ancient times, it was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land, making it a peninsula rather than an island. The strip of land was cut through by the Corinthians in the 7th century BCE. Modern geographers and hydrographers, however, have claimed that ancient Lefkada was an island. They noted that the causeway that connects it to the mainland today is a recent product of silting in the channel and so Lefkada may have experienced varying degrees of connection with the mainland over the last few thousand years. D√∂rpfeld may have believed that Lefkada was a freestanding island (or was regarded as such) at the time of Homer‚Äôs descriptions, in accordance with the above passage. D√∂rpfeld may also have felt that the difficulty of crossing the narrow causeway was referred to in Homer's enigmatic and repeated jest, \\"For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot\\".Homer, Odyssey 14.190, \\"did he come hither on foot\\" (passage from Odyssey) 16.59 16.224. In 1912-1914, D√∂rpfeld obtained permission from the King of Greece to excavate the area of Kardaki Temple, because it was part of the King's vacation home of Mon Repos. D√∂rpfeld published his results in two brief notes without illustrations in the Arch√∂ologischer Anzeiger. He also excavated the Temple of Hera in Corfu. Legacy He was one of the seminal figures in classical archaeology. His stratigraphic method of dating archaeological sites, based on the strata in which objects were found and the type of building materials, remains at the core in archaeological site analyses. His excavations, however, had many flaws, and his seeking to prove that Homer based his Odyssey on real places was rather romantic. His fellow archaeologists remarked that he overemphasised the importance of buildings in the dating of sites and often neglected less visible artifacts, such as pottery. D√∂rpfeld, however, remains known as one who brought much order and integrity into archaeology, and one who saved many archaeological sites from Schliemann's reckless excavations.

Thus, a parallel cousin is the child of the father's brother (paternal uncle's child) or of the mother's sister (maternal aunt's child), while a cross-cousin is the child of the mother's brother (maternal uncle's child) or of the father's sister (paternal aunt's child). Where there are unilineal descent groups in a society (i.e. matrilineal and/or patrilineal), one's parallel cousins on one or both sides will belong to one's own descent group, while cross-cousins will not (assuming descent group exogamy).  Role  A chart showing family members in relation to a particular Subject (black triangle). The role of cross-cousins is especially important in some cultures. For example, marriage is promoted between them in the Iroquois system. Parallel cousins are occasionally the subject of promoted marriage, such as the preferential marriage of a male to his father's brother's daughter, common among some pastoral peoples. Such a marriage helps keep property within a lineage. On the other hand, parallel cousin unions in some cultures would fall under an incest taboo, since parallel cousins are part of the subject's unilineage whereas cross-cousins are not.  Kinship terminologies  In many \\"classificatory\\" systems of kinship terminology, relatives far beyond genealogical first cousins are referred to using the terms for parallel and cross-cousins. And in many societies, parallel cousins (but not cross-cousins) are also referred to by the same terms that are used for siblings. For instance, it is characteristic of the \\"Iroquois\\" system of kinship terminology, its variants the \\"Crow\\" and \\"Omaha\\", and most Australian Aboriginal systems, that a male parallel cousin is referred to as \\"brother\\", and a female parallel cousin is \\"sister\\". In an Iroquois type of terminology, if the terms used to refer to cross-cousins are assimilated to those for other relatives, it is generally in-laws (since marriage with cross-cousins is often preferentially favored), so that the terms for \\"male cross-cousin\\" and \\"brother-in-law\\" are the same, as are the terms for \\"female cross-cousin\\" and \\"sister-in-law\\". The remaining types of kinship terminology (the \\"Hawaiian\\", \\"Eskimo\\" and \\"Sudanese\\") do not group parallel cousins together in opposition to cross-cousins.  Taboos  John Maynard Smith, in The Evolution of Sex (1978)Maynard Smith, J. (1978) The Evolution of Sex. Cambridge University Press. p. 142. . notes that Richard D. Alexander suggested that uncertainty regarding paternity may help account for the intermarriage taboo on parallel, but not on cross-cousins. Fathers who are also brothers may overtly or covertly share sexual relations with the wife of one or the other, raising the possibility that apparent parallel cousins are in fact half-siblings, sired by the same father. Likewise, mothers who are also sisters may overtly or covertly share sexual access to the husband of one or the other, raising the possibility that apparent parallel cousins are in fact half-siblings, sired by the same father. Note that there is no possibility of any classificatory cousins sharing the same mother. Because maternal identity is never in question, they would be automatically classified as siblings. Only mistaken paternity leads to such errors. This possibility is much less likely for cross-cousins, because in the absence of full-sibling incest, it is unlikely that cross-cousins can share a father by overt or covert sexual relationships. It would only be possible if a subject's mother had a brother whose wife was impregnated by the subject's father, thereby allowing apparent cross-cousins to be covert half-siblings, sharing the same father. =Middle Eastern parallel cousin marriage= Andrey Korotayev claimed that Islamization was a strong and significant predictor of parallel cousin (father's brother's daughter - FBD) marriage. He has shown that while there is a clear functional connection between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages. According to Korotayev, a systematic acceptance of parallel cousin marriage took place when Islamization occurred together with Arabization.Korotayev, A.

He was first elected as the MP for Newbury in 2005 and was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Benyon had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019 by prime minister Boris Johnson, after voting against the government, and sat as an independent MP until he had the whip restored by the prime minister on 28 October. Benyon studied at the Royal Agricultural College and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst before serving in the British Army, being posted to Northern Ireland and the Far East with the Royal Green Jackets. He was elected to Newbury Council in 1991 and became Conservative group leader in 1994. He became Member of Parliament (MP) for Newbury at the 2005 general election. In opposition, he served on the Home Affairs Select committee, as an Opposition Whip and Shadow Minister for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). In government under David Cameron, he worked as Wildlife Minister at DEFRA from May 2010 to October 2013. Early life Benyon was born on 21 October 1960 in Reading. He is the son of Sir William Richard Benyon, a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1970 until 1992, and is the great-great grandson of former Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. He was educated at nearby Bradfield College and the Royal Agricultural College. Military service Having attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets, British Army, as a second lieutenant on 8 August 1981. He was promoted to lieutenant on 8 August 1983. During his four years' service, he was posted to Northern Ireland, the UK and the Far East. He transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers on 8 August 1984, thereby ending his military career but maintaining call-up liability. Political career He was elected in 1991 to Newbury District Council, and became Conservative group leader in 1994, in opposition to the then-ruling Liberal Democrats. He lost his council seat in 1995. He contested Newbury at the 1997 general election but lost heavily to the 1993 by-election incumbent Liberal Democrat David Rendel. Benyon and Rendel contested Newbury again at the 2001 general election, and Rendel came out again as the victor with a reduced majority. He and Rendel again contested Newbury at the 2005 UK general election and Benyon was elected with a majority of 3,460, replacing Rendel. Benyon made his maiden speech on 20 May 2005 and served on the Home Affairs Select committee from 2005 to 2007, when he became an Opposition Whip. He was the Shadow Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2009 until the 2010 general election when he entered government. He was also one of the first 15 MPs to support David Cameron's Conservative Party leadership bid. In May 2009, he was listed by The Daily Telegraph as one of the \\"saints\\" in the expenses scandal exposed by that newspaper. He was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the first Cameron Ministry. and remained in post until the junior and middle ranking Cameron reshuffle of October 2013. In 2012, while Wildlife Minister he refused a request from other MPs that possession of carbofuran, a deadly poison used to kill raptors that is banned in Canada and the European Union, should be made a criminal offence.Michael McCarthy, \\"Fury at minister Richard Benyon's 'astounding' refusal to ban deadly bird poison\\" , The Independent, 20 October 2012. Retrieved 20 October 2012. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas was quoted as saying: \\"The minister's shocking refusal to outlaw the possession of a poison used only by rogue gamekeepers to illegally kill birds of prey would be inexplicable were it not for his own cosy links to the shooting lobby\\". Also in 2012, Benyon's neighbours complained when Hanson Aggregates were given permission to extract 200,000 tonnes of sand and gravel a year from woodlands on Benyon's family estate, leading it to be described as a bombsite. Benyon said that the estate was controlled by a family trust. In 2013, Benyon succeeded in preventing any cuts in fishing quotas. He said that if British fishermen had their quotas cut they would dump even more fish overboard, and the more fish they are allowed to catch, the better it will be for \\"the health of our seas\\". Back in 2004, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution proposed that 30% of the United Kingdom's waters should become reserves preventing fishing or any other kind of extraction. Also in 2013, Benyon's policy relating to access to rivers and his role as an owner of fishing rights was criticised. Writing in The Guardian, George Monbiot wrote that Benyon \\"repeatedly wields his power in ways that promote his own interests\\" and being \\"so enmeshed in potential conflicts of interest that were he to recuse himself from all the issues in which he has a personal stake, he would have nothing to do but order the departmental paperclips\\". In 2014, Benyon's family firm was part of a property consortium that purchased New Era estate, one of the last affordable housing estates for working-class Londoners. The consortium increased the rents and announced plans to increase them further to match the rest of the market, effectively displacing its current residents. Following negative publicity and protests by the tenants, Benyon Estate announced that it would sell its stake in the consortium back to the landlord, Westbrook Partners, a New York‚Äìbased property investment company. Benyon was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 European Union membership referendum. In 2017, Benyon was accused of nepotism by Private Eye after he hired his sister as a part- time senior researcher in his office just before a parliamentary ban on such practices came into force. In 2019 he was one of 21 Conservative MPs who lost the whip for supporting the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. He stood down in the general election called thereafter.  Philanthropy  Benyon is a patron of the charity, Berkshire Vision, a charity dedicated to supported the visually impaired in the county. Personal life Benyon is a director of the family controlled Englefield Charitable Trust, the largest private landowner in West Berkshire. He is one of nine Vice-Presidents of Berkshire County Scout Council. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Benyon is worth ¬£130 million. According to The Register of Members' Financial Interests, as at 21 January 2019, he is paid ¬£15,000 per annum by the UK Water Partnership, a not-for-profit company set up to promote the interests of the UK water sector; and employs his sister, Catherine Haig, as a part-time Senior Researcher. He received donations amounting to ¬£8,250 in 2018, from Philip Lavallin Wroughton (3 payments amounting to ¬£7,000) and from Chris Gent (a single payment of ¬£1,250). In December 2017, Benyon was banned from driving after admitting to using a mobile phone while driving.

There is also a state owned car top launch at the Cranberry Lake Campground and one more at the New York State Rangers School in Wanakena, New York. Lowville, New York. History The lake was named for the extensive cranberry bogs that it once contained. In 1865, the state authorized the building of a dam on the east branch of the Oswegatchie that doubled the lake's surface area and killed thousands of trees, the stumps of which still remain in some areas. In 1902, the Rich Brothers Lumber Company purchased on the southwestern shore of Cranberry Lake, and constructed a lumber mill. Housing for the millworkers was built in part from lumber salvaged from the company's abandoned Pennsylvania lumber operation. There were up to 1500 workers at the Rich Bros. mill and associated industries. A logging railroad was constructed connecting Wanakena to the Carthage & Adirondack Railroad at Benson Mines, starting operation in 1905. The railroad allowed tourists easy access to the area. In 1913, a second railroad called the Grasse River Railroad was built by the Emporium Lumber Company, connecting Cranberry Lake to the New York Central Railroad at Childwold Station near Conifer, NY. The Rich Bros. Lumber Co. donated in the vicinity of Cranberry Lake to the New York State Ranger School in 1912. Businessman Charles Lathrop Pack donated of what today is the Cranberry Lake Biological Station to the New York State College of Forestry in 1923.

The rebellion culminated in a battle fought between convicts and the colonial forces of Australia on 5 March 1804 at Rouse Hill, dubbed the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill after the first Battle of Vinegar Hill which had taken place in 1798 in Ireland. It was the first major convict uprising in Australian history suppressed under martial law. On 4 March 1804, according to the official accounts, 233 convicts led by Philip Cunningham (a veteran of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, as well as a mutiny on the convict transport ship Anne) escaped from a prison farm intent on \\"capturing ships to sail to Ireland\\". In response, martial law was quickly declared in the Colony of New South Wales. The mostly Irish rebels, having gathered reinforcements, were hunted by the colonial forces until they were caught on 5 March 1804 on a hillock nicknamed Vinegar Hill. While negotiating under a flag of truce, Cunningham was arrested. The troops then charged, and the rebellion was crushed. Nine of the rebel leaders were executed and hundreds were punished before martial law was finally revoked a week after the battle. Background =Rising= Many convicts in the Castle Hill area had been involved in the 1798 rebellions in Ireland and subsequently transported as exiles-without- trial to the Colony of New South Wales from late 1799. Phillip Cunningham, a veteran of the 1798 rebellion, and William Johnston, another Irish convict at Castle Hill, planned an uprising in which over 685 convicts at Castle Hill intended to meet with nearly 1,100 convicts from the Hawkesbury River area, rally at Constitution Hill, and march on Parramatta and then Sydney (Port Jackson) itself. According to Helen Mackay, their goal was to establish Irish rule in the colony and obtain ships for those that wanted to return to Ireland to help revive the failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.Mackay 2016, p. 125. On the evening of 4 March 1804, John Cavenah set fire to his hut at Castle Hill at 8:00 as the signal for the rebellion to begin. While this fire was not seen by the convicts at Green Hills, today's Windsor, on the Hawkesbury River, Cunningham activated the plan to gather weapons, ammunition, food and recruits from local supporters and the government farm at Castle Hill.Silver 1989, p. 81. With Cunningham leading, about 200 to 300 rebels broke into the Government Farm's buildings, taking firearms, ammunition, and other weapons. The constables and overseers were overpowered and the rebels then went from farm to farm on their way to Constitution Hill at Parramatta, seizing more weapons and supplies including rum and spirits, and recruiting others to join their cause.Silver 1989, pp. 82‚Äì86. Their move had been informed from the intelligence gathered a year previous when 12 convicts escaped from Castle Hill, seeking out friends and sympathisers in the surrounding districts. On capture each and every one had the same story ‚Äì they were heading to China by crossing over the Blue Mountains.According to Silver (p. 62), due to limited geographical knowledge, at the time many Irish convicts believed that China lay just beyond the Blue Mountains and that they could escape their incarceration by making their way over the mountains. =Initial government response= When news of the uprising spread there was great panic amongst the colony of around 5,000 inhabitants with officials such as Samuel Marsden fleeing the area by boat, escorting Elizabeth Macarthur and her children, as an informer had advised that an attack would be made on the farm to draw troops away from Parramatta.Silver 1989, pp. 87‚Äì88. In Sydney, following news from Parramatta, Governor Philip Gidley King set off alone for Parramatta to assume command, while Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson, the lieutenant governor, called out the guard. One hundred and forty men from HMS Calcutta, as well as the Sydney Loyal Association militia, took over guard duties, and a New South Wales Corps contingent of 56 personnel including Lieutenant William Davies and Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock were dispatched to march through the night to bolster the garrison at Parramatta. Meanwhile, the provost marshal, Thomas Smyth, was sent ahead to contact Major George Johnston at Annandale. The troops from Sydney arrived at 1:30 am, and after a quick inspection an advanced guard was sent to the west of the town.Silver 1989, pp. 90-91. Johnston arrived at Government House in Parramatta about four hours later not long after King had declared martial law under the Mansfield doctrine of posse comitatus.In 1780, a series of riots in London were eventually suppressed by the use of soldiers. In discussing the legal ramifications of this action Parliament agreed with Lord Chief Justice Mansfield who declared that all civil riots should be put down by civil authorities and the posse comitatus, never by military authorities. Further that even if soldiers comprise the posse comitatus they are deemed to be acting in a civil capacity and are thus subject to civilian laws. This policy of soldier as civilian came to be known as the Mansfield Doctrine and was to be the controlling policy on the role of the posse comitatus in England.Silver 1989, pp. 94 & 106. King's proclamation of martial law applied to a wide area extending from Castle Hill to the Hawkesbury and Nepean areas, and empowered citizens in the area to detain those who lacked the appropriate passes. A curfew had also been enacted and an amnesty declared, which gave those who were involved 24 hours to surrender. On Johnston's arrival at Parramatta, King delivered his orders, in writing, to Johnston and then verbally to his small detachment. Johnston was to proceed to the western gate of the park around Government House, where the rebels had been seen a few hours earlier. If they were not there, he was ordered to exploit towards Toongabbie and Castle Hill to locate them and then await further orders. He was also empowered to fire upon anyone who did not obey his directions.Silver 1989, pp. 94‚Äì95. Shortly after 5:00 am, Johnston set out to locate the main rebel force. In addition to the troops he had brought with him, a number of civilians volunteered along with the 36 armed members of the Parramatta Loyal Association militia were also called out and took over defence of the town. Over 50 enrolled in a reserve militia combined with the NSW Corps to march out and confront the rebels.Silver 1989, pp. 97 & 103. Johnston decided to advance in two columns, one which he led himself towards Toongabbie, and another under a subaltern, Davies, which was sent along the Castle Hill Road.Silver 1989, p. 96. = Rebels prepare = Meanwhile, the rebels at Constitution Hill (Toongabbie) were having difficulties co-ordinating their force as several parties, including one of around 70 men under Samuel Humes, had lost their way in the night. Nevertheless, Cunningham and William Johnston commenced drilling their men,Silver 1989, p. 94. while a party unsuccessfully tried to enter Parramatta,Some accounts state that about 30 rebels were killed or wounded in fighting with government forces around the western gate. See Mackay 2016. where they were to set fire to a building to signal other conspirators to begin converging on Constitution Hill.Silver 1989, pp. 88‚Äì90. Cunningham, being involved in two previous rebellions and the mutiny on the Anne, knew from experience that the most important element of a rebellion or uprising would be secrecy. However, there were two defections: an Irish convict overseer named Sloane, and Lewis Bulger.Silver 1989, pp. 77‚Äì79. The commandant at Parramatta, Captain Edward Abbott, who had warning of the rebellion as it was happening, commenced defensive measures and sent a message to the governor in Sydney.Silver 1989, p. 80. George Johnston, who led the military response to the rebellion, as a lieutenant colonel in 1810. With their courier, John Griffen, having had second thoughts about passing on the instructions Cunningham had given him to pass on to Brian Furey and subsequently being arrested,Silver 1989, pp. 77‚Äì80. the call out messages to Windsor, Parramatta and Sydney failed, and the uprising was confined to west of the Parramatta area. After fruitlessly waiting for a signal of a successful internal takeover of Parramatta, and the non-appearance of reinforcements, Cunningham was forced to withdraw from Parramatta to Toongabbie to re-assess his strategy. Having already declared his hand, and deprived of both surprise and facing a superior and well disciplined force of Red Coats and enthusiastic militia, the uprising under Cunningham had no recourse but to withdraw west towards the Hawkesbury hoping to pick up more recruits and meeting his missing forces on the way to add to his forces.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 2. Knowing that going forward would only see more death and possible routing, they quickly moved westward hoping to join up with those now heading east from Green Hills (Windsor) to meet in the area of today's Rouse Hill and Kellyville, recruiting or impressing against their will a number of convicts along the way. (Those later giving evidence stated they were press-ganged into serviceSilver 1989, p. 111. in hope of lessening their punishment.) During this phase they obtained around a third of the entire colony's armaments.Silver 1989, p. 86. Their numbers had dwindled to several hundred, eventually reaching a total of 233 as reported in the Government controlled newspaper of the time. During the short period of the rebellion while at Constitution Hill, Cunningham was elected \\"King of the Australian Empire\\", and his followers declared the area \\"New Ireland\\".  Battle  Major Johnston's contingent, wearied by their night march, needed time to close with the retreating rebels, who were reported to number around 400, so he rode after them with a small mounted party to implement delaying tactics, while the rest of his party completed the march to Toongabbie. Initially, it was believed that the rebels were at Toongabbie, but on arrival Johnston was informed that they had moved on to Constitution Hill. A small party under a corporal was sent to outflank this position, while an assault force of around a dozen men advanced on the summit, only to find it abandoned, with the rebels having moved off towards the Hawkesbury, about away. As the morning progressed, the heat of the day threatened to stymie the efforts of the marching troops who were poorly equipped for the pursuit.Silver 1989, p. 97. Nevertheless, about from Toongabbie,Silver 1989, p. 100. Johnston located the main rebel party of around 230 to 260 men near Rouse Hill,Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 3. Johnston first sent his mounted trooper on to call the rebels to surrender and take the benefit of the Governor's amnesty for early surrender. This failing, he dispatched Roman Catholic priest Father James Dixon to appeal to them. Next he rode up himself, appealing to them, then got their agreement to hear Father Dixon again.Silver 1989, pp. 100‚Äì101. Meanwhile, the pursuing forces had closed up and Major Johnston with Trooper Thomas Anlezark, from the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse,Sargent 1998, pp. 5‚Äì6. approached them again to parley, calling down the leaders Cunningham and William Johnston from the hill. Demanding their surrender, he received the response \\"Death or Liberty\\" from Cunningham,Silver 1989, pp. 100‚Äì102. to which some were reported to have added \\"and a ship to take us home\\", although this was only once recorded some time later by Suttor. With the NSW Corps and militia now formed up in firing lines behind him Major Johnston and Anlezark produced pistols duping, while under truce, the two leaders of the uprising, and escorting them back to the Red Coat's lines. Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock, on being given the order to engage, directed over fifteen minutes of musket fire, then charged cutting Cunningham down with his cutlass. The now leaderless rebels first tried to fire back, but then broke and dispersed.Silver 1989, pp. 102‚Äì104. During the battle (at least) fifteen rebels had fallen, according to official reports, Major Johnston prevented further bloodshed and killings by threatening his troops with his pistol tempering their enthusiasm.Silver 1989, pp. 103‚Äì105. Several convicts were captured and an unknown number killed in the pursuit which went up to Windsor all day until late in the night, with new arrivals of soldiers from Sydney joining in the search for rebels. It is reported that gun shots could be heard up to a fortnight after such was the settling of old scores. On Wednesday, 7 March Governor King announced that those that surrendered before 10 March would receive leniency and following this large parties who lost their way in the night turned themselves in under the amnesty or made their way back to Castle Hill where a large party of about 70 under Samuel Humes were captured by a detachment of the Loyal Parramatta Association.Silver 1989, pp. 106‚Äì108.  Aftermath  According to the official records of the day, around 230 were eventually brought in over next few days and of the convicts directly engaged in the battle, 15 were killed, and 9 including the ringleaders Cunningham and Johnston were executed, Derived from the book The Battle of Vinegar Hill by Lynette Ramsey Silver, published by Watermark Press, updated and expanded 2002.According to Silver (p. 132): Phillip Cunningham (executed at Windsor), William Johnston (executed at Castle Hill), John Neale (executed at Castle Hill), George Harrington (executed at Castle Hill), Samuel Humes (executed at Parramatta), Charles Hill (executed at Parramatta), Jonothan Place (executed at Parramatta), John Brannan (executed at Sydney), Timothy Hogan (executed at Sydney) with two, Johnson and Humes, subjected to gibbeting. Two men, John Burke and Bryan McCormack, were reprieved and detained at the Governor's pleasure, seven were whipped with 200 or 500 lashes then allotted to the Coal River chain gang,According to Silver (pp. 132‚Äì133): John Griffin, Neil Smith, Bryan Burne, Connor Dwyer, David Morrison, Cornelius Lyons and Owen McDermot. while 23 others, including Cavenah were sent to the Newcastle coal mines.Silver 1989, pp. 132‚Äì133. Another 34 prisoners were placed in irons until they could be \\"disposed of\\". It is not known whether some, or all of them, were sent to the Coal River. Of the remaining rebels, some were put on good behaviour orders against a trip to Norfolk Island, while the majority were pardoned and allowed to return to their places of employment as having been coerced into the uprising.Mackay 2016, pp. 128.Silver 1989, p. 133. Cunningham, badly wounded but still alive, was court martialled under the martial law and hanged at the Commissariat Store at Windsor, which he had bragged he would burn down.Silver 1989, p. 106. Initially, military officers were intent on hanging a token number of those captured having convened a military court at the Whipping GreenPresent day Prince Alfred Square, Parramatta. but this was quickly stopped by Governor Gidley King fearful of the repercussions.Silver 1989, pp. 108‚Äì110. Martial law was eventually lifted on 10 March 1804, but this did not end the insurgency. Irish plots continued to develop, keeping the Government and its informers vigilant, with military call out rehearsals continuing over the next three years. Governor King remained convinced that the real inspirers of revolt had kept out of sight, and had some suspects sent to Norfolk Island as a preventive measure.Silver 1989, pp. 114‚Äì118. = Location = The battle site is believed to be to the east of the site of the Rouse Hill Estate, and it is likely that Richard Rouse, a staunch establishment figure, was subsequently given his grant at this site specifically to prevent it becoming a significant site for Irish convicts. \\"The Government Farm at Castle Hill\\", a plot of land around , was added in March 1986 to the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, as a special place of international and Australian significance. Residential development has significantly diminished the area of the prison town. Less than has remained undeveloped and conserved, as Castle Hill Heritage Park, established in 2004. There is a sculpture near the battle site at Castlebrook Cemetery commemorating the sacrifice. However, there is some debate as to where the battle actually occurred. = Commemoration = The bicentenary of the rebellion was commemorated in 2004, with a variety of events. The re-enactment in 2004 was significant in that exact numbers were recruited to form the rebels, the militia and the military. The event was held in close proximity to the original site on a similar landscape. The re- enactment was recorded by the ABC. In addition, the battle has been depicted on screen. An Australian 1978 TV series, Against the Wind, included a dramatization over two episodes of the build-up to and ultimate defeat of the rebellion. A monument commemorating the battle was erected at Castlebrook Memorial Park, on Windsor Road, Rouse Hill. It was dedicated on 5 March 1988.

She served as Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Derbyshire from 2005 until her defeat in the 2017 general election. Engel has had extensive involvement in the trade union movement and was Second Deputy Chair of Ways and Means (one of three positions held by deputy speakers). For her work in Parliament she was awarded Parliamentarian of the Year in 2013 by the Political Studies Association. She was Commissioner for Shale Gas from October 2018 until resigning in April 2019.  Early life and education  The King's School, Canterbury Natascha Engel was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to a German father and an English mother. After her parents' divorce she moved with her mother to Kent and was educated at Kent College and The King's School, Canterbury. She later trained as a linguist in German and Portuguese at King's College London and at the University of Westminster where she obtained a Master's degree in Technical and Specialised Translation. In addition to her political career, Engel undertook postgraduate work in translation: she speaks English, German, Spanish and Portuguese.  Early career  While living in Madrid, Spain, Engel worked as a volunteer for two years in the local office of Amnesty International while earning a living as a teacher of English. After returning to Britain to work as a Teletext subtitler, Engel joined the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU). She was among the first to join the Organising Academy of the Trade Union Congress, serving with the Graphical, Paper and Media Union; she worked on political fund ballots in persuading trade union members to retain their financial backing for the Labour Party. Engel joined the Labour Party staff as a Trade Union Liaison Officer organising marginal seats campaigning at the 2001 general election. She later became policy co-ordinator for the Trade Union Liaison Office, leaving to work for Smith Institute as programme director. Working there for a year, her responsibilities included researching on skills and the needs of working women and Regional Economic Policy. In October 2002, through the Smith Institute, she co-wrote the book Age of Regions: Meeting the Productivity Challenge. She was an assistant to John Healey in February 2003, and collaborated with him on a pamphlet, published by the TUC, and an article, published by the New Statesman, arguing that unions should offer learning opportunities in order to recruit more members.  Parliamentary career  Following the decision to stand down of sitting MP Harry Barnes, she was selected as the Labour candidate for North East Derbyshire at the 2005 general election. \\"Easily\\" defeating local candidates, she denied that this was due to her connection to the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. In the election, Engel retained the seat with a majority of 10,065. She bought a house at Barrow Hill in her constituency in July 2006. In the May 2010 general election, the swing to the Conservative party in her constituency was 8.6%, compared to an East Midland average of 6.7%. =In the Commons= When the MP participation in Select Committees was formalised in the new Parliament, Engel was appointed to the Work and Pensions Select Committee. She made her maiden speech on 20 October 2005, the last of the incoming Labour MPs to do so. In the speech, Engel concentrated on constituency affairs, supporting devolution of power and resources to local communities and highlighting examples in Staveley and Grassmoor which are both within her constituency. She defined socialism as \\"the simple idea that if someone helps their neighbour, their neighbour will help them\\".Hansard , House of Commons, 6th series, vol. 437, cols. 1012‚Äì1013 In 2006, Engel was included on a list of up and coming MPs compiled for Sky plc.

Engel became Secretary of the All-Party Media Literacy Group in 2006. She backed Peter Hain for the Labour Party deputy leadership in the 2007 election, and served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Hain from July 2007 until Hain resigned from the Government in January 2008. Engel left the Work and Pensions Committee in November 2007. She performed the same role for Liam Byrne from October 2008, transferring to work for John Denham from January 2009. She was appointed to the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons when it was set up in July 2009. Engel did not agree with the committee's report, which contained proposals for the creation of a committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite‚Äîin this case, the Executive‚Äîand handing it to another‚Äîa group of senior Back Benchers'. She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done [reform], we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.Formal Minutes . 12 November 2009.

On 6 July 2011 she was named \\"Backbencher of the Year\\" for her work with the committee. Interviewed in the April 2012 edition of Total Politics, Engel expressed surprise at her status in being pictured alongside that of the Coalition leaders and the Speaker in an exhibition on democracy. Engel's role was to allocate roughly one day a week parliamentary debating time between competing backbenchers by a process described by Quentin Letts as akin to Dragons' Den. She has expressed pride in the committee which is \\"a powerful check on the executive\\". Debates are allowed on any topic and, unless they are against party policy, the whips don't interfere.

In a Fabian Society survey of some Labour MPs in Autumn 2007, Engel's suggestion for the next Labour general election manifesto was for sex and relationship education to be compulsory in all schools and taught by a professional.\\"Dear Ed: Manifesto suggestions \\", Fabian Review, Autumn 2007. At the ePolitix Charity Champion awards in November 2007, Engel was named \\"Children and Youth Champion\\" for her work.Charity award winners announced, 28 November 2007.Derbyshire Times, 13 December 2007 At the 2007‚Äì08 annual general meeting of the British Youth Council, she was chosen as an Honorary President of the council.BYC Honorary President . = Expenses scandal = In May 2009, during the expenses scandal the Derby Telegraph contacted all the MPs in Derbyshire for their opinion of the issues raised. Engel provided the Derbyshire Times with all her claim forms. The paper subsequently invited other members of parliament within its circulation area to do the same but only the neighbouring Amber Valley MP Judy Mallaber accepted. The Sunday Telegraph, published ten days later, showed that after her election in 2005, Engel claimed ¬£158.45 incidental expenses for \\"political history\\" items, some of which she told the paper she would repay. Also in 2005, she advised the Fees office of above limits second home claims, paying the excess though ¬£1,666 worth of kitchen goods were paid in full. She admitted that with hindsight she would not have claimed for some kitchen items which were \\"the letter... not the spirit, of the law\\". However, she cited costs of setting up a second home and a constituency office, and said she had paid out the money and had not acted corruptly, so she would not be repaying it. Following the publication, Engel set up meetings to answer questions though these were not well attended. The Sunday Telegraphs claim that Engel came low on the list of 'value for money' MPs was itself criticised by The Guardian for failing to mention that Engel had two periods of maternity leave whilst Engel herself wrote an article linking the expenses and hours of Parliament to the difficulties of raising a young family. \\"The expenses debate... has forced MPs to talk to the people they represent... Only when people realise that we split our time between constituency and Westminster can they begin to understand why we even have a second-home allowance.\\" The Legg Report showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay money, including several from Derbyshire. Engel repaid ¬£1,934 of which she said ¬£1,339 was a mortgage claim the Fees office paid twice which she repaid immediately whilst ¬£595 was a refund of a house rental deposit. =Later elections= In the 2015 general election, Engel's majority of 1,883 was the 17th-smallest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage.List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority UK Political.info. Retrieved 29 January 2017 She had been expected to lose but she retained her seat. Engel supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In explanation of her eventual defeat in the 2017 general election, Engel pointed to problems in Labour gaining votes in its post-industrial heartlands and the absence of a significant student vote in the constituency, comparing the situation with her native Canterbury where Labour had gained the seat in the election for the first time. Many in North East Derbyshire were of the opinion that her stance on fracking was the root cause of her defeat, having published a letter in support of fracking (against the national Party policy) immediately after the close of nominations for the Labour candidacy. North East Derbyshire has a large anti-fracking movement due to proposed developments by the chemicals company Ineos, and Engel's nomination had been signed by some anti-fracking activists.  After Parliament  =Consultant to fracking firm= After losing her seat in the election it was announced that Engel had taken a job as a consultant to a firm involved in fracking with Ineos. The North East Derbyshire Labour Party have strongly condemned her actions and are considering their options in relation to her status within the party, though she was replaced as the Labour candidate for the area by anti-fracking Sheffield councillor Christine Peace. =Fracking tsar= On 5 October 2018 the Conservative government announced Engel as the new commissioner for shale gas. According to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy she \\"will be a direct communication link between local communities, the shale gas industry and the industry regulators.\\" As fracking tsar she said that people opposing fracking were 'hysterical' and had 'knee jerk reactions': \\"Environment lobbyists and campaigners should be fracking‚Äôs number one fans. They should be pushing the government to get fracking while we try and bridge that gap between the renewable energy that we‚Äôre using at the moment which is absolutely negligible.\\" Resignation On 28 April 2019, she resigned as fracking tsar. According to The Guardian, Engel was quoted in her resignation as saying that \\"The UK is currently spending ¬£7bn a year on importing gas ‚Äì money that is not being used to build schools, hospitals or fix the potholes in our roads\\", despite the fact that the British Government does not itself procure gas, given that the energy industry was privatised several decades before; further to this, any UK oil or gas production is taxed by the government, and such production improves both the balance of trade (by supplanting some gas imports) and national GDP. Personal life In 2012, she and her veterinary surgeon husband divorced; they have three sons.

The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures are a series of lectures on a single topic each, which have been held at the Royal Institution in London each year since 1825, missing 1939‚Äì42 because of the Second World War. The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. Michael Faraday initiated the Christmas Lecture series in 1825, at a time when organised education for young people was scarce. Faraday presented nineteen series of lectures in all. History A close-up image of a candle showing the wick and the various parts of the flame; Michael Faraday lectured on \\"The Chemical History of a Candle\\". The Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures were first held in 1825, and have continued on an annual basis since then except during the Second World War. They have been hosted each year at the Royal Institution itself, except in 1929 and between 2005‚Äì2006, each time due to refurbishment of the building. They were created by Michael Faraday, who later hosted the lecture season on nineteen occasions. The Nobel laureate Sir William Bragg gave the Christmas lectures on four occasions, and his co-laureate son Sir Lawrence Bragg gave them twice. Other notable lecturers have included Desmond Morris (1964), Eric Laithwaite (1966 & 1974), Sir George Porter (1969 & 1976), Sir David Attenborough (1973), Heinz Wolff (1975), Carl Sagan (1977), Richard Dawkins (1991), Baroness Susan Greenfield (1994), Dame Nancy Rothwell (1998), Monica Grady (2003), Sue Hartley (2009), Alison Woollard (2013), Danielle George (2014), and Saiful Islam (2016).Professor from Newcastle becomes only sixth woman to present Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, Newcastle Chronicle, 2014-08-19, The Royal Institution, 2018-10-02 The props for the lectures are designed and created by the RI's science demonstration technician, a post which Faraday previously held. A popular technician, with the advent of television, serving from 1948 to 1986, was Bill Coates. The technician is informed of the general subject of the lectures during spring, but the specifics aren't settled until September, with the recordings made in mid-December. By 2009, the lectures had expanded to a series of five sessions each year. However, in 2010 the Royal Institution cut back on costs as it had become over ¬£2 million in debt. These cost-cutting measures included the budget allotted to the Christmas Lectures. This resulted in a reduction from five sessions to three. =Television= The Christmas Lectures were first televised in 1936 on the BBC's fledgling Television Service.http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6424a3e20cf3442aa89fe74b6b6f4859 They were broadcast on BBC Two from 1966 to 1999 and Channel 4 from 2000 to 2004. In 2000 one of the lectures was broadcast live for the first time. Following the end of Channel 4's contract to broadcast the lectures, there were concerns that they might simply be dropped from scheduling as the channel was negotiating with the Royal Institution over potential changes to the format, while the BBC announced that \\"The BBC will not show the lectures again, because it feels the broadcasting environment has moved on in the last four years.\\" Channel Five subsequently agreed to show the lectures from 2005 to 2008, an announcement which was met with derision from academics. The lectures were broadcast on More4 in 2009. In 2010, the lectures returned to the BBC after a ten-year absence from the broadcaster, and have been shown on BBC Four each year since then. In 1994, Professor Susan Greenfield became the first female scientist to present the Christmas Lectures. The first non-white science lecturer was Kevin Fong in 2015, and in August 2020 it was announced that Professor Christopher Jackson would jointly present the 2020 lecture series, thus becoming the first black scientist to do so.

Planned in partial secrecy, Washington led a column of Continental Army troops across the icy Delaware River in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation. Other planned crossings in support of the operation were either called off or ineffective, but this did not prevent Washington from surprising and defeating the troops of Johann Rall quartered in Trenton. The army crossed the river back to Pennsylvania, this time laden with prisoners and military stores taken as a result of the battle. Washington's army then crossed the river a third time at the end of the year, under conditions made more difficult by the uncertain thickness of the ice on the river. They defeated British reinforcements under Lord Cornwallis at Trenton on January 2, 1777, and defeated his rear guard at Princeton on January 3, before retreating to winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey. The unincorporated communities of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Washington Crossing, New Jersey, are named in honor of this event. Background While 1776 had started well for the American cause with the evacuation of British troops from Boston in March, the defense of New York City had gone quite poorly. British General William Howe had landed troops on Long Island in August and had pushed George Washington's Continental Army completely out of New York by mid-November, when he captured the remaining troops on Manhattan. The main British troops returned to New York for the winter season. They left mainly Hessian troops in New Jersey. These troops were under the command of Colonel Rall and Colonel Von Donop. They were ordered to small outposts in and around Trenton. Howe then sent troops under the command of Charles Cornwallis across the Hudson River into New Jersey and chased Washington across New Jersey. Washington's army was shrinking because of expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale because of the defeats in the New York area. Most of Washington's army crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania north of Trenton, New Jersey, and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions. Cornwallis (under Howe's command), rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from New Brunswick to Burlington, including one at Bordentown and one at Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters.The retreat is recounted in detail by Dwyer, pp. 24‚Äì112 The British were happy to end the campaign season when they were ordered to winter quarters. This was a time for the generals to regroup, re- supply, and strategize for the upcoming campaign season the following spring. Washington's army Map of Delaware River area depicting route George Washington and his Army made during the crossing by William Faden Washington encamped the army near McConkey's Ferry, not far from the crossing site. While Washington at first took quarters across the river from Trenton, he moved his headquarters on December 15 to the home of William Keith so he could remain closer to his forces. When Washington's army first arrived at McConkey's Ferry, he had four to six thousand men, although 1,700 soldiers were unfit for duty and needed hospital care. In the retreat across New Jersey, Washington had lost precious supplies and also lost contact with two important divisions of his army. General Horatio Gates was in the Hudson River Valley, and General Charles Lee was in western New Jersey with 2,000 men. Washington had ordered both generals to join him, but Gates was delayed by heavy snows en route, and Lee, who did not have a high opinion of Washington, delayed following repeated orders, preferring to remain on the British flank near Morristown, New Jersey. Other problems affected the quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire at the end of the year, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were completed. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful partially because of British and Hessian soldier's drunken behavior while in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The losses at Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy toll on the Patriots. When they evacuated their forts, they were forced to leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence. = Publication of The American Crisis= Paine's The American Crisis But the morale of the Patriot forces was boosted on December 19 when a new pamphlet titled The American Crisis written by Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense, was published. Within a day of its publication in Philadelphia, General Washington ordered it to be read to all of his troops. It encouraged the soldiers and improved the tolerance of their difficult conditions. = Reinforcements arrive = On December 20, General Lee's division of 2,000 troops arrived in Washington's camp under the command of General John Sullivan. General Lee had been captured by the British on December 12, when he ventured too far outside the protection of his troops in search of more comfortable lodgings (or, according to rumors, a possible assignation). Later that same day, General Gates' division arrived in camp, reduced to 600 whose enlistments had ended, and by the need to keep the northern frontier secure. Soon after, another 1,000 militiamen from Philadelphia under Colonel John Cadwalader joined Washington. With these reinforcements and smaller numbers of local volunteers who joined his forces, Washington's forces now totaled about 6,000 troops fit for duty. This total was then reduced by a large portion because some forces were detailed to guard the ferries at Dunk's Ferry (currently bordered by Neshaminy State Park in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania and New Hope, Pennsylvania). Another group was sent to protect supplies at Newtown, Pennsylvania, and to guard the sick and wounded who had to remain behind when the army crossed the Delaware River. This left Washington with about 2,400 men able to take offensive action against the Hessian and British troops in central New Jersey. This improvement in morale was aided by the arrival of some provisions, including much-needed blankets, on December 24. Planning the attack The Passage of the Delaware, by Thomas Sully, 1819 General Washington had been considering some sort of bold move since arriving in Pennsylvania. With the arrival of Sullivan's and Gates' forces and the influx of militia companies, he felt the time was finally right for some sort of action. He first considered an attack on the southernmost British positions near Mount Holly, where a militia force had gathered. He sent his adjutant, Joseph Reed, to meet with Samuel Griffin, the militia commander. Reed arrived in Mount Holly on December 22, found Griffin to be ill and his men in relatively poor condition, but willing to make some sort of diversion. (This they did with the Battle of Iron Works Hill the next day, drawing the Hessians at Bordentown far enough south that they would be unable to come to the assistance of the Trenton garrison.) The intelligence gathered by Reed and others led Washington to abandon the idea of attacking at Mount Holly, preferring instead to target the Trenton garrison. He announced this decision to his staff on December 23, saying the attack would take place just before daybreak on December 26. Washington's final plan was for three crossings, with his troops, the largest contingent, to lead the attack on Trenton. A second column under Cadwalader was to cross at Dunk's Ferry and create a diversion to the south. A third column under Brigadier General James Ewing was to cross at Trenton Ferry and hold the bridge across the Assunpink Creek, just south of Trenton, in order to prevent the enemy's escape by that route. Once Trenton was secure, the combined army would move against the British posts in Princeton and New Brunswick. A planned fourth crossing, by men provided by General Israel Putnam to assist Cadwalader, was nixed after Putnam indicated he did not have enough men fit for the operation. Preparations for the attack began on December 23. On December 24, the boats used to bring the army across the Delaware from New Jersey were brought down from Malta Island near New Hope. They were hidden behind Taylor Island at McConkey's Ferry, Washington's planned crossing site; security was tightened at the crossing. A final planning meeting took place that day, with all of the general officers present. General orders were issued by Washington on December 25 outlining plans for the operation. Watercraft Reenactors cross the river in Durham boats A wide variety of watercraft were assembled for the crossing, primarily through the work of militia men from the surrounding counties in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the assistance of the Pennsylvania Navy. Captain Daniel Bray, along with Captain Jacob Gearhart and Captain Jacob Ten Eyck, were chosen by Washington to take charge of the boats used in the crossing, supervising the transport of infantry, cavalry, cannon. In addition to the large ferry vessels (which were big enough to carry large coaches, and likely served for carrying horses and artillery during the crossing), a large number of Durham boats were used to transport soldiers across the river. These boats were designed to carry heavy loads from the Durham Iron Works, featured high sides and a shallow draft, and could be poled across the river.Michael W. Robbins, \\"The Durham Boat\\" MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History (Winter 2015) 27#2 pp 26-28. The boats were operated by experienced watermen. Most prominent among them were the men of John Glover's Marblehead Regiment, a company of experienced seamen from Marblehead, Massachusetts. These men were joined by seamen, dockworkers, and shipbuilders from Philadelphia, as well as local ferry operators and boatsmen who knew the river well. Crossing On the morning of December 25, Washington ordered his army to prepare three days' food and issued orders that every soldier be outfitted with fresh flints for their muskets. He was also somewhat worried by intelligence reports that the British were planning their own crossing once the Delaware was frozen over. At 4 pm Washington's army turned out for its evening parade, where the troops were issued ammunition, and even the officers and musicians were ordered to carry muskets. They were told that they were departing on a secret mission. Marching eight abreast in close formations and ordered to be as quiet as possible, they left the camp for McConkey's Ferry. Washington's plan required the crossing to begin as soon as it was dark enough to conceal their movements on the river, but most of the troops did not reach the crossing point until about 6 pm, about ninety minutes after sunset. The weather got progressively worse, turning from drizzle to rain to sleet and snow. \\"It blew a hurricane,\\" recalled one soldier. Henry Knox Washington had given charge of the crossing logistics to his chief of artillery, Henry Knox. In addition to the crossing of large numbers of troops (most of whom could not swim), he had to safely transport horses and eighteen pieces of artillery over the river. Knox wrote that the crossing was accomplished \\"with almost infinite difficulty\\", and that its most significant danger was floating ice in the river. One observer noted that the whole operation might well have failed \\"but for the stentorian lungs of Colonel Knox\\". The unusually cold weather of the 1770s and the icy river were likely related to the Little Ice Age. Washington was among the first of the troops to cross, going with Virginia troops led by General Adam Stephen. These troops formed a sentry line around the landing area in New Jersey, with strict instructions that no one was to pass through. The password was \\"Victory or Death\\". The rest of the army crossed without significant incident, although a few men, including Delaware's Colonel John Haslet, fell into the water. The amount of ice on the river prevented the artillery from finishing the crossing until 3 am on December 26\\\\. The troops were ready to march around 4 am. Map showing Washington's movements leading up to the Battle of Trenton The two other crossings fared less well. The treacherous weather and ice jams on the river stopped General Ewing from even attempting a crossing below Trenton. Colonel Cadwalader crossed a significant portion of his men to New Jersey, but when he found that he could not get his artillery across the river he recalled his men from New Jersey. When he received word about Washington's victory, he crossed his men over again but retreated when he found out that Washington had not stayed in New Jersey. Attack On the morning of December 26, as soon as the army was ready, Washington ordered it split into two columns, one under the command of himself and General Greene, the second under General Sullivan. The Sullivan column would take River Road from Bear Tavern to Trenton while Washington's column would follow Pennington Road, a parallel route that lay a few miles inland from the river. Only three Americans were killed and six wounded, while 22 Hessians were killed with 98 wounded. The Americans captured 1,000 prisoners and seized muskets, powder, and artillery. Return to Pennsylvania Following the battle, Washington had to execute a second crossing that was in some ways more difficult than the first. In the aftermath of the battle, the Hessian supplies had been plundered, and, in spite of Washington's explicit orders for its destruction, casks of captured rum were opened, so some of the celebrating troops got drunk, probably contributing to the larger number of troops that had to be pulled from the icy waters on the return crossing. They also had to transport the large numbers of prisoners across the river while keeping them under guard. One American acting as a guard on one of the crossings observed that the Hessians, who were standing in knee-deep ice water, were \\"so cold that their underjaws quivered like an aspen leaf.\\" The victory had a marked effect on the troops' morale. Soldiers celebrated the victory, Washington's role as a leader was secured, and Congress gained renewed enthusiasm for the war. Third crossing Statue of John Glover in Boston In a war council on December 27, Washington learned that all of the British and Hessian forces had withdrawn as far north as Princeton, something Cadwalader had learned when his militia company crossed the river that morning. In his letter, Cadwalader proposed that the British could be driven entirely from the area, magnifying the victory. After much debate, the council decided on action and planned a third crossing for December 29. On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold. As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used. At some of crossing points, the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7 cm) thick and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot. At other crossings, the conditions were so bad that the attempts were abandoned for the day. It was New Year's Eve before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey. This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring at the end of the year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, wanted to go home, where a lucrative privateering trade awaited them. Only by offering a bounty to be paid immediately from Congressional coffers in Philadelphia did a significant number of men agree to stay with the army another six weeks. Washington then adopted a fortified position just south of the Assunpink Creek, across the creek from Trenton. In this position he beat back one assault on January 2, 1777, which he followed up with a decisive victory at Princeton the next day. In the following days, the British withdrew to New Brunswick, and the Continental Army entered winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey. Legacy Landing area in Washington Crossing State Park, New Jersey At the time of the crossing, Washington's army included a significant number of people who played important roles in the formation and early days of the United States of America. These included future President James Monroe, future Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, Alexander Hamilton (a future Secretary of the Treasury), and Arthur St. Clair, who later served as President of the Continental Congress and Governor of the Northwest Territory.Fischer (2006), pp. 222, 223, 339.Bennett (2006), p. 89. Both sides of the Delaware River where the crossing took place have been preserved, in an area designated as the Washington's Crossing National Historic Landmark. In this district, Washington Crossing Historic Park in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, preserves the area in Pennsylvania, and Washington Crossing State Park in Washington Crossing, New Jersey preserves the area in New Jersey. and The two areas are connected by the Washington Crossing Bridge.Washington Crossing Toll Supported Bridge In 1851, the artist Emmanuel Leutze created the painting, Washington Crossing the Delaware, an idealized and inspirational portrayal of the crossing.

After Ian MacKaye's band Fugazi entered a hiatus, The Evens began practicing extensively, and eventually played a few shows and recorded a self-titled album, released in March 2005 on MacKaye's label, Dischord Records. The Evens are known for their unusual choices in venues for performances and the stylistic change from what many have dubbed the \\"D.C.\\" or \\"Dischord\\" sound. The Washington Post has described the sound as \\"what happens when post- hardcore becomes post-post-hardcore.\\" History The Evens first gained notice in late 2003 when they created a video for their original children's song \\"Vowel Movement\\", which was made for Pancake Mountain, a Washington, D.C. internet-based children's program. The clip fueled furthered rumors of Fugazi's breakup amid their hiatus, while adding speculation as to MacKaye's new musical direction. The song featured sing-along lines and upbeat music in the vein of Sesame Street and other children's educational programs, while the video showed dancing children and colorful vowels. In June and July 2006, MacKaye and Farina recorded new music that they wrote earlier in that year.

He is remembered for having been called the \\"father of the ballot\\" due to his responsibility in introducing the secret ballot in Victoria. Early life Nicholson was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, the son of an Anglican farmer. At the age of twenty six, in 1842, he emigrated to Australia, setting up business as a grocer in Melbourne. He was a successful businessman and became the head of a merchant firm, W. Nicholson and Company. In 1848 Nicholson was elected to the Melbourne City Council, and served as Mayor of Melbourne (1850‚Äì51). He was also a director of the Bank of Victoria and several other companies. Political career In 1852, Nicholson won another election, to the Legislative Council for North Bourke. In 1853, he became a member of the committee which drafted the Constitution of Victoria, and on 18 December 1855, Nicholson moved and carried a motion which stated that any Victorian electoral act should include voting by secret ballot. This move was opposed by the government at the time, under Premier William Haines, and after the motion was passed, Haines resigned. Although it was actually Henry Chapman who devised the secret ballot motion, the fact that Nicholson moved it, gained him the credit, and when Haines resigned, he was invited by the Governor of Victoria Sir Charles Hotham to form a government, but he was unable to do so, and Haines became Premier again. In 1856, Nicholson visited England, where he was congratulated for his work in establishing the secret ballot, which had been advocated by the Chartist movement there. The system was introduced in Victoria on 19 March 1856, and in South Australia on 2 April in the same year. It was later adopted by all the other colonies. The secret ballot was known as \\"the Victorian ballot\\" for the rest of the 19th century. Nicholson returned to Melbourne in 1858, and in 1859 was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of Murray. Later that year, he shifted to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), which he represented until 1864. When the conservative government of Premier John O'Shanassy was defeated in October 1859, Nicholson became Premier and Chief Secretary. Much of Nicholson's premiership was spent trying to pass a bill which would have allowed small farmers to settle on the grazing lands appropriated by the squatters, but it encountered strong opposition from the Legislative Council, which was dominated by landowners. When the Council severely amended the bill there were riots outside Parliament House. This stiffened conservative resistance and the bill was eventually passed in a much weaker form, which the squatters easily evaded. This failure led to Nicholson's resignation in November 1860. Late life Nicholson did not hold office again. Parallel to his serving as the premier of Victoria, however, he also fulfilled the duties of Chairman of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. In 1860 he also held his third office, that of the Secretary of the Royal Society of Victoria.

It is the first of seven novels in the Shadow Children series. In 2013 it was one of the ten most taught texts in United States' middle schools. Plot summary In a dystopian future, after a shortage of food and overpopulation, families are limited to two children. Luke Garner, a 12-year-old boy, lives on a farm with his mother, father, and two brothers. As a third child, Luke and his parents are in violation of a law called the population law. Luke, like all third children, must spend his days hidden or away from public view, or else they will be killed or imprisoned, as well as their families. When the government starts building houses in the woods behind the Garners' house for rich, elite people who are Government officials, Luke is forced to hide in his house. During the day, when Luke's brothers are at school, and his parents are at work, Luke is home alone. One day, Luke sees the face of a child in a window of a house that he knows already has two children. About a month later, he secretly runs over to the house out of curiosity and is caught by Jen, the child who he saw in the window. She reveals that she is also a Shadow Child, a third child, just like Luke. Jen introduces Luke to a chatroom on her computer where he meets other Shadow Children like him. Jen and Luke become friends and Luke visits Jen as much as he can. Jen, who strongly disagrees with the Government, shows Luke books that explain what the Government is doing wrong. He takes these books home. Luke feels guilty for being born because the books tell him that Shadow Children use up resources that other people and animals are supposed to use. Luke then learns about the upcoming rally. Luke finally confesses that he doesn't want to go because he is too afraid. Jen, who feels betrayed, gets upset and tells him to leave as she doesn't need him anymore. He is annoyed and angry at Jen and wishes that the Population Police would shoot her during the rally. After thinking that, he realizes that he shouldn't have thought that. The next morning, Luke is paranoid about what has happened. There has been no report of any rally. Growing more afraid of what may have happened to Jen, after a few months, he breaks into her home again, but there is no sign of her. He runs into the computer room and logs into the chatroom. He sends a message in the chatroom asking where Jen is, but there is no reply. Overcome with his emotions, he reacts too slow as the door opens and a man steps into the room with a gun. He asks who Luke is and how he knows Jen's identity. Luke reveals himself as another Shadow Child who is friends with Jen. He demands to know where Jen is. The man, who is Jen's father, lowers the gun. He explains that Jen and all forty other children were shot and killed in the rally. Luke asks where were the other children because he was told that there would be a thousand. Mr. Talbot explains that she had too much faith in the other children. The Population Police suddenly turn up and demand to come in. The chatroom Luke had sent messages in had been secretly monitored after the rally. Luke hides while Mr. Talbot, who is revealed to be working for the Population Police as well, sorts things out. Mr. Talbot is on Luke's side and wants to avenge his daughter. Mr. Talbot forges a fake I.D. for Luke, so he can travel far away. Luke begins a new life as Lee Grant. He gets sent to a boarding school miles away from his farm and family, where he begins his new life.

Population: 6,713 (1897). Town name in other languages Two important treaties between the Russian Empire and Manchu China mention Nerchinsk: the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk and the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta. Non-Russian comments on these treaties or on the history of the town may mention other names: *Latin: Nipchou or Nipcha (however, the Treaty of Kyakhta called the town Nipkoa) *Manchu: Nibcu hoton *Chinese: Â∞ºÂ∏ÉÊ•ö; Pinyin: N√≠b√πch«î History View of Nerchinsk, from Eberhard Isbrand Ides (1710), Driejaarige reize naar China (Dutch edition) A 1900 postcard showing the Butin Palace in Nerchinsk The fort of Nerchinsk dates from 1654. founded the town four years later; in that year he opened direct communication between the Russian settlements in Transbaikalia and those on the Amur River which had been founded by Cossacks and fur-traders from the Yakutsk region. In 1689 Russia and China signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which stopped the farther advance of the Russians into the basin of the Amur for two centuries (see Sino-Russian border conflicts). After that, Nerchinsk became the chief center for Russian trade with China. The opening of the western route through Mongolia, via Urga, and the establishment of a custom-house at Kyakhta in 1728 diverted this trade into a new channel. But Nerchinsk acquired fresh importance from the influx of immigrants, mostly exiles, into eastern Dauria, from the discovery of rich mines and from the arrival of great numbers of convicts to the Nerchinsk katorga. Ultimately Nerchinsk became the chief town of Transbaikalia. The famous English adventurer and engineer Samuel Bentham visited Nerchinsk in 1782. Bentham had seen a potential for Nerchinsk as a base for access to the Sea of Okhotsk, provided the Chinese would authorize navigation on the Amur River. Such a venture would have opened up the possibility of fur trade with the Pacific Ocean, as far as the Chinese port of Canton. In 1812, Nerchinsk was transferred from the banks of the Shilka to its present site, on account of floods. The town relinquished its supremacy to Chita in the late 19th century, when the Trans-Siberian Railway bypassed it. According to George Kennan, \\"a few of the Decembrist conspirators of 1825\\" and \\"thousands of Polish insurgents\\" from their unsuccessful insurrection of 1863\\" were transported to the Nerchinsk silver-mining district. =20th century= In the early 20th century, Nerchinsk was built of wood, and its lower areas frequently suffered from inundations. The inhabitants supported themselves mainly by agriculture, tobacco-growing and cattle-breeding; a few merchants traded in furs and cattle, in brick-tea from China, and in manufactured wares from Russia. Gold-mines in the vicinity were owned and developed by the Butin family of merchants, whose Neo-Moorish palace now accessible for visitors.  Nerchinsk today  Nerchinsk is home to some small electromechanical and food- processing industries. It has a small museum, established in 1884. Among its sights are the Resurrection Cathedral, built in the Neoclassical style in 1825 to commemorate the city's relocation, its belltower destroyed by the Communists. The site of old Nerchinsk is marked by the Assumption Monastery, the oldest in Dauria, founded in 1664. Its cathedral, consecrated in 1712, is the easternmost building in the Muscovite Baroque style. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nerchinsk serves as the administrative center of Nerchinsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Units and the Inhabited Localities of Zabaykalsky Krai As a municipal division, the town of Nerchinsk, together with one rural locality (the selo of Makeyevka), is incorporated within Nerchinsky Municipal District as Nerchinskoye Urban Settlement.Law #317-ZZK Transportation The Nerchinsk Airport is a former air-base located northwest of the town.

An extraterrestrial, he resembles an anthropomorphic rodent, such as a squirrel or chipmunk. Publication history Ch'p first appeared in Green Lantern vol. 2 #148 was created by Paul Kupperberg and Don Newton.Green Lantern vol. 2 #184 Fictional character biography Ch'p's early history was recounted in Green Lantern Corps #203. A native of the planet H'lven, he participated in the defense of his homeworld from an invasion by the Crabster army of Doctor Ub'x. He was captured and sentenced to death, but one of the Guardians of the Universe came secretly to induct him into the Corps with the power ring of his predecessor, who had fallen attempting to stop the invasion. Using the ring, Ch'p was able to defeat Doctor Ub'x and free his world. Shortly afterwardGreen Lantern (current series) #31 he travelled to Oa where he was instructed by Kilowog in the same group of recruits as Hal Jordan. Ch'p went on to become the Green Lantern of sector 1014, and became good friends with Jordan, Mogo, Salaak and other members of the Green Lantern Corps. Ch'p maintained a secret identity on H'lven until he married his longtime girlfriend M'nn'e. While not serving the Guardians on Oa, Ch'p defended H'lven from various threats, many of them engineered by his old nemesis Doctor Ub'x. Ch'p's history as a Green Lantern was fairly typical until his participation in the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Since the crisis had affected the entire universe, it was thus also a Crisis on Infinite H'lvens, and when he returned to his home, he discovered that history had been rewritten so that he had died in an accident fifteen years earlier. In the new timeline, his wife M'nn'e had remarried his best friend, D'll. Stunned and disheartened, Ch'p abandoned H'lven for Earth, where he served with the team of Green Lanterns that were assigned to safeguard the planet. Unlike the rest of the universe, the members of the Corps were able to recall pre-Crisis events. They were thus the only people who recalled the Green Lantern from H'lven. During this period, Ch'p once again battled Doctor Ub'x, the only other person from H'lven who recalled the pre-Crisis timeline. The two adversaries eventually realized the important connection they shared and set aside their differences. Ch'p's experiences on Earth were primarily negative, such as his shocked realization that his Earthly counterparts were non-sapient animals, so he eventually returned to H'lven to start over. When the power battery on Oa was destroyed following the execution of Sinestro, Ch'p's ring was one of the few that still functioned. The strain of living on a world where nobody remembered him led to depression and a suicide attempt that was halted by his fellow Green Lantern, Salaak, who became Ch'p's advisor and friend on H'lven. The two friends later travelled to Oa to participate in the reconstruction of the Green Lantern Corps. Ch'p was assigned to patrol Oa, specifically the makeshift city called Mosaic World.Green Lantern: Mosaic #2 There he teams up with John Stewart who is under the subtle influence of Sinestro. A yellow tractor-trailer hits and kills Ch'p. An image of the deceased Ch'p occasionally appears to the Green Lantern John Stewart, although the exact nature of the apparition was never fully explained. When the Corps was re-founded following the defeat of Parallax, another native of H'lven, B'dg, was selected as the new Green Lantern of Sector 1014. Ch'p has appeared in numerous ways since his death. He is shown in an Alex Ross painting of the Green Lantern Corps; and in one of the last Kyle Rayner Green Lantern stories, where Kyle visits his sector. In an issue of the DC comic book 52, the character Ambush Bug is shown enjoying a snack food called \\"Ch'ps\\" that apparently has a certain space squirrel as a mascot. Ch'p also appeared in a flashback story in the current Green Lantern series (#31) training in the same class as Hal Jordan. =Blackest Night= Ch'p is one of the many fallen Lanterns to be risen from his grave on Oa to become a Black Lantern.

Kilowog reveals he was planning on going anyway, but that he \\"just wanted to see Hal fight the squirrel.\\" He later assists Hal in rescuing Aya from the Guardians' labs, where she is about to be dissected.

The Lubbock Lights incident received national publicity in the United States as a UFO sighting. The Lubbock Lights were investigated by the U.S. Air Force in 1951. The Air Force initially believed the lights were caused by a type of bird called a plover, but eventually concluded that the lights \\"weren't birds... but they weren't spaceships...the [Lubbock Lights] have been positively identified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural phenomenon.\\" However, to maintain the anonymity of the scientist who had provided the explanation, the Air Force refrained from providing any details regarding their explanation for the lights. The sightings The first publicized sighting of the lights occurred on August 25, 1951, at around 9 pm. Three professors from Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University), located in Lubbock, were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's homes when they observed the \\"lights\\" fly overhead. A total of 20-30 lights, as bright as stars but larger in size, flew over the yard in a matter of seconds. The professors immediately ruled out meteors as a possible cause for the sightings, and as they discussed their sighting a second, similar, group of lights flew overhead.Ruppelt, pp. 97-99 The three professors - Dr. A.G. Oberg, chemical engineer, Dr. W.L. Ducker, a department head and petroleum engineer, and Dr. W.I. Robinson, a geologist - reported their sighting to the local newspaper, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. Following the newspaper's article, three women in Lubbock reported that they had observed \\"peculiar flashing lights\\" in the sky on the same night as the professor's sightings. Dr. Carl Hemminger, a professor of German at Texas Tech, also reported seeing the objects, as did the head of the college's journalism department.Clark, p. 343 The three professors became determined to view the objects again and perhaps discover their identity. On September 5, 1951, all three men, along with two other professors from Texas Tech, were sitting in Dr. Robinson's frontyard when the lights flew overhead. According to Dr. Grayson Mead the lights \\"appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in color. They were smaller than the full moon at the horizon. There were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights... they were absolutely circular... it gave all of us... an extremely eerie feeling.\\" Mead claimed that the lights could not have been birds, but he also stated that they \\"went over so fast... that we wished we could have had a better look.\\" The professors observed one formation of lights flying above a thin cloud at about ; this allowed them to calculate that the lights were traveling at over .Clark, pp. 343-344 The Hart photographs On the evening of August 30, 1951, Carl Hart, Jr., a freshman at Texas Tech, was lying in bed looking out of the window of his room when he observed a group of 18-20 white lights in a \\"v\\" formation flying overhead. Hart took a 35-mm Kodak camera and walked to the backyard of his parents‚Äô home to see if the lights would return. Two more flights passed overhead, and Hart was able to take a total of five photos before they disappeared.(Ruppelt, p. 100) After having the photos developed Hart took them to the offices of the Lubbock Avalanche- Journal. After examining the photos the newspaper's editor, Jay Harris, told Hart that he would print them in the paper, but that he would \\"run him (Hart) out of town\\" if the photos were fake. When Hart assured him that the photos were genuine, Harris paid Hart $10 for the pictures. The photographs were soon reprinted in newspapers around the nation, and were printed in Life magazine, thus giving them wide publicity.(Clark, p. 346) The physics laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio analyzed the Hart photographs. After an extensive analysis and investigation of the photos, Lieutenant Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of the Air Force's Project Blue Book, released a written statement to the press that \\"the [Hart] photos were never proven to be a hoax, but neither were they proven to be genuine.\\"(Ruppelt, pp. 105-107) Hart has consistently maintained to this day that the photos are genuine. Curiously, the Texas Tech professors claimed that the photos did not represent what they had seen, since their objects had flown in a \\"u\\" formation instead of the \\"v\\" formation depicted in Hart's photos.(Ruppelt, p. 106) Air Force investigation and controversy In late September 1951, Lieutenant Ruppelt read about the Lubbock Lights and decided to investigate them.(Ruppelt, p. 98) Project Blue Book, founded in 1948 as Project Sign, was the Air Force's official research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. Ruppelt traveled to Lubbock and interviewed the professors, Carl Hart, and others who claimed to have witnessed the lights. Ruppelt's conclusion at the time was that the professors had seen a type of bird called a plover.(Ruppelt, p. 110) The city of Lubbock had installed new vapor street lights in 1951, and Ruppelt believed that the plovers, flying over Lubbock in their annual migration, were reflecting the new street lights at night. Witnesses who supported this assertion were T.E. Snider, a local farmer who on August 31, 1951 had observed some birds flying over a drive-in movie theater; the birds' undersides were reflected in the light.(Clark, p. 345) Another witness, Joe Bryant, had been sitting outside his home with his wife on August 25 - the same night on which the three professors had first seen the lights. According to Bryant, he and his wife had seen a group of lights fly overhead, and then two other flights. Like the professors, they were at first baffled by the objects, but when the third group of lights passed overhead they began to circle the Bryants' home. Mr. Bryant and his wife then noticed that the lights were actually plovers, and could hear them as well.(Ruppelt, pp. 101-102) In addition, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and one of Project Blue Book's scientific consultants, contacted one of the Texas Tech professors in 1959 and learned that the professor, after careful research, had concluded that he had actually been observing the plovers.(Clark, p. 349) However, not everyone agreed with this explanation. William Hams, the chief photographer for the Lubbock Avalanche- Journal, took several nighttime photos of birds flying over Lubbock's vapor street lights and found that he could not duplicate Hart's photos - the images were too dim to be developed.(Clark, p. 346) Dr. J.C. Cross, the head of Texas Tech's biology department, ruled out the possibility that birds could have caused the sightings.(Clark, p. 346) A game warden Ruppelt interviewed felt that the sightings could not have been caused by plovers, due to their slow speed () and tendency to fly in groups much smaller than the number of objects reported by eyewitnesses.(Ruppelt, p. 102) The warden did admit that an unusually large number of plovers had been seen in the fall of 1951. Dr. Mead, who had observed the lights, strongly disputed the plover explanation: \\"these objects were too large for any bird...I have had enough experience hunting and I don't know of any bird that could go this fast we would not be able to hear...to have gone as fast as this, to be birds, they would have to have been exceedingly low to disappear quite so quickly.\\"(Clark, p. 344) In his 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Ruppelt rejected the plover hypothesis but declined to say what the lights were: \\"They weren't birds, they weren't refracted light, but they weren't spaceships. The lights... have been positively identified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural phenomenon. It is very unfortunate that I can't divulge... the way the answer was found.... Telling the story would lead to [the identity of the scientist who \\"finally hit upon the answer\\"] and... I promised the man complete anonymity.\\"(Ruppelt, p. 110) The flying wing While investigating the Lubbock Lights, Ruppelt also learned that several people in and around Lubbock claimed to have seen a \\"flying wing\\" moving over the city.(Clark, p. 347) Among the witnesses was the wife of Dr. Ducker, who reported that in August 1951 she had observed a \\"huge, soundless flying wing\\" pass over her house.(Clark, p. 347) Ruppelt knew that the US Air Force did possess a \\"flying wing\\" jet bomber, and he felt that at least some of the sightings had been caused by the bomber, although he could not explain why, according to the witnesses, the wing made no sound as it flew overhead. Publicity and media The Lubbock Lights were one of the best-publicized events in American UFO history. In April 1952 Life magazine published a popular article about the UFO phenomenon;LIFE link 1; LIFE link 2 the Lubbock Lights were a prominent feature of the article. Lieutenant (later Captain) Ruppelt devoted an entire chapter of his bestselling 1956 book to the incident.(Ruppelt, pp. 96-110) A novel, by Dr. David Wheeler, focuses on the Lubbock Lights. In 1994, the Albuquerque-based progressive rock band Skumbaag staged a rock opera called \\"The Lubbock Lights- a melodrama and interpretive ballet\\". In November 1999, Dallas, Texas-based television station KDFW aired a news story about the Lubbock Lights. Reporter Richard Ray interviewed Carl Hart, Jr. about taking the famous photos and being investigated by the U.S. Air Force. The coverage concluded that after decades of intense scrutiny, Hart's photos are still among the most remarkable and vexing in UFO history. The Lubbock Lights were featured prominently in the 2002 Sci Fi Channel miniseries Taken, in which one alien poses as a human in the Lubbock area for a brief period of time. In 2005, a film called Lubbock Lights was released about the music scene in Lubbock which describes some theories about the lights by the musicians from the area. In 2006, Lubbock-based alternative country band Thrift Store Cowboys wrote and recorded a song entitled \\"Lubbock Lights\\" on their third album, Lay Low While Crawling or Creeping. The third episode of the 2019 History Channel television series Project Blue Book is entitled \\"The Lubbock Lights\\", and is based on the Lubbock Lights incident.https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/history-project-blue- book-aiden-gillen-ufos-ancien.html  See also  Marfa lights *List of UFO sightings References SourcesClark, Jerome. \\"The Lubbock Lights\\", from The UFO Book.

The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy (2004) defines \\"neo- pragmatism\\" as \\"A postmodern version of pragmatism developed by the American philosopher Richard Rorty and drawing inspiration from authors such as John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Wilfrid Sellars, W. V. O. Quine, and Jacques Derrida\\". It's a contemporary term for a philosophy which reintroduces many concepts from pragmatism. While traditional pragmatism focuses on experience, Rorty centers on language. The self is regarded as a \\"centerless web of beliefs and desires\\". It repudiates the notions of universal truth, epistemological foundationalism, representationalism, and epistemic objectivity. It is a nominalist approach that denies that natural kinds and linguistic entities have substantive ontological implications. Rorty denies that the subject-matter of the human sciences can be studied in the same ways as we study the natural sciences.Bunnin & Yu, The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, 2007, p. 467. It has been associated with a variety of other thinkers including Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson,Malpas, Jeff, \\"Donald Davidson\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = though none of these figures have called themselves \\"neopragmatists\\". The following contemporary philosophers are also often considered to be neopragmatists: Nicholas Rescher (a proponent of methodological pragmatism and pragmatic idealism), J√ºrgen Habermas, Susan Haack, Robert Brandom, and Cornel West.  Background  = \\"Anglo-analytic\\" influences = Neopragmatists, particularly Rorty and Putnam, draw on the ideas of classical pragmatists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Putnam, in Words and Life (1994) enumerates the ideas in the classical pragmatist tradition, which newer pragmatists find most compelling. To paraphrase Putnam: #Complete skepticism (the notion that a belief in philosophical skepticism requires as much justification as other beliefs); #Fallibilism (the view that there are no metaphysical guarantees against the need to revise a belief); #Antidualism about \\"facts\\" and \\"values\\"; #That practice, properly construed, is primary in philosophy. (WL 152) Neopragmatism is distinguished from classical pragmatism (the pragmatism of James, Dewey, Pierce, and Mead) primarily due to the influence of the linguistic turn in philosophy that occurred in the early and mid-twentieth century. The linguistic turn in philosophy reduced talk of mind, ideas, and the world to language and the world. Philosophers stopped talking about the ideas or concepts one may have present in one's mind and started talking about the \\"mental language\\" and terms used to employ these concepts. In the early twentieth century philosophers of language (e.g. A.J. Ayer, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore) thought that analyzing language would bring about the arrival of meaning, objectivity, and ultimately, truth concerning external reality. In this tradition, it was thought that truth was obtained when linguistic terms stood in a proper correspondence relation to non- linguistic objects (this can be called \\"representationalism\\"). The thought was that in order for a statement or proposition to be true it must give facts which correspond to what is actually present in reality. This is called the correspondence theory of truth and is to be distinguished from a neo-pragmatic conception of truth. There were many philosophical inquiries during the mid- twentieth century which began to undermine the legitimacy of the methodology of the early Anglo-analytic philosophers of language. W. V. O. Quine in Word and Object, originally published in 1960, attacked the notion of our concepts having any strong correspondence to reality. Quine argued for ontological relativity which attacked the idea that language could ever describe or paint a purely non-subjective picture of reality. More specifically, ontological relativity is the thesis that the things we believe to exist in the world are wholly dependent on our subjective, \\"mental languages\\". A 'mental language' is simply the way words which denote concepts in our minds are mapped to objects in the world. Quine's argument for ontological relativity is roughly as follows: # All ideas and perceptions concerning reality are given to our minds in terms of our own mental language. # Mental languages specify how objects in the world are to be constructed from our sense data. # Different mental languages will specify different ontologies (different objects existing in the world). # There is no way to perfectly translate between two different mental languages; there will always be several, consistent ways in which the terms in each language can be mapped onto the other. # Reality apart from our perceptions of it can be thought of as constituting a true, object language, that is, the language which specifies how things actually are. # There is no difference in translating between two mental languages and translating between the object language of reality and one's own mental language. # Therefore, just as there is no objective way of translating between two mental languages (no one-to-one mapping of terms in one to terms in the other) there is no way of objectively translating (or fitting) the true, object language of reality into our own mental language. # And therefore, there are many ontologies (possibly an infinite number) that can be consistently held to represent reality. (see Chapter 2, in Word and Object). The above argument is reminiscent of the theme in neopragmatism against the picture theory of language, the idea that the goal of inquiry is to represent reality correctly with one's language. A second critically influential philosopher to the neo- pragmatist is Thomas Kuhn who argued that our languages for representing reality, or what he called \\"paradigms\\", are only as good as they produce possible future experiments and observations. Kuhn, being a philosopher of science, argued in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions that \\"scientific progress\\" was a kind of a misnomer; for Kuhn, we make progress in science whenever we throw off old scientific paradigms with their associated concepts and methods in favor of new paradigms which offer novel experiments to be done and new scientific ontologies. For Kuhn 'electrons' exist just so much as they are useful in providing us with novel experiments which will allow us to uncover more about the new paradigm we have adopted. Kuhn believes that different paradigms posit different things to exist in the world and are therefore incommensurable with each other. Another way of viewing this is that paradigms describe new languages, which allow us to describe the world in new ways. Kuhn was a fallibilist; he believed that all scientific paradigms (e.g. classical Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian relativity) should be assumed to be, on the whole, false but good for a time as they give scientists new ideas to play around with. Kuhn's fallibilism, holism, emphasis on incommensurability, and ideas concerning objective reality are themes which often show up in neopragmatist writings. Wilfrid Sellars argued against foundationalist justification in epistemology and was therefore also highly influential to the neopragmatists, especially Rorty.deVries, Willem, \\"Wilfrid Sellars\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL= =\\"Continental\\" influences= Philosophers such as Derrida and Heidegger and their views on language have been highly influential to neopragmatist thinkers like Richard Rorty. Rorty has also emphasised the value of \\"historicist\\" or \\"genealogical\\" methods of philosophy typified by Continental thinkers such as Foucault. = Wittgenstein and language games = The \\"later\\" Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Philosophical Investigations argues contrary to his earlier views in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus that the role of language is not to describe reality but rather to perform certain actions in communities. The language-game is the concept Wittgenstein used to emphasize this. Wittgenstein believed roughly that: # Languages are used to obtain certain ends within communities. # Each language has its own set of rules and objects to which it refers. # Just as board games have rules guiding what moves may be made so do languages within communities where the moves to be made within a language game are the types of objects that may be talked about intelligibly. # Two people participating in two different language-games cannot be said to communicate in any relevant way. Many of the themes found in Wittgenstein are found in neopragmatism. Wittgenstein's emphasis of the importance of \\"use\\" in language to accomplish communal goals and the problems associated with trying to communicate between two different language games finds much traction in neopragmatist writings.  Richard Rorty and anti- representationalism  Richard Rorty was influenced by James, Dewey, Sellars, Quine, Kuhn, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and Heidegger. He found common implications in the writings of many of these philosophers. Namely, he believed that these philosophers were all in one way or another trying to hit on the thesis that our language does not represent things in reality in any relevant way. Rather than situating our language in ways in order to get things right or correct Rorty says in the Introduction to the first volume of his philosophical papers that we should believe that beliefs are only habits with which we use to react and adapt to the world. To Rorty getting things right as they are \\"in themselves\\" is useless if not downright meaningless. In 1995 Rorty wrote: \\"I linguisticize as many pre-linguistic-turn philosophers as I can, in order to read them as prophets of the utopia in which all metaphysical problems have been dissolved, and religion and science have yielded their place to poetry.\\" Rorty and Pragmatism: The Philosopher Responds to His Critics, edited by Herman J. Saatkamp (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1995). This \\"linguistic turn\\" strategy aims to avoid what Rorty sees as the essentialisms (\\"truth,\\" \\"reality,\\" \\"experience\\") still extant in classical pragmatism. Rorty writes: \\"Analytic philosophy, thanks to its concentration on language, was able to defend certain crucial pragmatist theses better than James and Dewey themselves. [...] By focusing our attention on the relation between language and the rest of the world rather than between experience and nature, post- positivistic analytic philosophy was able to make a more radical break with the philosophical tradition.\\" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society 21, no. 1 (Winter 1985).  Distinguished from idealism and epistemic relativism  One way to understand the motivation and themes of the neopragmatist is to understand how neopragmatism (and pragmatism in general) distinguishes itself from both idealism and relativism. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from idealism primarily in the fact that it does not, like idealism, believe that what is actually in the world is affected in any way by what individuals believe concerning it. Neopragmatism holds to the doctrine of a mind-independent reality while simultaneously maintaining that this world is not knowable in the classical Cartesian sense of the word \\"know\\". The neopragmatist views mind-independent reality to causally influence people's minds but whatever way that influence may be on the individual mind is up to the individual. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from epistemic relativism on the force of the idea that in order to be an epistemic relativist one must be concerned about getting one's ideas \\"right\\" in relation to reality. The neopragmatist thesis views this to be a concern which is of no use and therefore is to be discarded. Neopragmatists hold that it makes no sense to talk about getting reality right due to the fact that this adds no utility to do so. The neopragmatist is concerned with developing beliefs and habits which allow one to adapt to one's environment with success rather than generating pictures used in order to describe reality. Since neopragmatism lacks any concern for generating descriptive pictures of reality the whole question of epistemic relativism is meaningless.

While in Dano-Norwegian service she participated in an action at Tripoli, North Africa. She served the Royal Navy as the fifth rate HMS Nyaden (or Nijaden) from 1808 until 1812 when she was broken up. During her brief British service she participated in some small attacks in the Barents Sea during the Anglo-Russian War. Design Najaden was the first ship that the great Danish naval architect F.C.H. Hohlenberg designed after he returned home from training abroad. She had several revolutionary innovations and bore more resemblance to 19th century sailing warships than 18th century examples.The Danish ending \\"en\\" equates to the definite article in English; when captured British ships were brought into Danish service they gained an article as part of the name - see \\"The Seagull\\" HMS Nymphen was the only other member of the class. Najaden had a slab-sided hull and the typical Hohlenberg pinkie stern, with a place for two stern chaser guns. Gardiner suggests that the pinkie stern and increased tumblehome towards the stern permitted the vessel to fire over the quarters. Naval warfare in the Baltic made extensive use of oared gunboats, which would fire on becalmed vessels from the quarter, an angle that normally broadside guns could not cover. The pinkie stern was unpopular with the British, who removed it when they refitted her. Compared to many British frigates of the same period, her main gun deck ports were closer to the water (at when loaded with full supplies), and she had less carrying capacity for supplies. This made sense as Hohlenberg expected that her primary area for operations would be the Baltic. But it would have been difficult for her to be in full action in heavy weather in the open Atlantic. Dano-Norwegian service Najaden at Tripoli in 1797, Royal Danish Naval Museum In the action of 16 May 1797, Najaden, under Captain John Hoppe, with Captain Steen Andersen Bille in overall command, led a small squadron that also included and a hired xebec in an attack at Tripoli. The battle lasted for about two hours before the Tripolitans retreated. The Danes suffered one man killed and one wounded. As a result of the Danish victory, the Bey of Tripoli signed a peace treaty with Denmark on 25 May. British service The British captured Najaden at the Battle of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807. Lieutenant John Gore brought her home in October. She was to be renamed Hephaestion but the Admiralty canceled the name change. After refit she joined the British Navy as HMS Nyaden (sometimes given as Nijaden). =Anglo-Russian War= Nyaden was commissioned under Captain Frederick Cottrell (or Cotterell) in February 1809 and may have sailed for Greenland on 2 March. Under Cottrell Nyaden participated in at least one and possibly two actions during the Anglo-Russian War. In June 1809 her boats, under the command of her senior lieutenant, A. Wells, participated in a night raid on Kildin Island that wiped out a Russian garrison. Boats from the Nyaden also captured some 22 or 23 coastal trading vessels in the Kola River, many upriver from the present city of Murmansk. The landing party took away the fort's guns or threw them into the Kola River. On 9 June Nyaden captured the Russian vessels Peter Metropolite, Neptune, and Magnum Brostrum, for which prize money was paid on 4 July 1811. Then on 15 June Nyaden captured two Russian vessels, Rolla and Czar Constantine, for which prize money was paid on 23 February 1810. Unfortunately, it is unclear what connection, if any, these vessels had with the raid on Kildin. Nyaden was probably the vessel whose boats in July took possession of Catherine Harbour, in the ostrog or fortified settlement of Kola. The British also commandeered all the stores belonging to the White Sea Company (est. 1803 at Archangel), consisting of salt, cordage etc., as well as some vessels loaded with corn. The Times reported that this was the first attack of the English upon the Russian territory, news of the attack on Kildin Island either being subsumed or overlooked.The Times, 29 July 1809. The Russian account of the incident is that a British vessel sent two boats with 35 men under a lieutenant. Kola had been demilitarized during the reign of Paul I, but its citizens quickly formed a militia corps of about 300 men under the command of the merchant Matvey Gerasimov to resist the attack. However the Governor, fearing possible reprisals, forbade any resistance so most of population of the town (about a thousand souls) left Kola with their goods. The British sailors entered the town unopposed, sacked a wine store, looted what they could, arrested the Governor and officials, and singing their anthem, returned to their ship. They also captured all the vessels in the bay. =Leeward Islands= Nyaden sailed for the Leeward Islands on 14 January 1810. On the way, on 17 January, she and Dannemark, with in company, captured the brig Thomas. (Prize money was available for payment on 24 November 1812.) On 8 and 10 July Nyaden captured Marrimack and Sally. (Prize money was paid on 19 November 1816.) While she served in the Leeward Islands she suffered an epidemic of yellow fever that killed 47 of her crew. On 19 April 1811 Cottrell died of \\"a rapid consumption\\" while Nyaden was off Barbados. His replacement was Captain Robert Fowler. Later, she came under the command of Captain Farmery Predam Epworth. In the spring of 1812 she was carrying dispatches from Lisbon back to Great Britain when a flotilla of five French ships of the line that had escaped from Lorient spotted her. The French ships pursued Nyaden and shots were exchanged, but although some shots damaged her rigging, she managed to flee and warn a convoy of three East Indiamen, Northampton, Monarch, and . The French, bound for Brest, continued on their route without giving chase.James, op. cit., p.43 Fate Nyaden was broken up in May 1812. Post script The British took the lines off Najaden, and they are available at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The Royal Danish Naval Museum holds a set of the 1795/96 plans for the Najaden, signed by Hohlenberg.

Waccabuc is considered \\"New York's Secret Suburb\\" and is home to a \\"collection of privacy-loving C.E.O.‚Äôs and bright stars in other firmaments,\\" according to an Upstart Business Journal article about the tremendous number of notable residents in a hamlet of just a few hundred people. Waccabuc is known by many outside of the town for its Castle Rock. Before becoming its own hamlet, Waccabuc was originally a vacation retreat established by the Mead family, who are considered one of the First Families of Westchester. The retreat prided itself for having no \\"tramps, bars, or malaria.\\" A couple of the hamlet's handful of roads, such as \\"Tarry-a-Bit,\\" are named after the vacation house they originally served. Waccabuc Country Club's main clubhouse sits at the site of one of the original vacation houses. On July 1, 1956, Marilyn Monroe wed Arthur Miller in a Jewish ceremony at a private house in Waccabuc. Their nuptials were celebrated at the home of Miller's literary agent, Kay Brown. Some 30 friends and relatives attended the hastily arranged party. The Mead Memorial Chapel and The Homestead are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Waccabuc Historic District was listed on July 28, 2015. Demographics The total population of Waccabuc is just 851 people. Waccabuc is by far the smallest of Lewisboro's four hamlets, and the hamlet's strict zoning laws ensure that Waccabuc maintains a low population density not seen in any of the other hamlets. These factors combine to separate Waccabuc from the other hamlets of Lewisboro and project an image of exclusivity. The median household income, as of 2010, was $186,554 and the average household income was $240,258. Waccabuc has a per capita income of $79,819. The median home value was $1,243,423, earning Waccabuc a place on Forbes magazine's annual list of \\"America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes\\" and is listed above more recognizable towns in Westchester such as Scarsdale, Pound Ridge, and Chappaqua. Real estate brokers note that listings in Waccabuc priced at $600,000 could be teardown projects, despite being more than $100,000 above the median home value of the country overall. Residential property and conservation Waccabuc is set apart from the other hamlets of Lewisboro, as well as most other towns in Westchester, in that all property must be on a minimum of two acres of land and, on most streets, the property minimum increases to four acres of land, the exception being the Hunt Farm development on hamlet's outskirts. To further maintain the beauty of Waccabuc, a 100-acre piece of land was bought by all residents of Waccabuc through the Waccabuc Land Owner's Association for conservation purposes as well as to provide hiking trails. The Mead Memorial Chapel and The Homestead are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the hamlet itself is a designated historic district. A 2005 NYT story on the hamlet captured the social function of the Post Office and the locals' efforts to preserve and maintain it.

In the summer of 1862, the federal government failed to deliver annuities in a timely way, and there were rumors that the 'Great Council' Congress had expended all their gold fighting the great Civil War and could not send any money to the indians, which left the Dakota starving. Little Crow supported the decision of a Dakota war council in August 1862 to try to drive the whites out of the region. Little Crow led warriors in the Dakota War of 1862, but retreated in September 1862 before the war's conclusion in December of that year. Little Crow was shot and killed on July 3, 1863 by two white settlers, a man and his son. He was scalped and his body was taken to Hutchinson, Minnesota, where it was ritually humiliated and mutilated by white settlers. Some time later his remains were exhumed by Army troops, and eventually the Minnesota Historical Society held and displayed them publicly. In 1971 the Society repatriated his remains, giving them to his grandson. He had Little Crow reinterred at the First Presbyterian Church and Cemetery in Flandreau, South Dakota. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Early life Little Crow at Traverse des Sioux, 1851 Little Crow was born at the Dakota settlement of Kaposia just below present-day Indian Mounds Park. His father died in 1846 after accidentally discharging a gun. Band leadership was disputed between Little Crow and his brother. They had an armed fight that resulted in Little Crow being wounded in both wrists. This left scars that he concealed with long sleeves for the rest of his life. He had a third physical oddity, a double row of teeth. By 1849, Little Crow took control of his band. In 1851, the United States negotiated the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and the Treaty of Mendota with the Dakota people. Little Crow was present at Traverse des Sioux and signed the Mendota treaty,Mayer (1986), pp. 149, 202, 242. by which the bands agreed to move to land set aside along the Minnesota River to the west of their traditional territory. The treaty as ratified by the United States Senate removed Article 3 of the treaty, which had set aside this land. The tribe was compelled to negotiate a new treaty, under threat of forcible removal to the Dakota Territory, and was granted land only on one side of the river. Little Crow tried to adapt to customs of the United States.Brown, Dee (1970) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, , chapter 2: \\"Little Crow's War\\" He visited President James Buchanan in Washington, D.C., replaced his native clothing with trousers and jackets with brass buttons, joined the Episcopal Church, and took up farming. However, by 1862, his band was starving. Crops had failed on their small reservation, game was overhunted, and Congress failed to pay the annuities mandated by treaty. Payments were delayed because of the outbreak of the American Civil War. As the tribe grew hungry and as food languished in traders' warehouses at the Sioux agencies, Little Crow's ability to restrain his people deteriorated. Dakota War of 1862 Little Crow, c. 1862 Little Crow's wife and two children at Fort Snelling prison compound, 1864 On August 4, 1862, about five hundred Dakota broke into food warehouses at the Lower Agency. The agent in charge, Thomas J. Galbraith, ordered defending troops not to shoot and called for a council. At the conference, Little Crow pointed out that the Dakota were owed the money to buy the food and warned that \\"When men are hungry, they help themselves.\\" The representative of the traders, Andrew Myrick, replied, \\"So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass.\\" Within weeks, on August 17, 1862, a band of Dakota crossed paths with a group of white civilian settlers. The Dakota killed five of the settlers, mutilating their bodies in ritual fashion. The band's need for food and failures by the federal government and trades resulted in the Dakota War of 1862. Little Crow agreed to lead the bands through the conflict, even though he knew the whites could ultimately send larger numbers of troops into the conflict than his people could counter. The Dakota first attacked the Lower Sioux agency; they scalped Myrick and stuffed his mouth with grass in a sense of revenge. Under Taoyateduta's leadership, the Dakota had some success in the ambush of a small detachment of US troops under Captain Marsh at Redwood ferry, an attack on a burial party in the Battle of Birch Coulee, and killing many unprepared settlers. However, two Dakota attacks on Fort Ridgely were thwarted by soldiers and civilians who, although outnumbered, used the fort's cannon to drive off the attackers. Little Crow was wounded by cannon fire in the second attack on Fort Ridgely, and did not join the attack on New Ulm. The Dakota attacked New Ulm twice, and a collection of settlers and volunteers staved off the warriors although they were outnumbered. Attacks on Forest City, Hutchinson, and Fort Abercrombie were also repulsed. The Dakota attacked white civilians throughout the area. In the end, Little Crow's forces suffered a rout at the Battle of Wood Lake on September 23, 1862, after which Little Crow and many of his warriors fled west, taking three white boys with them as captives. One of the boys, George Washington Ingalls age 9 (cousin to author Laura Ingalls) had witnessed the killing and scalping of his father Jedidiah and the capture of his three sisters at the start of the conflict. By late spring 1863, Little Crow and his followers were camped near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. They ransomed the boys in early June 1863, in exchange for blankets and horses.\\"Dakota War Hoop\\" pgs 308-9, \\"A History of the Great Massacre by the Sioux Indians in Minnesota\\" pg 131 Bryant & Murch, \\"South Dakota Historical Collections\\", Vol 5, pp. 304-5, footnote #65, by the South Dakota State Historical Society. Death Wowinapa, or Thomas Wakeman, son of Little Crow. Deciding that the tribe must adopt a mobile existence, having been deprived of its territory in the War, Little Crow led a raiding party to steal horses from his former land in Minnesota. His people did not want to do this. On the evening of July 3, 1863, while he and his son Wowinapa were picking raspberries, they were spotted by Nathan Lamson and his son Chauncey. The four engaged in a brief firefight. Little Crow wounded the elder Lamson, but was mortally shot by both Lamson and his son. The chief told his own son to flee. The Lamsons separated, and each traveled the nearly 12 miles to Hutchinson, Minnesota to raise the alarm. The next day, a search party returned and found the body of an unidentified Dakota man. The body wore a coat they recognized as belonging to white settler James McGannon, who had been killed two days before. Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, Volume 15, pp. 367-370 They scalped the Dakota man, and later brought the body back to Hutchinson. They then dragged his body along the town's Main Street. Firecrackers were placed in his ears and nose and lit. The body was ultimately tossed into a pit at a slaughterhouse. It was later decapitated. Henry H. Cross, Little Crow. 1863. Minneapolis Institute of Art On July 28, 1863, Wowinapa was captured by US Army troops in the vicinity of Devil's Lake, Dakota Territory. He told the troops of Little Crow's death. Officials tracked down and exhumed the chief's body on August 16. Little Crow's identity was verified by his scarred wrists. The next year, the Legislature awarded Nathan Lamson $500 for \\"rendering great service to the State\\".Minnesota Special Laws 1864, Chapter 84 His son Chauncey Lamson received a $75 bounty for the scalp, although he had taken it the same day that the Adjutant General's bounty on Dakota warriors was declared on July 4, 1863., Minnesota History Magazine, pp. 150-153 The Minnesota Historical Society acquired Little Crow's scalp in 1868, and his skull in 1896. Other bones were collected at other times. These human trophies were displayed publicly for decades. In 1971, the Society returned Little Crow's remains to his grandson Jesse Wakeman (son of Wowinapa) for burial. A small stone memorial tablet was installed at the roadside of the field where Little Crow was killed. Legacy Sculpture mask of Little Crow at Minneapolis *In 1937, the city of Hutchinson erected a large bronze statue of Little Crow in a spot overlooking the Crow River near the Main Street bridge access to the downtown business district. It was created by local artist Les Kouba, who later became known for his wildlife art. *In 1971 Jesse Wakemen arranged to have the remains of his grandfather Little Crow reinterred at the First Presbyterian Church and Cemetery in Flandreau, South Dakota. The church and cemetery were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2017. *In 1982, sculptor Robert Johnson and Kouba created an updated statue of Little Crow for the city of Hutchinson, as the older one was weather beaten. It was removed in 2007 and held at the McLeod County Historical Society in order to allow construction of a new Main Street bridge across the river. Eheim Park was redesigned here, and the statue was planned to be reinstalled in a lower position in 2009, so that viewers could appreciate the symbols on the cape. The statue again overlooks the Crow River.\\"Where's Little Crow?\\" Editorial in the Hutchinson Leader, 7 May 2009; Accessed 26 Oct. 2012 *A mask commemorating Little Crow was installed near the waterfall in Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis, however the foundry says there is no correlation between Little Crow and the site.Per Note 58 on page 172, in Notes References Anderson, Gary Clayton.

It was one of the chief events which was to precipitate the English Civil War. Background Relations between King and Parliament had been uneasy since 1625, when Charles I, King of England married the French Roman Catholic Henrietta Maria. In 1626 Charles had dissolved Parliament in order to prevent it impeaching his favourite, the influential Duke of Buckingham. Being in need of money to carry on a war with Spain as part of his strategy for intervention in the Thirty Years War, Charles resorted to means of uncertain lawfulness to raise the necessary funds, imprisoning without charge those who refused to pay. This had resulted in Parliament presenting the King with the Petition of Right in 1628, in response to which Charles had again dismissed Parliament and for the next eleven years governed without it. In 1640, the situation had become desperate enough for Charles to summon Parliament again: faced with the Bishops' War in Scotland, he attempted to raise money for a new royal army and immediately dismissed the Parliament in May when it refused to accede. He attempted to send an army anyway, but starved of funds, the ill-equipped and poorly led English army was easily crushed by Scottish supporters of the National Covenant. Now in need of money to pay indemnities to the Scots, Charles was advised by a hastily summoned Magnum Concilium that he had no choice but to return to Parliament, which reassembled in November. The Grand Remonstrance First proposed by John Pym, the effective leader of opposition to the King in Parliament and taken up by George Digby, John Hampden and others, the Grand Remonstrance summarised all of Parliament's opposition to Charles's foreign, financial, legal and religious policies, setting forth 204 separate points of objection and calling for the expulsion of all bishops from Parliament, a purge of officials, with Parliament having a right of veto over Crown appointments, and an end to sale of land confiscated from Irish rebels. The document was careful not to make any direct accusation against the King himself, or any other named individual, instead blaming the state of affairs on a Roman Catholic conspiracy, made the easier by the King‚Äôs reconciliation with Spain and marriage to Henrietta Maria, a Roman Catholic. In tone it was strongly against the Church of Rome, taking the side of the Puritan party in the English church in opposition to William Laud, whom Charles had appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and who, by implication, was therefore placed at the heart of the implied plot. On 22 November 1641, following a protracted debate, the Grand Remonstrance was passed by a relatively narrow margin: 159 votes to 148. Its passage divided Parliament and drove some prominent parliamentarians such as Hyde and Falkland, who had previously been critical of the King, into the Royalist camp. At the same time, it strengthened the resolve of those who opposed what they saw as a drift toward Rome and Absolutism: Cromwell commented to Falkland that if the Grand Remonstrance had been defeated, 'I would have sold all I had the next morning and never seen England more; and I know there are many other honest men of the same resolution'.Firth, C. H. (1900) Oliver Cromwell and the Rule of the Puritans in England . In regard to church government, the Grand Remonstrance called for > A General Synod of the most grave, pious, learned and judicious divines of > this island, assisted with some from foreign parts professing the same > religion with us, who may consider all things necessary for the peace and > good government of the Church.J. Rushworth, Historical Collections, 1692, pt > III, i, 428, 450 The result was the establishment of the Westminster Assembly of Divines. The King's response The Grand Remonstrance was delivered to King Charles I on 1 December 1641, but he long delayed giving any response to it. Parliament therefore proceeded to have the document published and publicly circulated, forcing the King's hand. On 23 December, he gave his reply, refusing to remove the bishops. Charles insisted that none of his ministers were guilty of any crime so as to merit their removal and deferred any decision on Irish land until the conclusion of the war there. The king stated that he could not reconcile Parliament's view of the state of England with his own and that regarding religious affairs, in addition to affirming his opposition to Roman Catholicism, it was also necessary to protect the Church from 'many schismatics and separatists'. The response, drafted in consultation with Hyde, was an attempt at moderation calculated to win back the support of more moderate members of Parliament. In spite of this and concessions including the arrest of William Laud, subsequent events made reconciliation impossible.

In Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction, the term is more narrowly defined as: \\"the series of all events from past to future, especially when conceived of as one of many such series\\". Timestream is the normal passage or flow of time and its historical developments, within a given dimension of reality. The concept of the time stream, and the ability to travel within and around it, are the fundamentals of a genre of science fiction. This conception has been widely used in mythology and in fiction. This analogy is useful in several ways: * Streams flow only one way. Time moves only forward. * Streams flow constantly. Time never stops. * People can stand in a stream, but will be pulled along by it. People exist within time, but move with it.Science fiction scholar Paul Kincaid comments, \\"The time machine allows not movement in time (we already live in time, and a novelist has always been able to set a story in any future or past era), but transposition in time.\\" * Some physicists and science fiction writers have speculated that time is branching‚Äîit branches into alternate universes (see many-worlds interpretation). Streams can converge and also diverge. Science fiction scholar Andrew Sawyer writes, \\"The paradoxes of timedo we move in time, or does it move by us? Does it exist or is it merely an illusion of our limited perception?are puzzles that exercise both physicists and philosophers...\\" History Brian Stableford writes of the historical and philosophical concepts of time (and using the terminology of \\"flow\\"): The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus was famous for a statement that has been translated in many ways, most commonly as \\"No man ever steps in the same river twice,\\" which is often called his \\"flux [flow] doctrine.\\" An essayist for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explained it in this manner: \\"Everything is in flux (in the sense that 'everything is always flowing in some respects'...) ...\\"  Fiction  In fiction, an alternate continuity is sometimes called an alternate timestream. = Science fiction = The Time Stream, a 1946 science fiction novel by author John Taine (pseudonym of Eric Temple Bell), is the first novel to see time as a flowing stream. It was originally serialized in Wonder Stories, in four parts, from December, 1931, to March, 1932. Science fiction scholar E. F. Bleiler described how Taine employed the metaphor: > The basic concept is that time is a circular stream that runs eternally, > with far past blending into far future. It is possible for certain > individuals to enter this stream mentally and move in either direction, > although this is a dangerous venture, for they may be carried away > erratically by the stream. ... In San Francisco nine associates, who have > been troubled by occasional memories of [the planet] Eos, band together to > explore the time stream. They live out crisis moments in both times. Another mid-century novel which employed the term in its title was The Ship That Sailed the Time Stream (1965) by G. C. Edmondson (pseudonym of Jos√© Mario Garry Ordo√±ez Edmondson y Cotton). John Clute writes that this \\"and its sequel, To Sail the Century Sea (1981), are amusingly and graphically told Fantastic-Voyage tales involving a US ship and its inadvertent Time Travels. They remain his most successful books.\\" Other fiction titles with the term include J. Robert King's 1999 novel Time Streams (), Michael Moorcock's 1993 collection A Nomad of the Time Streams (), and Charles M. Saplak's short story \\"Backwater by the Time Stream\\" (Manifest Destiny #1, Winter 1993). Discussing the theme of parallel universes, in an encyclopedia article which can usefully be applied to the concept of timestreams, Brian Stableford and David Langford write, > \\"A parallel world is another universe situated 'alongside' our own, > displaced from it along a spatial fourth Dimension (parallel worlds are > often referred to in sf as 'other dimensions'). Although whole universes may > lie parallel in this sense, most stories focus on parallel Earths. The > parallel-world idea forms a useful framework for the notion of Alternate > History, and is often used in this way... > The idea that other worlds lie parallel to our own and occasionally connect > with it is one of the oldest speculative ideas in literature and legend; > examples range from Fairyland to the 'astral plane' of Spiritualists and > mystics. There are two basic folkloristic themes connected with the notion; > in one, an ordinary human is translocated into a fantasy land where s/he > undergoes adventures and may find the love and fulfilment that remain beyond > reach on Earth; in the other, a communication or visitation from the other > world affects the life of an individual within this world, often injuring or > destroying that person. Both patterns are very evident in modern imaginative > fiction, shaping whole subgenres... > A common variant of the theme is that of a multiplicity of almost-identical > worlds existing in parallel: alternate worlds in which there has been no > significant change.\\" = Fantasy fiction = Rick Sutcliffe provides a definition in a brief essay on his own fiction: \\"The timestream is an alternate history device used in Rick Sutcliffe's fiction. It is the medium in which the various alternate earths exist, or, if one prefers, it provides the connections among them, in the manner of C. S. Lewis' wood between the worlds  a place between.\\" While not discussing the timestream per se, scholar John Grant discusses a related topic, that of the time slip: \\"Generally protagonists [return] to their starting points but a frequent device is that, after repeated timeslips, the 'traveler' chooses to remain in the other period. Generally there is an emotional or psychological connection of some kind between the character and the earlier time  most often love... Unsurprisingly, timeslips are a staple of the subgenre of romance fiction called the Paranormal Romance, exemplified by Diana Gabaldson's Outlander (1991) and its sequels.\\"  Examples  Examples of the usage of timestream: * In DC Comics, the timestream is an invisible current that flows through the DC Universe. It is used as a way for heroes like the Linear Men, and especially Waverider, to travel and correct time fluctuations from time traveling supervillains who seek to alter the correct reality. The timestream was mainly used by Waverider during Armageddon 2001, Death of Superman, and Zero Hour events. The timestream is connected to the Speed Force, so speedsters are able to tap into certain points in it in order to time travel. It is possible Per Degaton, Chronos, Vandal Savage, Hourman, Max Mercury, Savitar and Epoch, has also used the same type of time stream for time travel. * In the Legacy of Kain game series, the timestream's nature (as to whether or not it can be changed) plays a vital role throughout the story. * Similarly, in Three Days to Never by Tim Powers, various individuals and groups try to find and control a time machine, hoping to travel back in time, make changes to events, and thereby enter a parallel universe in which they might find themselves experiencing a happier life. Powers also explicitly links time travel with rivers in his 1983 novel The Anubis Gates. * In the Terra Nova (TV series), the Terra Nova settlement exists in a different timestream, so that it doesn't affect the future of 2149, from where the settlers arrive. To decide upon where (and when) to start the settlement, a timeprobe is sent out from 2149 and, when it can't be traced back anywhere on Earth, they sense that it reached a different timestream and begin the settlement in that timestream. * David R. Slavitt's Walloomsac begins with a description of a river and the stones which it flows over; the narrator is philosophical: \\"What would be the subject? The water rushing by, looking the same but always different?\\" Later in the narrative, many lives and changes are discussed.

In April 2006, Naza developed the Naza Sutera based on Hafei Lobo. It was joined by a Naza-badged version of the Peugeot 206 called the Naza 206 Bestari in May 2006, and a Naza-badged version of the Kia Picanto called Naza Picanto in November 2006. History =Early years= The Naza Group of Companies began with the establishment of Naza Motor Trading Sdn Bhd in 1975 as an importer of used and reconditioned cars in Malaysia by the late Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin SM Amin. At just 21, he used his savings, earned from helping his father's construction business, to import used Japanese vehicles. After selling off his entire stock within three- months, Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin began a dealership for used luxury vehicles in Kuala Lumpur. Within several years, the group established itself as a major dealer of used luxury vehicles in Malaysia. The group also included the importation of used luxury bikes. =1990 to 1999= By the late 90s, the Naza Group expanded its business to include automotive distribution after capturing its first franchise from South Korean carmaker, Kia Motors Corp. Part of Naza Group of Companies, Naza Hotel Management was born. Under the late Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, the Naza Group also ventured into the hotel management industry. In the late 90s it acquired the Crowne Plaza Los Angeles Harbor Hotel and the Howard Johnson Inn Torrance in California, USA. =2000 to 2009= In 2000, the Naza Group's extended its portfolio to include the distribution of motorcycles after being appointed as the exclusive distributor for the Ducati brand in Malaysia. By 2001, the Naza Group became a full-fledged auto assembler with the introduction of the locally assembled, Kia Spectra. Several locally assembled Kia models that were subsequently launched such as the Naza Ria MPV, the Sorento and the Sportage quickly became market leaders in their respective segments. In the same year, the Naza Group captured its second franchise after it was appointed as the exclusive distributor of Brabus-tuned cars. In 2002, the Naza Group acquired hotels in Penang, Melaka and Johor Bahru. These three hotels were later re-branded under the name, Naza Talyya Hotels, in 2010. Naza Talyya Hotel closes their operation in Johor and to-date only two Naza Talyya Hotels which in Penang and Melaka. With demand for locally assembled Kia's increasing, the Naza Group started construction works on its very own automotive manufacturing facility in Gurun, Kedah in September 2002. In 2003, the Naza Group commenced operations of a RM30 million motorcycle manufacturing plant in Shah Alam, Selangor to assemble a wide range of bikes including scooters and superbikes. By May 2003, the RM500 million manufacturing facility in Gurun- known as Naza Automotive Manufacturing (NAM) ‚Äì commenced operations by rolling out a Naza Ria MPV. It has a workforce of close to 450 people and has a production capacity of 50,000 units per annum. The group's foray into manufacturing into NAM also led to the launch of the Naza 206 Bestari, which was the result of a joint venture with Automobiles Peugeot, and the group's first ever car, the Naza Sutera in 2006. In 2004, current shareholder Ekspedisi Nikmat Sdn Bhd helmed by Naza Group late chairman Tan Sri Dato' Seri Utama SM Nasimuddin SM Amin, acquired TTDI from Danaharta. TTDI is now the main property arm of the NAZA group of companies. TTDI development changed its name to Naza TTDI Sdn Bhd on 11 March 2008 to reflect its association with the NAZA Group. The Naza Group is an established player in the property development market through its subsidiary, Naza TTDI, which is best known for the development of the acclaimed township of Taman Tun Dr Ismail in Kuala Lumpur. At the same time, the Naza Group began to rapidly expand its motor-trading business. In 2005, it launched the Naza Auto Mall in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, which is the largest motor showroom in Malaysia. With a built-up area of 250,414 square feet and the capacity to display 2,000 cars, the Naza Auto Mall symbolised the group's status as the largest importer of used and re-conditioned luxury and high-end vehicles in Malaysia. Naza Auto Mall and has won a mention in the Malaysia Book of Records for being the largest motor showroom in the country. The group has also had a strong commitment in the field of education. In 2006, the group established the Naza Kia Academy (NKA) by its manufacturing facility in Gurun, Kedah. NKA offers sales and after-sales training to all employees of the Naza Group particularly in developmental and technical-related programs. The academy is also recognised by Kia Motors as its overseas training centre in the Asia Pacific region. In 2008, the group added more brands to its portfolio. In January, it was appointed the sole distributor for the Peugeot brand followed by Ferrari in April and Harley-Davidson in October. By 2009, it added the Italian luxury brand, Maserati, to its portfolio.‚ÄúNaza Italia granted sole distributor of Ferrari in Malaysia‚Äù As the distributor for Peugeot vehicles in Malaysia, the Naza Group began assembling Peugeots at NAM in Gurun. By that time, vehicles produced at Gurun were also being exported to neighbouring countries in Asean which established the group's credentials as a manufacturer that could meet international standards. The Naza Group entered the food and beverage industry in 2008 after capturing the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co franchise for Malaysia. In 2009, Naza Kia Academy began offering executive diploma in automotive management and executive diploma in manufacturing management process programmes. These diploma programmes were offered in collaboration with the UK's Society of Business Practitioners. In that same year, the Naza Group signed a collaboration agreement with US-based Motorola University to offer executive development programmes the group's employees. In 2009, it expanded its food and beverage portfolio to include the Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt brand. The group became the master license holder for the franchise in Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Brunei and Thailand. It currently has over 100 outlets in Malaysia as well as outlets in Singapore, Cambodia, Brunei and Thailand.‚ÄúNaza has over 100 Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt outlet‚Äù =2010 to present= In 2010, Automobiles Peugeot announced it would partner the Naza Group in establishing a manufacturing hub for the former at the latter's plant in Gurun for right-hand drive markets in the Asean region. The announcement marked the first time a foreign carmaker had chosen to make Malaysia its hub for the region. 2010 was another active year for the group as it added several more brands to its stable. In March, it won the exclusive rights to distribute the Chevrolet brand in Malaysia from General Motors. By May, it expanded its motorcycle division by entering into an agreement with the Piaggio Group. Under the agreement, the Naza Group was given exclusive rights to distribute the Piaggio, Aprilia, Vespa and Gilera brands in Malaysia.

Beginning in Weekly Young Sunday issue 9 of 1987, it was published sporadically until finishing in issue 3/4 of 2007 with the chapters collected into four tank≈çbon volumes. The story is a fusion of the sports (specifically, boxing) and romantic comedy genres. Studio Gallop produced an anime original video animation adaptation in 1988. A live-action television drama adaptation starring Kazuya Kamenashi from KAT-TUN and Meisa Kuroki aired for nine episodes in 2008. Viz Media licensed and released the manga and OVA in North America. Plot The protagonist of the series is , the pride of for the most part. He went pro in only two bouts after leaving high school, and his strong punches are universally recognized by his opponents. While he is a natural at boxing, he can't control his voracious appetite. Not surprisingly, K≈çsaku eats anything and everything. As a result, he has been forced to change his weight class since high school. Going from flyweight, all the way up to feather weight, something his trainer tells him he doesn't have the frame for. On top of this he accepts challenges from higher weight classes, giving his coach (and himself) constant trouble. Into this picture steps , a novice nun who takes K≈çsaku on as a personal project, determined to set him on the right path and break his habit of gluttony. She constantly encourages him, making sure that he stays in shape while staying away from food. Unfortunately, closeness can sometimes breed feelings of affection, which K≈çsaku begins to develop. Even worse, Sister Angela realizes she is beginning to have the same problems as well. Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, chapters of One-pound Gospel were sporadically published in Weekly Young Sunday between 1987 and 2006. The chapters were collected and published into four tank≈çbon volumes by Shogakukan from July 5, 1989 to March 5, 2007. It was released in North America by Viz Media, adapted into English by Gerard Jones, with some chapters serialized in Animerica . It was published in both a monthly comic book format and as three volumes mirroring the Japanese tank≈çbon from 1996 to 1998. The volumes were re-published in 2008, to include the final fourth volume. Volume list =Other media= One-pound Gospel was adapted into a single 55 minute anime original video animation by Studio Gallop. Directed by Osamu Dezaki, under the alias Makura Saki, it was released on December 2, 1988. The OVA was released by Viz Media on subtitled VHS in 1995. Unlike the manga, Angela is two-year-older than Kosaku and has a red scouter. A live-action television adaptation of the manga aired on Nippon TV from January 12 to March 8, 2008. The nine episode series stars KAT-TUN's Kamenashi Kazuya as Hatanaka Kosaku and Meisa Kuroki as Sister Angela. It was released in a DVD box set on September 3, 2008. A CD containing the music used in the drama was released on February 27, 2008 as One Pound Gospel Original Soundtrack.  Reception  Shaenon K. Garrity, writing for Anime News Network, stated that despite the unlikely combination of boxing and Catholicism in a situational comedy, Takahashi makes it work. She also called the action scenes \\"realistic\\" with proper boxing terminology. Garrity suspected the author was paying tribute to Mitsuru Adachi with the sports comedy and believes that One-pound Gospel appeals to fans of Takahashi's older \\"slapstick\\" works, as opposed to her new dramatic works.

Their lyrics, which are rapped and sung by all members of the group, feature a mixture of Spanish and English. The band members switch instruments and roles depending on what song they are performing. Biography Molotov in Managua, Nicaragua The band began in 1995 when two friends, Tito Fuentes (guitar) and Micky \\"Chicho\\" Huidobro (bass), started playing together. On September 21 of the same year, Javier de la Cueva \\"J\\" and Iv√°n Jared Moreno \\"La Quesadillera\\" joined them becoming the first line up for the band. Iv√°n Jared Moreno, \\"La Quesadillera\\", would eventually leave, to be replaced by Randy Ebright (who joined the band in October 1995), the only US-born member of the band. Around February 1996 de la Cueva would also leave, being replaced by Paco Ayala, establishing the four-member line-up that has remained consistent over the years. Throughout 1996, the band played in many underground locations in Mexico City and began to have a small group of fans. Their success finally came when they opened for H√©roes del Silencio in Monterrey and later for La Lupita in Puebla. During a concert in which they opened for Illya Kuryaki and The Valderramas, talent hunters from Universal offered them to record an album. It was a difficult period, and the band had to sell cassettes during the concerts while they prepared their album. In July 1997, they released their debut album ¬øD√≥nde Jugar√°n las Ni√±as?, which took its name partly from Man√°'s album ¬øD√≥nde Jugar√°n los Ni√±os? generating controversy with stores refusing to sell it because of its lyrics and cover. Molotov went out to the street to sell their discs as a form of protest. The lyrics include a mixture of politics, sex and expletives, which made it hard for Molotov to enter mainstream media. In 1998, they participated with the song \\"Payaso\\" in the album Volc√°n: Tributo a Jos√© Jos√© a tribute to legendary singer Jos√© Jos√©. Molotov received a recognition without precedent for a hip-hop group in Spanish. Urban publications such as Vibe said about them: \\"[Molotov's music] is incendiary by nature‚Ä¶ with darts poisoned aimed directly to the heart of the oppressive paternalism of the government.\\" For example, the song \\"Gimme Tha Power\\" contained lyrics such as \\"Hay que arrancar el problema de ra√≠z y cambiar el gobierno de nuestro pa√≠s\\" (translated: We have to rip out the problem by the roots and change the government of our country). These lyrics reflected aspects of the tumultuous political climate of the late 1990s. In 2000, popular vote elected a president from a different political party than that which had held the presidency, uninterrupted, since 1940 (see Politics of Mexico). In 1998 Molotov released Molomix, an album with remixes of Donde Jugar√°n...?, including a version of the classic Queen song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" titled \\"Rap, Soda y Bohemia\\", and a new song, \\"El Carnal de las estrellas\\", which attacks the Mexican television network Televisa, as a response to its refusal to air the band's videos. In September 1999, Apocalypshit was released and the band toured Europe, including Russia and were also a part of the 1999 Vans Warped Tour. In 2001, after a couple of years of touring, they took a rest by contributing to the soundtrack of the films Y tu mam√° tambi√©n (in which the soundtrack was nominated for a Grammy) and Atl√©tico San Pancho,. They were part of the Watcha Tour 2000, which included 17 shows with Los Enanitos Verdes, Aterciopelados, Caf√© Tacuba, and A.N.I.M.A.L. In 2003, the band's new album, Dance and Dense Denso, was released with the Grammy-winning single, \\"Frijolero,\\" which became the band's biggest hit to date. In 2004, the band released Con Todo Respeto, which consisted of covers of groups such as The Misfits, Beastie Boys, ZZ Top, and Los Toreros Muertos. On January 18, 2007, Molotov's official website addressed a separation rumor, saying that it could neither be confirmed or denied but that more information would be coming soon. A few weeks later, the band confirmed on its website that it would indeed be touring and posted dates starting April 3 in Ventura, California, and ending April 15 in Dallas, Texas. Despite no official break-up update, many radio stations announced the tour as Molotov's last. In 2007, the band released its album Eternamiente (a portmanteau of eternamente [eternally] and miente [he lies]) with the hit song \\"Yofo.\\" which opened with first week sales of nearly 1,000 copies. In 2008, the song \\"Apocalypshit\\", from the album of the same name, was used in the first episode of Breaking Bad, during camper scene. Molotov performed at the 2009 Coachella Music Festival. In an interview, the band talked about the possibility of releasing a live DVD. In a later interview, Randy Ebright said the DVD would possibly be directed by Alfonso Cuaron, with whom they worked on the soundtrack for Cuaron's 2001 film Y tu mam√° tambi√©n. The band's manager, Jorge Mondrag√≥n, has said that a book would be published recounting their 15 years as a band. Band lead guitar Tito Fuentes said that their next album would be released independently during 2010. On May 14, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform on Mexico City's Z√≥calo for the first time in the band's history, after being denied the venue five times before. The band performed in a concert along with other bands such as Jaguares and Maldita Vecindad to protest against Arizona's SB 1070 law. The band recorded their performance in the \\"Creation of Peace\\" festival in Kazan, Russia. In May 2012 this was released as the live album Desde Rusia con amor, with an accompanying DVD. They worked with Mexican film director Olallo Rubio, providing their music to a documentary called Gimme the Power in which Rubio analyzes Mexico under the power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional). The documentary was released on June 1, 2012.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2169326/ Members Note: The members switch instruments depending on what song they are performing; the below list shows their main roles in the band. *Ismael Fuentes de Garay ‚Äì guitar, bass, vocals *Miguel √Ångel Huidobro Preciado ‚Äì bass guitar, drums, vocals *Juan Francisco Ayala Gonzalez ‚Äì bass guitar, guitar, vocals *Randall Ebright ‚Äì drums, guitar, bass, vocals = Timeline= ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:35 PlotArea = left:80 bottom:60 top:0 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1995 till:31/12/2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:purple legend:Drums id:lines value:black legend:Studio_album ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1995 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:2016 LineData = at:11/03/1997 color:black layer:back at:14/09/1999 color:black layer:back at:05/02/2003 color:black layer:back at:26/10/2004 color:black layer:back at:16/10/2007 color:black layer:back at:10/06/2014 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Fuentes text:\\"Tito Fuentes\\" bar:Huidobro text:\\"Micky Huidobro\\" bar:Cueva text:\\"Jay de la Cueva\\" bar:Ayala text:\\"Paco Ayala\\" bar:Moreno text:\\"Iv√°n Moreno\\" bar:Ebright text:\\"Randy Ebright\\" PlotData= width:16 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Fuentes from:01/01/1995 till:end color:guitar bar:Fuentes from:01/01/1995 till:end color:vocals width:4 bar:Fuentes from:01/10/1995 till:end color:bass width:8 bar:Huidobro from:01/01/1995 till:end color:guitar bar:Huidobro from:01/01/1995 till:end color:vocals width:4 bar:Huidobro from:01/10/1995 till:end color:bass width:12 bar:Huidobro from:01/10/1995 till:end color:drums width:8 bar:Cueva from:01/01/1995 till:01/10/1995 color:bass bar:Cueva from:01/01/1995 till:01/10/1995 color:vocals width:4 bar:Ayala from:01/02/1997 till:end color:bass bar:Ayala from:01/02/1997 till:end color:drums width:12 bar:Ayala from:01/02/1997 till:end color:vocals width:8 bar:Ayala from:01/02/1997 till:end color:guitar width:4 bar:Moreno from:01/01/1995 till:01/10/1995 color:drums bar:Ebright from:01/02/1996 till:end color:drums bar:Ebright from:01/02/1996 till:end color:vocals width:12 bar:Ebright from:01/02/1996 till:end color:guitar width:8 bar:Ebright from:01/02/1996 till:end color:bass width:4 Discography ;Studio albums *¬øD√≥nde Jugar√°n las Ni√±as?

The organization's primary goal is to promote and represent the interests of its agricultural members within the state of Michigan. There are two types of member classification within the Michigan Farm Bureau. Members are either associate members or regular members. Associate members are those who have obtained membership because they are sympathetic to the cause of the Michigan Farm Bureau, or because they would like to receive the benefits associated with a membership (such as Farm Bureau Insurance). Regular members are those who are involved with agriculture. Regular members are typically active farmers, but they can also be retired farmers, greenhouse operators, or landholders who lease their land for agricultural activities. The Michigan Farm Bureau provides a variety of benefits and services to its members, but the most important functions for regular members are (state and federal) lobbying activities and programs and services to educate members on current agricultural issues: political, environmental or otherwise. Other services, such as long distance telephone service, health insurance and many others, are available to both regular and associate members. The headquarters of the Michigan Farm Bureau Family of Companies is located in Lansing, Michigan. The current president of Michigan Farm Bureau is Carl Bednarski.  Policy development  The Michigan Farm Bureau calls itself a grassroots organization, with its agricultural members meeting once per year to create and vote on policy, which guides the direction of the organization for the next year. Each member of the Michigan Farm Bureau belongs to an independently operated county Farm Bureau. There are 67 county Farm Bureaus within the state - some county Farm Bureau offices cover more than one county with lower population levels. Each County Farm Bureau has an annual meeting when policy for that county Farm Bureau is set. During that meeting, policy is also developed for the state and national levels. State and national policies passed by majority vote at the county annual meetings are then reviewed and modified by county Farm Bureau delegates at the state annual meeting. National policies passed by majority vote at the state annual meeting are then reviewed and modified by delegates at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting. The Michigan Farm Bureau is a member organization of both the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, both headed by Bob Stallman. The USFRA is a lobbying organization \\"of more than 80 farmer and rancher-led organizations and agricultural partners representing virtually all aspects of agriculture, working to engage in dialogue with consumers who have questions about how today‚Äôs food is grown and raised,\\" and is funded by checkoff funds from the USDA and corporate sponsors including Monsanto and DuPont.  History  The Michigan Farm Bureau was formed as an initial response to the tax situation in the early 1900s. The motor car was changing the dynamics of transportation, and Michigan's residents demanded new and improved roads for their vehicles. The state legislature determined that the best way to fund road improvements was through a tax levied on owners of land touching roadways. Because Michigan's farmers owned more land than most citizens, the tax became a burden on their lifestyle. After its formation, the Michigan Farm Bureau successfully lobbied for shifting this tax from land owners to purchasers of gasoline. In early 1973, the flame retardant PBB was accidentally mixed with a cattle feed supplement and then sent to a Michigan Farm Bureau Services feed mill in Battle Creek, Michigan. By the time the mix-up was discovered a year later, contaminated livestock feed had been sent to hundreds of farms. About 500 contaminated farms were quarantined. The state of Michigan killed thousands of animals and destroyed tons of animal feed and dairy products to keep the chemical out of the food system. The Gratiot Landfill in Gratiot County, Michigan, has 269,000 pounds of PBB buried, in addition to animals. But people across the state of Michigan were already contaminated, mostly at low levels. Residents of quarantined farms had the highest levels of the chemical and formed the base of 4,000 participants for the Michigan Long-Term PBB Study, now transferred to Georgia due to lack of funds. The study is the largest one on human chemical contamination in the world. Michigan Farm Bureau came under criticism in 2014 for its stance on changes to regulations related to the Michigan Right to Farm Act, with small farm rights advocates asserting that MFB is supporting regulations that harm small farms and favor agribusiness.

Biography Hall, nicknamed 'Ski Boss', was born in Kalispell, Montana where he grew up skiing at Big Mountain, now named Whitefish Mountain Resort, starting at age three. He joined the freestyle ski team at age 10, skiing moguls and aerials until age 15 when he moved to Park City, Utah to pursue freeskiing. His first major competition was the US Open in Vail, Colorado In 2002, Hall co-founded the freeride ski company Armada Skis with skier JP Auclair and photographer Chris O'Connell. Hall is also part owner of the Retallack Snowcat Operation near Nelson, BC, Canada, along with skiers Seth Morrison and the young Algerian/Canadian Mehdi Trari. In March 2005, while attempting a switch cork 900 over the legendary Chad's Gap in Wasatch backcountry, Utah, he pulled up short, hit the knuckle and then ragdolled down the landing, breaking both ankles. His injuries put him out for the rest of the season but returned in 2006 to win gold at both the US Freeskiing Open and the Winter X-Games. His attempt at a fourth gold in slopestyle was upset by Charles Gagnier and in 2009 he lost a fourth straight superpipe gold to Xavier Bertoni.http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/23012009/5/photo/xavier-bertoni-france- crosses-skis-during-men-s-superpipe-during.html After overshooting a jump at Stevens Pass, in May 2009, in Washington, he has been on hiatus for just over a year.

Bhd. is a subsidiary of Malaysia-based Sime Darby Motors. Inokom is the licensed contract assembler for Hyundai, BMW and Mazda passenger vehicles in Malaysia. Inokom was incorporated in October 1992 through a joint venture between companies from Malaysia, France and South Korea. In 1998, Inokom's shareholders included the Berjaya Group (35%), Royal Malaysian Police Cooperative subsidiary Pesumals (30%), Renault (15%), Hyundai Motor Company (15%) and Hyumal Motor (5%). History Inokom launched its first product, the Inokom Permas in 1998. The Permas is based on the first generation Renault Traffic, and was produced in various configurations at Inokom's new plant in Kulim, Kedah. In May 2000, Inokom launched its second product, the Inokom Lorimas, a license-built Hyundai Porter. Inokom's first non-commercial product, the Hyundai-based Inokom Atos was launched in 2002. In 2004, Sime Darby acquired a 51% stake in Inokom, and by the 2010s, Hyundai assembly operations in Malaysia were centralised at the Inokom plant. Prior to the consolidation, Hyundai models were assembled at two separate plants, namely the Inokom plant in Kulim and the Oriental Assemblers plant in Tampoi. Inokom's acquisition by Sime Darby also led to the assembly of BMW M and Land Rover models at the Inokom plant in 2008.Inokom - Contract Assembly BMW M and Land Rover vehicles were previously assembled at the Associated Motor Industries plant in Shah Alam, which shut down in 2007. Mazda assembly at Inokom commenced in 2011 under a separate initiative by the Berjaya Group. Inokom has also carried out contract assembly for Dongfeng, Jinbei and Ford commercial vehicles. Presently, Inokom's shareholders include Sime Darby Motors (51%), Sime Darby Hyundai (5%), Hyundai Motor Company (15%) and Berjaya Auto (29%). Inokom was previously known as Industri Otomotif Komersial (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. between 1992 and 2002. The company changed its name to Inokom Corporation Sdn. Bhd. in November 2002.

Tensions between warriors and the Ikki had been escalating in Mikawa as the Ikki resisted samurai efforts to tax their temples. Fighting broke out in 1563 when Suganuma Sada, a Matsudaira retainer entered the J≈çg≈´-ji temple in Okazaki, and confiscated its rice to feed his own men. In retaliation the monks attacked Suganuma's castle and retrieved the rice back to J≈çg≈´-ji where they barricaded themselves. When Motoyasu sent messengers to their temple to investigate the disorder they were executed. In another incident, Ikki samurai attacked a merchant in the temple town of Honsh≈ç-ji. Motoyasu launched a raid against the temple but was defeated. Okazaki J≈çdo monastery of Daiju-ji enjoyed the patronization of the Matsudaira clan and assisted Motoyasu at Azukizaka 1 On January 15, 1564. Motoyasu had decided to concentrate his forces in eliminating the Ikki from Mikawa and had sought the help of warrior monks from the temple of Daiju-ji with whom he enjoyed good relations. In the Ikki ranks were some of Motoyasu's vassals, like Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had turned over to the Ikki rebellion on religious sympathy. The battle was fierce and Motoyasu took the field personally, issuing challenges to enemy samurai and fighting in the front line where he received several bullets that pierced his armour but failed to wound him. Motoyasu's brave conduct in the battle convinced many of the samurai turncoats in the Ikki to switch sides and the Ikki were defeated. Nevertheless, the battle did not spell the end of the Ikki in Mikawa and Motoyasu continued his campaign to pacify the province from the Ikki.

In October 2013 he joined the Government as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department of Communities and Local Government. In May 2015 Williams lost his Bristol West seat to the Labour Party's Thangam Debbonaire, and in May 2017 he came third in the election for the newly created role of Mayor of the West of England. Early life and education Williams grew up in the village of Abercynon in the Cynon Valley in Glamorgan, Wales. He attended Mountain Ash Comprehensive School and the University of Bristol, graduating in 1988 with a degree in History. During his first two years he lived in Wills Hall, one of the University's halls of residence, and remains a member of the Wills Hall Association. He qualified as Chartered Tax Adviser and worked for several large firms including PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton. Political background Williams was interested in politics from a young age. While at the University of Bristol he was President of the SDP/Liberal society, and an active member of the local SDP branch. He has also served on Avon County Council (1993-1996) and Bristol City Council (1995-1999), elected as Councillor for the Liberal Democrats' then-stronghold of Cabot ward in 1993 aged 26. He was leader of the Avon Liberal Democrat group from 1995 to 1997. Williams had been the Liberal Democrat candidate for the safe Labour seat of Bristol South in 1997, before being selected to stand for Bristol West at the 2001 general election. Williams won Bristol West in 2005, making him the first Liberal MP ever for that constituency and the first to be elected in the city of Bristol since 1935. He was also the first openly gay Liberal Democrat MP. Government career In October 2013, Williams was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary at Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). As Minister for Communities, his responsibilities include community cohesion, race relations, localism and community rights, housing standards, building regulations and neighborhood planning. As the Liberal Democrat minister in DCLG he had oversight of all areas of department policy such as housing, local economic development and planning. In March 2014, Williams published the Government's proposals following the housing standards review, which recommended a rationalisation of government, local authority and industry housing standards into a national set. As a result, for the first time there will be a national space standard for the interior of housing. As Minister for Communities, Williams also announced new funding for promotion of the Cornish language and gave recognition to the people of Cornwall as a national minority on the same basis as the other Celtic people of the British Isles. In 2017, it emerged that Williams had responded to 2014 concerns from the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group about the fire safety of Britain's tower blocks, especially the absence of sprinklers in many of these, by saying, \\"I have neither seen nor heard anything that would suggest that consideration of these specific potential changes is urgent and I am not willing to disrupt the work of this department by asking that these matters are brought forward.\\" The correspondence was leaked to the BBC after the Grenfell Tower fire. Parliamentary career Williams served as Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health between July 2010 and October 2013. During this time the group published reports on the plain packaging of cigarettes, smoking in cars and the illicit trade in tobacco. Between 2010 and 2013 he served as the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman in Parliament and to the media. In addition, he has previously served as a member of the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee and has spoken in favour of replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate. =Smoking ban in public places= After his election on 5 May 2005, Charles Kennedy appointed Williams as Liberal Democrat public health spokesperson, shadowing Minister for Public Health Caroline Flint. In this role he served on the standing committee which scrutinised the Health Bill. One aspect of this Bill was the introduction of a ban on smoking in public places. Williams strongly supported a ban on smoking in all public places, rather than the alternative proposal to exempt private clubs and pubs which do not serve food from the ban. He won an award from World Health Organization for his advocacy of a full ban. =Higher Education and tuition fees= In the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election Williams was the agent of Chris Huhne. Following the election, newly elected leader Sir Menzies Campbell moved Williams to the Further and Higher Education portfolio, shadowing Labour Minister Bill Rammell. After the reorganisation of government departments by new Prime Minister Gordon Brown in July 2007 Lib Dem Leader Sir Menzies Campbell reshuffled his team and Williams became Lib Dem spokesperson on Schools. Since his election, Williams has served on two House of Commons select committees ‚Äî the Education and Skills Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. He stepped down as a member of the Public Accounts Committee at the beginning of 2006 following his appointment as Further and Higher Education spokesperson in order to focus more exclusively on his portfolio. He transferred to the new Children, Schools and Families Select Committee in November 2007. Following the election of Nick Clegg as leader, whom Williams supported against Chris Huhne, Williams became the spokesperson for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In 2008, Williams wrote an alternative policy proposal that would allow top-up fees as part of his role as spokesperson for universities, but the proposal was rejected by the party's Federal Policy Committee. In December 2010, Williams was one of the Liberal Democrat MPs who abstained on the coalition government's proposals to increase tuition fees. =Reducing the voting age= On 29 November 2005, Williams introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill to the House of Commons to reduce the voting age to 16. The motion was supported by a majority of Labour members and Liberal Democrats, but opposed by the Conservatives. It was defeated by 136-128 votes. In January 2013 Williams introduced a backbench committee motion to reduce the voting age. The motion was passed. =Homophobic bullying and gay marriage= In June 2006, Williams launched a campaign against homophobic bullying, after organising the Education and Skills Select Committee's first ever enquiry into the issue of bullying in schools. His petition read: We, the undersigned, call for the following to support and protect the victims of homophobic bullying: # Homophobic taunts and name calling in schools should be challenged immediately by staff. # All schools' anti-bullying policies should be required to include measures specifically to deal with homophobic bullying. # At least one teacher in every school should undergo training which includes how to tackle homophobic bullying. In February 2013 Williams spoke in the second reading debate on the introduction of same sex marriage. He then served as the Lib Dem representative on the public bill committee, introducing amendments to allow opposite sex couples to have civil partnerships and for recognition to be given to humanist marriages. Election results 2017 West of England mayoral candidate Transport Infrastructure Debate at the Bristol and Bath Science Park =Avon and Bristol Councils= Williams was first elected to Avon County Council in May 1993, representing Cabot ward. Avon was abolished in March 1996. In May 1995, Williams had been elected to the City (i.e. district council) ward of Cabot and he continued in office when the unitary authority was created. He stood down from the council in May 1999. =General elections= Williams has contested six general elections - 1997, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017. In 1997, he stood against Labour Minister Dawn Primarolo in Bristol South, coming third with 13.4% of the vote. In 2001, he stood for the first time in Bristol West, polling 28.89% of the vote and coming in second place. In 2005, this increased to 38.3%, winning the seat from Labour. In the 2010 election, Williams held the seat with an increased majority of 11,366, winning 48% of the vote. In the 2015 election Williams lost his seat, coming third to Labour and the Green party. In the 2017 election Williams again stood in the Bristol West constituency, coming fourth. =West of England metro mayor= Williams stood in the 2017 West of England mayoral election on 4 May 2017.

III, Section 2, Clause 1) as embodying two distinct limitations on exercise of judicial review. First, the Court has held that the clause identifies the scope of matters which a federal court can and cannot consider as a case (i.e., it distinguishes between lawsuits within and beyond the institutional competence of the federal judiciary), and limits federal judicial power only to such lawsuits as the court is competent to hear. For example, the Court has determined that this clause prohibits the issuance of advisory opinions (in which no actual issue exists but an opinion is sought), and claims where the appellant stands to gain only in a generalized sense (i.e. no more or less than people at large), and allows only the adjudication of claims where (1) the plaintiff has actually and personally suffered injury or harm \\"in fact\\", (2) the injury or harm suffered by the plaintiff is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions and (3) the injury or harm would be capable of redress by the court. As with all parts of the law, there are exceptions. One of the most significant deals with free speech and free expression cases involving the First Amendment where a party suing over a restriction on freedom of speech issues can argue the unconstitutionality of a statute restricting certain types of speech or expression, even where the restriction might not directly affect them, such as a bookseller or video game dealer may argue that a restriction on some media restricts their customer's ability to choose various works and the restrictions could have a \\"chilling effect\\" on some publishers who might not release some works that would be affected by the law. Other than this, generally, there are usually no exceptions to the standing issue at the Federal level. Secondly, the Court has interpreted the clause as limiting Congress' ability to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. It does so by establishing an outer limit of the types of matters within which Congress may constitutionally confer jurisdiction. Historically, the Court has not interpreted this Clause to limit Congressional power to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The delicate phrasing of the Clause and the ambiguity of the terms therein has inspired frequent academic debate. Though the Supreme Court has given much attention to the legal issues arising from this provision of the Constitution, many problematic issues remain unresolved. Critics argue that the standing requirements imposed by this Clause enable judges to avoid difficult issues, decide the merits of a case before the parties have had a fair opportunity to litigate, and avoid the necessity of applying law the judge finds distasteful.  Text  Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution states: This clause, in addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, prohibits courts from issuing advisory opinions, or from hearing cases that are either unripe, meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or moot, meaning that the controversy has already been resolved.  History of legal application  The earliest expression by the United States Supreme Court of adherence to this requirement came during the presidency of George Washington. Washington sent a letter to the Court asking for their approval should he choose to seek advice from them from time to time on matters that might not come before the Court in a timely manner. Chief Justice John Jay wrote in his response that, although the members of the Court had great confidence in the ability of the president to receive appropriate advice from his executive officers, the Court itself was constitutionally bound not to go beyond its role as an arbiter of judicial questions. The most famous case setting forth the parameters of this requirement is Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), in which the Court held that when Congress paid the legal bills for both the plaintiffs and the defendant (in this case the U.S. Treasury department, by designation), then there was no real controversy between the parties, and a judgment of the Court would be the equivalent of an advisory opinion. The boundaries of the \\"case and controversy\\" clause are open to dispute. For instance, the Court has held that where the controversy between parties has ceased because of a change in facts, it has no jurisdiction. However, where the case or controversy ceases‚Äîor, in legal terms, is \\"mooted\\"‚Äîafter a case is filed, the Court may render a decision in the interest of justice. In Roe v. Wade, for instance, the Court applied the mootness exception for cases \\"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that due to the natural limitation of the human gestation period, issues concerning pregnancy will always come to term before the appellate process is complete. Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Therefore, the Supreme Court could rule on the constitutionality of an abortion law despite the issue being moot at the time of adjudication.  Interpretation  The U.S. Supreme Court observed in DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno (2006): \\"No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary‚Äôs proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.‚ÄùDaimlerChrysler Corp v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341 (2006) The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III of the constitution requires plaintiffs to establish their standing to sue.Clapper v. Amnesty International, Article III standing law is built on separation-of-powers principles. Its purpose is to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the legislative and executive branch of the U.S. federal government.Clapper v. Amnesty International, , ‚ÄúThe law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.‚Äù Article III standing requires an injury that is ‚Äúconcrete, particularized and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.‚ÄùMonsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7) Generally, the clause is taken to mean that a generalized, as opposed to particular, injury, is not grounds for a federal lawsuit. Relevant cases: : Lujan v. Defenders of WildlifeLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992) (\\"[A litigant] raising only a generally available grievance about government‚Äîclaiming only harm to his and every citizen‚Äôs interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large‚Äîdoes not state an Article III case or controversy.\\"), Allen v. WrightAllen v. Wright 468 U. S. 737, 754 (1984) (\\"an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court\\"), Diamond v. CharlesDiamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986) (Article III standing \\"is not to be placed in the hands of ‚Äòconcerned bystanders,‚Äô who will use it simply as a ‚Äòvehicle for the vindication of value interests.‚Äô\\"), Arizonans for Official EnglishArizonans for Official English, 520 U. S. (\\"Nor has this Court ever identified initiative proponents as Article-III-qualified defenders of the measures they advocated.\\"), Karcher v. MayKarcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72 (1987) (Citizens who had standing in their 'public official' roles did not retain standing once they left public office), Hollingsworth v. PerryHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. (2013) (\\"We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the constitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here\\"), and numerous other cases. The clause does not forbid individual States from granting standing to such parties; it only mandates that federal courts may not do so:Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. (2013) : \\"The Court does not question [the State's] sovereign right to maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to defend their initiatives in [State] courts. But standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law. No matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this Court‚Äôs settled law to the contrary. Article III‚Äôs requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers. States cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.\\" (Hollingsworth v.

The arena was opened on January 27, 1998, and dedicated to the memory of the late Paul Tsongas, prominent Lowell native and U.S. senator. The arena was built with $4 million in funding from both the city and the university, plus another $20 million contributed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. About the arena Interior of the arena The facility is home to the NCAA Division I University of Massachusetts Lowell River Hawks ice hockey team, which competes in the Hockey East Association and men's basketball team which play for the America East Conference. https://goriverhawks.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-basketball-record-number-of-home- games-highlights-river-hawks-2019-20-slate.aspx The facility was also home to the Lowell Lock Monsters and the Lowell Devils ice hockey team, which competed in the American Hockey League from 1998 to 2010. The Devils ended their stay in Lowell due to financial difficulties and the arena's new ownership and moved to Albany, NY to compete as the Albany Devils. The Tsongas Center - which seats approximately 6,000 for hockey and 7,000 for concerts and other events - is the site of major concerts and other public events, including job fairs, skating competitions and graduation ceremonies for area high schools, colleges and universities. It also hosts major university events, such as the annual Commencement ceremonies, Open House for prospective students and the Chancellor's Speaker Series. The series debuted in 2012 with bestselling author Stephen King. Also in 2012, the Tsongas Center was the site of a debate between then-incumbent U.S. Sen. Scott Brown and challenger Elizabeth Warren, which drew more than 5,000 people and was covered by more than 100 media outlets, including NBC News and MSNBC. In 2004, alternative rock pioneers Pixies recorded their live concert DVD and high-definition television special \\"The Pixies: Come Home Live 2004 World Tour\\" at the Tsongas Arena. The same year, progressive rock band Yes released a DVD of their 35th anniversary tour performance at the venue titled Songs from Tsongas. In 2009, the boxing scenes of the 2010 film The Fighter were filmed at the Tsongas Center, with Mark Wahlberg portraying Lowell-born champion boxer Micky Ward and Christian Bale portraying his brother Dicky Eklund. UMass Lowell and the city of Lowell entered into negotiations in 2009 with the intent to transfer ownership of the arena and the land adjacent to it to the university. In late October 2009, it was reported that the deal had been reached with UMass Lowell committing to major renovations to the facility. In a ceremony during a game against Boston University on October 30, 2009, the deal transferring ownership to the university was signed. UMass Lowell formally took control of the arena on February 5, 2010 after completing a $1 transaction. UMass Lowell has spent more than $5 million to renovate the arena since its acquisition. LED \\"ribbon\\" boards were installed in the winter of 2010. A new high-definition video scoreboard and sound system were installed during the summer 2010. A new club seating area was built in conjunction with a new upscale bar. In the summer of 2011, new ice-making equipment was installed, followed by new luxury boxes and press box in 2012. In March 2017, the arena played host to the second NWHL Isobel Cup finals between the Buffalo Beauts and Boston Pride.

She was best known for her appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling in the mid-1990s under the ring name Woman. Early life After graduating from DeLand (Florida) High School, Nancy got a job answering phones at State Farm Insurance. When George Napolitano needed a beautiful young girl for the cover of the June 1984 edition of the pro-wrestling magazine Wrestling All Stars, fellow photographer Bill Otten suggested the 20-year-old Nancy Toffoloni Daus for the role. Nancy, who had worked as a model, often sat alongside her then- husband Jim. She had also been selling programs at the Orlando shows and appeared as Para in \\"Apartment Wrestling\\" features. It was on this shoot where she met Kevin Sullivan, who eventually wanted her to be a part of his wrestling entourage. After months of convincing, Nancy finally became an on- air valet, taking the ring name \\"Fallen Angel\\". Professional wrestling career =Early career (1984‚Äì1989)= She made her in-ring debut on June 30, 1984, in Miami, Florida, for Florida Championship Wrestling. She became a part of Kevin Sullivan's stable of kayfabe \\"Satanists\\", which also included wrestlers The Lock, Luna Vachon, The Purple Haze, and Sir Oliver Humperdink. Nancy and Kevin Sullivan traveled throughout the United States using the \\"Satanist\\" gimmick for promotions such as Angelo Savoldi's ICW and Southwest Championship Wrestling. The two married in 1985. On August 3, 1985, she wrestled Debbie Combs in Hawaii for NWA Polynesian Wrestling, in which she lost by disqualification. =World Championship Wrestling (1989‚Äì1990)= She first appeared in WCW as a \\"fan\\" of Rick Steiner named Robin Green, wearing a Steiner T-shirt and large glasses. She would sit in the audience and would interact with Steiner whenever he appeared. She eventually turned on him, aligning herself with Kevin Sullivan and adopting the name Woman and becoming the manager of Doom (Butch Reed and Ron Simmons). After leaving Doom, she aligned herself with Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1996)= In late 1993, Sullivan and Nancy joined the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling, where she reverted to the ring name \\"Woman\\". In December 1993, Sullivan and The Tazmaniac won the ECW Tag Team Championship. They held the championship until March 1994, when they were defeated by The Public Enemy. After Sullivan left ECW in spring 1994, Woman began managing The Sandman. The Sandman's character was estranged from his wife and valet, Peaches, who had left him after he accidentally struck her during a match while temporarily blinded. Woman drove a wedge between The Sandman and Peaches, convincing him that Peaches was cheating on him with Tommy Cairo. In keeping with The Sandman's character, Woman would open his beers and light his cigarettes prior to matches. She began carrying a Singapore cane with which she would strike The Sandman's opponents. At When Worlds Collide on May 14, 1994, Woman and The Sandman lost to Cairo and Peaches in a Singapore Cane match, after which Peaches caned The Sandman in the groin until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling The Sandman to regroup and cane Cairo and Peaches. In mid-1994, The Sandman began feuding with Tommy Dreamer after he kissed Woman. The feud culminated in an \\"I Quit\\" match on October 1, 1994, during which The Sandman was seemingly blinded when Dreamer pushed a lit cigarette into his eye and then caned him in the face. Following the bout, Woman announced that she was leaving The Sandman as he was now \\"useless\\". After Tommy Cairo mocked The Sandman, a guilt-stricken Dreamer challenged him to a match at November to Remember on November 5, 1994. At the same event, Peaches attempted to reconcile with The Sandman. Woman interrupted the reconciliation, caning Peaches and threatening The Sandman. After Dreamer came to the ring to stop Woman, The Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer, with his estrangement from Woman a ploy to pit Dreamer and Cairo against one another. In April 1995 at Three Way Dance, Woman again left The Sandman, aligning herself with Shane Douglas. At Hostile City Showdown on April 15, 1995, she helped The Sandman defeat Douglas for his second ECW World Heavyweight Championship by striking him in the knee with a Singapore cane, revealing the turn to have been another ruse. Following The Sandman's victory, Woman began carrying the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to ringside. Throughout mid-1995, she helped The Sandman defend his championship in a series of bouts with Cactus Jack. In September 1995, she began also managing The Sandman's ally, ECW World Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio. In late 1995, The Sandman began feuding with Mikey Whipwreck, during which a controversial storyline began in which Woman became visibly aroused while watching The Sandman cane Whipwreck. The Sandman's reign lasted until October 28, 1995, when he lost to Whipwreck in a ladder match after Stunning Steve Austin prevented Woman from interfering. On October 28, 1995, 2 Cold Scorpio defeated Rocco Rock in a singles bout to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship, then selected The Sandman as his partner. The Sandman regained the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way dance with Whipwreck and Austin at December to Dismember on December 9, 1995, giving Woman control of all three championships. On December 29, 1995, at Holiday Hell, Mikey Whipwreck defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in a singles match with the ECW World Tag Team Championship on the line. The Sandman's third reign as ECW World Heavyweight Champion lasted until January 27, 1996, when he lost to Raven. In February 1996 at Big Apple Blizzard Blast, Woman announced that she was returning to World Championship Wrestling, parting ways with The Sandman and 2 Cold Scorpio. =Return to WCW (1996‚Äì1997)= Woman made her return to WCW on the January 22, 1996 episode of WCW Monday Nitro as one of many women who stood in the aisle and waved as Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage came to the ring. On the February 5 episode of Nitro she turned on Savage during his match with Chris Benoit and rejoined Flair, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Benoit in the then-current incarnation of the Four Horsemen. Miss Elizabeth also managed the stable. In 1996, Pillman had left the Horsemen, but they added Steve McMichael and his wife Debra in June, which didn't sit well with Woman. In her next angle, the two bickered, not getting along in general. The Four Horsemen were often given interview time on Nitro and when it came time for Debra to speak on the mic, she'd often go into a soliloquy regarding Woman's looks and fashion sense ‚Äì usually when the two weren't within the vicinity of each other. Despite the heavy tension, the two managers never had a physical altercation. At the same time, she started an on-screen relationship with Benoit, who at the time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan. On December 7, on WCW Saturday Night, during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a home movie of the couple canoodling in a kitchen was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, \\"You can't find me\\" and \\"I'm my own woman,\\" while Benoit added: \\"You consider yourself the master of human chess. Well, my bishop just took your queen\\". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager Jimmy Hart led him off stage. This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then- valet Jacquelyn at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the strap connecting them as a weapon against the men. Eventually, the Benoit-Nancy on-screen relationship developed into a real-life affair off-screen. Because of this, it is often joked that Kevin Sullivan \\"booked his own divorce.\\" The two were indeed divorced in 1997. What's more, Sullivan lost a retirement match to Benoit. His intent had been to retire from in-ring action and focus on booking. Nancy's final WCW appearance (and professional wrestling appearance as Woman) took place on May 26, 1997, on Monday Nitro as she accompanied Benoit to the ring for a confrontation with Jimmy Hart regarding the whereabouts of Sullivan, who wasn't in the arena. On the following week's show, Benoit came alone to ringside without her by his side. After managing him for a little over half a year, no reason was given for Woman's sudden disappearance, and she was never mentioned on WCW programming again. Personal life Before her marriage to Kevin Sullivan in 1985, Nancy had been married to and divorced from Jim Daus. In early 1997, while Nancy was married to Sullivan, she was having an extramarital affair with Chris Benoit. Nancy and Benoit became engaged later in 1997 after her divorce from Sullivan, although Benoit referred to Nancy as only his fianc√©e even after they were married. She managed her husband's career from their home in Atlanta. She gave birth to their son Daniel Christopher Benoit on February 25, 2000. Nancy married Chris Benoit on November 23, 2000. However, in May 2003, she filed for divorce, citing the marriage as \\"irrevocably broken\\" and alleging \\"cruel treatment.\\" She dropped the suit in August 2003, as well as a restraining order filed on her husband. In December 2006, Nancy had back and neck fusion surgery with Lloyd Youngblood, the same surgeon who had previously done a 3‚Äìhour neck operation on Nancy's husband Chris on June 28, 2001. After Nancy's death in 2007, Hustler published nude photographs of her from a shoot taken when she was 20 years old. The length of time between the events caused controversy, causing critics to claim that Hustler owner Larry Flynt was attempting to capitalize on the event. The family of Nancy Benoit took legal action against Hustler. The appellate court ruled that, \\"The photographs published by [Flynt] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [the murders] nor correspond with the time period during which Benoit was rendered, against her will, the subject of public scrutiny\\". Death On June 25, 2007, Benoit, her husband Chris, and their son Daniel were found dead in their home in suburban Atlanta at around 2:30 p.m. It first was reported by the WWE Mobile Alerts service and posted to their official website soon after. Lieutenant Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department told ABC News it was being investigated as a double murder-suicide, and the police were not searching for any suspects outside of the house, as the instruments of death were located at the scene of the crime. During a press conference on June 26, Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard reported that Chris Benoit had killed his wife and son and committed suicide. A Bible was left by Nancy's body, and she died of asphyxiation. She had bruises on her back and stomach consistent with an attacker pressing a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck. Daniel also died of asphyxiation, without signs of restraint. He had internal injuries to the throat area, but no bruises, indicating he may have been killed by a choke. Chris killed Nancy on Friday, Daniel on Saturday, then asphyxiated himself with the cord of a weight machine in his basement on Sunday. A memorial for Nancy and Daniel took place in Daytona Beach, Florida, on July 14, 2007. Both were cremated and their ashes placed in starfish-shaped urnsBenoit's wife and son mourned as many questions persist for Nancy's family. Chris was also cremated, but the fate of his ashes has not been publicly revealed.

It is a seaweed that only grows in the northern Atlantic Ocean, also known in localities as feamainn bhu√≠, rockweed, Norwegian kelp, knotted kelp, knotted wrack or egg wrack. It is common on the north-western coast of Europe (from Svalbard to Portugal) including east Greenland and the north- eastern coast of North America, its range further south of these latitudes being limited by warmer ocean waters. Description Ascophyllum nodosum has long tough and leathery fronds,Bunker, F.StP., Maggs, C.A., Brodie, J.A. and Bunker, J.A. 2017. Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. Second Edition. Wild Nature Press, Plymouth, UK. irregularly dichotomously branched Newton, L. 1931. A Handbook of the British Seaweeds. British Museum, Londonfronds with large, egg-shaped air bladders set in series at regular intervals along the fronds and not stalked. The fronds can reach 2 m in length and are attached by a holdfast to rocks and boulders. The fronds are olive-green,Harvey, W.H. 1841. A Manual of the British Algae: London, John van Voorst, London olive- brown in color and somewhat compressed, but without a midrib. Reproduction Its life history is of one diploid plant and gametes. Each individual plant is either male or female. The gametes are produced in the spring in conceptacles embedded in yellowish receptacles on short branches. =Varieties and forms= Several different varieties and forms of this species have been described. * Ascophyllum nodosum var. minor has been described from Larne Lough in Northern Ireland. Free-floating forms of this species are found in, for example, A. n. mackaii Cotton, which is found at very sheltered locations, such as at the heads of sea lochs in Scotland and Ireland. Ecology Ascophyllum nodosum is found mostly on sheltered sites on shores in the midlittoral, where it can become the dominant species in the littoral zone. The species is found in a range of coastal habitats from sheltered estuaries to moderately exposed coasts, and often it dominates the intertidal zone (although subtidal populations are known to exist in very clear waters). However, it is rarely found on exposed shores, and if it is found, the fronds are usually small and badly scratched. This seaweed grows quite slowly, 0.5% per day, carrying capacity is about 40 kg wet weight per square meter, and it may live for 10‚Äì15 years. It may typically overlap in distribution with Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus. Its distribution is also limited by salinity, wave exposure, temperature, desiccation, and general stress.Seip K. L. \\"Mathematical models of rocky shore ecosystems\\". In: J√∏rgensen S. E. & Mitch W J. (Eds.) Application of ecological modelling in environmental management, Part B, Chap 13, pp 341-433. It may take approximately five years before becoming fertile. Phlorotannins in A. nodosum act as chemical defenses against the marine herbivorous snail, Littorina littorea. Polysiphonia lanosa (L.) T.A. Christensen is a small red alga, commonly found growing in dense tufts on Ascophyllum whose rhizoids penetrate the host. It is considered by some as parasitic; however, as it only receives structural support from knotted wrack (not parasitically), it acts as an epiphyte. Distribution Observed in Zeeland, Netherlands This species has been recorded in Europe from Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Britain and Isle of Man, Netherlands, and North America from the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Baffin Island, Hudson Strait, Labrador, and Newfoundland. It has been recorded as an accidental introduction near San Francisco, California, and eradicated as a potential invasive species. Uses Ascophyllum nodosum is harvested for use in alginates, fertilisers, and the manufacture of seaweed meal for animal and human consumption. It has long been used as an organic and mainstream fertilizer for many varieties of crops due to its combination of both macronutrients, (N, P, and K) and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, etc.). It also contains cytokinins, auxin-like gibberellins, betaines, mannitol, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and proteins which are all very beneficial and widely used in agriculture. Ireland, Scotland and Norway have provided the world's principal alginate supply. Ascophyllum nodosum is frequently used as packaging material for baitworm and lobster shipments from New England to various domestic and international locations. Ascophyllum itself has occasionally been introduced to California, and several species frequently found in baitworm shipments, including Carcinus maenas and Littorina saxatilis, may have been introduced to the San Francisco Bay region this way. = Toxicological uses = Because the age of the different parts of A. nodosum can be identified by its shoots, it has also been used to monitor concentrations of heavy metals in seawater. A concentration factor for zinc has been reported to be of the order 104.  Chemistry  Ascophyllum nodosum contains the phlorotannins tetraphlorethol C and tetrafucol A. Harvesting controversy Controversy exists over impacts of commercial harvesting of A. nodosum for use in garden or crop fertilizers and livestock feed supplements in North America and Europe. Some research has been focused on bycatch and impact on intertidal zone communities. T. Trott & P.F. Larsen (2008) Evaluation of short-term changes in rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) and associated epifaunal communities following cutter rake harvesting in Maine. Maine Department of Marine Resources Retrieved 2011-07-13 Opponents of its wild harvest point to the algae's high habitat value for over 100 marine species, including benthic invertebrates, commercially important fish, wild ducks, shorebirds, and seabirds. Shoreland owners in Maine, as well as federal, state, and local agencies in the United States, have placed their conservation lands off limits to rockweed removal. Rockweed harvesters point to the value of the seasonal jobs created by the harvest operation, and also highlight the differences in impact of different harvesting methods such as machine v hand harvesting.

According to biographer Ramlah Adam, one of the main reasons for him to enroll at MCKK was the need to improve his Malay language proficiency that had weakened considerably following his time in England. After graduating from MCKK, he worked as a trainee clerk at the Johor Government Secretary office and was made a permanent clerk a year later. He served in this capacity in several departments before joining the Johor Military Forces in 1917 with the rank of lieutenant. Two years later, he rejoined the civil service. Soon later, he found himself in trouble with the Johor palace after expressing his unhappiness over the sale of his family‚Äôs ancestral home. The royal palace did not take the issue kindly and terminated his service in June 1920. He rejoined the service again in 1921 as an Assistant Collector of Land Revenue.  Malay nationalism and politics  Early Malay nationalism took root in Johor during the 1920s, he became a journalist and wrote articles on the welfare of the Malays. Some of Onn's articles were critical of Sultan Ibrahim's policies, which led to strained personal relations with the Sultan. In particular, Sultan Ibrahim expelled Onn from Johor in 1927 after he published an article in the Sunday Mirror, a Singapore-based English tabloid, which criticised the Sultan's poor treatment of the Johor Military Forces personnel and the welfare of the Orang Asli. He went into exile in Singapore and became the editor of a Malay paper, Warta Malaya, in 1930. Over the next six years, he edited four other newspapers including Lembaga Malaya, Warta Ahad and Lembaga. Onn became very popular after he continued to cover issues on Malay grievances, and Sultan Ibrahim invited Onn to return to Johor in 1936.Aristocrat who spoke his mind . 18 June 2007. The Star. Following the Japanese occupation of Malaya in 1941, Onn was drafted into the administrative system and served as a food controller in Johor. Along with his companions, Haji Anwar bin Abdul Malik, Haji Syed Alwi bin Syed Sheikh al-Hadi and Mohamad Noah Omar, they founded the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) as a means to rally the Malays against the Malayan Union, which was perceived as threatening Malay privileges and the position of the Malay rulers. Onn took up the role of UMNO's president on 1 May 1946. =Malayan Union= The Malayan Union proposal provided that United Kingdom had full administrative powers over the Malay states except in areas pertaining spiritual and moral authority of the Malay rulers, which the Malays held high esteem over it. Communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese were high, and the prospect of granting citizenship to non-Malays was deemed unacceptable to the Malays.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 133-4 In particular, politicians in Johor were extremely unhappy with the willingness of Sultan Ibrahim to sign the treaties with Harold MacMichael, and voiced out that the Sultan had violated the terms in the Johor state constitution which explicitly forbade any foreign powers to assume legitimate control over the state. In early February 1946, seven political dissidents led by Awang bin Hassan organised a rally to protest against the Sultan's decision for signing the treaties, and Onn Jaafar, who was then serving as a district officer in Batu Pahat, was invited to attend the rally.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 211 The rally was held on 1 February 1946 at the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, and protesters shouted nationalistic slogans and called for the dethronement of Sultan Ibrahim. Malay nationalistic slogans were raised during the rally, many of whom were directed against the Sultan himself, whom they accused him for committing treason against the Malay race by signing the treaties. News of the rally reached the Sultan Ibrahim on 22 February, who was then residing at Grosvenor House in London. Sultan Ibrahim approached the colonial office and expressed his withdrawal of support for the proposal scheme, but this did not appease the political dissidents and Onn continued to organise more rallies in the other Malay states to muster further support for his calls against the Malayan Union, and formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in May.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 211-2 To appease the Malays and the UMNO leaders, including Onn himself, Sultan Ibrahim personally donated a lump sum of $5,000 to UMNO and Onn was appointed the Menteri Besar of Johor in 1946.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 361 The establishment of the Federation of Malaya did not go down well with the ethnic Chinese, whereby favourable conditions for obtaining citizenship for the Chinese and other non-Malays were withdrawn. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was formed in 1949 under the leadership of a Straits Chinese businessman, Tan Cheng Lock who frequently raised grievances over the citizenship terms that were set when the Federation was established.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 502-3 As a result, communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese surfaced, and Onn kept his distance from Tan. Tan encountered initial difficulties with meeting Sultan Ibrahim, who was not accustomed to working with Chinese businessmen. Sultan Ibrahim also became increasingly disappointed in Onn's work commitment, whom he saw as neglecting state affairs as a result of his commitments towards UMNO. In early 1950, Sultan Ibrahim approached Onn, who was asked to choose between committing his efforts for UMNO and the state. Onn chose to the former, and resigned as the Menteri Besar of Johor in May.Ong, One Man's Will: A Portrait of Dato' Sir Onn bin Ja'afar, pg 184 =Leaving UMNO= Onn became increasingly disgusted with what he considered to be UMNO's race based communalist policies, and called for party membership to be opened to all Malayans, and for UMNO to be renamed as the United Malayans National Organisation. When his recommendations went unheeded, he left the party on 26 August 1951, to form the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). However, the IMP failed to receive sufficient backing from Malayans, and eventually Onn left it to form the Parti Negara, which placed membership restrictions on non-Malays in an attempt to woo the Malays. He finally won the Kuala Terengganu Selatan seat in the Malayan parliament in the 1959 elections under his new party. Neither party gained popular support against Tunku Abdul Rahman's new Alliance coalition and he was eventually eclipsed in Malayan political life.

The film was directed by Eric Bross and was written by Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton, based upon their short film of the same name. Plot Kevin (Lance Bass) is performing with his band at a high school graduation party. When he sees an attractive girl, his bandmates try to get him to sing to her and ask her out. He becomes nervous, and envisions himself nude in front of everyone, and faints. Seven years later, Kevin is working in advertising. He makes a pitch for Reebok that is rejected, though the pitch is later used in the meeting by his \\"partner\\" Jackie (Tamala Jones), who presents it as hers. As he takes the train home from work, Kevin meets Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with whom he finds he has much in common, such as their mutual interest in the Chicago Cubs and Al Green. Kevin tries to find Abbey by making posters imploring Abbey to contact him, and placing them all over town. He goes out with a few random women who respond, none of whom are Abbey. The local newspaper finds out about his search and sets up an interview. The reporter, Brady Frances (Dan Montgomery, Jr.), is an old classmate who harbors ill will toward Kevin, on account of a girl in high school who rejected Brady for Kevin. When Brady's article is published, Kevin gets hundreds of calls, which leads to his dateless roommates ‚Äî aspiring musician Rod (Joey Fatone); slacker Eric (GQ); and art aficionado Randy (James Bulliard) ‚Äî suggesting they date all the callers to help. Kevin rejects this idea, but a miscommunication leads Eric to believe that Kevin has approved it. A follow up article is published in which Brady portrays Kevin as a failure, which garners even more calls from women. Brady is further irritated when his girlfriend Julie (Amanda Foreman), who is bothered by his grudge against Kevin, takes Kevin's side. Meanwhile, Abbey is having problems with her boyfriend of three years, whom she was visiting when she met Kevin. Her boyfriend buys tickets to an Al Green concert, but then cancels at the last minute. Kevin is also at the concert, but they never see each other, despite several close calls. As Kevin's roommates date the women who responded to the articles in order to find Abbey, they encounter Julie. When she tells Brady that Kevin's friends are answering the calls and dating the respondents, Brady reports this as a scam in a follow-up article. As a result, Reebok declines to work with Kevin, and he is taken off the project. When Kevin subsequently sees Abbey waiting for a train, he tries to get her attention but she only sees him after she boards the train, and the doors close before he can get to her. Kevin also learns that Abbey responded to his public search for her, and when he learns that Eric went out on a date with her, he punches Eric. After Kevin's best friend at the agency, Nathan (Jerry Stiller), suffers a heart attack, Kevin visits him at a rehab facility, where Nathan tells him the story of both meeting his wife at a Chicago Cubs game, and catching a home run from Cubs legend Ernie Banks the same day, and how the two events are tied together. He gives Kevin the baseball and tells him to try to find Abbey again. Jackie apologizes to Kevin, and places him in charge of the campaign's billboards. He uses the billboards to publicly ask Abbey to meet him at the train station at a specific day and time, which garners the interest of the media, who wait with him at the scheduled time. Kevin and Abbey are reunited at the station, much to the delight of the crowd at the station, to the television viewers at home, and to his roommates watching this unfold in a bar. In addition, Randy meets a woman who enjoys art as he does, Julie dumps Brady for Rod, who is offered a recording contract by a record label after listening to a demo tape of his that Kevin sent them, and Brady is given an advice column in the Living section of the Chicago Times.

The original screenplay for the film would have received an R rating, but was rewritten to a PG so that it could be marketed to NSYNC fans. The short film on which the film was based starred Troy Garity, Charlie O'Connell, and Eric Michael Cole. During the credits of the film, the film features a comedic clip of Lance Bass and Joey Fatone who played two of the main characters being made up by fellow NSYNC members Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick. Timberlake and Kirkpatrick played wardrobe managers yet NSYNC member JC Chasez failed to appear. Soundtrack Reception The film was produced on a US$16 million budget. Miramax marketed the film heavily towards *NSYNC's teen fans, and the film's soundtrack featured songs by teen pop artists Mandy Moore and BB Mak, along with previously unreleased tracks by *NSYNC and Britney Spears. However, the film was a box-office flop, and grossed only $4.3 million domestically. The film was heavily criticized, especially by Roger Ebert, who said the film was \\"...an agonizingly creaky movie that laboriously plods through a plot so contrived that the only thing real about it is its length.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 19% based on reviews from 69 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"An inept attempt at a romantic comedy aimed at 'NSYNC fans.\\" References External links  * 2001 romantic comedy films American films American romantic comedy films Miramax films Films directed by Eric Bross Films set in Chicago Films shot in Chicago Films shot in Toronto Features based on short films NSYNC Films scored by Stewart Copeland 2001 comedy films ","title":"On the Line (2001 film)"},{"id":"1847859","text":"Gary Michael Langan (born 19 April 1956) is an English engineer, record producer, mixer and musician.

Geography The region where Kyakhta stands is a natural location for Russo-Chinese trade. The Siberian River Routes connect the fur-bearing lands of Siberia to Lake Baikal. From there, the Selenga River valley is the natural route through the mountains southeast of Lake Baikal out onto the plains of Mongolia. History Kyakhta was founded in 1727 soon after the Treaty of Kyakhta was negotiated just north at Selenginsk. It was the starting point of the boundary markers that defined what is now the northern border of Mongolia. Kyakhta's founder, the Serb Sava Vladislavich, established it as a trading point between Russia and the Qing Empire. The Manchus built Maimaicheng just south of Kyakhta on their side of the border. Before 1762, state caravans traveled from Kyakhta to Peking. After that date, trade was mostly by barter at Kyakhta-Maimaicheng, with merchants crossing the border to make their business. The twin towns of Kyakhta and Maimaicheng can be seen on this 1851 map, on the shortest route from Irkutsk to Peking Kyakhta and Maimaicheng were visited by the famous English adventurer and engineer Samuel Bentham in 1782. He related that he was entertained by the commander of the Chinese city \\"with the greatest politeness which a stranger can meet with in any country whatever\\". At that time, the Russians sold furs, textiles, clothing, hides, leather, hardware, and cattle, while the Chinese sold silk, cotton stuffs, teas, fruits, porcelain, rice, candles, rhubarb, ginger, and musk. Much of the tea is said to have come from Yangloudong, a major center of tea production and trade near today's Chibi City, Hubei. Kyakhta was crowded, unclean, ill-planned, and never came to reflect the wealth that flowed through it,W. Bruce Lincoln. The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians. Cornell University Press, 2007. Page 145. although several Neoclassical buildings were erected in the 19th century, including a tea bourse (1842) and the Orthodox cathedral (1807‚Äì1817), both of which still stand. In 1996 the Voskreskenskaya church was being used a stable.Martha Avery,The Tea Road, 2003, page 135 and photograph It was from Kyakhta that Nikolay Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Kozlov, and Vladimir Obruchev set off on their expeditions into the interior of Mongolia and Xinjiang. Town status was granted to Kyakhta in 1805.rbth.com After the entire Russian-Chinese frontier was opened to trade in 1860 and the Trans-Siberian and the Chinese Eastern Railways bypassed it, Kyakhta fell into decline. The town was renamed Troitskosavsk during the first part of the 20th century, but the original name was restored in 1935. Other sourcesClifford M Foust, 'Muscovite and Mandarin', 1969, index have Troitskosavsk as a fort a short distance north, Troitskosavsk being the administrative and military center while Kyakhta was the trading post on the border. In the mid-20th century, a branch railway was built from Ulan-Ude (on the Trans-Siberian) to Mongolia's Ulan Bator, and, eventually, to China, paralleling the old Kyakhta trade route. However, this railway crosses the Russian-Mongolian border not in Kyakhta itself, but in nearby Naushki.Rolf Potts, Stranded in Siberia: At an obscure border town, our correspondent discovers the biggest obstacle in negotiating the next 4,000 miles: The train has left without him.

Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kyakhta serves as the administrative center of Kyakhtinsky District.Resolution #43 As an administrative division, it is, together with one rural locality (the settlement of Sudzha), incorporated within Kyakhtinsky District as the Town of Kyakhta. As a municipal division, the Town of Kyakhta is incorporated within Kyakhtinsky Municipal District as Kyakhta Urban Settlement.Law #985-III Economy Kyakhta's economy today relies mainly on its status as an important center for trade between Russia, China, and Mongolia, located on the highway from the republic's capital of Ulan-Ude to the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator.

Gurney was assassinated by communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency, while serving as high commissioner in the Federation of Malaya. Career As a boy, Gurney was educated at Winchester College. During World War I, he joined the British Army, and served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps from 1917 to 1920. After a brief spell at University College Oxford, he joined the British Colonial Service in 1921, and was posted to Kenya as an assistant district commissioner. In 1935, after fourteen years in Kenya, he was appointed Assistant Colonial Secretary to Jamaica. After a brief stint working at the Colonial Office in London, Gurney served as Chief Secretary to the Conference of East Africa Governors from 1938 to 1944, and Colonial Secretary in the Gold Coast from 1944 to 1946. In 1946, he was appointed Chief Secretary to Palestine, serving until the end of British rule there in 1948. While serving in Palestine, Gurney was instrumental in crafting British policy during the Jewish insurgency in Palestine.Grob-Fitzgibbon, Benjamin: Imperial Endgame: Britain's Dirty Wars and the End of Empire. In the 1947 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Knight Commander () of the Order of St Michael and St George, which is the second highest rank in this order ‚Äì for his service in Palestine. He had previously been a Companion (CMG) in the same order. In 1949 he was made a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John. On 1 October 1948, Gurney was appointed High Commissioner to Malaya. Gurney assumed his post as the Malayan Emergency was beginning, and over the next three years he became the chief architect of British policy in Malaya. Death On 6 October 1951, Gurney was killed in an ambush by communist insurgents from the Malayan Communist Party while on his way to a resort at Mile 56 ¬Ω, Kuala Kubu Road near Fraser's Hill. According to Communist leader Chin Peng, the ambush was routine, the killing by chance, and the guerrillas only learned the High Commissioner was among the dead from news reports.Chin Peng, My Side of History, Media Masters, Singapore, 2003, pp 287‚Äì289.

He was buried in Cheras War Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, in a ceremony that drew thousands of people.Slain British Officer Buried Honours Gurney's grave at Cheras Christian Cemetery Although Gurney was knighted by King George VI, Malayans from all classes and nationalities, having already given him their esteem and affection, kept his memory green, and when he died on 6 October 1951 they would mourn him as a friend who \\"has gone home to the mercy of God\\". At that moment, his funeral was not only attended by his family members and British Officers in Malaya but also attended by the Malayans from all classes and races. Today, Gurney Road in Malacca, Seremban, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore are named after him. The town named Pekan Gurney in Perak is also named after him.

He was previously a Foreign Office and Home Office Minister. In September 2015 Browne was appointed as a \\"Special Representative for the City of London Corporation\\" in the European Union, as part of the City's efforts to boost its presence in Brussels. Browne left this role in August 2018. Early life and education Born in Islington, Browne is the son of British diplomat Sir Nicholas Browne, and, as a child, lived in many different countries, including Iran, Zimbabwe, and Belgium. Browne was educated at Bedales School, and the University of Nottingham where he studied politics. He became Editor of the University Newspaper and was elected President of the Students' Union in 1992. Political career =Early career= Browne became a researcher for the Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith in 1993. He worked for financial- consultancy Dewe Rogerson and has also worked for a public relations firms Edelman and Reputationinc. He worked for the Liberal Democrats nationally and rose to be their Director of Press and Broadcasting under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy. =1997 candidature= Browne was chosen by his Enfield local party branch to contest Enfield Southgate parliamentary constituency at the 1997 general election and followed the previous result for the party in achieving third position, behind Labour's Stephen Twigg who on that date ousted the Secretary of State for Defence, Michael Portillo in one of the most surprising landslide results. =Becoming an MP= Shortly after the 2001 general election Browne was chosen to contest the more winnable marginal seat of Taunton which had been gained by the Conservative Adrian Flook from the Liberal Democrat Jackie Ballard by just 235 votes. The 2005 general election was again close in Taunton; however Browne beat the incumbent by 573 votes, against the national swing. =Opposition MP= Following his election in 2005, Browne was appointed a spokesman on Foreign Affairs and as Member of the Home Affairs Select Committee. During the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership campaign, Browne was campaign press secretary to Menzies Campbell. He was later promoted to the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team to become the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Home Affairs. During the 2007 leadership election, he was a supporter of Nick Clegg and a member of his campaign team. In 2008, Browne became Lib Dem Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Browne presented a private member's bill entitled the Organ Donation (Presumed Consent) Bill 2008‚Äì09. The Bill aimed to address the problem of a lack of organs available for transplant in the UK. Over 1000 people a year die whilst on waiting lists for organs. During the 2009 expenses scandal, Browne was initially asked to pay back ¬£17,894 in mortgage payments by the Legg Report, after re-mortgaging his London home to provide a deposit for a constituency home. He appealed this decision, making him the first MP to do so, and argued that he was being penalised for using his own money instead of claiming a greater amount from the taxpayer. His appeal was successful, with Sir Paul Kennedy accepting that the arrangement cost the taxpayer less than the alternative options and saying that Browne had acted \\"openly and honestly, and for the very purpose for which ACA was established\\". In the final report, Browne was not required to repay anything. In 2010 after some boundary changes, Browne defended his renamed seat, Taunton Deane, with an increased majority of 3,993. =Coalition government= Browne speaking in 2013 Following the 2010 general election as part of the new coalition government Browne was appointed Minister of State with the responsibility for South East Asia & Far East, Caribbean, Central & South America, Australasia & Pacific, human rights, consular, migration, drugs and international crime, public diplomacy and the Olympics at the Foreign Office. In the government reshuffle of September 2012 he was appointed Minister of State for crime prevention and drug policy in the Home Office. In the reshuffle of October 2013 he was returned to the back benches. Browne confirmed that has been approached by senior Tories, such as Grant Shapps, in the hope he might be persuaded to defect to the Conservative Party. Interviewed about those who said he was in the wrong party, Browne said: \\"I'd turn that on its head. I'd say my ambition for the Lib Dems is to attract the small 'l' liberals in the Conservative and Labour parties. Browne was the UK Government representative at the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. On 15 October 2014, Browne announced that he would stand down at the next general election. =Other interests= Browne became a vice president of the charity Parkinson's UK in 2007.‚ÄúVice Presidents‚Äù Parkinson‚Äôs UK. Browne is a supporter of Queens Park Rangers Football Club. =Political views= Browne is strongly associated with the Orange Book wing of the Liberal Democrats. He is a classical liberal: a believer in free-market economics, free trade, low taxation, small government and individual empowerment. At the same time he is both culturally and socially liberal. In 2014, following his years in the Foreign Office, he wrote a book called Race Plan: An authentic liberal plan to get Britain fit for \\"The Global Race\\". It details a warning to British political classes, of the urgent necessity, to get fit for the global race against the new powerhouses of Asia and Latin America. It has been described as a tightly argued plea for a more ambitious liberalism. Browne writes: \\"Britain must work with, rather than against, the forces of globalisation. We must champion our economic liberalism if we are to keep our markets open for business. In addition we need to rediscover the true meaning of social liberalism. The task today is to push power, money, information and choice down to the individual citizen, so that everyone can enjoy the opportunities that a fortunate few take for granted.\\" Several of his proposed policy ideas received broad media attention, including calls for the top rate of tax to be returned to 40%, the introduction of portable school vouchers allowing parents to choose their child's school, allowing free schools to function for profit, reduction of the state to 35‚Äì38% of GDP, the removal of ring-fencing of public spending in areas including health, more patient choice and the creation of new sources of revenue including insurance payments, abolition of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, big increases in infrastructure spending on new housing, roads, high-speed rail and a new hub airport in the Thames Estuary, and reform of the House of Lords. Although Browne argued for continuing British membership of the European Union, he opposed the idea of \\"ever closer union\\" and also delivered more Eurosceptic messages in his book. =Polls and awards= Jeremy Browne was nominated for the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in 2011 for his work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. He was given a score of 79% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall. On 5 February 2013 he voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on marriage equality in Britain.

He played for the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers) from 1978 until 1986. Following his retirement from football Benirschke tried to find a career in television and was hired by Merv Griffin to replace Pat Sajak as host of the daytime game show Wheel of Fortune in 1989. Early career Benirschke grew up in San Diego and attended La Jolla High School. His father Kurt Benirschke, a German immigrant, was a pathologist at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and the founder/director of the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species at the San Diego Zoo, where Rolf worked summers in high school and college. Rolf Benirschke majored in zoology at the University of California, Davis, where he played football under coach Jim Sochor. He was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the 12th round of the 1977 NFL Draft, and was then traded to the San Diego Chargers for his rookie year in the National Football League. In the off- season before the 1978 season, his second season, he developed chronic fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. He learned that he had ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Living with ulcerative colitis His health problems got worse in the 1979 season, when, on the team plane coming home from a road trip, Benirschke collapsed. He underwent two surgeries to remove his large intestine and he was in the intensive care unit for weeks. When released from the hospital, he weighed only 123 pounds and had to adjust to life with two ostomy appliances. His ileostomy was eventually reversed in a Kock pouch procedure. On Sunday, November 18, 1979, Benirschke made his dramatic return to the Chargers in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While he did not play, he was named honorary team captain for the game, which was a sellout. Louie Kelcher, a Chargers' defensive tackle, assisted him and held his hand out onto the field.about.com The Chargers won the game 35-7. From 1980 to 1982, Benirschke was also a broadcaster for the San Diego Sockers of the former North American Soccer League.Benirschke, Rolf with Mike Yorkey.

In 1980 Benirschke returned to kicking and played seven more seasons with the team before retiring in 1987 as the team's all-time leader in points scored (766).San Diego Magazine He was named the NFL Man of the Year in 1983. He was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1983 season. In 1984, his kickoffs were viewed to be too short, and he gave a thumbs-up sign to Denver Broncos kicker Rich Karlis before a field goal that defeated the Chargers, prompting a meeting with San Diego owner Alex Spanos over Benirschke's loyalties. Although Benirschke had the third-highest field goal percentage in NFL history, the Chargers selected punter/kicker Ralf Mojsiejenko in the 1985 NFL Draft to provide competition. On August 31, 1987, Benirschke was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a draft pick after he lost his job to rookie Vince Abbott. He was released by Dallas on September 7, and formally announced his retirement in December. After 10 years with San Diego, he retired as the team's all-time scoring leader with 766 points and held 15 club records. He made 146 field goals in 208 tries for a .702 field goal percentage, at the time the third-most accurate in league history behind Eddie Murray and Nick Lowery. In 1997, he was the twentieth player inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame. Life after football Benirschke hosted the daytime version of the TV game show Wheel of Fortune from January 10 to June 30, 1989 after Pat Sajak left the daytime version to host The Pat Sajak Show; Sajak has continued to host the nighttime syndicated version. When the daytime version moved to CBS, Bob Goen succeeded Benirschke as host. He has not been involved in television since, but was among the many participants in the E!

Honi the Circle-drawer) was a Jewish scholar of the 1st-century BC, during the age of the tannaim, the scholars from whose teachings the Mishnah was derived. During the 1st century BC, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in Judea. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha, the ancient Jewish prophets. The Babylonian Talmud, and the Jerusalem Talmud both provide some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, including Honi.  Circle drawing incident  Tomb of Honi HaMe'agel in Hatzor HaGlilit, Galilee His surname is derived from an incident in which, according to the Babylonian Talmud, his prayer for rain was miraculously answered. On one occasion, when God did not send rain well into the winter (in Israel, it rains mainly in the winter), Honi drew a circle in the dust, stood inside it, and informed God that he would not move until it rained. When it began to drizzle, Honi told God that he was not satisfied and expected more rain; it then began to pour. He explained that he wanted a calm rain, at which point the rain calmed to a normal rain. He was almost put into herem (excommunication) for the above incident in which he showed \\"dishonor\\" to God. However, Shimon ben Shetach, the brother of Queen Shlomtzion, excused him, saying that Honi had a special relationship with God. Two variations of this story appear in the Talmud, in Taanit 19aTaanit 19a and 23a.Taanit 23a  Extended sleep story  Two variations of a story are recorded‚Äîin the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds‚Äîin which Honi fell asleep for decades before awaking. The story provides a Jewish version on the theme of a person or persons (as the Seven Sleepers) sleeping for many decades and waking to find a changed world‚Äîa theme originating in the story of Epimenides‚Äîfound in many divergent cultures and traditions, and in modern times associated especially with the Rip Van Winkle story. = In the Babylonian Talmud (Carob tree story) = The Babylonian Talmud tells the following story, in which Honi slept for 70 years, before awaking and then dying: :Rabbi Yohanan said: \\"This righteous man [Honi] was troubled throughout the whole of his life concerning the meaning of the verse, 'A Song of Ascents: When the Lord brought back those that returned to Zion, we were like dreamers' (Psalms 126:1). [Honi asked] Is it possible for seventy years to be like a dream? How could anyone sleep for seventy years?\\" :One day Honi was journeying on the road and he saw a man planting a carob tree. He asked, \\"How long does it take [for this tree] to bear fruit?\\" The man replied: \\"Seventy years.\\" Honi then further asked him: \\"Are you certain that you will live another seventy years?\\" The man replied: \\"I found [already grown] carob trees in the world; as my forefathers planted those for me so I too plant these for my children.\\" :Honi sat down to have a meal and sleep overcame him. As he slept a rocky formation enclosed upon him which hid him from sight and he slept for seventy years. When he awoke he saw a man gathering the fruit of the carob tree and Honi asked him, \\"Are you the man who planted the tree?\\" The man replied: \\"I am his grandson.\\" Thereupon Honi exclaimed: \\"It is clear that I have slept for seventy years.\\" He then caught sight of his ass which had given birth to several generations of mules, and he returned home. There he inquired, \\"Is the son of Honi the Circle-Drawer still alive?\\" The people answered him, \\"His son is no more, but his grandson is still living.\\" Thereupon he said to them: \\"I am Honi the Circle-Drawer,\\" but no one would believe him. :He then repaired to the beit hamidrash [study hall] and there he overheard the scholars say, \\"The law is as clear to us as in the days of Honi the Circle-Drawer,\\" for whenever he came to the beit hamidrash he would settle for the scholars any difficulty that they had. Whereupon he called out, \\"I am he!\\" But the scholars would not believe him nor did they give him the honor due to him. This hurt him greatly and he prayed for mercy, and he died. Raba said: \\"Hence the saying, 'Either companionship or death.'\\"Ta'anit 23a The lesson that is taken away from this story is that if you give something you will not be alive to see, you are still giving. = In the Jerusalem Talmud = In the Jerusalem Talmud, the circle drawing story is notably missing, and the sleep theme does not manifest as the carob tree story. Instead, the story is about Honi sleeping in a cave for seventy years, then returning to the Temple, where he was able to prove his identity: :Said R. Yudan Giria: \\"This is Honi the Circle Maker [of M. Ta. 3:9], the grandson of Honi the Circle Maker. Near the time of the destruction of the Temple, he went out to a mountain to his workers. Before he got there, it rained. He went into a cave. Once he sat down there he fell asleep. He remained sound asleep for seventy years, until the Temple was destroyed and it was rebuilt a second time. At the end of the seventy years he awoke from his sleep. He went out of the cave, and he saw a world completely changed. An area that had been planted with vineyards now produced olives, and an area planted with olives now produced grain. He asked the people of the district, \\"What do you hear in the world?\\" They said to him, \\"And don't you know what the news is?\\" He said to them, \\"No.\\" They said to him, \\"Who are you?\\" He said to them, \\"Honi the Circle Maker.\\" They said to him, \\"We heard that when he would go into the Temple courtyard, it would be illuminated.\\" He went in and illuminated the place and recited the following verse of Scripture, \\"When the Lord restored the fortune of Zion, we were like those who dream\\" (Ps. 126:1).The Death of Honi the Circle MakerYerushalmi Ta'anit 3:9 (16b) Unlike the Babylonian Talmud story, the Jerusalem Talmud story does not describe Honi's death. This more closely resembles the Epimenides sleep story in which Epimenides is able to pass on his message. According to one source, this difference could be specifically because of the two pieces this story is based on: Honi's death in Josephus (described below), and the Epimenides sleep theme. The idea would be that in the Jerusalem Talmud's case, the author more closely followed the Epimenides story to get their point across, while in the Babylonian Talmud, the author had a more metaphorical approach to his death in Josephus.  Death  According to Josephus, in Antiquities of the Jews, Honi met his end in the context of conflict between the Hasmonean brothers Hyrcanus II, backed by the Pharisees and advised by Antipater the Idumaean, and Aristobulus II, backed by the Sadducees. Around 63 BC, Honi was captured by the followers of Hyrcanus besieging Jerusalem and was asked to pray for the demise of their opponents. Honi, however, prayed: \\"Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Your people, I beseech You not to answer the evil prayers of either.\\" After this, the followers of Hyrcanus stoned him to death.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 14.2.1 21. The Babylonian Talmud records a different story of his death, as part of the aforementioned carob tree story. The Maharsha explains the discrepancy between the Talmud and Josephus by stating that Honi was \\"presumed\\" killed by Hyrcanus II's men, but in reality was put into a deep sleep or coma for 70 years, and only then died. Honi's grave is found near the town of Hatzor HaGlilit in northern Israel.

Tom is the biological mother of two children, and the adoptive mother of eleven children with special needs. Tom was previously married and adopted her first two children while still with her husband. Following the birth of her two now fully grown boys, Jeremy and Ben, Tom decided that she wanted a girl and adopted her daughter Emily from South Korea. Following Emily's adoption, the social worker from her case again contacted Susan and enquired whether she would be able to take in a newborn, Margaret, suffering from failure to thrive and numerous other health conditions. According to Tom, it is at this point that she and her husband, Philip, began to drift apart. Eventually, the strain was too much and the couple separated. Over the next decade, Tom adopted 9 other children with special needs, who likely would not have found stable homes otherwise. In her own words, Tom explained the drastic expansion as follows, \\"Well from three to four isn't that much of a jump and at that point what's five? After five, the noise isn't going to get any louder and you're already cooking big meals so, well- it's not that hard to get to twelve.\\" In 2003 Tom was nominated for the \\"Most Inspirational Person of the Year Award\\", sponsored by beliefnet.com. Tom lost that award to Archbishop Joseph O'Malley, but she was later awarded with assemblywoman Louis Wolk's \\"Woman of the Year\\" award, which was presented on March 24, 2003 in Sacramento Susan Tom and two of her friends established the \\"Susan Tom Family Foundation\\", which aims to educate the public about various diseasets that affect children and which accepts donations for her families education. In the summer of 2005, the show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition built Tom and her family a new house. The Toms went to Walt Disney World while the EM team built the house. The show mentioned Anthony's death (a few clips of him from My Flesh and Blood were shown during the episode). Children Here is a partial list of Tom's children and their characteristics: *Anthony: (b.1982-d.2004) Anthony had a rare skin disease that usually does not allow people to reach adulthood and he died from cancer in December 2004. *Faith: Faith suffered burns as an infant. She has excelled as a student and overcome the constant taunts of fellow students. Faith is also an avid reader. *Hannah: An avid swimmer, Hannah was born without legs. She maintains a great relationship with her adoptive sister, Xenia, in particular. As stated on Extreme Makeover, she loves to draw. *Joe (b.1987‚Äìd.2002): Joe had psychological problems, as well as cystic fibrosis. Arguably the most outspoken of Tom's children during the documentary, he died of cystic fibrosis complications while the documentary was being filmed. *Margaret: Margaret was adopted by Tom, following brain surgery as an infant, and she has no current major health problems. She has become Tom's top assistant and a loving sister to her adoptive siblings. Margaret is in school to become a nurse. *Xenia: Also born without legs, Xenia is an avid figure skater, using her arms to practice her favorite sport. Xenia is described by her family as flirtatious and has had some significant boy friendships during her life. As seen on Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Xenia stated she wanted to travel the world, specifically Africa (she was born in Russia). She also has an interest in photography and has a great sense of humor. When getting into the new car EM gave Margaret, Xenia got in and joked, \\"Look at all the legroom!!\\" *Olivia \\"Libby\\": Libby was born with spina bifida, uses a wheelchair, and loves board games. *Cloe: Cloe was born with the inability to bend her elbows and knees. She has an interest in fashion. *Katie: Katie was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and is mentally challenged.

PCHL 1928‚Äì1931 The first incarnation of the PCHL had four teams and lasted three seasons. Brothers Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick, financed by their wealthy lumberman father Joseph Patrick founded it and operated franchises in Vancouver and Victoria, with Frank, one of the founders of the earlier Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) as president. The Victoria Cubs' Arena was destroyed by fire in 1929, after which the club continued for the season and disbanded.

In 1936, the Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver franchises of the North West Hockey League joined with an Oakland team to re- form the Pacific Coast Hockey League. The Oakland team relocated to Spokane in its first year. The Spokane team disbanded for the 1939‚Äì40 season, but reappeared the next year as the Spokane Bombers. The league disbanded after the 1941 season, primarily as a result of World War II. =Teams=Oakland Clippers/Spokane Clippers (1936‚Äì1938) *Portland Buckaroos (1936‚Äì1941) *Seattle Seahawks (1936‚Äì1940) *Vancouver Lions (1936‚Äì1941) *Spokane Bombers (1940‚Äì1941) *Seattle Olympics (1940‚Äì1941) =Champions= 1937: Portland Buckaroos 1938: Seattle Seahawks 1939: Portland Buckaroos 1940: Vancouver Lions 1941: Vancouver Lions PCHL 1944‚Äì1952 The final incarnation of the league was managed by Hockey Hall of Fame member Al Leader, and grew out of combining teams from the Southern California Hockey League and the Northwest International Hockey League. The PCHL was founded as an amateur loop, partly because the National Hockey League recognized Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) founder Lester Patrick as the territorial rights holder for professional hockey in Vancouver, Portland and Seattle. In 1948, however, the ten team league voted to turn pro, and was recognized as such by the NHL. Before the start of the 1951‚Äì1952 season, the PCHL had dwindled to a six team league. The neighbouring Western Canada Senior Hockey League (WCSHL), which played minor senior hockey on the Canadian prairies, had also dwindled, to just three franchises. The three WCSHL franchises turned professional and joined the PCHL for 1951‚Äì1952. One year later, the PCHL renamed itself the Western Hockey League before the start of the 1952‚Äì1953 season.

He was best known for his written accounts of the people, events, and silver mining operations on the Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Nevada, including his non-fiction book History of the Big Bonanza (American Publishing Company, 1876). DeQuille was on the staff of the (Virginia City) Territorial Enterprise for over thirty years, and his writings were also printed in other publications throughout the country and abroad. Highly regarded for his knowledge of silver mining techniques and his ability to explain them in simple terms, he was also appreciated for his humor, similar in style to that of his associate and friend Mark Twain, and of a type very popular in the United States at that time, now referred to as the Sagebrush School literary genre. Early life William Wright was born in Knox County, Ohio, in 1829, the oldest of nine children. In 1849 he moved west with his family to West Liberty, Iowa, where in 1853 he married Caroline Coleman. Their union produced five children, two of whom died in infancy. In 1857, leaving his family behind, he traveled to California in search of gold. While living as a nomadic prospector in the Sierra foothills and Mono Lake region, he heard of the discovery of silver on the other side of the Sierras and ventured to Virginia City, Nevada in 1859. With no success at prospecting there and in need of funds to send his wife and children in Iowa, Wright applied for regular employment in Virginia City at the (Territorial) Enterprise, a newspaper that had recently relocated there from Carson City, Nevada. He was hired in 1862 and soon adopted the pen name Dan DeQuille. Writing career The Territorial Enterprise building (in 2010) William Wright was interested as a young adult in a career as a writer. After his move to Iowa he wrote and submitted manuscripts to popular magazines in the East Coast. While prospecting for gold in California he wrote articles on prospector mining that were published in California newspapers. Long letters to his family helped to develop his skills at humorous exaggeration and detailed description. Following his move to Virginia City, he wrote articles that were printed in San Francisco's The Golden Era. Soon after he became known as Dan DeQuille at the Enterprise, another unsuccessful miner named Sam Clemens was hired to work under him in August 1863. Clemens adopted the pen name Mark Twain. The two of them reported on local events and wrote columns for the newspaper. Under DeQuille's editorial supervision, Twain established his reputation as a humorous writer. Twain would later describe this period in his book Roughing It. Twain left Virginia City in May 1864 and after brief stays in San Francisco and Hawaii he toured as a lecturer, which brought him back for visits to Virginia City and DeQuille in 1866 and 1868. =History of the Big Bonanza= In 1874 mine operators John William Mackay, James Graham Fair, Sen. John P. Jones, and William Ralston decided that a book should be written about the history of the Comstock. They approached DeQuille as the preferred author and he accepted the task. His original intent was to write a small book which could be sold to overland train passengers and to continue expanding it with new information and additional sketches until it eventually became a volume which could be published for a broader audience. DeQuille set to work on the book, collecting data, illustrations, and sketches to be included. In March 1875 he sent a letter to Mark Twain, then residing in Hartford, Connecticut, to seek his advice on having the book published. Concurrently Twain had himself seen a need for such a book and, seeing DeQuille as the one to write it, wrote him a letter to that effect. In response to DeQuille's letter, Twain responded with a 19-page letter enthusiastically providing advice and an invitation for DeQuille to gather up all the material he might need and join him in Hartford where they could each work on their respective projects in close proximity and mutual support. History of the Big Bonanza, title page of first edition, 1877 Under Twain's mentorship during the summer of 1875, DeQuille pieced together a sizable volume which contained a mixture of technical chapters on silver mining interspersed with lighter accounts of Nevada events and individuals, including the Northern Paiute group of Native Americans living in the vicinity. DeQuille and Twain believed the book would have wide appeal and sell well. Twain helped DeQuille negotiate a favorable contract with his own publisher and DeQuille returned to Virginia City late that summer. In October a fire destroyed much of the city and his account of this tragedy would become the last chapter of his book. A History of the Big Bonanza was published by the American Publishing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1876. They also published A History of the Comstock Silver Lode Mines, a smaller version as a paper-bound guide-book to be sold on overland trains. The main book was eagerly anticipated in Virginia City and sold well on the Pacific Coast, but sales in the East were disappointing. DeQuille did not achieve the financial independence he had anticipated and would continue in his position at the Enterprise for another seventeen years. =Later work= At the beginning of the 1880s the major silver mining operations at the Comstock Lode were coming to an end and the population of Virginia City was rapidly declining. DeQuille remained a prolific writer, however, providing articles for publication on both coasts, contributing a portion to Myron Angel's History of Nevada (Thompson & West, 1881), and writing the article on Nevada for the 10th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in 1884. In 1893 the Enterprise ended publication. DeQuille remained in Virginia City for a few more years working as a correspondent for a newspaper in Utah and as a contributor to publications on both coasts. In the late 1890s he returned in poor health to West Liberty, Iowa where he resided with his daughter until his death on March 16, 1898. Legacy As a journalist and author Dan DeQuille contributed significantly to Americans' understanding of the events in Nevada and the procurement of vast fortunes from the Comstock Lode in the late 19th century. As a humorist he also made a significant contribution the lore of the Wild West. During Virginia City's heyday, DeQuille was one of the most widely read journalists on the Pacific Coast because of his wit coupled with his ability to explain in non-technical terms the significance of events on the Comstock Lode. The style of humor that flourished in the United States during the latter half of the 19th century was shared by DeQuille, Artemus Ward, Orpheus C. Kerr, Petroleum V. Nasby, Major Jack Downing, and most notably Mark Twain. It has since been theorized that America's hunger for this type of humor sprang from a sort of national psychic need from the aftermath of the American Civil War, the grief over the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, and the hardships of industrial pioneering in the West. Historical interest in Virginia City's past has continued throughout the 20th century. The town has become a popular tourist attraction with one of its features being the building which housed the Enterprise and on display therein the desk once used by DeQuille, Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and other frontier journalists. In 1946 publishing house Alfred A. Knopf announced that in conjunction with the upcoming California centenary, it would reprint a series of five books that were historically significant in portraying the early days of California statehood, but which were difficult to find. The first book on their list was DeQuille's History of the Big Bonanza. Editor Oscar Lewis wrote a biography of DeQuille as the \\"Introduction\\" to The Big Bonanza, published in 1947. In 1950 DeQuille was represented in an anthology of Western Americana entitled Comstock Bonanza, collected and edited by Duncan Emrich and published by Vanguard. More recently Richard A. Dwyer and Richard E. Lingenfelter published Dan De Quille, The Washoe Giant. A Biography and Anthology, featuring the fullest collection of his journalism and a checklist of all his writings (University of Nevada Press, 1990). English professor Lawrence I. Berkove collected the best of DeQuille's works and published them in 1990 as The Fighting Horse of the Stanislaus: Stories and Essays (University of Iowa Press). In 1994, DeQuille was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. In 2005, DeQuille's The Big Bonanza was used as the basis for a new American opera entitled The Big Bonanza, with music by Monica Houghton and libretto by Jon Christensen.

The novel won the 1987 Booker Prize. It is written from multiple points of view and moves backward and forward through time. It begins as the story of a woman who, on her deathbed, decides to write a history of the world, and develops into a story of love, incest and the desire to be recognized as an independent free thinking woman of the time. Plot summary Claudia Hampton, a 76-year-old English woman and a professional historian, is terminally ill and is spending her last remaining moments in and out of consciousness thinking of writing a history of the world with her life as a blueprint. Her first, primordial recollections are of a father that died in World War I, and of the summer of 1920, when she was 10 and competing with her 11-year-old brother Gordon for fossils. Claudia and Gordon are, at times throughout their lives, rivals, lovers, and best friends to each other. When the two are in their late teens they begin an incestuous relationship and find it hard to relate to almost any other person their own age. Soon, however, their college careers and other events allow both to open up to the outside world, and look outward for companionship. At the outset of World War II, Gordon, a would-be economist, is sent to India, whereas Claudia sets aside her studies in history to become a war correspondent. Independent and enterprising, Claudia talks her way into a correspondent's post in Cairo, where she meets Tom Southern, a captain of an English armoured tank division, who sweeps her off her feet. Tom and Claudia fall in love during several long weekends together while he is on leave from the front. But their future together is never to materialize: shortly after their time together, the English are called to defend Egypt from Erwin Rommel's offensive at the First Battle of El Alamein, and Tom is declared missing. Later on, Claudia receives news that he has been killed. Shortly after Tom's death, Claudia finds out she is pregnant, and decides that she will have the child, even though she would have to raise it alone. It isn't to be: Claudia miscarries, and is never told whether the child she had carried was a boy or a girl. That uncertainty, along with her fear that Tom died a horrible and painful death, will haunt her for the rest of her life. After the War, Claudia and Gordon reunite, but the encounter is more friendly than passionate. Each of them has obviously been changed by the War, but they are both sparse on actual details during their conversations. Gordon marries a girl named Sylvia, whom Claudia finds insipid and boring. Claudia meanwhile met Jasper, a well connected young man with whom she goes on to have an on-and-off, rather stormy relationship, and one that Gordon openly disapproves of. In 1948 Claudia finds herself pregnant again, this time by Jasper, and while she has no intention of marrying him, she decides to have the child, Lisa. While Claudia loves Lisa, she finds she has little patience and time to care for a child, and so Lisa ultimately ends up being raised by her maternal and paternal grandmothers, who share her custody and dictate her upbringing. Not surprisingly, Lisa grows up sullen and indifferent to Claudia, and marries a respectable (boring) man at a young age. After reading an article Claudia has written condemning the Soviet invasion, a Hungarian functionary who becomes implicated in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution contacts Claudia out of the blue. Knowing that he will soon be imprisoned, the functionary decides to ask Claudia to make sure that his son Laszlo, who is in England at art college, does not attempt to return to Hungary. Claudia becomes a sort of surrogate mother to Laszlo, whom she grows to love and admire over the years, recognizing that he is drastically different from anyone else she knows: an open, painfully honest, sensitive, self-destructive artist. Claudia writes several popular history books, earning accolades from the public and occasional scorn from academic historians. She also briefly becomes a consultant for a movie based on her history of the Spanish invasion of Mexico, which leads to a personal scandal when she is in a car accident with the star of the movie, and the press suspects there is more to the relationship than just friendship. The event earns scorn from Jasper, who refuses to see her when she is in the hospital. Gordon, on the other hand, visits her to let her know that she is not alone. Later in life, Claudia decides to travel to Egypt alone but finds it much changed. Yet the desert brings back powerful memories of her intense love for Tom Southern and enduring pain at his death, a pain she is still unable to share with anyone else even after all the years that have passed. Shortly thereafter, Gordon dies, and leaves a gaping void in Claudia's life. A few years later, when she is diagnosed with cancer, and knowing her own death is imminent, she apologizes to Lisa for having been a cold and distant mother. Lisa accepts the apology, but is not sure how to feel about it: it is the most unlikely thing Claudia (who to Lisa seemed to revel in being an almost omnipotent figure) has ever done for Lisa. Long after the War, Tom's sister Jennifer reads an article Claudia wrote about her experiences in Egypt, realizes she is the \\"C.\\" Tom had often referred to in letters home, and mails Claudia his wartime diary. Soon before she dies, Claudia asks Laszlo to fetch Tom's diary for her. Reading over the short entries in Tom's diary, many of which refer to his love for her, Claudia allows herself to reflect on her grief for Tom, her sorrow at having been left behind, and the course her life might have taken had he survived. She comes to peace with the fact that she too will soon become a set of imperfect memories of those who knew her. The next day, Claudia dies.

It appeared in excerpts in journals between 1912 and 1914, when it was published as an artist's book in Milan. It is an account of the Battle of Adrianople, which he witnessed as a reporter for L'Intransigeant. The poem uses Parole in libert√† (words in freedom; creative typography) and other poetic impressions of the events of the battle, including the sounds of gunfire and explosions. The work is now seen as a seminal work of modernist art, and an enormous influence on the emerging culture of European avant-garde print. > \\"[The] masterpiece of Words-in-freedom and of Marinetti‚Äôs literary career > was the novel Zang Tumb Tuuum... the story of the siege by the Bulgarians of > Turkish Adrianople in the Balkan War, which Marinetti had witnessed as a war > reporter.

Amongst a series of exhortations to replace the 'pensive, immobile' traditional literature with 'exalt[ed] movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness ... the slap and the blow with the fist.' and 'want[ing] to glorify war ‚Äì the only cure for the world', the piece includes the famous line: > We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: > the beauty of speed ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine- > gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. In a slightly later manifesto, contemporaneous with Zang Tumb Tuuum, Marinetti sets out a vision of modern book design which would provide the template for what would become known as the artist's book, in direct contrast to the French tradition of Livre d'Artiste. > I call for a typographic revolution directed against the idiotic and > nauseating concepts of the outdated and conventional book, with its handmade > paper and seventeenth century ornamentation of garlands and goddesses, huge > initials and mythological vegetation, its missal ribbons and epigraphs and > roman numerals.

The Futurist Political Party which Marinetti had founded was absorbed into the National Fascist Party (PNF) of Italy, and he co-wrote with Alceste De Ambris the Fascist Manifesto.Dahlia S. Elazar.

International promotional tours Marinetti promoted his ideas by continually travelling across Europe giving recitations; as well as giving 'riotous soir√©es' throughout Italy, he travelled to Russia in 1910 and 1913, Paris 1912 and 1914, Berlin and Brussels in 1912, and London in 1911, 1912 and 1914. This last recital, on June 12, 1914, became notorious when, during a performance of The Battle Of Adrianople with CRW Nevinson on drums, a group of disgruntled vorticists, including Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Jacob Epstein interrupted the performance, jeering and shouting to protest at Marinetti's co-opting of vorticists' signatures to an English translation of the Futurist Manifesto.Blasting The Future! Black, Philip Wilson Publishing, 2004 p100 On another occasion at the Lyceum Club, 1911, Marinetti challenged an Irish journalist to a duel after a perceived slight against the Italian Army. Largely as a result of these tours, and the ease in which his publications including Zang Tumb Tumb could be distributed and disseminated, Futurism was better known than Cubism before World War I, and in England at least had become a synonym by the English Press to simply mean any forward looking trends in modern art.

Population was 15 in 2006 (stats Canada census). Keno City was the site of a former silver-lead mining area proximal to Keno Hill. Keno City is 13 kilometres away from Elsa, Yukon, which is owned by Alexco Resource Corp who currently own and operate the various Ag-Pb-Zn deposits in the Keno Hill area. Rich silver and lead ore deposits were found on Keno Hill in 1919, and since then the population of the community has fluctuated in response to the mining activity in the area. When in 1989 United Keno Hill closed the mines, literally overnight, the people in the Keno area who decided to stay chose a more sustainable economy: tourism. They successfully marketed Keno City as the quiet, tranquil community. History Keno City was named after the gambling game Keno popular in mining camps at the turn of the 20th century. A small placer mining operation is behind Keno City, indicating the present support for active disturbance of earth materials through mining in the vicinity of Keno City. Some people believe that fewer materials will be moved through the new Alexco proposal than have been moved by placer mining around Keno City. The issue, however, is not the amount of material being moved but the placing of an industrial facility (crusher/mill/tailings) close to a residential community. Keno City has also developed some tourism-based businesses, and its attraction is the Keno Mining Museum with an extensive collection dedicated to the history of mining in Yukon from the early 1900s until the present.

Local mines With the property abandoned by the previous owners, and mounting environmental impacts due to metal laden water coming from mine adits, in 2006 the Federal Government sold the assets of former United Keno Hill Mines through the Supreme Court to an Alexco Resource Corp. (Vancouver based mining company) subsidiary for $410,000. Alexco now became the 100% owner of the Yukon Keno Hill Silver district (23,350 hectares hosting 35 prior producing mines, its own private town of Elsa, and the infrastructure), with a requirement to stop the environmental degradation and a contract to clean up past impacts. With this deal Alexco also became the sole-source clean-up contractor to the Government of Canada in charge to clean up the environmental mess left by former mining activities (estimated $60+ millions of taxpayer's monies). In 2009 Alexco decided to resume silver mining in the district. Some of the 15 residents of Keno City have opposed a proposal by Alexco to build the crusher/mill and tailing facility less than one kilometre from their homes in Keno City, YT which will impact this quiet small community. The ore was historically processed in Elsa, which is located approximately 13 km away from Keno City. This proposal was recommended to proceed subject to specified terms and conditions by the Mayo Designated Office of Yukon Socio-Economic Assessment board (YESAB). Yukon's Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR) issued the Quartz Mining Licence in November 2009. While some of the 15 residents of Keno continue to oppose the mill location, support for the project includes the local community of Mayo and the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun. First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun as well as residents of Mayo live 60 km away from the mill plant. Recent test runs of just the ball mill have shown noise levels of 50- 55 dbA.

April 1408), commonly known as Miran Shah (), was a son of the Central Asian conqueror Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire. During his father's reign, Miran Shah was initially a powerful regional governor and prominent military commander, having aided Timur in his conquests as well as suppressing several revolts. However, after facing accusations of destructive and hedonistic behaviour, the prince was later deposed from these roles by the emperor. Following Timur's death in 1405, Miran Shah became embroiled in the ensuing war of succession, having thrown his support behind his son Khalil Sultan. He was later killed whilst battling against the Timurid's traditional rivals, the Qara Qoyunlu. Though never ruling in his own right, the line of Miran Shah played a prominent role in the history of the Timurid Empire. His grandson Abu Sa'id Mirza eventually came to rule the majority of Transoxiana in the latter half of the 15th century. Abu Sa'id's own grandson was Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire of India. Early life Miran Shah was born in 1366, the third of Timur's four sons. His mother was a concubine, Mengli Khatun, daughter of Hayut of the Jauni Qurban tribe. In 1380, prior to his conquest of Khorasan, Timur pre-emptively named Miran Shah (at this point fourteen years old) governor of the region. The kingdom was then under the rule of the Kartid dynasty, who quickly submitted to Timur's army. In 1383, the head of the former royal family, Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali, became complicit in a plot against Timur. Miran Shah quickly crushed the rebellion and annexed the Kartid capital of Herat, which he made his viceregal seat. Several years later, the last of the Kartids, Ghiyas-uddin's son Pir Muhammad, was killed by Miran Shah in a banquet that the latter hosted. Miran Shah, who supposedly laughed while decapitation the prince, later explained his actions were due to excessive drinking. Military career In the winter of 1386, Timur launched an invasion of Azerbaijan, an area that had by that point been sought after by the Golden Horde for over a century. Tokhtamysh, the Khan of the Golden Horde and Timur's erstwhile ally, sent his army against the invading force and defeated their advance-guard, resulting in the loss of forty of Timur's officers. Miran Shah was commanded to avenge this defeat and routed the enemy force, pursuing the fleeing soldiers as far as Derbent, the frontier of the Golden Horde. Some of Tokhtamysh's most distinguished followers were taken captive, who were then escorted by Miran Shah to his father's winter quarters in Qarabagh, where they were presented to Timur in chains. Contrary to his usual practise however, Timur treated the prisoners leniently and returned them to Tokhtamysh. They were sent bearing only paternal reproaches towards the Khan, a final, ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Timur to discourage his former mentee from further hostilities. Several revolts were also put down by Miran Shah in subsequent years. In 1389 the governor of Tus, Amir Hajji Beg Jauni Qurbani, aided by a Sarbadar ruler, sought to make himself independent. Timur sent Miran Shah who, after a protracted siege of several months, had Tus sacked and razed, with the city suffering a heavy death toll. In 1394, Timur entered a conflict with members of a Sufi sect known as the Hurufis. This was likely as a result of both heresy charges laid against the group by traditional religious scholars, as well as Timur's own attempts to remove potential threats to his rule from the area. Miran Shah was instructed to arrest the founder of the movement Fazlallah Astarabadi al-Hurufi who was, according to legend, executed by the prince himself. The death of their leader led al- Hurufi's followers to have a specific hatred against the Timurids. Miran Shah in particular was considered to be the Dajjal (Antichrist) and was further mocked as Maran Shah (King of Snakes). Viceroy of Persia A miniature of Miran Shah, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum By 1393, Timur had conquered all the lands that had formerly been part of the Mongol Ilkhanate. This dominion, which Timur termed \\"the throne of Hulagu\\", was bestowed upon Miran Shah. The prince's fief was now the entirety of northern Persia and Transcaucasia, and included the cities of Baghdad, Tabriz and Soltaniyeh. However Miran Shah, who had been suffering from mental issues following a fall from his horse several years earlier, began to show increasingly destructive tendencies during his rule. Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo, the Castilian ambassador to Timur's court, claimed that the prince had ancient buildings destroyed, supposedly so that it would be known that \\"Miran Shah did nothing himself, but he ordered the finest works in the world to be demolished\\". The poet Daulatshah reported that Miran Shah also ordered the tomb of the historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani be dismantled and for his bones to be re-interred in a Jewish cemetery. This was said to be due to the latter's Semitic descent. There are doubts however regarding this claim, since Miran Shah was purported to have had an interest in Muslim historic literature. Reports eventually started reaching Timur of his son's behaviour. Stories were heard in the imperial court of chaotic gambling, drinking bouts held within mosques and gold coins being scattered from palace windows to frenzied mobs. Miran Shah's excessive lifestyle evidently took its toll on his health, as he was described by Clavijo as \\"big and fat, and he suffers much from the gout.\\" In addition to this, Timur had concerns regarding unrest and taxation problems in Miran Shah's domains, as well as the prince's military failures. Chief among these was his inability to capture the fortress of Alinja from the Jalairid Sultanate in 1395. Here Prince Tahir, son of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, had been besieged by Miran Shah before being relieved by George VI of Georgia, the combined forces of whom defeated the Timurid army. Worries had also been raised for the emperor regarding his son's loyalty. Miran Shah had alluded in letters about his father's increasing age and doubts about Timur's continued capabilities of ruling. These suspicions were realised when Miran Shah's wife, the Khwarezmian princess Khanzada Begum, reached out to her father-in-law. Khanzada reported her husband's rebellious intentions as well as complaining about her mistreatment at his hands. Daulatshah states that Timur was moved to tears when Khanzada presented to him her blood-stained chemise, though this episode was not confirmed in contemporary sources. Official histories only state that Miran Shah made crude accusations against her that were later disproved. Nevertheless, the angry Khanzada never returned to her husband and remained with Timur in Samarqand. In 1399, Timur sent a detachment of troops under his nephew Sulaiman Shah to investigate his concerns. Miran Shah, without posing any difficulties, returned with them to face his father, who had by this point arrived in Soltaniyeh to confront him. Having tied a rope around his neck, Miran Shah appeared before the emperor and begged for his forgiveness. Timur was said to have been at the point of ordering his son's execution, only refraining due to the intercession of his relatives and nobles. Instead, Miran Shah was deposed from his lands and assigned to Timur's own retinue, where he would remain for the next four years. His friends and advisers, among whom were well known figures, were severely punished, with some being executed for the alleged crime of corrupting the prince and leading him astray. War of succession and death The Gur-e-Amir in Samarqand, Uzbekistan Miran Shah's headstone (far left) in the Gur-e-Amir Timur had never unambiguously appointed an heir, so at the time of his death in February 1405, a succession dispute erupted among his surviving sons and grandsons. Miran Shah was Timur's eldest living son by this point, but was not considered an active contender to the throne and was passed over in favour of his own son, Khalil Sultan. The latter proclaimed himself emperor at Tashkent soon after his grandfather's death and seized the royal treasury, as well as Timur's imperial capital Samarqand. Sultan Husayn Tayichiud, a maternal grandson of Timur as well as Miran Shah's son-in-law, also made a bid for the throne before aligning himself with Khalil Sultan. Shah Rukh, governor of Herat and Timur's other surviving son, made no offensive move against his nephews at this point. This was likely due to Miran Shah, who posed a serious threat as he, along with his other son Abu Bakr, had led an army out of Azerbaijan in support of Khalil Sultan. However, Miran Shah and Abu Bakr were forced to withdraw prior to being able to do this. Ahmad Jalayir, who had been expelled by Timur fifteen years previously, took advantage of the old emperor's death to recapture his former lands. The two princes drove out Jalayir at Tabriz before being forced to contend with another former enemy: Qara Yusuf, ruler of the Black Sheep Turkomans. In 1406, Qara Yusuf defeated the Timurids at the Battle of Nakhchivan and captured Tabriz. Miran Shah and Abu Bakr attempted to retake the city in the Battle of Sardrud on the 20 April 1408, but were decisively defeated by the joint efforts of the Turkomans and Jalayirids. As a result of this rout, all of Timur's western conquests were lost, with the Timurids being subsequently driven out of western Persia. Though Abu Bakr had managed to escape, Miran Shah was struck down during the battle by a Turkoman chief who, having not recognised the prince, had stripped and looted his body. Qara Yusuf then had his head impaled before the walls of Tabriz to induce the cities inhabitants to surrender. Shortly thereafter, the Turkoman ruler sent Miran Shah's head and body, along with his own condolences, to Shah Rukh, who had emerged the victor in the war of succession. Miran Shah was buried alongside his father in the Gur-e-Amir in Samarqand.

New Zealand career Old Government Buildings, Wellington He established the practice of Mason and Clayton with William Mason (later first mayor of Dunedin), and over six years designed many prominent buildings in the area, such as All Saints' Church, Dunedin. the Excelsior Hotel, and Edinburgh House. In 1869 Clayton moved to Wellington to take up a post as the first (and only) Colonial Architect, in which position he became central to the public works projects of prime minister Julius Vogel (Clayton's daughter Mary had married Vogel in 1867). He designed many public buildings in Wellington, including the old Government House and Parliament buildings, but he is best known for designing the Old Government Buildings in Wellington, then part of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings and the second-largest wooden building in the world (behind T≈çdai-ji in Nara, Japan). An important design in Christchurch is the Chief Post Office in Cathedral Square, a Category I heritage building.

Situated at the head of the Northwest Arm, from which it derives its name, Armdale borders the southern part of an isthmus connecting the Halifax Peninsula with the larger Chebucto Peninsula. As of 2011, the population of Armdale was approximately 9,904.Population Counts History The Mi'kmaq people attacked the British blockhouse at Armdale numerous times during Father Le Loutre's War. In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Mi'kmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. They also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a saw-mill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the Northwest Arm. They killed two men.Piers, Harry. The Evolution of the Halifax Fortress (Halifax, PANS, Pub. #7, 1947), p. 6 As cited in Peter Landry's. The Lion and the Lily. Vol. 1. Trafford Press. 2007. p. 370 (Map of Halifax Blockhouses) In 1753, when Lawrence became governor, the Mi'kmaq attacked again upon the sawmills near the South Blockhouse on the Northwest Arm, where they killed three British. The Mi'kmaq made three attempts to retrieve the bodies for their scalps.Thomas Atkins. History of Halifax City. Brook House Press. 2002 (reprinted 1895 edition). p 209 Original names for the community included Dutch Village, North-West Arm, and Armdale District. During the 1960s, the city of Halifax amalgamated Armdale and neighbouring Spryfield, Fairview and Rockingham in a westward expansion off the Halifax Peninsula. From 1969 until the creation of Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996, Armdale and its neighbouring communities west of the Halifax Peninsula were grouped under the colloquial term \\"Mainland Halifax\\". The community was at the head of the Northwest Arm, west of the Canadian National Railway tracks leading to downtown Halifax. Armdale railway station was once located near the Chebucto Road underpass. The community also extended for a short distance up the St. Margaret's Bay Road, Herring Cove Road, and Purcell's Cove Road but was mostly concentrated in the valley near the junction of these roads. The largest employer during the 20th century in the Armdale area was Simpson's and later Simpsons-Sears, which operated a large warehouse for its catalogue division beside the railway line. This was later superseded by Maritime Life Assurance Company, which was absorbed by Manulife Financial in 2004. Armdale had its own post office, which no longer operates. Prior to and following amalgamation with the City of Halifax, Armdale developed into a residential neighborhood consisting of single family homes and small apartment buildings. A nearby commercial district in West End Halifax centred on the Halifax Shopping Centre and West End Mall has kept Armdale relatively free from retail development. Today, the name Armdale is mostly associated with a traffic circle located at the junction of Herring Cove Road, St. Margaret's Bay Road, Quinpool Road, Chebucto Road, and Joseph Howe Drive.

subarachnoid space so that it reaches the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is useful in spinal anesthesia, chemotherapy, or pain management applications. This route is also used to introduce drugs that fight certain infections, particularly post- neurosurgical. The drug needs to be given this way to avoid being stopped by the blood brain barrier. The same drug given orally must enter the blood stream and may not be able to pass out and into the brain. Drugs given by the intrathecal route often have to be compounded specially by a pharmacist or technician because they cannot contain any preservative or other potentially harmful inactive ingredients that are sometimes found in standard injectable drug preparations. The route of administration is sometimes simply referred to as \\"intrathecal\\"; however, the term is also an adjective that refers to something occurring in or introduced into the anatomic space or potential space inside a sheath, most commonly the arachnoid membrane of the brain or spinal cord (under which is the subarachnoid space). For example, intrathecal immunoglobulin production is production of antibodies in the spinal cord. The abbreviation \\"IT\\" is best not used; instead, \\"intrathecal\\" is spelled out to avoid medical mistakes. Intrathecal administration of analgesic agents Very popular for a single 24-hour dose of analgesia (opioid with local anesthetic) *Caution because of late onset hypoventilation due to intrathecal opioids *Severe pruritus and urinary retention may limit the use of intrathecal morphine *Pethidine has the unusual property of being both a local anaesthetic and opioid analgesic which occasionally permits its use as the sole intrathecal anaesthetic agent * An intrathecal catheter and pump can be used to deliver a local anaesthetic and sometimes also an opioid and/or clonidine. Intrathecal chemotherapyCurrently, only four agents are licensed for intrathecal chemotherapy They are methotrexate, cytarabine (Ara-C), hydrocortisone, and, rarely, thiotepa. *Accidental administration of any vinca alkaloids‚Äîespecially vincristine but also vinblastine, vinorelbine, or others‚Äîvia the intrathecal route is nearly always fatal. Intrathecal baclofen Often reserved for spastic cerebral palsy, intrathecally- administered baclofen is done through an intrathecal pump implanted just below the skin of the abdomen, (or behind the chest wall, depending on the surgeon implanting the device, and patient preferences), with a tube (called the 'catheter') connected directly to the base of the spine, where it bathes the spinal cord using a dose about one thousand times smaller than that required by orally-administered baclofen. Intrathecal baclofen also carries none of the side effects, such as sleepiness, that typically occur with oral baclofen. However, intrathecal baclofen pumps carry serious clinical risks, such as infection or a possibly fatal sudden malfunction, that oral baclofen does not. A tremendous amount of care is taken to ensure the optimal location of the pump and catheter, based upon medical considerations and patient requirements.

Kimball and Orson Hyde, Clayton was baptized October 21, 1837; ordained a priest in December; and a high priest on April 1, 1838.Biography of William Clayton, The Joseph Smith Papers. Accessed December 21, 2011. Clayton's parents and siblings also joined the church. Clayton quit his job as a factory clerk to devote his time to missionary service in England, where he founded a branch of the church in Manchester. In 1838, he served as second counselor to the British mission president Joseph Fielding, with Willard Richards as first counselor. In September 1840, Clayton led a group of British converts who emigrated to the United States. He and his family first tried to farm in Iowa Territory, then settled in the predominantly Latter Day Saint community of Nauvoo, Illinois. There he was a clerk and scribe to Joseph Smith. In an 1840 letter, Clayton wrote to church members in Manchester about interacting with Smith: > We have had the privilege of conversing with Joseph Smith Jr. and we are > delighted with his company. We have had a privilege of ascertaining in a > great measure from whence all the evil reports have arisen and hitherto have > every reason to believe him innocent. He is not an idiot, but a man of sound > judgment, and possessed of abundance of intelligence and whilst you listen > to his conversation you receive intelligence which expands your mind and > causes your heart to rejoice. He is very familiar, and delights to instruct > the poor saints. I can converse with him just as easy as I can with you, and > with regard to being willing to communicate instruction he says, \\"I receive > it freely and I will give it freely.\\" He is willing to answer any question I > have put to him and is pleased when we ask him questions. Clayton was responsible for maintaining church records in Nauvoo, including those considered private and sacred. Other positions in the church and community included: * recorder and clerk of the Nauvoo City Council, * elected treasurer of Nauvoo, * secretary pro tem of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, * an officer in the Nauvoo Music Association, * a member of the church's influential Council of Fifty, and * a member of Joseph Smith's private prayer circle where the Latter Day Saint temple ceremonies were first introduced. =Plural marriage= In 1843, Smith dictated a revelation on plural marriage to Clayton. As the practice of polygamy was initially secret, Clayton spent time dealing with rumors and innuendo about the practice both in the church and surrounding community. he accepted plural marriage as a religious principle, and ultimately married nine wives and fathered 42 children. Three of his wives later left him. =Journal and personal records= Clayton's impressions of day-to-day activities, recorded in a series of personal journals, describe the social activities of mid-19th century America and the evolution of Mormon religious culture. After Smith's death, Clayton helped complete Smith's official church history, using his personal journals as a major source. Clayton's personal records were at times incorporated into official Mormon scripture and history without recognition of their source. His notes were one of four sources used to reconstruct a sermon by Smith known as the \\"King Follett Discourse\\". Published sections of Clayton's journals also provide a detailed description of the Nauvoo Temple and an account of the Latter Day Saints' efforts to complete temple endowments for all interested members before being forced to leave Illinois. Migration to the west Early in February 1846, Clayton left Nauvoo with the first Latter Day Saint group in their exodus to the West. He spent the winter of 1846‚Äì47 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. The following year, he was a member of the vanguard company that crossed the plains to select a western site for Mormon colonization. He was a recording scribe for Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, during the journey. The group traveled along the Platte River into present day Wyoming territory and crossed the continental divide, ultimately reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley in modern Utah. Clayton's pioneer journal, later published, is the most well-known account of the expedition. He noted that land in the Salt Lake valley would be easy to clear as it had limited timber, and expressed concern over the apparent scarcity of rainfall. Clayton later prepared and published The Latter-day Saints' Emigrants' Guide, a meticulous description of the route from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City, with suggestions for camping places. Using his odometer, the guide had the most accurate distances of the day. It was a valuable guide for Mormon migrants, but was also used by pioneers bound for the Oregon and California territories. =\\"Come, Come, Ye Saints\\" and other hymns= In April 1846, while camped near Locust Creek on the plains of Iowa, Clayton wrote the words to the popular Mormon hymn, now known as \\"Come, Come, Ye Saints\\", which is sung to the music of a traditional English song, \\"All is Well\\". The hymn was in response to good news from Mormons still living in Nauvoo. One of his plural wives, Diantha, had given birth to a healthy baby boy, William Adriel Benoni Clayton. In his journal, he stated that he \\"composed a new song‚Äî'All is well.' I feel to thank my heavenly father for my boy and pray that he will spare and preserve his life and that of his mother and so order it so that we may soon meet again.\\" To modern Latter-day Saints, this hymn signifies the difficulties and faith involved in the Mormon migration to the west.Cracroft, in Walker and Dant, pp. 143-145 Some of Clayton's other poems have also been put to music, including \\"When First the Glorious Light of Truth\\", also used as a hymn by the LDS Church. =The Roadometer= Clayton is credited with inventing a version of the modern odometer, during this trip across the plains from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah, with the help of apostle and mathematician Orson Pratt. Clayton was assigned to record the number of miles the company traveled each day. This was accomplished by tying a red flag onto one of the wagon wheels, and counting the revolutions. After three weeks, Clayton tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with Pratt, he developed a design consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \\"counting\\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. The apparatus was built by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon. Clayton's journal records: \\"About noon today Brother Appleton Harmon completed the machinery on the wagon called a 'roadometer' by adding a wheel to revolve once in ten miles, showing each mile and also each quarter mile we travel, and then casing the whole over so as to secure it from the weather.\\" The \\"roadometer\\" was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. =Life in Utah= Once settled in Utah, Clayton continued to maintain church records and also participated in public and private business activities. He became an auditor for Utah Territory, as well as recorder of marks and brands, holding both positions until his death. Clayton also worked as treasurer of the Deseret Telegraph Company and as secretary of Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), a church based cooperative business enterprise. Private ventures included collecting debts, filing land claims, acting as a legal advocate, lending money, merchandising, farming, and mining speculation. Clayton was active in cultural activities in the Salt Lake Valley, particularly those associated with music. He died in Salt Lake City on December 4, 1879. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Latterly he sat as an independent Member of Parliament (MP) and AM for the same constituency. Background Born in Abergavenny, Law was educated at Grofield Secondary School and then attended Nant-y-Glo Community College. He later studied at the Open University. He ran a General Store between 1964 and 1987. He was subsequently appointed chair of Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust.Death of a fighter  South Wales Argus Political career Law served as a councillor for Nantyglo and Blaenau Urban District Council between 1970 and 1974. He continued to serve as a councillor on Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council until 1999 and was appointed mayor for 1988-89.

However, the Labour AMs voted instead for John Marek who was an Independent AM, thereby ensuring that an opposition member was in the Chair and unable to vote against the Welsh Assembly Government. =2005 General Election= Law left the Labour Party in protest at the use of an all- woman shortlist in selecting the candidate for the general election, which was used to replace the retiring Llew Smith. Law believed all-woman shortlists were being selectively imposed on local parties only where a leadership supported male candidate was unlikely to be selected, citing the example of Ed Balls and Pat McFadden as new leadership-supported male candidates, and noting that use of all-woman shortlists had been stopped in Scotland. Smith had enjoyed a majority of 19,313, making it the safest parliamentary seat in Wales. Prior to the announcement of Law's rumoured candidacy, his Labour opponent Maggie Jones stated that Law would be \\"very foolish\\" to stand against her. She argued \\"Blaenau Gwent is solidly Labour and I don't think people will vote for anyone else.\\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales- news/controversial-candidate-strikes-back-smear-2406481 Law won the seat with 58.2% of the vote, defeating Labour candidate Maggie Jones, and gaining a majority of 9,121 votes. His successful campaign was all the more remarkable, given that he campaigned while recovering for surgery for a brain tumour.Peter Law  The Independent Law initially withdrew from the election on 4 April upon receiving the news of his tumour, but he was persuaded to continue standing, receiving treatment throughout the campaign.Brain tumour forces Law out of poll  South Wales Argus Shortly after his victory, Law highlighted his former party's failure to acknowledge the problems with the use of all-women short- lists, stating: \\"What I find very strange is that even after the result in Blaenau Gwent, there is no one in the party [Labour] who is prepared to admit that they were wrong.\\" Law noted Prime Minister Tony Blair's initial misgivings about the shortlist and how this contrasted with the views of his wife Cherie Blair, questioning whether she had excessive influence over the UK leaderhttps://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cherie-sad-laws-victory- over-2396658 Law's independent position has a particularity significant impact in the Welsh Assembly, as it meant Labour lost its majority. As a result, the party suffered a number of defeats by combined opposition parties who, when they agreed to do so, were able to vote down a various of Labour policies. Law was the third Welsh MP or AM to win a constituency as both a party candidate and an independent, following S. O. Davies who was MP for Merthyr Tydfil from 1934 until his death in 1972, who was deselected by the local Labour Party on grounds of age prior to the 1970 general election but ran against the official candidate as an independent and won; and John Marek who remained AM for Wrexham, later forming his own party, Forward Wales. =Parliamentary Career= Law won the award of Welsh Politician of the Year by both BBC Waleshttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4484690.stm and the Wales Yearbook.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZRsvDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT134 Personal life Law married Trish Bolter in 1976 and they have three daughter and two sons.

As a result of his death, there were by-elections in Blaenau Gwent for both the UK Parliament and the Welsh Assembly seats. In the by-elections Law's former agent, Dai Davies, won the election to Law's former Westminster seat, while his widow Trish Law succeeded him in the Welsh Assembly. Both stood under the banner of the Blaenau Gwent People's Voice Group. His widow has claimed that he was offered a peerage not to stand against Labour in Blaenau Gwent in 2005, an allegation denied by Labour, The claim had considerable media impact because of the ongoing Cash for Peerages police investigation.

He directed the Pixar short film Geri's Game and served as co- director and co-wrote the story for Ratatouille, both of which went on to win Oscars. Early life His family immigrated to Britain in 1969, where he obtained British citizenship. He attended Colchester Royal Grammar School from 1974 to 1982 showing interest and talent in the arts, music, drama and sculpture. (One of his juvenile sculptures 'Big Cat' was acquired by Essex University and put on permanent display outside the library.) After obtaining an 8mm movie camera for Christmas in 1975, he began experimenting with pixilation, stop-motion plasticine, paper-drawn and cel animation. He had some early prize-winning successes in animation competitions. Most notably, he won the Young Film-Maker's Competition of the Year Award 1980 on the long-running (1969 to 1984) BBC children's quiz series Screen Test for his animated short \\"The Rainbow\\". This was hailed in 2001 on Channel 4's \\"100 Greatest Kids' TV shows\\" by ex-Screen Test presenters Michael Rodd and Brian Trueman as \\"the only occasion in the history of the competition where we came across a piece of film that was spectacularly professional\\", a clip of him receiving the award is shown in the 2007 film Son of Rambow. He went on to study Computer Science at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated with first class honours and obtained his PhD, During this time he also represented his university in archery, fencing and hang-gliding competitions, and continued developing his cartoon drawing skills. Career After university he turned to a career in computer animation initially in London, with Digital Pictures, who specialised in TV commercials. In 1993 he joined Pixar, and moved to the USA. His \\"Arrows\\" TV commercial for Listerine won the Gold Clio Award in 1994. His 1997 animated short Geri's Game won the Oscar for Best Animated Short on his mother's birthday, which prompted him to dedicate the award to her long- distance, with a message in Czech and won a string of other awards. The short film \\"67 Aluminum Plates\\" was created during the 1998 Ottawa International Animation Festival by a group of volunteers under the direction of Jan Pinkava. The film is stop motion, filmed in one long day and edited the next. It was shown on the closing night of the festival. In 2000, he began work as director on Ratatouille, a European-flavoured, ultimate-outsider tale based on his original story. This was to have been his feature film debut and the first Pixar film beyond the terms of the then-expiring Pixar-Disney franchise. In 2005, Pinkava was replaced as main director by The Incredibles director Brad Bird. In an interview given in 2006, Pinkava had \\"no comment\\" about this turn of events and for two years staunchly refrained from comment on the genesis of the film. At the time when he was replaced, Pinkava had written the core storyline of the film and created the styling, key characters, and sets. Following his departure from the project, Pinkava initially undertook other duties and then left the company. In the final film, Pinkava is credited for his original story idea and as the co-director. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including a nomination for Pinkava (along with Jim Capobianco and Bird) in the Best Original Screenplay category. He subsequently worked as a director at LAIKA on his new film Little White Lie, but left in 2011; along with Claire Jennings, the studio's head of entertainment. In his most recent assignment, with Motorola Mobility, he came up with a new, in- phone, interactive animation genre.

He joined Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt and Elliott Torrance Galt in their western industrial enterprises as a surveyor, later becoming Elliott's assistant and Land Commissioner of the North Western Coal and Navigation Company. He was also the first mayor of Lethbridge, Alberta, which has a major street (Mayor Magrath Drive) named after him. Magrath was a member of the North-West Legislative Assembly from 1891 to 1898. He was appointed as a cabinet minister in the Frederick Haultain administration in 1897. In the 1891 and 1894 general elections and an 1897 by- election, he represented Lethbridge and was acclaimed. Magrath was elected to the House of Commons representing the Medicine Hat constituency (1908‚Äì1911). He was fuel controller during the Great War and chairman of Ontario Hydro and the Canadian section of the International Joint Commission. He also served on the Newfoundland Royal Commission of 1933. He married Margaret Holmes White Mair in 1887. After giving birth to a son, Charles Bolton, in 1888, she died in June 1892 of complications following the birth of a daughter. In 1899, he married Mabel Lillian Galt, a daughter of Sir Alexander and half-sister of Elliot Galt. Two daughters were born of this union: Amy and Laura.

Spivey Hall is home to the award-winning Spivey Hall Children's Choir and Spivey Hall Young Artists. The Children's Concert Series, sponsored in part by Delta Air Lines, won the prestigious Abby Award for arts education in Atlanta in 1998. The Hall was the inspiration of Emilie Parmalee Spivey and Walter Boone Spivey, wealthy real estate developer couple of the Atlanta Area. The Walter & Emilie Spivey Foundation donated $2.5 million to the construction which began in November 1988 (total cost, $4.5 million). Though intimately involved in the planning, by the time of the groundbreaking, Walter had died, and Emilie died soon thereafter. The visual centerpiece of Spivey's design is the Albert Schweitzer Memorial Organ, a 79-rank, 3-manual, 4,413-pipe organ, built and installed by Fratelli Ruffatti of Padua, Italy. The creation of this organ was the subject of a PBS special. The majority of Spivey's finishes were designed to be acoustically reflective, in an effort to preserve the sound within and prolong its reverberation.

It began in mid-November 1912 and ended on 26 March 1913 with the capture of Edirne (Adrianople) by the Bulgarian 2nd Army and the Serbian 2nd Army. The loss of Edirne delivered the final decisive blow on the Ottoman army and brought the First Balkan War to a close. A treaty was signed in London on 30 May. The city was reoccupied and retained by the Ottomans during the Second Balkan War. The victorious end of the siege was considered to be an enormous military success because the city's defenses had been carefully developed by leading German siege experts and called 'undefeatable'. The Bulgarian army, after five months of siege and two bold night attacks, took the Ottoman stronghold. The victors were under the overall command of General Nikola Ivanov, and the commander of the Bulgarian forces on the eastern sector of the fortress was General Georgi Vazov, the brother of the famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov and of General Vladimir Vazov. One early use of an airplane for bombing took place during the siege: the Bulgarians dropped special hand grenades from one or more airplanes in an effort to cause panic among Ottoman soldiers. Many young Bulgarian officers and professionals who took part in this decisive battle of the First Balkan War would later play important roles in Bulgarian politics, culture, commerce and industry. Siege artillery arriving before Adrianople, 3 November 1912. Serbian artillery at siege. Edirne people living under siege, 1913 Final battle The final battle consisted of two night attacks. Preparations for the battle included covering all metal parts of the uniforms and weapons with tissue to avoid any shine or noise. The several armies that took part in the siege were put under joint command, creating a prototype of a front. Some light artillery pieces towed by horses followed the advancing units, which played the role of infantry support guns. Attempts were made to perturb all Ottomans' radio communications to isolate and demoralize the besieged troops. On 24 March 1913, the external fortifications began to be captured in one night, and the next night, the fortress itself fell into Bulgarian hands. Early in the morning on 26 March 1913, the commander of the fortress, Mehmed ≈û√ºkr√º Pasha, surrendered to the Bulgarian army,–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ: –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2007 which ended the siege. After the surrender, large parts of the city, especially the houses of Muslims and Jews, were subjected to looting for three days. However, it is disputed who actually carried out the looting since some accounts accuse the Bulgarian army and other sources accuse the local Greek population.Jews, Turks, Ottomans: a shared history, fifteenth through the twentieth century, Avigdor Levy, p. 187, 2002 The Bulgarian achievements until were fairly summarized by a British war correspondent: \\"A nation with a population of less than five million and a military budget of less than two million pounds per annum placed in the field within fourteen days of mobilization an army of 400,000 men, and in the course of four weeks moved that army over 160 miles in hostile territory, captured one fortress and invested another, fought and won two great battles against the available armed strength of a nation of twenty million inhabitants, and stopped only at the gates of the hostile capital. With the exception of the Japanese and Gurkhas, the Bulgarians alone of all troops go into battle with the fixed intention of killing at least one enemy.\\" There were many journalists who reported on the Siege of Adrianople; their accounts provide rich details about it. Serbian units involved were the 2nd Army, under the command of General (later Vojvoda, equivalent to Field Marshal) Stepa Stepanoviƒá (two divisions and some support units) and heavy artillery (38 siege cannons and howitzers of 120 and 150 mm purchased from French Schneider-Canet factory in 1908); they had been dispatched because the Bulgarians lacked heavy artillery (though they were well supplied with Krupp-designed 75 mm field artillery).  Arrival of Serbian forces  Serbian forces, commanded by General Stepa Stepanoviƒá, arrived on 6 November 1912. In Mustafa Pasha Place, a railway station outside Odrin, Stepanoviƒá immediately reported to the supreme commander, General Nikola Ivanov. The Serbian Second Army was formed from the Timok Division without the 14th Regiment, the Second Danube Division reinforced with the 4th Reserve Regiment and the Second Drina Artillery Division. There was a total of 47,275 Serbian troops with 72 artillery guns, 4,142 horses and oxen and 3,046 cars. The arrival of the Serbian soldiers greatly improved the morale of the Bulgarian troops at Odrin. Both Serbian divisions were immediately sent to the front. The Timok Division, strengthened by a Bulgarian regiment, occupied the north-western sector between Maritsa and Tundzha Rivers, its sector being 15 km long. The Danube Division occupied a 5 km stretch of the western sector between the Maritsa and Arda Rivers. A combined brigade was formed from the Timok Cavalry Regiment and the Bulgarian guard Cavalry Regiment to scout the Maritsa Valley.

After training as an economist and working as a macroeconomic forecaster at the Economist Intelligence UnitKitty Ussher - LinkedIn url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kittyussher/?originalSubdomain=uk, she was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Burnley at the 2005 general election, succeeding Peter Pike. Seen as a high flier, she went on to serve as a minister in Gordon Brown's government from 2007 to 2009, mainly at the Treasury, but also at the Department for Work and Pensions, having previously been a Special Advisor at the Department for Trade and Industry.Kitty Ussher LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/kittyussher/?originalSubdomain=uk At the time she was the second-youngest government minister, and the youngest woman. Ussher resigned from her ministerial role in 2009 following her involvement in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal in which it was reported she had taken action on the advice of her accountants to reduce her capital gains tax liability.. She did not stand at the 2010 election, citing the desire for a more normal family life while her children were young. Since, she has worked primarily in public policy thought leadership, at Demos and as Managing Director of Tooley Street Research. Kitty Ussher LinkedIn Biography Ussher is the daughter of an Anglo-Irish lawyer father and a headmistress mother whose brother is Peter Bottomley. Consequently, she is a niece-in-law of the former Conservative cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, and a granddaughter of the diplomat Sir James Bottomley. She is also distantly descended from the family of Archbishop James Ussher. Ussher was educated on a free place at the independent St Paul's Girls' School; she subsequently attended Balliol College, Oxford, where she read PPE, and Birkbeck College, London, where she took a MSc in Economics. Early career In her early career, she was chief economist for Britain in Europe and an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Centre for European Reform, as well as working for MPs Paul Boateng, Martin O'Neill, Kim Howells and Adam Ingram. From 1998 to 2002 she also served as a councillor for Vassall ward in the London Borough of Lambeth, where she chaired the Council's Finance and Environment Scrutiny Committees. From 2001, until her selection as a parliamentary candidate in February 2004, she was special adviser to Patricia Hewitt at the Department of Trade and Industry. Parliamentary career Ussher was elected as the member of Parliament for Burnley at the 2005 general election, having been selected through an All-Women Shortlist as the constituency's Labour candidate. The new intake of MPs was called the brightest for a generation. Class of 2005, Guardian, October 2005 https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/10/houseofcommons.uk From 2005 to 2006, Ussher was a member of the Public Accounts Committee. She was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Margaret Hodge, the Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, until 29 June 2007. In Gordon Brown's first reshuffle, she was appointed as City Minister, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, succeeding Ed Balls. The timing of her appointment, as the first signs of the credit crunch appeared, meant that she was party to crucial meetings of the Tripartite Committee of Treasury, FSA and the Bank of England as the authorities dealt with the collapse of Northern Rock, the subsequent financial crisis and its legislative response. She chaired the Treasury Islamic Finance Grouphttps://www.ft.com/content/990ca516-9094-11dc-a6f2-0000779fd2ac https://mondovisione.com/news/uk-city-minister-kitty-ussher-chairs-islamic- finance-experts-group-meeting-on-fe/ , leading to the issuance of the first sukuk government bond, co-chaired with Hector Sants the official High-Level Working Group on the efficiency of the UK capital-raising processHector Sants and co-chaired with Sir Michael Snyder the High-Level Working Group on the professional services sector.\\"Government launches new group to boost UK competitiveness\\", Moneymarketing, July 2008 https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/news/government-launches-new-group-to-boost- uk-competitiveness/\\"New Government Industry Group Champions Professional Services\\" September 2008 Her period in office also saw a review of the policy towards co-operatives and credit unions, to give them greater commercial freedom and ability to expand. She also developed the policy leading to the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008 that redistributes unclaimed banking assets to community use, and the Savings Gateway Act 2009 that provides financial incentives to poorer people to save. On 5 October 2008, she moved to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions, taking on broad welfare reform responsibilities previously undertaken by Stephen Timms and James Plaskitt. At the time of the reshuffle, she was described by Martin Waller, city diarist of The Times, as \\"one of the brighter denizens of the lower depths of the Brown administration\\" who had \\"made herself popular enough in the City\\". She became responsible for the government's review of housing benefit policy and a review of the social fund, as well as the Child Support Agency and welfare policy on lone parents. Ussher made London her permanent home in April 2009, moving to Brixton, so she could send her children to school in Westminster. In the June 2009 reshuffle she was moved back to the Treasury, this time promoted to Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, but ten days later resigned to prevent embarrassment to the government regarding her tax position, and was replaced by Sarah McCarthy-Fry, the MP for Portsmouth North. =Expenses controversy= On 10 May 2009 the Sunday Telegraph reported that within a year of being elected, Ussher was inquiring about claiming for around ¬£20,000 worth of renovations to her London home, a property she had owned for several years before becoming an MP. In her claims she stated: \\"The plumbing in the entire house is strange [...] The electrics are also odd [...] Most of the ceilings have Artex coverings. Three-dimensional swirls. It could be a matter of taste, but this counts as ‚Äòdilapidations‚Äô in my book!\\" A letter produced by the Telegraph include a covering \\"With Compliments\\" slip stating \\"I am aware this takes us over our limit. Please pay as much as you are able\\". The following month, Ussher resigned, citing a desire to \\"prevent embarrassment to the government\\" after allegations that she also temporarily changed the designation of her \\"main\\" home for tax purposes to reduce her tax bill. Ussher's main home was in London, but in order to reduce her capital gains tax bill by ¬£3,420 she temporarily designated her Burnley house as the main residence for one month while it was sold. A letter from her accountants concerning the matter was also hidden from the published official version of her office expenses file published online. In her resignation letter Ussher claimed that she had done nothing wrong and that her actions were \\"in line with HM Revenue and Customs guidance and based on the advice of a reputable firm of accountants who in turn were recommended to me by the House of Commons fees office\\". She also denied any abuse of the allowances system of the House of Commons. Four years later in an article on her blog she said she had nevertheless voluntarily paid the amount in question to HMRC stating that \\"Public servants should always be at pains to ensure that they are not only compliant with the letter of the law but also with the spirit of it, and I did not focus on that.\\" At the same time Ussher announced that she would not contest the next election, citing the difficulties in reconciling her parental responsibilities with the working hours of Parliament, stating that this decision had preceded the expenses controversy. Commenting on her resignation, the BBC described her as a \\"rising star\\" who had risen quickly through the ranks, despite only being elected in 2005. An investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into MPs' claims found that Ussher had breached the retrospectively-applied ¬£11,000 limit for building work in her kitchen and ordered her to repay ¬£1,271.65. Her appeal against the ruling, on the grounds that the limit was not in place at the time the expenses were incurred, was rejected as being outside the scope of the terms of enquiry of Sir Thomas Legg's investigation. Later career In May 2010, after leaving Parliament, Ussher became the new Chief Executive of Demos until 2012. Kitty Ussher LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/kittyussher/?originalSubdomain=uk She then became a research fellow of the Smith Institute, an associate at the Centre for London, a member of TheCityUK's Independent Economists' Panel, and a co founder of Labour in the City. In December 2013, she became Managing Director of Tooley Street Research, and economic and policy adviser to Portland Communications. She has also written pamphlets for the Fabian Society, the Social Market Foundation and Policy Network and for the FT.https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Kitty_Ussher In February 2015, she joined the Financial Services Consumer Panel, a scrutiny panel for the Financial Conduct Authority regulator. Between 2017-19 she spent two years working as an inner city maths teacher, as part of the inaugural cohort of Now Teach, a scheme to encourage older professionals to switch careers into teaching, stating in her blog that she \\"thought she should do something useful\\".

With Dorton, the team won nine NASCAR championships. On October 24, 2004, Dorton was killed in a plane crash in Patrick County, Virginia's Bull Mountain, near Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, in which he along with seven other passengers, a number of whom associated with Hendrick Motorsports, and the two pilots were killed. Career Born in Concord, North Carolina, Dorton began his NASCAR career in the 1970s working for crew chief Harry Hyde. In 1984, Dorton's company Competition Engines was bought out by Hendrick Motorsports, and two years later, he was named Engine Builder of the Year by NASCAR and Clevite Engine Parts. Dorton's engines helped guide the team to nine NASCAR titles (five in the Winston Cup Series, one in the Busch Series, and three in the Craftsman Truck Series). Dorton also worked with General Motors and Hendrick Motorsports in the research and development department. Death On October 24, 2004, Dorton and nine others boarded a Beechcraft Super King Air heading to Martinsville Speedway for the Subway 500. Flying into foggy weather, the pilots became disoriented, and flew five miles past Blue Ridge Airport, and when they attempted to perform the missed approach procedure, the plane flew two miles without making the necessary right turn, and the plane crashed into Bull Mountain, killing all on board; the race would begin 27 minutes later. Hendrick driver Jimmie Johnson won the race, though no post-race celebrations were held. In February 2006, Dorton's wife Dianne filed a lawsuit against Rick Hendrick alleging that he and his team were liable for Dorton's death, and claimed the team \\"showed 'conscious and intentional disregard' for Randy Dorton's safety, alleging that company president John Hendrick rejected the pilot's suggestion to divert to a different airport because of bad weather because he didn't want to be late for the race.\\" The suits were settled in 2011, six years after the crash. Legacy In tribute to Dorton, a 900-horsepower engine was built and used by Jimmie Johnson in a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro before being placed on display in the Hendrick Motorsports Museum. The trophy awarded to the winner of the Mahle Engine Builders Challenge is named the Randy Dorton Trophy in his honor.

In the classical period of Indian mathematics (400 AD to 1200 AD), important contributions were made by scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II, and VarƒÅhamihira. The decimal number system in use today: \\"The measure of the genius of Indian civilisation, to which we owe our modern (number) system, is all the greater in that it was the only one in all history to have achieved this triumph. Some cultures succeeded, earlier than the Indian, in discovering one or at best two of the characteristics of this intellectual feat. But none of them managed to bring together into a complete and coherent system the necessary and sufficient conditions for a number- system with the same potential as our own.\\" was first recorded in Indian mathematics. Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the concept of zero as a number,: \\"...our decimal system, which (by the agency of the Arabs) is derived from Hindu mathematics, where its use is attested already from the first centuries of our era. It must be noted moreover that the conception of zero as a number and not as a simple symbol of separation) and its introduction into calculations, also count amongst the original contribution of the Hindus.\\" negative numbers,: Modern arithmetic was known during medieval times as \\"Modus Indorum\\" or method of the Indians. Leonardo of Pisa wrote that compared to method of the Indians all other methods is a mistake. This method of the Indians is none other than our very simple arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Rules for these four simple procedures was first written down by Brahmagupta during 7th century AD. \\"On this point, the Hindus are already conscious of the interpretation that negative numbers must have in certain cases (a debt in a commercial problem, for instance). In the following centuries, as there is a diffusion into the West (by intermediary of the Arabs) of the methods and results of Greek and Hindu mathematics, one becomes more used to the handling of these numbers, and one begins to have other \\"representation\\" for them which are geometric or dynamic.\\" arithmetic, and algebra. In addition, trigonometry Quote: \\"Geometry, and its branch trigonometry, was the mathematics Indian astronomers used most frequently. Greek mathematicians used the full chord and never imagined the half chord that we use today. Half chord was first used by Aryabhata which made trigonometry much more simple. In fact, the Indian astronomers in the third or fourth century, using a pre-Ptolemaic Greek table of chords, produced tables of sines and versines, from which it was trivial to derive cosines. This new system of trigonometry, produced in India, was transmitted to the Arabs in the late eighth century and by them, in an expanded form, to the Latin West and the Byzantine East in the twelfth century.\\" was further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there.: \\"As for trigonometry, it is disdained by geometers and abandoned to surveyors and astronomers; it is these latter (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, Ptolemy) who establish the fundamental relations between the sides and angles of a right angled triangle (plane or spherical) and draw up the first tables (they consist of tables giving the chord of the arc cut out by an angle \\\\theta < \\\\pi on a circle of radius r, in other words the number 2r\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\theta/2\\\\right); the introduction of the sine, more easily handled, is due to Hindu mathematicians of the Middle Ages).\\" These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the Middle East, China, and Europe\\"algebra\\" 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 16 May 2007. Quote: \\"A full-fledged decimal, positional system certainly existed in India by the 9th century (AD), yet many of its central ideas had been transmitted well before that time to China and the Islamic world. Indian arithmetic, moreover, developed consistent and correct rules for operating with positive and negative numbers and for treating zero like any other number, even in problematic contexts such as division. Several hundred years passed before European mathematicians fully integrated such ideas into the developing discipline of algebra.\\" and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics. Ancient and medieval Indian mathematical works, all composed in Sanskrit, usually consisted of a section of sutras in which a set of rules or problems were stated with great economy in verse in order to aid memorization by a student. This was followed by a second section consisting of a prose commentary (sometimes multiple commentaries by different scholars) that explained the problem in more detail and provided justification for the solution. In the prose section, the form (and therefore its memorization) was not considered so important as the ideas involved. All mathematical works were orally transmitted until approximately 500 BCE; thereafter, they were transmitted both orally and in manuscript form. The oldest extant mathematical document produced on the Indian subcontinent is the birch bark Bakhshali Manuscript, discovered in 1881 in the village of Bakhshali, near Peshawar (modern day Pakistan) and is likely from the 7th century CE. A later landmark in Indian mathematics was the development of the series expansions for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and arc tangent) by mathematicians of the Kerala school in the 15th century CE. Their remarkable work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala. Quote: \\"There is no evidence that the Indian work on series was known beyond India, or even outside Kerala, until the nineteenth century. Gold and Pingree assert [4] that by the time these series were rediscovered in Europe, they had, for all practical purposes, been lost to India. The expansions of the sine, cosine, and arc tangent had been passed down through several generations of disciples, but they remained sterile observations for which no one could find much use.\\" Quote: \\"It is not unusual to encounter in discussions of Indian mathematics such assertions as that ‚Äúthe concept of differentiation was understood [in India] from the time of Manjula (... in the 10th century)‚Äù [Joseph 1991, 300], or that \\"we may consider Madhava to have been the founder of mathematical analysis\\" (Joseph 1991, 293), or that Bhaskara II may claim to be \\"the precursor of Newton and Leibniz in the discovery of the principle of the differential calculus\\" (Bag 1979, 294). ... The points of resemblance, particularly between early European calculus and the Keralese work on power series, have even inspired suggestions of a possible transmission of mathematical ideas from the Malabar coast in or after the 15th century to the Latin scholarly world (e.g., in (Bag 1979, 285)). ... It should be borne in mind, however, that such an emphasis on the similarity of Sanskrit (or Malayalam) and Latin mathematics risks diminishing our ability fully to see and comprehend the former. To speak of the Indian \\"discovery of the principle of the differential calculus\\" somewhat obscures the fact that Indian techniques for expressing changes in the Sine by means of the Cosine or vice versa, as in the examples we have seen, remained within that specific trigonometric context. The differential \\"principle\\" was not generalised to arbitrary functions‚Äîin fact, the explicit notion of an arbitrary function, not to mention that of its derivative or an algorithm for taking the derivative, is irrelevant here\\" Quote:\\"One example I can give you relates to the Indian MƒÅdhava's demonstration, in about 1400 A.D., of the infinite power series of trigonometrical functions using geometrical and algebraic arguments. When this was first described in English by Charles Matthew Whish, in the 1830s, it was heralded as the Indians' discovery of the calculus. This claim and MƒÅdhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read anymore the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that MƒÅdhava derived the series without the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what MƒÅdhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of MƒÅdhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution.\\" Quote:\\"How close did Islamic and Indian scholars come to inventing the calculus? Islamic scholars nearly developed a general formula for finding integrals of polynomials by A.D. 1000‚Äîand evidently could find such a formula for any polynomial in which they were interested. But, it appears, they were not interested in any polynomial of degree higher than four, at least in any of the material that has come down to us. Indian scholars, on the other hand, were by 1600 able to use ibn al-Haytham's sum formula for arbitrary integral powers in calculating power series for the functions in which they were interested. By the same time, they also knew how to calculate the differentials of these functions. So some of the basic ideas of calculus were known in Egypt and India many centuries before Newton. It does not appear, however, that either Islamic or Indian mathematicians saw the necessity of connecting some of the disparate ideas that we include under the name calculus. They were apparently only interested in specific cases in which these ideas were needed. ... There is no danger, therefore, that we will have to rewrite the history texts to remove the statement that Newton and Leibniz invented calculus. They were certainly the ones who were able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between them, and turn the calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have today.\\" Prehistory Excavations at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation have uncovered evidence of the use of \\"practical mathematics\\". The people of the Indus Valley Civilization manufactured bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favourable for the stability of a brick structure. They used a standardised system of weights based on the ratios: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, with the unit weight equaling approximately 28 grams (and approximately equal to the English ounce or Greek uncia). They mass-produced weights in regular geometrical shapes, which included hexahedra, barrels, cones, and cylinders, thereby demonstrating knowledge of basic geometry. The inhabitants of Indus civilisation also tried to standardise measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler‚Äîthe Mohenjo-daro ruler‚Äîwhose unit of length (approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts. Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length. Hollow cylindrical objects made of shell and found at Lothal (2200 BCE) and Dholavira are demonstrated to have the ability to measure angles in a plane, as well as to determine the position of stars for navigation.S.

By the time of the ' (1200‚Äì900 BCE), numbers as high as were being included in the texts. For example, the mantra (sacred recitation) at the end of the annahoma (\\"food- oblation rite\\") performed during the a≈õvamedha, and uttered just before-, during-, and just after sunrise, invokes powers of ten from a hundred to a trillion: The solution to partial fraction was known to the Rigvedic People as states in the purush Sukta (RV 10.90.4): The Satapatha Brahmana (ca. 7th century BCE) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba Sutras.A. Seidenberg, 1978. The origin of mathematics. Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol 18. =≈öulba S≈´tras= The ≈öulba S≈´tras (literally, \\"Aphorisms of the Chords\\" in Vedic Sanskrit) (c. 700‚Äì400 BCE) list rules for the construction of sacrificial fire altars. Most mathematical problems considered in the ≈öulba S≈´tras spring from \\"a single theological requirement,\\" that of constructing fire altars which have different shapes but occupy the same area. The altars were required to be constructed of five layers of burnt brick, with the further condition that each layer consist of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers have congruent arrangements of bricks. According to , the ≈öulba S≈´tras contain \\"the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.\\" > The diagonal rope (') of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank > (pƒÅr≈õvamƒÅni) and the horizontal (') produce separately.\\" Since the statement is a s≈´tra, it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes produce is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student. They contain lists of Pythagorean triples,Pythagorean triples are triples of integers with the property: . Thus, , , , etc. which are particular cases of Diophantine equations.: \\"The arithmetic content of the ≈öulva S≈´tras consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as , , , and . It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain \\"Diophantine\\" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others.\\" They also contain statements (that with hindsight we know to be approximate) about squaring the circle and \\"circling the square.\\": \\"The requirement of three altars of equal areas but different shapes would explain the interest in transformation of areas. Among other transformation of area problems the Hindus considered in particular the problem of squaring the circle. The Bodhayana Sutra states the converse problem of constructing a circle equal to a given square. The following approximate construction is given as the solution.... this result is only approximate. The authors, however, made no distinction between the two results. In terms that we can appreciate, this construction gives a value for of 18 (3 ‚àí 2), which is about 3.088.\\" Baudhayana (c. 8th century BCE) composed the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, the best-known Sulba Sutra, which contains examples of simple Pythagorean triples, such as: , , , , and , as well as a statement of the Pythagorean theorem for the sides of a square: \\"The rope which is stretched across the diagonal of a square produces an area double the size of the original square.\\" It also contains the general statement of the Pythagorean theorem (for the sides of a rectangle): \\"The rope stretched along the length of the diagonal of a rectangle makes an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.\\" Baudhayana gives a expression for the square root of two: ::\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3\\\\cdot4} - \\\\frac{1}{3\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot 34} = 1.4142156 \\\\ldots The expression is accurate up to five decimal places, the true value being 1.41421356...The value of this approximation, 577/408, is the seventh in a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, ... to , the numerators and denominators of which were known as \\"side and diameter numbers\\" to the ancient Greeks, and in modern mathematics are called the Pell numbers. If x/y is one term in this sequence of approximations, the next is (x + 2y)/(x + y). These approximations may also be derived by truncating the continued fraction representation of . This expression is similar in structure to the expression found on a Mesopotamian tabletNeugebauer, O. and A. Sachs. 1945. Mathematical Cuneiform Texts, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press. p. 45. from the Old Babylonian period (1900‚Äì1600 BCE): ::\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{24}{60} + \\\\frac{51}{60^2} + \\\\frac{10}{60^3} = 1.41421297 \\\\ldots which expresses in the sexagesimal system, and which is also accurate up to 5 decimal places. According to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 written ca. 1850 BCEMathematics Department, University of British Columbia, The Babylonian tabled Plimpton 322. \\"contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple,Three positive integers (a, b, c) form a primitive Pythagorean triple if and if the highest common factor of is 1. In the particular Plimpton322 example, this means that and that the three numbers do not have any common factors. However some scholars have disputed the Pythagorean interpretation of this tablet; see Plimpton 322 for details. indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic\\" in Mesopotamia in 1850 BCE. \\"Since these tablets predate the Sulbasutras period by several centuries, taking into account the contextual appearance of some of the triples, it is reasonable to expect that similar understanding would have been there in India.\\" Dani goes on to say: In all, three Sulba Sutras were composed. The remaining two, the Manava Sulba Sutra composed by Manava (fl. 750‚Äì650 BCE) and the Apastamba Sulba Sutra, composed by Apastamba (c. 600 BCE), contained results similar to the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra. ;Vyakarana An important landmark of the Vedic period was the work of Sanskrit grammarian, (c. 520‚Äì460 BCE). His grammar includes early use of Boolean logic, of the null operator, and of context free grammars, and includes a precursor of the Backus‚ÄìNaur form (used in the description programming languages). Pingala (300 BCE ‚Äì 200 BCE) Among the scholars of the post-Vedic period who contributed to mathematics, the most notable is Pingala (') (fl. 300‚Äì200 BCE), a music theorist who authored the Chhandas Shastra (', also Chhandas Sutra '), a Sanskrit treatise on prosody. There is evidence that in his work on the enumeration of syllabic combinations, Pingala stumbled upon both Pascal's triangle and binomial coefficients, although he did not have knowledge of the binomial theorem itself. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called maatraameru). Although the Chandah sutra hasn't survived in its entirety, a 10th-century commentary on it by HalƒÅyudha has. HalƒÅyudha, who refers to the Pascal triangle as Meru-prastƒÅra (literally \\"the staircase to Mount Meru\\"), has this to say: The text also indicates that Pingala was aware of the combinatorial identity: :: {n \\\\choose 0} + {n \\\\choose 1} + {n \\\\choose 2} + \\\\cdots + {n \\\\choose n-1} + {n \\\\choose n} = 2^n ;KƒÅtyƒÅyana KƒÅtyƒÅyana (c. 3rd century BCE) is notable for being the last of the Vedic mathematicians. He wrote the Katyayana Sulba Sutra, which presented much geometry, including the general Pythagorean theorem and a computation of the square root of 2 correct to five decimal places. Jain mathematics (400 BCE ‚Äì 200 CE) Although Jainism is a religion and philosophy predates its most famous exponent, the great Mahaviraswami (6th century BCE), most Jain texts on mathematical topics were composed after the 6th century BCE. Jain mathematicians are important historically as crucial links between the mathematics of the Vedic period and that of the \\"classical period.\\" A significant historical contribution of Jain mathematicians lay in their freeing Indian mathematics from its religious and ritualistic constraints. In particular, their fascination with the enumeration of very large numbers and infinities led them to classify numbers into three classes: enumerable, innumerable and infinite. Not content with a simple notion of infinity, their texts define five different types of infinity: the infinite in one direction, the infinite in two directions, the infinite in area, the infinite everywhere, and the infinite perpetually. In addition, Jain mathematicians devised notations for simple powers (and exponents) of numbers like squares and cubes, which enabled them to define simple algebraic equations (beejganita samikaran). Jain mathematicians were apparently also the first to use the word shunya (literally void in Sanskrit) to refer to zero. More than a millennium later, their appellation became the English word \\"zero\\" after a tortuous journey of translations and transliterations from India to Europe. (See Zero: Etymology.) In addition to Surya Prajnapti, important Jain works on mathematics included the Sthananga Sutra (c. 300 BCE ‚Äì 200 CE); the Anuyogadwara Sutra (c. 200 BCE ‚Äì 100 CE); and the Satkhandagama (c. 2nd century CE). Important Jain mathematicians included Bhadrabahu (d. 298 BCE), the author of two astronomical works, the Bhadrabahavi-Samhita and a commentary on the Surya Prajinapti; Yativrisham Acharya (c. 176 BCE), who authored a mathematical text called Tiloyapannati; and Umasvati (c. 150 BCE), who, although better known for his influential writings on Jain philosophy and metaphysics, composed a mathematical work called Tattwarthadhigama-Sutra Bhashya. Oral tradition Mathematicians of ancient and early medieval India were almost all Sanskrit pandits (' \\"learned man\\"), who were trained in Sanskrit language and literature, and possessed \\"a common stock of knowledge in grammar ('), exegesis (') and logic (nyƒÅya).\\" Memorisation of \\"what is heard\\" (≈õruti in Sanskrit) through recitation played a major role in the transmission of sacred texts in ancient India. Memorisation and recitation was also used to transmit philosophical and literary works, as well as treatises on ritual and grammar. Modern scholars of ancient India have noted the \\"truly remarkable achievements of the Indian pandits who have preserved enormously bulky texts orally for millennia.\\" =Styles of memorisation= Prodigious energy was expended by ancient Indian culture in ensuring that these texts were transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity. For example, memorisation of the sacred Vedas included up to eleven forms of recitation of the same text. The texts were subsequently \\"proof-read\\" by comparing the different recited versions. Forms of recitation included the ' (literally \\"mesh recitation\\") in which every two adjacent words in the text were first recited in their original order, then repeated in the reverse order, and finally repeated in the original order. The recitation thus proceeded as: word1word2, word2word1, word1word2; word2word3, word3word2, word2word3; ... In another form of recitation, ' (literally \\"flag recitation\\") a sequence of N words were recited (and memorised) by pairing the first two and last two words and then proceeding as: word1word2, wordN ‚àí 1wordN; word2word3, wordN ‚àí 3wordN ‚àí 2; ..; wordN ‚àí 1wordN, word1word2; The most complex form of recitation, ' (literally \\"dense recitation\\"), according to , took the form: word1word2, word2word1, word1word2word3, word3word2word1, word1word2word3; word2word3, word3word2, word2word3word4, word4word3word2, word2word3word4; ... That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the ' (ca. 1500 BCE), as a single text, without any variant readings. Similar methods were used for memorising mathematical texts, whose transmission remained exclusively oral until the end of the Vedic period (ca. 500 BCE). =The Sutra genre= Mathematical activity in ancient India began as a part of a \\"methodological reflexion\\" on the sacred Vedas, which took the form of works called ', or, \\"Ancillaries of the Veda\\" (7th‚Äì4th century BCE). The need to conserve the sound of sacred text by use of ' (phonetics) and chhandas (metrics); to conserve its meaning by use of ' (grammar) and nirukta (etymology); and to correctly perform the rites at the correct time by the use of kalpa (ritual) and ' (astrology), gave rise to the six disciplines of the '. Mathematics arose as a part of the last two disciplines, ritual and astronomy (which also included astrology). Since the ' immediately preceded the use of writing in ancient India, they formed the last of the exclusively oral literature. They were expressed in a highly compressed mnemonic form, the s≈´tra (literally, \\"thread\\"): Extreme brevity was achieved through multiple means, which included using ellipsis \\"beyond the tolerance of natural language,\\" using technical names instead of longer descriptive names, abridging lists by only mentioning the first and last entries, and using markers and variables. The s≈´tras create the impression that communication through the text was \\"only a part of the whole instruction. The rest of the instruction must have been transmitted by the so-called Guru-shishya parampara, 'uninterrupted succession from teacher (guru) to the student (≈õisya),' and it was not open to the general public\\" and perhaps even kept secret. The brevity achieved in a s≈´tra is demonstrated in the following example from the BaudhƒÅyana ≈öulba S≈´tra (700 BCE). The design of the domestic fire altar in the ≈öulba S≈´tra The domestic fire-altar in the Vedic period was required by ritual to have a square base and be constituted of five layers of bricks with 21 bricks in each layer. One method of constructing the altar was to divide one side of the square into three equal parts using a cord or rope, to next divide the transverse (or perpendicular) side into seven equal parts, and thereby sub-divide the square into 21 congruent rectangles. The bricks were then designed to be of the shape of the constituent rectangle and the layer was created. To form the next layer, the same formula was used, but the bricks were arranged transversely. The process was then repeated three more times (with alternating directions) in order to complete the construction. In the BaudhƒÅyana ≈öulba S≈´tra, this procedure is described in the following words: According to , the officiant constructing the altar has only a few tools and materials at his disposal: a cord (Sanskrit, rajju, f.), two pegs (Sanskrit, ≈õanku, m.), and clay to make the bricks (Sanskrit, ', f.). Concision is achieved in the s≈´tra, by not explicitly mentioning what the adjective \\"transverse\\" qualifies; however, from the feminine form of the (Sanskrit) adjective used, it is easily inferred to qualify \\"cord.\\" Similarly, in the second stanza, \\"bricks\\" are not explicitly mentioned, but inferred again by the feminine plural form of \\"North-pointing.\\" Finally, the first stanza, never explicitly says that the first layer of bricks are oriented in the East-West direction, but that too is implied by the explicit mention of \\"North-pointing\\" in the second stanza; for, if the orientation was meant to be the same in the two layers, it would either not be mentioned at all or be only mentioned in the first stanza. All these inferences are made by the officiant as he recalls the formula from his memory. The written tradition: prose commentary With the increasing complexity of mathematics and other exact sciences, both writing and computation were required. Consequently, many mathematical works began to be written down in manuscripts that were then copied and re-copied from generation to generation. The earliest mathematical prose commentary was that on the work, ' (written 499 CE), a work on astronomy and mathematics. The mathematical portion of the ' was composed of 33 s≈´tras (in verse form) consisting of mathematical statements or rules, but without any proofs. However, according to , \\"this does not necessarily mean that their authors did not prove them. It was probably a matter of style of exposition.\\" From the time of Bhaskara I (600 CE onwards), prose commentaries increasingly began to include some derivations (upapatti). Bhaskara I's commentary on the ', had the following structure: *Rule ('s≈´tra') in verse by *Commentary by BhƒÅskara I, consisting of: Elucidation of rule (derivations were still rare then, but became more common later) Example (udde≈õaka) usually in verse. Setting (nyƒÅsa/sthƒÅpanƒÅ) of the numerical data. Working (karana) of the solution. Verification (', literally \\"to make conviction\\") of the answer. These became rare by the 13th century, derivations or proofs being favoured by then. Typically, for any mathematical topic, students in ancient India first memorised the s≈´tras, which, as explained earlier, were \\"deliberately inadequate\\" in explanatory details (in order to pithily convey the bare-bone mathematical rules). The students then worked through the topics of the prose commentary by writing (and drawing diagrams) on chalk- and dust-boards (i.e. boards covered with dust). The latter activity, a staple of mathematical work, was to later prompt mathematician-astronomer, Brahmagupta (fl. 7th century CE), to characterise astronomical computations as \\"dust work\\" (Sanskrit: dhulikarman). Numerals and the decimal number system It is well known that the decimal place-value system in use today was first recorded in India, then transmitted to the Islamic world, and eventually to Europe. The Syrian bishop Severus Sebokht wrote in the mid-7th century CE about the \\"nine signs\\" of the Indians for expressing numbers. However, how, when, and where the first decimal place value system was invented is not so clear., The earliest extant script used in India was the script used in the Gandhara culture of the north- west. It is thought to be of Aramaic origin and it was in use from the 4th century BCE to the 4th century CE. Almost contemporaneously, another script, the BrƒÅhmƒ´ script, appeared on much of the sub-continent, and would later become the foundation of many scripts of South Asia and South-east Asia. Both scripts had numeral symbols and numeral systems, which were initially not based on a place-value system. The earliest surviving evidence of decimal place value numerals in India and southeast Asia is from the middle of the first millennium CE. A copper plate from Gujarat, India mentions the date 595 CE, written in a decimal place value notation, although there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the plate. Decimal numerals recording the years 683 CE have also been found in stone inscriptions in Indonesia and Cambodia, where Indian cultural influence was substantial. There are older textual sources, although the extant manuscript copies of these texts are from much later dates. Probably the earliest such source is the work of the Buddhist philosopher Vasumitra dated likely to the 1st century CE. Discussing the counting pits of merchants, Vasumitra remarks, \\"When [the same] clay counting- piece is in the place of units, it is denoted as one, when in hundreds, one hundred.\\" Although such references seem to imply that his readers had knowledge of a decimal place value representation, the \\"brevity of their allusions and the ambiguity of their dates, however, do not solidly establish the chronology of the development of this concept.\\" A third decimal representation was employed in a verse composition technique, later labelled Bhuta-sankhya (literally, \\"object numbers\\") used by early Sanskrit authors of technical books. Since many early technical works were composed in verse, numbers were often represented by objects in the natural or religious world that correspondence to them; this allowed a many-to-one correspondence for each number and made verse composition easier. According to , the number 4, for example, could be represented by the word \\"Veda\\" (since there were four of these religious texts), the number 32 by the word \\"teeth\\" (since a full set consists of 32), and the number 1 by \\"moon\\" (since there is only one moon). So, Veda/teeth/moon would correspond to the decimal numeral 1324, as the convention for numbers was to enumerate their digits from right to left. The earliest reference employing object numbers is a ca. 269 CE Sanskrit text, YavanajƒÅtaka (literally \\"Greek horoscopy\\") of Sphujidhvaja, a versification of an earlier (ca. 150 CE) Indian prose adaptation of a lost work of Hellenistic astrology. Such use seems to make the case that by the mid-3rd century CE, the decimal place value system was familiar, at least to readers of astronomical and astrological texts in India. It has been hypothesized that the Indian decimal place value system was based on the symbols used on Chinese counting boards from as early as the middle of the first millennium BCE. According to , > These counting boards, like the Indian counting pits, ..., had a decimal > place value structure ... Indians may well have learned of these decimal > place value \\"rod numerals\\" from Chinese Buddhist pilgrims or other > travelers, or they may have developed the concept independently from their > earlier non-place-value system; no documentary evidence survives to confirm > either conclusion.\\" Bakhshali Manuscript The oldest extant mathematical manuscript in India is the Bakhshali Manuscript, a birch bark manuscript written in \\"Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit\\" in the ≈öƒÅradƒÅ script, which was used in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent between the 8th and 12th centuries CE. The manuscript was discovered in 1881 by a farmer while digging in a stone enclosure in the village of Bakhshali, near Peshawar (then in British India and now in Pakistan). Of unknown authorship and now preserved in the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, the manuscript has been variously dated‚Äîsometimes as early as the \\"early centuries of the Christian era.\\" The 7th century CE is now considered a plausible date. Quote:\\"The dates so far proposed for the Bakhshali work vary from the third to the twelfth centuries CE, but a recently made comparative study has shown many similarities, particularly in the style of exposition and terminology, between Bakhshalƒ´ work and BhƒÅskara I's commentary on the ƒÄryabhatƒ´ya. This seems to indicate that both works belong to nearly the same period, although this does not deny the possibility that some of the rules and examples in the BakhshƒÅlƒ´ work date from anterior periods.\\" The surviving manuscript has seventy leaves, some of which are in fragments. Its mathematical content consists of rules and examples, written in verse, together with prose commentaries, which include solutions to the examples. The topics treated include arithmetic (fractions, square roots, profit and loss, simple interest, the rule of three, and regula falsi) and algebra (simultaneous linear equations and quadratic equations), and arithmetic progressions. In addition, there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also \\"employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero.\\" Many of its problems are of a category known as 'equalisation problems' that lead to systems of linear equations. One example from Fragment III-5-3v is the following: The prose commentary accompanying the example solves the problem by converting it to three (under-determined) equations in four unknowns and assuming that the prices are all integers. In 2017, three samples from the manuscript were shown by radiocarbon dating to come from three different centuries: from 224-383 AD, 680-779 AD, and 885-993 AD. It is not known how fragments from different centuries came to be packaged together. Classical period (400‚Äì1600) This period is often known as the golden age of Indian Mathematics. This period saw mathematicians such as Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara I, Mahavira, Bhaskara II, Madhava of Sangamagrama and Nilakantha Somayaji give broader and clearer shape to many branches of mathematics. Their contributions would spread to Asia, the Middle East, and eventually to Europe. Unlike Vedic mathematics, their works included both astronomical and mathematical contributions. In fact, mathematics of that period was included in the 'astral science' (jyoti·∏•≈õƒÅstra) and consisted of three sub-disciplines: mathematical sciences (ga·πáita or tantra), horoscope astrology (horƒÅ or jƒÅtaka) and divination (sa·πÉhitƒÅ). This tripartite division is seen in VarƒÅhamihira's 6th century compilation‚ÄîPancasiddhantika (literally panca, \\"five,\\" siddhƒÅnta, \\"conclusion of deliberation\\", dated 575 CE)‚Äîof five earlier works, Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitamaha Siddhanta, which were adaptations of still earlier works of Mesopotamian, Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy. As explained earlier, the main texts were composed in Sanskrit verse, and were followed by prose commentaries. =Fifth and sixth centuries= ;Surya Siddhanta Though its authorship is unknown, the Surya Siddhanta (c. 400) contains the roots of modern trigonometry. Because it contains many words of foreign origin, some authors consider that it was written under the influence of Mesopotamia and Greece. This ancient text uses the following as trigonometric functions for the first time: *Sine (Jya). *Cosine (Kojya). *Inverse sine (Otkram jya). It also contains the earliest uses of: *Tangent. *Secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East. ;Chhedi calendar This Chhedi calendar (594) contains an early use of the modern place-value Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally. ;Aryabhata I Aryabhata (476‚Äì550) wrote the Aryabhatiya. He described the important fundamental principles of mathematics in 332 shlokas. The treatise contained: *Quadratic equations *Trigonometry *The value of œÄ, correct to 4 decimal places. Aryabhata also wrote the Arya Siddhanta, which is now lost. Aryabhata's contributions include: Trigonometry: (See also : Aryabhata's sine table) *Introduced the trigonometric functions. *Defined the sine (jya) as the modern relationship between half an angle and half a chord. *Defined the cosine (kojya). *Defined the versine (utkrama-jya). *Defined the inverse sine (otkram jya). *Gave methods of calculating their approximate numerical values. *Contains the earliest tables of sine, cosine and versine values, in 3.75¬∞ intervals from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞, to 4 decimal places of accuracy. *Contains the trigonometric formula sin(n + 1)x ‚àí sin nx = sin nx ‚àí sin(n ‚àí 1)x ‚àí (1/225)sin nx. *Spherical trigonometry. Arithmetic: *Continued fractions. Algebra: *Solutions of simultaneous quadratic equations. *Whole number solutions of linear equations by a method equivalent to the modern method. *General solution of the indeterminate linear equation . Mathematical astronomy: *Accurate calculations for astronomical constants, such as the: Solar eclipse. Lunar eclipse. The formula for the sum of the cubes, which was an important step in the development of integral calculus. ;Varahamihira Varahamihira (505‚Äì587) produced the Pancha Siddhanta (The Five Astronomical Canons). He made important contributions to trigonometry, including sine and cosine tables to 4 decimal places of accuracy and the following formulas relating sine and cosine functions: *\\\\sin^2(x) + \\\\cos^2(x) = 1 *\\\\sin(x)=\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}-x\\\\right) *\\\\frac{1-\\\\cos(2x)}{2}=\\\\sin^2(x) =Seventh and eighth centuries= Brahmagupta's theorem states that AF = FD. In the 7th century, two separate fields, arithmetic (which included measurement) and algebra, began to emerge in Indian mathematics. The two fields would later be called ' (literally \\"mathematics of algorithms\\") and ' (lit. \\"mathematics of seeds,\\" with \\"seeds\\"‚Äîlike the seeds of plants‚Äîrepresenting unknowns with the potential to generate, in this case, the solutions of equations). Brahmagupta, in his astronomical work ' (628 CE), included two chapters (12 and 18) devoted to these fields. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was divided into two sections: \\"basic operations\\" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and \\"practical mathematics\\" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral: Brahmagupta's theorem: If a cyclic quadrilateral has diagonals that are perpendicular to each other, then the perpendicular line drawn from the point of intersection of the diagonals to any side of the quadrilateral always bisects the opposite side. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalisation of Heron's formula), as well as a complete description of rational triangles (i.e. triangles with rational sides and rational areas). Brahmagupta's formula: The area, A, of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides of lengths a, b, c, d, respectively, is given by : A = \\\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} \\\\, where s, the semiperimeter, given by s=\\\\frac{a+b+c+d}{2}. Brahmagupta's Theorem on rational triangles: A triangle with rational sides a, b, c and rational area is of the form: :a = \\\\frac{u^2}{v}+v, \\\\ \\\\ b=\\\\frac{u^2}{w}+w, \\\\ \\\\ c=\\\\frac{u^2}{v}+\\\\frac{u^2}{w} - (v+w) for some rational numbers u, v, and w . Chapter 18 contained 103 Sanskrit verses which began with rules for arithmetical operations involving zero and negative numbers and is considered the first systematic treatment of the subject. The rules (which included a + 0 = \\\\ a and a \\\\times 0 = 0 ) were all correct, with one exception: \\\\frac{0}{0} = 0 . Later in the chapter, he gave the first explicit (although still not completely general) solution of the quadratic equation: :\\\\ ax^2+bx=c This is equivalent to: :x = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{4ac+b^2}-b}{2a} Also in chapter 18, Brahmagupta was able to make progress in finding (integral) solutions of Pell's equation, :\\\\ x^2-Ny^2=1, where N is a nonsquare integer. He did this by discovering the following identity: Brahmagupta's Identity: \\\\ (x^2-Ny^2)(x'^2-Ny'^2) = (xx'+Nyy')^2 - N(xy'+x'y)^2 which was a generalisation of an earlier identity of Diophantus: Brahmagupta used his identity to prove the following lemma: Lemma (Brahmagupta): If x=x_1,\\\\ \\\\ y=y_1 \\\\ \\\\ is a solution of \\\\ \\\\ x^2 - Ny^2 = k_1, and, x=x_2, \\\\ \\\\ y=y_2 \\\\ \\\\ is a solution of \\\\ \\\\ x^2 - Ny^2 = k_2, , then: : x=x_1x_2+Ny_1y_2,\\\\ \\\\ y=x_1y_2+x_2y_1 \\\\ \\\\ is a solution of \\\\ x^2-Ny^2=k_1k_2 He then used this lemma to both generate infinitely many (integral) solutions of Pell's equation, given one solution, and state the following theorem: Theorem (Brahmagupta): If the equation \\\\ x^2 - Ny^2 =k has an integer solution for any one of \\\\ k=\\\\pm 4, \\\\pm 2, -1 then Pell's equation: : \\\\ x^2 -Ny^2 = 1 also has an integer solution. Brahmagupta did not actually prove the theorem, but rather worked out examples using his method. The first example he presented was: Example (Brahmagupta): Find integers \\\\ x,\\\\ y\\\\ such that: :\\\\ x^2 - 92y^2=1 In his commentary, Brahmagupta added, \\"a person solving this problem within a year is a mathematician.\\" The solution he provided was: :\\\\ x=1151, \\\\ y=120 ;Bhaskara I Bhaskara I (c. 600‚Äì680) expanded the work of Aryabhata in his books titled Mahabhaskariya, Aryabhatiya-bhashya and Laghu-bhaskariya. He produced: *Solutions of indeterminate equations. *A rational approximation of the sine function. *A formula for calculating the sine of an acute angle without the use of a table, correct to two decimal places. =Ninth to twelfth centuries= ;Virasena Virasena (8th century) was a Jain mathematician in the court of Rashtrakuta King Amoghavarsha of Manyakheta, Karnataka. He wrote the Dhavala, a commentary on Jain mathematics, which: *Deals with the concept of ardhaccheda, the number of times a number could be halved, and lists various rules involving this operation. This coincides with the binary logarithm when applied to powers of two, but differs on other numbers, more closely resembling the 2-adic order. *The same concept for base 3 (trakacheda) and base 4 (caturthacheda). Virasena also gave: *The derivation of the volume of a frustum by a sort of infinite procedure. It is thought that much of the mathematical material in the Dhavala can attributed to previous writers, especially Kundakunda, Shamakunda, Tumbulura, Samantabhadra and Bappadeva and date who wrote between 200 and 600 CE. ;Mahavira Mahavira Acharya (c. 800‚Äì870) from Karnataka, the last of the notable Jain mathematicians, lived in the 9th century and was patronised by the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. He wrote a book titled Ganit Saar Sangraha on numerical mathematics, and also wrote treatises about a wide range of mathematical topics. These include the mathematics of: *Zero *Squares *Cubes *square roots, cube roots, and the series extending beyond these * Plane geometry *Solid geometry *Problems relating to the casting of shadows *Formulae derived to calculate the area of an ellipse and quadrilateral inside a circle.

It flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559‚Äì1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school astronomers independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. The most important results, series expansion for trigonometric functions, were given in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta called Tantrasangraha and a commentary on this work called Tantrasangraha-vakhya of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ (c.1500‚Äìc.1610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on Tantrasangraha. Their discovery of these three important series expansions of calculus‚Äîseveral centuries before calculus was developed in Europe by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz‚Äîwas an achievement. However, the Kerala School did not invent calculus, because, while they were able to develop Taylor series expansions for the important trigonometric functions, differentiation, term by term integration, convergence tests, iterative methods for solutions of non- linear equations, and the theory that the area under a curve is its integral, they developed neither a theory of differentiation or integration, nor the fundamental theorem of calculus. The results obtained by the Kerala school include: *The (infinite) geometric series: \\\\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4+ \\\\cdots\\\\text{ for }x<1 This formula was already known, for example, in the work of the 10th-century Arab mathematician Alhazen (the Latinised form of the name Ibn Al-Haytham (965‚Äì1039)).Edwards, C. H., Jr. 1979. The Historical Development of the Calculus. New York: Springer-Verlag. *A semi- rigorous proof (see \\"induction\\" remark below) of the result: 1^p+ 2^p + \\\\cdots + n^p \\\\approx \\\\frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1} for large n. This result was also known to Alhazen. *Intuitive use of mathematical induction, however, the inductive hypothesis was not formulated or employed in proofs. *Applications of ideas from (what was to become) differential and integral calculus to obtain (Taylor‚ÄìMaclaurin) infinite series for sin x, cos x, and arctan x. The Tantrasangraha-vakhya gives the series in verse, which when translated to mathematical notation, can be written as: :: r\\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{1}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{ry}{x} -\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{ry^3}{x^3} + \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{ry^5}{x^5} - \\\\cdots ,\\\\text{ where }y/x \\\\leq 1. :: \\\\sin x = x - x \\\\frac{x^2}{(2^2+2)r^2} + x \\\\frac{x^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x^2}{(4^2+4)r^2} - \\\\cdots :: r - \\\\cos x = r \\\\frac{x^2}{(2^2-2)r^2} - r \\\\frac{x^2}{(2^2-2)r^2} \\\\frac{x^2}{(4^2-4)r^2} + \\\\cdots, : where, for r = 1, the series reduces to the standard power series for these trigonometric functions, for example: ::\\\\sin x = x - \\\\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\\\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\\\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\\\cdots : and ::\\\\cos x = 1 - \\\\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\\\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\\\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\\\cdots *Use of rectification (computation of length) of the arc of a circle to give a proof of these results. (The later method of Leibniz, using quadrature, i.e. computation of area under the arc of the circle, was not used.) *Use of the series expansion of \\\\arctan x to obtain the Leibniz formula for œÄ: :: \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{7} + \\\\cdots *A rational approximation of error for the finite sum of their series of interest. For example, the error, f_i(n+1), (for n odd, and i = 1, 2, 3) for the series: :: \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\approx 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3}+ \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\cdots + (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\\\\frac{1}{n} + (-1)^{(n+1)/2}f_i(n+1) :: \\\\text{where }f_1(n) = \\\\frac{1}{2n}, \\\\ f_2(n) = \\\\frac{n/2}{n^2+1}, \\\\ f_3(n) = \\\\frac{(n/2)^2+1}{(n^2+5)n/2}. *Manipulation of error term to derive a faster converging series for \\\\pi: :: \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = \\\\frac{3}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{3^3-3} - \\\\frac{1}{5^3-5} + \\\\frac{1}{7^3-7} - \\\\cdots *Using the improved series to derive a rational expression, 104348/33215 for œÄ correct up to nine decimal places, i.e. 3.141592653. *Use of an intuitive notion of limit to compute these results. *A semi-rigorous (see remark on limits above) method of differentiation of some trigonometric functions. However, they did not formulate the notion of a function, or have knowledge of the exponential or logarithmic functions. The works of the Kerala school were first written up for the Western world by Englishman C.M. Whish in 1835. According to Whish, the Kerala mathematicians had \\"laid the foundation for a complete system of fluxions\\" and these works abounded \\"with fluxional forms and series to be found in no work of foreign countries.\\" However, Whish's results were almost completely neglected, until over a century later, when the discoveries of the Kerala school were investigated again by C. Rajagopal and his associates. Their work includes commentaries on the proofs of the arctan series in YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ given in two papers, a commentary on the YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ's proof of the sine and cosine series and two papers that provide the Sanskrit verses of the Tantrasangrahavakhya for the series for arctan, sin, and cosine (with English translation and commentary). The Kerala mathematicians included Narayana Pandit (c. 1340‚Äì1400), who composed two works, an arithmetical treatise, Ganita Kaumudi, and an algebraic treatise, Bijganita Vatamsa. Narayana is also thought to be the author of an elaborate commentary of Bhaskara II's Lilavati, titled Karmapradipika (or Karma-Paddhati). Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340‚Äì1425) was the founder of the Kerala School. Although it is possible that he wrote Karana Paddhati a work written sometime between 1375 and 1475, all we really know of his work comes from works of later scholars. Parameshvara (c. 1370‚Äì1460) wrote commentaries on the works of Bhaskara I, Aryabhata and Bhaskara II. His Lilavati Bhasya, a commentary on Bhaskara II's Lilavati, contains one of his important discoveries: a version of the mean value theorem. Nilakantha Somayaji (1444‚Äì1544) composed the Tantra Samgraha (which 'spawned' a later anonymous commentary Tantrasangraha-vyakhya and a further commentary by the name Yuktidipaika, written in 1501). He elaborated and extended the contributions of Madhava. Citrabhanu (c. 1530) was a 16th-century mathematician from Kerala who gave integer solutions to 21 types of systems of two simultaneous algebraic equations in two unknowns. These types are all the possible pairs of equations of the following seven forms: : \\\\begin{align} & x + y = a,\\\\ x - y = b,\\\\ xy = c, x^2 + y^2 = d, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & x^2 - y^2 = e,\\\\ x^3 + y^3 = f,\\\\ x^3 - y^3 = g \\\\end{align} For each case, Citrabhanu gave an explanation and justification of his rule as well as an example. Some of his explanations are algebraic, while others are geometric. Jyesthadeva (c. 1500‚Äì1575) was another member of the Kerala School. His key work was the Yukti-bhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ (written in Malayalam, a regional language of Kerala). Jyesthadeva presented proofs of most mathematical theorems and infinite series earlier discovered by Madhava and other Kerala School mathematicians. Charges of Eurocentrism It has been suggested that Indian contributions to mathematics have not been given due acknowledgement in modern history and that many discoveries and inventions by Indian mathematicians are presently culturally attributed to their Western counterparts, as a result of Eurocentrism. According to G. G. Joseph's take on \\"Ethnomathematics\\": > [Their work] takes on board some of the objections raised about the > classical Eurocentric trajectory. The awareness [of Indian and Arabic > mathematics] is all too likely to be tempered with dismissive rejections of > their importance compared to Greek mathematics. The contributions from other > civilisations ‚Äì most notably China and India, are perceived either as > borrowers from Greek sources or having made only minor contributions to > mainstream mathematical development. An openness to more recent research > findings, especially in the case of Indian and Chinese mathematics, is sadly > missing\\"Joseph, G. G. 1997. \\"Foundations of Eurocentrism in Mathematics.\\" In > Ethnomathematics: Challenging Eurocentrism in Mathematics Education (Eds. > Powell, A. B. et al.). SUNY Press. . p.67-68. The historian of mathematics, Florian Cajori, suggested that he and others \\"suspect that Diophantus got his first glimpse of algebraic knowledge from India.\\" However, he also wrote that \\"it is certain that portions of Hindu mathematics are of Greek origin\\".Florian Cajori (2010). \\"A History of Elementary Mathematics ‚Äì With Hints on Methods of Teaching\\". p.94. More recently, as discussed in the above section, the infinite series of calculus for trigonometric functions (rediscovered by Gregory, Taylor, and Maclaurin in the late 17th century) were described (with proofs and formulas for truncation error) in India, by mathematicians of the Kerala school, remarkably some two centuries earlier. Some scholars have recently suggested that knowledge of these results might have been transmitted to Europe through the trade route from Kerala by traders and Jesuit missionaries. Kerala was in continuous contact with China and Arabia, and, from around 1500, with Europe. The existence of communication routes and a suitable chronology certainly make such a transmission a possibility. However, there is no direct evidence by way of relevant manuscripts that such a transmission actually took place. According to David Bressoud, \\"there is no evidence that the Indian work of series was known beyond India, or even outside of Kerala, until the nineteenth century.\\" Both Arab and Indian scholars made discoveries before the 17th century that are now considered a part of calculus. However, they did not, as Newton and Leibniz did, \\"combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have today.\\" The intellectual careers of both Newton and Leibniz are well-documented and there is no indication of their work not being their own; however, it is not known with certainty whether the immediate predecessors of Newton and Leibniz, \\"including, in particular, Fermat and Roberval, learned of some of the ideas of the Islamic and Indian mathematicians through sources we are not now aware.\\" This is an active area of current research, especially in the manuscript collections of Spain and Maghreb. This research is being pursued, among other places, at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Paris.

The school is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It consists of an early childhood center (nursery- kindergarten), a lower school (1st-4th grade), a middle school (5th-8th grade), and an upper school (9th-12th grade). The Ramaz Upper School is a college preparatory program, designed to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the intellectual disciplines that are part of western civilization. The Judaic studies curriculum provides an equally rigorous program through which the religious and cultural tradition of Judaism is both taught and experienced. It is located on East 78th Street, seven city blocks (0.5 km) away from the other two school buildings, located on East 85th Street. Approximately fifty percent of the Upper School student body advances from the Middle School, as well as daily commuters from the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, and Nassau counties in New York; Stamford and New Haven in Connecticut; from all over metropolitan New Jersey; and on a weekly or longer basis from more distant communities. Ramaz was founded in 1937 and is affiliated with Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (\\"KJ\\"), a synagogue located on East 85th Street, which shares a building with the lower school and is across the street from the middle school. The congregation and its rabbi, Joseph Lookstein, helped to found and finance the school. Architect James Rossant designed the modernist Upper School building, completed in 1981.Goldberger, Paul. \\"Architecture: A Bridge known as Ramaz School\\", The New York Times, June 4, 1981.

Etra, Ramaz takes its name from the initials of Rabbi Moses Zevulun Margolies, the grandfather-in-law of Lookstein. The former principal, Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, is the son of Joseph Lookstein and was a member of the first class of six students. Classes were held in many locations over the years, including the vestry rooms of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun. After the closing of Finch College, Ramaz bought the college's campus and renovated the buildings.Goldberger, Paul. \\"A Bridge Known as Ramaz School.\\", The New York Times, June 4, 1981.

Villarin contacted the father who admitted to injuring his son. The Ramaz administration told Villarin not to report the incident to the police. Villarin did report this and was fired in 2008 because the school thought that she was \\"not a team player.\\" Villarin sued the school in Manhattan Supreme Court in 2009, arguing that the state's Social Services Law obligated her to report the potential abuse. Under the law, school faculty are required to report to state authorities a suspicion that a child is being abused or mistreated.Marcy Oster, Ex-Ramaz school nurse can sue under whistleblower law April 15, 2012.

On November 30, 2007, The Wall Street Journal listed Ramaz as one of the top schools for graduates entering the top eight universities in the country, with 10 out of a class of 100 (class of 2007) going to these schools.

The Ramaz School had proposed a 28-story project to be built in place of the Lower School during 2008‚Äì2010. The building would have replaced the current school with a new building split into ten floors used by the school and topped by 18 floors of condominiums. Air rights of the adjoining synagogue would be transferred for use by the adjoining school/condo structure. The project may have had to be scaled back following a review by the City's Board of Standards & Appeals because the height is more than what is permitted at this site.Beyer, Gregory. \\"Condos Above Classrooms Strike Some as an Odd Mix\\", The New York Times, November 11, 2007.

Co-curricular activities and athletics The Ramaz School's team name is the Ramaz Rams, and their logo is a Ram's head. Ramaz fields a number of competitive and recreational athletic teams throughout the school year. In the Upper School, there are varsity teams for both boys and girls in basketball, tennis, volleyball, and hockey, these teams compete in both the Yeshiva High School Athletic League and local independent school leagues. Ramaz also fields soccer, baseball, swim, table tennis, and track teams. Ramaz's academic teams include their Mock Trial team, which competes in the New York State Bar Association's statewide competition and won the New York State competition in 2002 and the New York City competition four times. Ramaz's Model Congress team participates in the University of Pennsylvania Model Congress tournament, and their Model UN team competes in the annual Yeshiva University National Model United Nations event. Additionally, Ramaz's College Bowl team participates in independent tournaments, their Math Team competes in the New York Math League and the Mandelbrot Competition, the Chess Club competes in the Yeshiva Chess League, the Science Olympiad team competes against 15 other New York and New Jersey schools in a competition administered by the Board of Jewish Education, and their Hidon HaTanakh and Torah Bowl teams compete against local Jewish Day Schools. Ramaz Upper School students have also succeeded in numerous academic competitions in both the arts and sciences, including the 2004‚Äì2005 Siemens Westinghouse Competition, the 2007 NCTE Achievement Awards in Writing, the Intel Science Competition, and the American Mathematics Competition. Ramaz's creative writing magazine, Parallax, has also consistently been awarded the gold medal from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. The Ramaz Upper School also has special interest clubs, including an Arabic Club, Coalition for the Homeless, an Israel Advocacy Club, and fine and performing arts clubs.

He was first elected at the 2005 general election, winning the seat from Labour and was re-elected with an increased majority at the 2010 general election, and with a reduced majority at the 2015 general election. Before his parliamentary career, he served as a councillor for Headingley. He served as a Liberal Democrat spokesman for Health, Schools and International Development. At the 2017 general election he lost his seat to Alex Sobel of the Labour Party.  Early life  Born in Manchester, Mulholland attended St. Ambrose College near Altrincham and studied politics at the University of York, going on to achieve an MA in Public Administration and Public Policy. While at York University he played at centre for the university rugby league team in matches against Bradford, Leeds, Manchester and Hull. He then worked in marketing for five years, including two years spent in Edinburgh, working on several national promotional campaigns. His first experience in politics was canvassing in the Knowsley North by-election in 1986, while studying politics for A-level. He had a long-standing interest and involvement in international development, trade justice and debt campaigns. He was an active member of the campaigning groups Trade Injustice and Debt Action Leeds (TIDAL) and Catholic Aid For Overseas Development (CAFOD).  Councillor  In 2003, he was elected as a Leeds City Councillor for Headingley ward. From 2004 to 2005 he was the lead member for corporate services, until his election to Parliament in 2005. He was also the Liberal Democrat group's spokesperson on the Leeds Supertram, approval for which was turned down in 2006.  Member of Parliament  = Constituency and party = Greg Mulholland's constituency surgery at the Holt Park District Centre in North Leeds. Mulholland was elected to Parliament at the 2005 general election for the constituency of Leeds North West. This West Yorkshire constituency extends from inner-city Leeds through suburban and rural areas to the towns of Otley and Yeadon. The seat had been held by the Conservative party from 1950 to 1997 and by the Labour party from 1997 to 2005. In the general election of 2010 the seat was retained by the Liberal Democrats with an increased majority. In the 2015 general election the seat was again retained by the Liberal Democrats, leaving Mulholland as one of eight Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament. In the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election Mulholland backed Chris Huhne, who eventually finished second behind Menzies Campbell. In the 2007 Liberal Democrat leadership election he supported Nick Clegg. In the 2015 Liberal Democrat leadership election Mulholland backed Tim Farron In the 2017 general election Mulholland lost his seat to Labour's Alex Sobel, who gained a majority of 4,224. = Positions held = After his election to Parliament, he was appointed his party's junior International Development spokesperson from 2005 to 2006. In 2006 he was appointed Shadow Spokesperson on Schools, and in 2007 he became Shadow Spokesperson on Health. He was also a member of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee. Mulholland is a member of 27 all-party parliamentary groups including 4 as chair or co-chair and 7 as vice chair. = Expenses = During and after the 2009 expenses scandal, Greg Mulholland's expense claims were generally without controversy and he was described as an angel by the Telegraph after he called for stricter regulations. He did, however, have two claims rejected: for a cot and playpen, then later to have photographs reframed.  Subjects of interest  = Land banking = In November 2005, Mulholland proposed the Sale of Green Belt Land Bill to prevent 'land banking' (property speculation in Green Belt land). However, the bill did not receive a second reading and was dropped without becoming law. = Abortion = As a Roman Catholic, Mulholland describes himself as holding 'pro-life' views and has a strong voting record against abortion, embryology and euthanasia. Mulholland is one of three Liberal Democrat MPs to have supported MP Nadine Dorries's attempts to reduce the number of weeks at which a woman can legally have an abortion. = Voting record = According to ThePublicWhip.org, as of February 2013, Greg Mulholland has supported the Coalition Government 91.6% of the time in the 2010 Parliament. = Healthcare = Mulholland speaking on dementia during a Health Hotel session at the 2009 Liberal Democrat Party Conference. Mulholland took part in a community campaign in his constituency against further cuts at the Wharfedale Hospital in Otley. He called a public meeting at which he presented a 5,000-signature petition to Parliament after one ward was closed. He has also campaigned alongside other Leeds MPs for a new children's hospital in the city, questioning the then Prime Minister Tony Blair over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions. He faced criticism for aspects of this campaign. An article in a Liberal Democrat Focus leaflet featuring Mulholland and distributed in Leeds claimed that the government had axed plans to build a new ¬£204 million Children's Hospital at St. James's, which had been backed by all the city's MPs. The Government claimed that this was untrue and that the decision had been made by the Leeds Hospital Trust without the Government's prior knowledge. Caroline Flint, Minister of State for Public Health, described the statement as: \\"taking political grandstanding too far. The article is not true, it is a complete misrepresentation.\\" = Save the Pub = Greg Mulholland is an active campaigner for Save the Pub, an all party parliamentary group which aims to preserve and protect the Great British pub. In 2012, the group celebrated three years of success with the introduction of a special \\"Save the Pub Ale\\". = Rugby league = Mulholland set up a rugby league team called \\"Political Animals\\", based at Westminster, to bring greater prominence and attention to rugby league within Parliament. He plays left wing for the team. He is also a Vice President of the Leeds Rugby Foundation charity. = Other = Mulholland was criticised for calling a constituent a \\"disingenuous, manipulative, illiberal shit\\" over Twitter in response to the constituent's comments on his vote in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. The constituent's earlier message had said \\"After abstaining, voting for a wrecking amendment, then trying to abolish marriage, I'm glad @GregMulholland1 finally voted the right way\\". Mulholland said he supported same sex marriage but believed there were flaws in the legislation, and was frustrated at being misrepresented. In 2007, he was nominated for best campaigning politician in the Channel 4 Political Awards for helping to secure the release of Mirza Tahir Hussain from prison in Pakistan. He has tabled Early Day Motions on a variety of subjects including support for small breweries, winter fuel payments for the severely disabled under 60, and against biometric data collection in schools. In 2008, Mulholland was recorded describing health minister Ivan Lewis as an \\"arsehole\\" after Lewis refused to let him intervene in a Westminster Hall debate on hospice funding. He later publicly defended his comment. Mulholland has also been active in seeking to expose companies which wish to move out of the Leeds area to reduce costs. In 2011 he tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling for a boycott of brands owned by Carlsberg due to their brewery being moved from Leeds. After Parliament In September 2018 Mulholland announced that he would not be standing for election to Parliament in the next general election. He described the shock of losing his seat in the unexpected 2017 election, when \\"just eight weeks later I had lost my job, my career, our family income and actually to a great extent, my identity\\". He is establishing himself as a \\"specialist campaigning and public affairs consultant\\" and political campaigning would be incompatible with that role. He did not rule out the possibility of standing for Parliament again, but \\"only if we see real change in British politics\\". He would also devote more time to his band Summercross, whose album My Northern Heart was nearing completion. It was subsequently announced that Kamran Hussain had been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Leeds North West. Hussain said \\"Greg Mulholland was a brilliant MP. He was hard working, focused on the constituency, and I would like to emulate his work\\". In August 2019 the album My Northern Heart, with 12 songs written by Mulholland and performed by his band Summercross, was reported to be \\"Set to be released in the next few weeks\\". The songs refer to topics including the construction of the Bramhope Tunnel, the suicide of Big Country singer Stuart Adamson, the campaign for the restoration of hire boats on the River Wharfe at Otley, and Mulholland's campaigning work for community pubs.  Personal life  He is married and has three daughters. The family lives in Otley. In 2009, he completed the Belfast marathon in 3 hrs 18 mins 50 secs and the \\"Wessex 100 mile\\" walk in 38 hrs 24 mins, as a \\"126 mile challenge\\" to raise money for local charities, along with Otley & Yeadon councillor Ryk Downes and university lecturer Martin Rivett.

The film was released on July 26, 1996 with a budget of $25 million, and was a box office hit of $32.2 million. Plot Flashy young bowler Roy Munson wins the 1979 Iowa state bowling championship and leaves home to turn professional. In his professional bowling tour debut, he defeats established pro Ernie McCracken, who takes the loss poorly and seeks revenge. McCracken convinces Roy to join him in hustling a group of local amateur bowlers. When the amateurs become furious after realizing they are being conned, McCracken flees while Roy is brutally beaten and loses his hand when it is forced into the ball return, ending his career. Seventeen years later, Roy uses a prosthetic hand and is living in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as an alcoholic, unsuccessful traveling salesman of bowling supplies. He is always behind on his rent and is constantly harassed by his landlady, Mrs. Dumars, eventually being reduced to trade sexual favors with her for a break on his back rent. On a sales visit to a nearby bowling alley, Roy meets Ishmael Boorg. Roy tries to convince Ishmael to turn pro, with Roy acting as manager. Ishmael declines, explaining that he is from the local Amish community and that his bowling hobby is a secret and must hide it from his family. Roy then sees a poster in a bowling magazine advertising a $1 million winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. Learning that Ishmael's family is about to lose their farm to the bank, Roy eventually convinces Ishmael's family to let him join Roy, under the guise of going on a mission trip. Roy discovers that the childlike Ishmael is not aware of some of bowling's basic rules and skills. (His 270 average was because he was taught to bowl fifteen frames and not the standard ten.) However, after some coaching, Ishmael improves. The duo earn money in various local tournaments and by hustling bowlers. Ishmael defeats a wealthy bowling enthusiast named Stanley Osmanski, but Stanley attacks the duo after discovering that the roll of cash Roy put up was fake. As the group flee Osmanski's mansion, his girlfriend Claudia, who had also been a victim of Osmanski's violence, joins them. Roy suspects Claudia has ulterior motives and is distracting Ishmael. After Roy gets in a fistfight with her, Ishmael flees. During his absence, Roy and Claudia drive on and end up back in Roy's hometown and at his childhood home, which has been abandoned ever since his father died years earlier. Roy then confesses to Claudia he never returned for his father's funeral out of shame for his failure as a pro bowler. They eventually call a truce, find Ishmael and continue on to Reno. In Reno, the group runs into McCracken, who is now a national bowling superstar. McCracken insults and makes fun of Roy and infuriates Ishmael, who attempts to punch McCracken but instead hits a wall and breaks his hand, leaving him unable to bowl. Later on, Claudia disappears with all of their money after being discovered by Stanley. Feeling distraught, Ishmael convinces Roy that they still have a chance to win $1 million if Roy bowls. Roy enters the tournament, rolling the ball with his prosthetic rubber hand. He rediscovers his touch, progresses through several rounds, and eventually ends up in the televised finals against McCracken. During the final match, Ishmael's brother, who had been sent by the Boorg family, arrives and takes Ishmael back to Pennsylvania. When Roy realizes he is alone, he struggles and McCracken wins the tournament by one pin. Afterwards, Roy has returned to his Pennsylvania apartment, and is seen pouring his liquor down the drain, when he is visited by Claudia, who explains she had disappeared with Stanley in Reno to keep him from hurting Roy and Ishmael. She made Stanley believe she was running away with McCracken to give McCracken payback off-screen, and confesses her love for Roy, offering him money Stanley earned from gambling on McCracken in the finals. Roy responds that he is going to make $500,000 in an endorsement deal for Trojan Condoms based on his prosthetic rubber hand. Roy and Claudia visit Ishmael's family home. Ishmael's parents explain that Roy and Claudia told them about Ishmael's forbidden bowling career, but also about the moral strength and decency he showed during his travels. Roy tells them how Ishmael straightened out Roy and Claudia's lives, with Roy shown to have finally given up drinking. Roy pays off the Boorg family's debts with his endorsement check, and Roy and Claudia kiss before driving away together.

It is sometimes spelled arak, or simply referred to as 'rack or 'rak. It is not to be confused with the anise-flavored distilled spirit called Arak or Araq. There are two primary styles of Arrack that are very different from one another: Batavia Arrack is often clear in color but has a flavor profile more similar to dark rum, with a distinctive \\"funk\\" or \\"hogo\\" imparted to it from fermented red rice. Ceylon Arrack, by contrast, is a more refined and subtle spirit. It has hints of Cognac and rum character and a wealth of delicate floral notes. Both styles are also made \\"in house\\" by local citizenry and can be more akin to moonshine in their presentation. History Arrack predates all \\"New World\\" spirits, as it is a parent to aguardiente (which was, in turn, the parent of rum, rhum agricole, and ron). Genoese merchants made the spirit as a byproduct of their sugar cane production in the Canary Islands. Besides making sugar, they produced arrack instead of importing it for their growing list of customers. Other early arrack was distilled from molasses and water, using dried cakes of red rice and botanicals that contain yeast and other fungi to trigger the fermentation process (this technique can be traced back thousands of years to China and even predates the birth of distillation). It is also claimed to have been distilled in India in 800 BC, but while palm wine and fermented sugar-cane drinks were being made around this time period not all believe that formal distillation was taking place. Outside Asia, the spirit was a common ingredient in the proliferation of Indian alcoholic punch, and was particularly popular in Holland and Sweden. It was the first distilled spirit consumed in the continental US, in the colonies of New Sweden and New Netherland, but is now mostly confused with the more common and similar spelled anise-flavored spirit arak. Regardless of the exact origin, arrack has come to symbolize a multitude of largely unrelated, distilled alcohols produced throughout Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. This is largely due to the proliferation of distillation knowledge throughout the Middle East during the 14th century. Each country named its own alcohol by using various Latin alphabet forms of the same word which was synonymous with distillation at the time (arak, araka, araki, ariki, arrack, arack, raki, raque, racque, rac, rak). 1864 English and Australian Cookery Book described Arrack as \\"a spirituous liquor from the East Indies. This term, or its corruption, rack, is applied to any spirituous liquor in the East. The true arrack is said to be distilled from toddy, the fermented juice of the coconut flower.It is however, frequently distilled from rice and sugar, fermented with the cocoa-nut juice.\\" Arrack in different countries =India= Arrack was banned in the states of Kerala in 1996,Arrack ban to stay in Kerala and Karnataka on 1 July 2007.Arrack ban in Karnataka from tomorrow - Economic TimesSiddu wants cheap, safe liquor for poor Batavian arrack factory \\"Aparak\\" in 1948 =Indonesia (Batavia-Arrack)= Within Indonesia itself, the term arak is still widely used to describe arrack. Arak (or rice wine) was a popular alcoholic beverage during the colonial era. It is considered the \\"rum\\" of Indonesia because, like rum, it is distilled from sugarcane. It is a pot still distillation. To start the fermentation, local fermented red rice is combined with local yeast to give a unique flavor and smell of the distillate. It is distilled to approx. 70% ABV. Like rum, Batavia-arrack is often a blend of different original parcels. One of the longest established arrack companies in Indonesia is the Batavia Arak Company (Dutch Batavia-Arak Maatschappij), which was already in business by 1872, became a limited liability company in 1901, and was still operating in the early 1950s. The Batavia Arak Company also exported arack to the Netherlands and had an office in Amsterdam. Some of the arrack brand produced by Batavia Arak Company were KWT (produced in the Bandengan (Kampung Baru) area of old Jakarta) and OGL. Still commonly available in Northern Europe and Southern Asia, Batavia Arrack can be difficult to find in the United States. Batavia-Arrack van Oosten is a more recently available brand. Batavia-Arrack is said to enhance flavor when used as a component in other products, such as pastries (like the Finnish Runeberg torte or the Dresdner Stollen), or in the confectionery and flavor industries. It is used in herbal and bitter liqueurs, and as a component in alcoholic punches (such as punsch, regent punch, royal punch, and black tea-port milk punch). Its use in punch was noted by early American bartender Jerry Thomas: \\"Most of the arrack imported into this country is distilled from rice, and comes from Batavia. It is but little used in America, except to flavor punch; the taste of it is very agreeable in this mixture. Arrack improves very much with age. It is much used in some parts of India, where it is distilled from toddy, the juice of the coconut tree\\". In Indonesia, arrack is often created as a form of moonshine. =Philippines= A Filipino term for distilled and undistilled alcoholic drinks in general is alak, derived from the Arabic word \\"arrak\\". The term \\"arak,\\" though, is specifically used in Ilocano. Arracks in the Philippines are predominantly not distilled. They can be derived from palm sap (notably coconut, nipa palm, or kaong palm), sugarcane, or rice. The only native alcohol that is traditionally distilled is lamban√≥g, which is made from the sap of palm flowers. The process begins with the sap from palm flowers. The sap is harvested into bamboo receptacles similar to rubber tapping, then cooked or fermented to produce a mildly-alcoholic coconut toddy called tub√¢. The tub√†, which by itself is also a popular beverage, is further distilled to produce lamban√≥g. The Italian explorer, Antonio Pigafetta, stated that the arrack that he drank in Palawan and nearby islands in 1521 was made from distilled rice wine.The Philippine Islands, 1493‚Äì1898 (Volume XXXIII, 1519‚Äì1522) However, he was likely referring to pangasi, a rice wine which is not distilled. =Sri Lanka (Ceylon-Arrack)= \\"Ceylon Arrack\\" Sri Lanka is the largest producer of coconut arrack and up until 1992 the government played a significant role in its production.SL‚Äôs Sin Industry and Sin Tax, W. A. Wijewardena Daily Ft ThinkWorth, Accessed 2015-10-11 Other than water, the entire manufacturing process revolves around the fermentation and distillation of a single ingredient, the sap of unopened flowers from a coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). Each morning at dawn, men known as toddy tappers move among the tops of coconut trees using connecting ropes not unlike tightropes. A single tree may contribute up to two litres per day. Due to its concentrated sugar and yeast content, the captured liquid naturally and immediately ferments into a mildly alcoholic drink called \\"toddy\\", tuak, or occasionally \\"palm wine\\". Within a few hours after collection, the toddy is poured into large wooden vats, called \\"wash backs\\", made from the wood of teak or Berrya cordifolia. The natural fermentation process is allowed to continue in the washbacks until the alcohol content reaches 5-7% and deemed ready for distillation. Distillation is generally a two-step process involving either pot stills, continuous stills, or a combination of both. The first step results in \\"low wine\\", a liquid with an alcohol content between 20 and 40%. The second step results in the final distillate with an alcohol content of 60 to 90%. It is generally distilled to between 33% and 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 66 to 100 proof. The entire distillation process is completed within 24 hours. Various blends of coconut arrack diverge in processing, yet the extracted spirit may also be sold raw, repeatedly distilled or filtered, or transferred back into halmilla vats for maturing up to 15 years, depending on flavor, color and fragrance requirements. Premium blends of arrack add no other ingredients, while the inexpensive and common blends are mixed with neutral spirits before bottling. Most people describe the taste as resembling \\"‚Ä¶a blend between whiskey and rum\\", similar, but distinctively different at the same time. Coconut arrack is traditionally consumed by itself or with ginger beer, a popular soda in Sri Lanka. It also may be mixed in cocktails as a substitute for the required portions of either rum or whiskey. Arrack is often combined with popular mixers such as cola, soda water, and lime juice. Production types According to the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre's 2008 report on alcohol in Sri Lanka, the types of arrack are: *Special arrack, which is produced in the highest volume, nearly doubling in production between 2002 and 2007. * Molasses arrack is the least-processed kind and considered the common kind. Nevertheless, as a whole, arrack is the most popular local alcoholic beverage consumed in Sri Lanka and produced as a wide variety of brands that fit into the following three categories: *Premium aged, after distillation, is aged in halmilla vats for up to 15 years to mature and mellow the raw spirit before blending. Premium brands include Ceylon Arrack, VSOA, VX, Vat9, Old Reserve and Extra Special. *Premium clear is generally not aged, but often distilled and/or filtered multiple times to soften its taste. Premium clear brands include Double Distilled and Blue Label. *Common is blended with other alcohols produced from molasses or mixed with neutral spirits as filler. Producers Sri Lanka's largest manufacturers, listed in order based on their 2007 annual production of arrack, are: * DCSL (Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka), 37.25 million litres * IDL (International Distilleries Ltd), 3.97 million litres * Rockland Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd, 2.18 million litres * Mendis, 0.86 million litres Ceylon Arrack, a brand of Sri Lankan coconut arrack, was recently launched in the UK in 2010. It is also available in France and Germany.Ceylon Arrack Bottled in UK Retrieved 18 September 2009 White Lion VSOA entered the American market soon after. Coconut arrack for export =St Helena= Historically Arrack has been a common beverage on the island of St Helena, distilled from potatoes. This is likely due to influences of the East India Company, which controlled St Helena and used it as a halfway point between India and England. = Sweden and Finland = In Sweden and Finland, batavia-arrack has historically been mixed with other ingredients in order to make Swedish punsch (now available in prepackaged bottles). The alcohol content is normally not over 25%, although it has a high sugar content of nearly 30%. The original recipe was a mixture of arrack with water, sugar, lemon, and tea and/or spices (chiefly nutmeg). Today punsch is mostly drunk warm as an accompaniment to yellow split pea soup, although it is also used as a flavouring in several types pastries and sweets as well. The name arrak is still retained for some pastries, for example arraksboll, whereas punsch is used for things like punschrulle. In Finland, arrack (or rum) usually serves as one of the ingredients in the making one of the Finnish traditional pastries, Runeberg tortes. Etymology The word derived from the Arabic word arak (ÿπÿ±ŸÇ, arq), meaning 'distillate'. In the Middle East and Near East, the term arak is usually used for liquor distilled from grapes and flavored with anise. Unlike arak, the word arrack has been considered by some experts to be derived from areca nut, a palm seed originating in India from the areca tree and used as the basis for many varieties of arrack. In 1838, Samuel Morewood's work on the histories of liquors was published. On the topic of arrack, he said: See also Feni (Urrack) * Arak * List of Indonesian beverages References External links This describes different forms of arrack as understood at the time, and cites H.

She was killed on August 1, 1975, during an ambush near El Sauce, Leon, Nicaragua, by soldiers from Anastasio Somoza Debayle's National Guard. She was 20 years old. Many in Nicaragua consider Siu one of the earliest deaths in the revolutionary movement. Her artistic works and critical essays on Marxism and feminism served as an inspiration to both the Sandinistas and the Nicaraguan women's movement. Her picture was often displayed at FSLN celebrations throughout Nicaragua. Managua and El Rama have neighborhoods named after her, and a park in Le√≥n is also named after her. Siu wrote a song called \\"Maria Rural\\", and since her death it has been sung by √Ålvarez and Grupo Pancas√°n, among others.

She is regarded as ‚Äúone of the five most influential Chinese-born women writers in the postwar era and the progenitor of the Chinese students‚Äô overseas genre.‚Äù She wrote primarily in Chinese, drawing on her experience as a Chinese √©migr√© in postwar America. She was celebrated in the diaspora for giving voice to what she called the ‚Äúrootless generation‚Äù ‚Äî √©migr√©s who had left for a better life but remained nostalgic for their homeland. She was more than a successful writer, but a bridge, a cultural ambassador between China and the US. In 1975, she was one of the first individuals to be invited back to China after relations between the two countries were re-opened. Her work, which until then had been blacklisted in China, began to focus on life in China. Through sponsorship of scholarly exchange programs, her column in China's People's Daily newspaper, and radio broadcasts on the Voice of America, she educated both the American and Chinese public about life in each other's countries. Early life Yu was born in Shanghai in 1929 and moved to Taiwan in 1948 after the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). She attended National Taiwan University, where she graduated with a degree in history in 1953. That year, Yu emigrated to the United States and enrolled in the school of journalism at the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1956, even though she had failed UCLA's English proficiency exam and was turned away from their literature program, she won the coveted Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award, with her story \\"The Sorrow at the End of the Yangtze River.\\" (Êù®Â≠êÊ±üÂ§¥Âá†Â§öÊÑÅ). She received her master's degree in history in 1956.  Career  After UCLA, Yu wrote several pieces in English, which were all rejected by American publishers. Not to be stopped, she returned to writing in Chinese and began her long writing career in earnest. In 1967, her breakout novel, \\"Again the Palms,\\" (ÂèàË¶ãÊ£ïÊ´ö, ÂèàË¶ãÊ£ïÊ´ö) won Taiwan's prestigious Ch'ia Hsin Award for best novel of the year. She continued to write into her late eighties. Yu taught Chinese language and literature at the University at Albany, State University of New York from 1968 to 1993. She continued her writing career throughout her time at SUNY. She was instrumental in starting exchange programs that brought many Chinese students to the campus. In 2006, Yu received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College. Personal life Yu was married to physics professor Chih Ree Sun, with whom she had three children: daughters Lena Sun, Eugene Sun, and Anna Sun. After their divorce, Yu married University at Albany president Vincent O‚ÄôLeary. After O'Leary's retirement, they moved to San Mateo in 1997. They moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland in 2006. Death Yu died on April 30, 2020 of respiratory failure brought on by COVID-19 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Bibliography She is the author of over thirty novels, short stories, essays, and translations. *Êù®Â≠êÊ±üÂ§¥Âá†Â§öÊÑÅ, /Yangzi jiang tou ji duo chou (The Sorrow at the End of the Yangtze River) 1956

Unlike most of the residents of the time, he was not interested in material riches; instead, he was the first preacher, of any denomination, in the Black Hills Gold Rush camps. Biography Smith was born in Ellington, Connecticut to Joshua Weston and Percey or Persey (Galpin) Smith of Berlin, Connecticut. In 1847, he married Ruth Yeomans, but both his wife and infant son died one year later. At the age of 23, Smith became a licensed \\"exhorter\\" and later a Methodist preacher. On February 23, 1858, while still in Connecticut, he married Lydia Ann Joselyn or Joslin, with whom he had four children. He subsequently moved to Massachusetts and, during the American Civil War, served with the Massachusetts 52nd Infantry, after which he became a doctor in 1867. The family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1876. Move to Deadwood In 1876, although not being appointed to do so by the church, Smith felt a calling to minister to the Black Hills Gold Rush, and that spring he accompanied a wagon train from Cheyenne, Wyoming to the Black Hills, traveling on foot. He found work as a prospector and boarded a freight train in Custer, arriving in Deadwood in May 1876. According to George V. Ayres, later a prominent merchant in the area, \\"Reverend Smith held the first church service in the Hills\\" at Custer City, on May 7, 1876, with 30 men and five women in attendance. Smith preached in Custer again the next Sunday, then offered $5 to Captain C.V. Gardner to accompany his wagon train to Deadwood, a three-day walk; as a Methodist himself, Gardner allowed Smith to come along without charge. In Deadwood, Smith became a street preacher, working at odd jobs during the week in addition to prospecting and mining, and also worked on the Boulder Ditch, a large project that did not pay many of those worked on it. After working during the week, Smith would be found preaching on Main Street on Sundays and would travel miles on foot to preach at other settlements. John S. McClintock's memoirs describe Smith preaching near the corner of Main and Gold Streets, to a mixture of curiosity and respect, with some removing their hats to listen. As described by Gardner: > \\"In the years past I have noted in the press many statements regarding > incidents connected with the man known as Preacher Smith. Most of them are > pure romance. ... how he used to go into the saloons and pray are pure > fiction. I never saw him in a saloon, and I am sure he never was. He > preached frequently in Deadwood, generally in front of Bent and Deetken's > drug store or in front of my store. ... in those days the town had 3,000 to > 4,000 people, located mostly on one street, and he had no trouble in > securing an audience. He was a man about 6 feet tall, with a fine physique > and I should say 40 years old. He was very quiet and unassuming in manner. I > know nothing of his past life, as he never volunteered to tell me and it was > not wise in those days to inquire too closely into a man's antecedents.\\" Death On Sunday, August 20, 1876, Smith left a note on his cabin door after his Deadwood service, saying \\"Gone to Crook City to preach, and if God is willing, will be back at three o‚Äôclock.\\" Friends concerned about the danger of Indians or thieves had warned Smith against walking alone and unarmed, but he is remembered as replying, \\"The Bible is my protection. It has never failed me yet.\\" Unfortunately, Smith was murdered as he walked to Crook City, his body found alongside the road by a local resident, the exact location no longer remembered. He had not been robbed, causing his death to be generally attributed to Indians, although some still believed he was killed by thieves. Another theory, however, held that he was murdered by a person or persons representing the saloons, brothels, casinos, and other 'vice dens' of Deadwood, who feared that his preaching would cut into their income. Similar rumors had circulated after the recent murder of Wild Bill Hickok. Seth Bullock, Deadwood's sheriff, described Smith's death in an August 21, 1876 letter to Reverend J. S. Chadwick: > \\"It becomes my painful duty to inform you that Rev. H. Weston Smith was > killed by the Indians yesterday (Sunday) a short distance from this place. > He had an appointment to preach here in the afternoon, and was on his way > from Crook City when a band of Indians overtook him and shot him. His body > was not mutilated in any way, and was found in the road a short time after > the hellish deed had been done. His death was instantaneous as he was shot > through the heart. His funeral occurred today from his home in this town. > Everything was done by kind hands, that was possible under the > circumstances, and a Christian burial given him. I was not personally > acquainted with Mr. Smith, but knew him by reputation, as an earnest worker > in his Master's Vineyard. He has preached here on several occasions, and was > the only minister in the Hills. He died in the harness and his memory will > be always with those who knew him. A letter from you which I found in his > home causes me to convey this sad intelligence to you.\\" Smith's body was buried in a hillside cemetery in Deadwood, the service conducted by C. E. Hawley, a member of Smith's flock, in the absence of other clergy. The casket was later moved to Mount Moriah Cemetery, with a life-sized statue marking his grave. Memorial Monument in Deadwood, SD off US-85 In 1914, the Society of Black Hills Pioneers erected a monument on the road between Deadwood and Spearfish, South Dakota, in the approximate area where Smith's body had been found. In 1994, Highway 85 north of Deadwood, along with the Preacher Smith Monument, was relocated by construction of a four-lane road. A copper time capsule that had been buried in 1914 was opened, providing some period artifacts, such as newspapers; after examination, they, along with additional contemporary items, were returned to the capsule and reburied under the new monument, three miles south of Deadwood on the rebuilt Highway 85. The new monument was rededicated on August 20, 1995, on the 119th anniversary of Smith's murder. The highlight of the ceremony was a reading by local resident, historian, and lawyer Reed Richards of the sermon Preacher Smith had planned to deliver at Crook City that fateful day, 119 years delayed.  Deadwood  Smith was portrayed in the HBO television series Deadwood (2004‚Äì2006) by actor Ray McKinnon. The letter written by the character of Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) in the third season episode \\"Unauthorized Cinnamon\\" is similar to the August 21, 1876, letter to Reverend J. S. Chadwick written by the real Seth Bullock. In the show, the circumstances of Smith's demise were changed to a gradual decay due to a brain tumor, though he was killed by Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) before dying from the cancer. He was also depicted conducting the funeral of Wild Bill Hickok when in reality there was no preacher involved in his burial.

They are often quasi-judicial in nature; that is, they include public or in-camera hearings. Presidential Commissions often serve one of two political purposes: to draw attention to a problem (the publication of a report by a commission can generally be counted on to draw attention from the media, depending on how its release is handled); or, on the other hand, to delay action on an issue (if the President wants to avoid taking action but still look concerned about an issue, he can convene a commission and then let it slip into obscurity.) However, there have been cases (the Tower, Rogers and Warren Commissions) where the commission has created reports that have been used as evidence in later criminal proceedings.

The eight-line poem is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a New York Giants fan watching the Chicago Cubs infield of shortstop Joe Tinker, second baseman Johnny Evers, and first baseman Frank Chance complete a double play. These three players helped the Cubs win four National League championships and two World Series from 1906 to 1910. \\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\\" became popular across the United States among sportswriters, who wrote their own verses along the same vein. The poem only enhanced the reputations of Tinker, Evers, and Chance over the succeeding decades as the phrase became synonymous with a feat of smooth and ruthless efficiency. It has been credited with their elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Publication The poem was first published in the New York Evening Mail on July 12, 1910, under the title \\"That Double Play Again.\\" The day before, the Cubs had defeated the Giants, 4‚Äì2, in Chicago, having squelched a late-inning Giants rally with a double play from Tinker to Evers to Chance. Background Tinker, Evers, and Chance began playing together with the Cubs in September 1902, forming a double play combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 and won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, a five-year span that saw them regularly defeat the arch-rival Giants en route to the pennants and World Series. =Context in baseball history= Frank Chance joined the Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a reserve catcher, backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny Kling. Frank Selee, the Cubs' manager, decided that Chance would be better suited as a first baseman. Chance at first opposed the move and even threatened to quit, but ultimately obliged. Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league baseball, but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop, replacing Barry McCormick. Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base. Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base to back up Bobby Lowe. Fans watch Merkle's Boner from Coogan's Bluff, September 23, 1908 Lowe suffered a knee injury late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time. Tinker, Evers, and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They turned their first double play on September 15, 1902. Lowe's injury did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903. Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill. The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs clinched the pennant after defeating the Giants in part due to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant. From 1906 to 1910, the Cubs turned 491 double plays, the third-most in the NL during that time. According to Bill James' formula, \\"expected double plays\\", the Cubs led the NL with 50 more double plays than expected during those five seasons. From 1906 through 1910, the \\"Tinker, to Evers, to Chance\\" double play happened 54 times in 770 games played, and the trio did not collaborate on a double play during any of their 21 World Series games. In 1906, the trio committed 194 errors, though this was in part due to poor field conditions and scorers. =Composition= Franklin Pierce Adams wrote a weekly column for the New York Evening Mail, called \\"Always in Good Humor\\". Adams hoped to leave work to attend a Giants game, but his editor found that Adams had not produced enough content for his column. While traveling to the Polo Grounds to see the Giants play the Cubs, Adams wrote the poem that would become Baseball's Sad Lexicon, while reflecting on Tinker, Evers, and Chance. He considered the lines to be forgettable as he wrote them, and an editor at the paper told him that he did not consider the work to be \\"much good\\". This work was first published as \\"That Double Play Again\\" in the New York Evening Mail on July 12, 1910 (not on July 10 as numerous sources state). The Chicago Daily Tribune reprinted it as \\"Gotham's Woe\\" on July 15, 1910. Three days later, on July 18, the New York Evening Mail republished it under the title by which it is best known today, \\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon.\\" The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses. For the poem's 100th anniversary, Tim Wiles, director of research at the Baseball Hall of Fame, conducted research on the poem. He revealed that the poem was part of series of poems published in the New York Evening Mail and the Chicago Tribune. During the research process, combing the archives in the New York Public Library and the Center for Research Libraries, they uncovered 29 poems, 15 of which detail a specific play or game that had occurred during the 1910 season, with \\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\\" the first poem published. After publication In 1911, the Giants overcame the Cubs, capturing the first of three consecutive National League pennants. The trio played their final game together on April 12, 1912. While Chance was hospitalized for a brain injury suffered while playing, club owner Charles Webb Murphy released him after an argument about Murphy's releasing other players with high salaries. Murphy named Evers manager for the 1913 season, which displeased Tinker, who was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. Murphy fired Evers as manager after one season, trading him against his will to the Boston Braves in February 1914. As a consequence, National League president John K. Tener and newspaper owner Charles P. Taft (who also owned the Philadelphia Phillies) made a successful effort to drive Murphy out of baseball. Taft purchased the Cubs from Murphy in 1914. Sporting Life commemorated the affair with this variation on the poem: Impact and legacy 1906 Chicago Cubs Chance died in 1924, Evers in 1947, and Tinker in 1948. The poem was regularly used to memorialize each of the players after his death. All three players were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited in part to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs as well as a coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was not a member of the Hall of Fame. The poem gave the trio \\"everlasting fame\\". Evers made an appearance on Information Please, a radio show on which Adams was a panelist in 1938. Evers thanked Adams for writing the poem, which he credited for his being remembered. However, many forgot Harry Steinfeldt, the third baseman who started alongside Tinker, Evers, and Chance from 1906 through 1910. Including Steinfeldt, the Cubs infield set a record for longevity surpassed by the Los Angeles Dodgers infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell, and third baseman Ron Cey, who played together for eight years, from 1973 through 1981. Despite their celebrated success at turning spectacular plays in collaboration, relations between the teammates were said to have been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States. In popular culture = As a metaphor for teamwork or precision = The phrase \\"Tinker to Evers to Chance,\\" and variations using other names, have been colloquially used to characterize high-caliber teamwork. Examples include: * The song \\"O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg\\" in the 1949 musical film Take Me Out to the Ball Game * In a 1966 episode of Hogan's Heroes titled \\"The Safecracker Suite\\", after Corporal Newkirk bypasses Colonel Klink to toss Colonel Hogan an envelope containing secret plans, Hogan remarks to Klink, \\"Tinker to Evers to Chance is the play. You're only Evers, I'm Chance.\\" * In an episode of the 1970s TV series, The Brady Bunch, Alice, the housekeeper, refers to Greg, Peter and Bobby as \\"Tinker to Evers to Chance\\" as the boys enter the kitchen after a baseball game. * An advertisement for The Hours, a 2003 film, praising the trio of Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Julianne Moore as the \\"acting version\\" of the three baseball players The poem's title has also been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as \\"like clockwork\\" or \\"a well-oiled machine.\\" For example: * In Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye (1953), detective Philip Marlowe goes through his mail, opens it, and tosses it into the waste bin, remarking, \\"Mail slot to desk to wastebasket, Tinker to Evers to Chance.\\" * The Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward used the phrase \\"Tinker to Evers to Chance\\" in their account of the Post investigation of the Watergate scandal in their 1974 book, All the President's Men. The reference described the smooth operation of President Richard Nixon's White House staff in responding to allegations of misconduct. = Other references = Tinker, Evers, and Chance Ogden Nash, in his 1949 poem \\"Line-Up For Yesterday: An ABC of Baseball Immortals,\\" referred to the trio of players in a stanza for the letter \\"E\\": Walt Kelly, in the May 7, 1953 installment of the Pogo comic strip, depicted the character Simple J. Malarkey (a caricature of Senator Joseph McCarthy) advising a preacher that the Constitution \\"can't guarantee what happens after you speak up... it don't pay to tinker forever with chance, ha ha like the fella says.\\" Musician Scott Miller, leader of the 1980s band Game Theory, chose Tinker to Evers to Chance as the ironic title of a 1990 compilation album of the band's greatest would-be hits which, despite significant critical acclaim, had struck out commercially. Like Nash, Miller emphasized the double meaning of the names, creating a visual pun by featuring a piece from a Tinkertoy set (\\"tinker\\"), a pocket watch (\\"evers\\"), and a die (\\"chance\\") on the album cover. The poem was set to music and recorded in 2010 by Chicago singer/songwriter guitarist Chris McCaughan. The song, also titled \\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon,\\" appears on the album We Chase the Waves by McCaughan's solo project, Sundowner.

A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four- decade naval career by attending and receiving a commission from the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1970, he was head of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command. After his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga, California less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global Marine Development, Inc., in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American Society of Naval Engineers' Harold E. Saunders Award, which honors \\"an individual whose reputation in naval engineering spans a long career of notable achievement and influence.\\" In 1983, he was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems of the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report, \\"Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels\\". On July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one of eight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The Reagan Administration's choices for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists, who noted that it included no atmospheric scientists. One of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U.S. shipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by government subsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyard capacity is \\"considerably greater\\" than would be required in a major conventional war. Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expand production by 3¬Ω to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. \\"Look at England in the Falklands\\", Sonenshein told the Washington Post. \\"In less than two months, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that were then used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and more merchant ships to give you a margin of safety.

Galarpe (US-Veteran, Ret) is considered to be the father of Aikido in the Philippines. He began training in 1957 in Guam under Harry S. Ito. Four years later he earned his Shodan (rank) degree from the Japan Aikido Hombu Dojo. He was the first Aikido representative of the Japan Aikikai Hombu Dojo to spread and propagate Aikido in the Philippines. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, promoted him to the degree of Nidan after advanced training in the World Aikido Hombu in Sanjukuku, Tokyo, Japan. While teaching in the Philippines, he held exhibitions in Bicol, Pampanga, Baguio, Olongapo City, Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Cebu City, Batangas City, and other places within the Philippines. Benjamin Galarpe's students, namely Chan Hok-seng, Ernesto Talag, Max Tian and Manuel \\"Omar\\" Camar, became the prime movers of the Aikido Movement in the Philippines. In 1963, Benjamin began teaching Aikido in San Andres, Bukid, Malate, Philippines. Monching J. Gavile√±o, later to found the Aikido Association of the Philippines (AAP), became his first student. The school later moved to Avenida Rizal, Philippines and finally settled in Quiapo located within Metro Manila, Philippines. the school was known as the Manila Aikikai and was under the supervision of Manuel \\"Omar\\" Camar. In 1965 Koichi Tohei, the chief instructor of Aikido Hombu in the World Aikido Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan visited the Aikido schools in Manila, Philippines and held Aikido exhibitions along with Benjamin Galarpe throughout the Philippines. Later that year, Koichi Tohei went on to promote Benjamin Galarpe to the rank of Sandan. The schism between Aikikai doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba and the head master Koichi Tohei in the early 1970s pressured Galarpe to take sides and choose his loyalty between the Aikikai and Koichi Tohei's Ki Society. In the end, Galarpe chose Koichi Tohei and joined Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido. The now orphaned Manila Aikido Club, which Galarpe founded for the Aikikai, was left in the hands of his student Manuel \\"Omar\\" Camar. As far as he was concerned, Galarpe's decision to ally himself with Tohei was his personal choice and was not supposed to involve any of his students nor the Manila Aikido Club. However, three of his students, Ernesto Talag of Quezon City, Chan Hok-seng of Pampanga and Max Tian of Cebu, did decide to follow Galarpe's example and remain loyal to Koichi Tohei. Ernesto Talag joined Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido and founded the Ki Society of the Philippines. Max Tian did the same thing and established the Cebu Ki Society. Chan Hok-seng, founder of the Angeles Aikido Club and long-time friend of Galarpe, decided to follow his teacher's example to the letter. But unlike Galarpe, Chan Hok-seng decided to close down his school rather than pass it on to someone else. Galarpe returned to Guam in 1968. Once established in Guam he began teaching Aikido at the University of Guam Guam Police Science Academy for the next four years. While there, he taught college students and police recruits physical education and the arts of Aikido. In 1972, Galarpe founded the School of Self-Defense in Guam. The school teaches Aikido under the direction of his students and family members who have gone on to become black belt Aikido instructors.

The crash arose from misunderstandings between staff which effectively over-rode the safe operation of the Electric Train Tablet system protecting the single line. A train departed carrying the wrong tablet for the section it was entering and collided with a train coming the other way. Background The Cambrian Railways, which traversed Wales from Whitchurch in Shropshire to and , via , contained a number of single line sections. The small station of Abermule was a crossing station between two such sections. To the east was , to the west was Newtown. To protect the single line sections, Tyer's Electric Train Tablet apparatus was used. Two linked tablet instruments were used on each section, one at each end. To allow a train to proceed into the section, a call button would be pressed on one instrument, alerting the operator at the other end of the section. If the other operator was in a position to accept the train, he would then press a release button on his instrument, which allowed a tablet (a metal plate inscribed with the name of the section) to be withdrawn from the caller's instrument. The tablet would then be placed inside a pouch fitted with a metal loop (which allowed it to be easily picked up or handed over by a train crew while in motion) and given to the driver of the train as proof of his authority to occupy the section. Until the tablet was replaced in one of the instruments, another tablet could not be withdrawn from either of them. Tablets of adjacent sections had differently-shaped and -positioned holes and notches in them to prevent a tablet being inserted into wrong instrument. This system had protected the Cambrian Railways for many years. There was a weakness at Abermule, in that the electric tablet machines and the other block telegraph instruments were kept in the main station buildings, while the signals were worked from a separate signal box at the east end of the station, and some of the points from a ground frame at the other end of the station. Regulations specified that only the stationmaster or signalman were to work the tablet machines, but it was common for both to be occupied with duties away from the station buildings, and it became accepted practice for any member of the station staff to work them. The accident The section of the Cambrian Railways adjacent to Abermule Station, where the accident occurred Shortly before midday on 26 January 1921, a west-bound stopping train from Whitchurch and an east-bound express from Aberystwyth were approaching Abermule from opposite directions, and were due to cross there. The regular Abermule Stationmaster, Parry, was on leave, and Relief Stationmaster Lewis, who was deputising for him, had gone for his lunch. The other three station staff at Abermule were Signalman Jones, Porter Rogers, who was seventeen, and a trainee booking clerk named Thompson, who was only fifteen years old. The staff at Montgomery station requested clearance for the stopping train to run to Abermule, and Signalman Jones pressed the release on the tablet instrument for the Montgomery-Abermule section, allowing the train to proceed. He then checked that the express was running to time, and was informed that it had just passed Moat Lane Junction on the far side of Newtown, as scheduled. Jones went to the signal box to open the level crossing gates and clear the signals for the stopping train. Meanwhile, Relief Stationmaster Lewis returned from his lunch. A permanent way sub-inspector attracted his attention with an urgent enquiry, and the stationmaster immediately went with the sub-inspector to the goods yard, without entering the instrument room or inquiring as to the position of any trains approaching Abermule. Newtown station then requested permission for the express to proceed to Abermule. Porter Rogers pressed the release on the tablet machine for the Newtown-Abermule section which allowed it to do so. He then went to the ground frame at the west end of the station to set the points for the express, but found the frame locked against him because Jones had already \\"set the road\\" for the stopping train to arrive on the down road. While Rogers was occupied at the ground frame, Newtown signalled that the express was entering the Newtown-Abermule section. However, there was no-one in the Abermule station buildings to note the signal. Before Porter Rogers could call to Signalman Jones to release the ground frame lock, the stopping train arrived. The youth, Thompson, collected the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section from the driver of the stopping train, and was heading back to the station buildings to put it in the tablet instrument when he met Lewis returning from the goods yard. He gave the tablet to Lewis, saying that he had to go and collect the tickets (although only one passenger had alighted from the train). He did not mention that he had yet to exchange the tablet for one for the Abermule- Newtown section (which he could not have done, because the Abermule-Newtown tablet machine was still locked). Thompson also mistakenly told Lewis that the express was still \\"about Moat Lane\\", presumably from having overheard some of Jones's earlier telephone conversation. Lewis assumed that because the express had apparently not reached Newtown, the two trains would cross at Newtown rather than Abermule, and he did not look at the tablet closely enough to see that it was the one for the Montgomery-Abermule section that had just been handed over by the driver of the stopping train. He crossed back to the down platform and, because the driver was oiling around the engine, handed the tablet back to the stopping train's fireman, who did not notice the error either. Lewis gave the \\"Right away\\" signal by hand. Jones, who was also on the down platform, assumed that the express had been delayed or held at Newtown for some reason. Rogers, who was still at the ground frame, assumed the same, because of Lewis's actions and because the frame was locked, and so he lowered the down advance starting signal. Lewis, Jones and Rogers did not realise the truth until the stopping train had already departed. Lord Herbert Lionel Henry Vane-Tempest, a director of the Cambrian Railways, killed in the accident. The crew of the express were travelling at about , and about to begin slowing for the arrival at Abermule, when they saw the stopping train heading for them on the same track. Although they immediately braked, they could not stop in time. The crew of the stopping train did not appear to have seen them, because they continued to put on steam. The crew of the express were just able to jump clear in time, although they were both severely injured. Fifteen passengers, including a director of the railway, Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest, and the driver and fireman of the stopping train, were killed in the collision. After the crash, Driver Pritchard Jones of the express train was desperately concerned that he had made an error, until his fireman, Owen, retrieved both their own correct tablet for the section, and the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section, from the wreckage. The tablets were handed to the Traffic Controller for the Cambrian Railways, who had been travelling on the stopping train, and the Chief Traffic Inspector, who had been a passenger on the express. The Inspector (George) took the Montgomery-Abermule tablet on foot to Abermule station and replaced it in the correct machine in the presence of witnesses, to allow a breakdown train from Oswestry to reach the scene of the crash and assist with freeing the injured.Rolt, Red for Danger, p. 159 The engines involved were 4-4-0 passenger locomotives. Both were reduced to wreckage and written off. There was severe telescoping of the passenger carriages, especially in the express train, which caused most of the casualties. This was apparently the result of the collision occurring on a slight curve, causing the buffers to be slightly misaligned, and allowing the fourth carriage of the express to override the buffers of the third. Causes and lessons The obvious cause of the Abermule collision was the unauthorised working of the tablet machines by anyone who happened to be around, and the failure of the staff at Abermule to notify each other of their actions. The slack working practices had been allowed to develop over several years by Stationmaster Parry and Signalman Jones. A contributory cause was the failure of anyone to examine the tablet they received by removing it from its pouch and checking that it was the correct one. Although inspection of the tablet was required in the working rules, it was clearly taken for granted that the tablet was correct, since the system had worked faultlessly for years. Indeed, for anyone to ostentatiously examine a tablet may have been a breach of etiquette, as it would imply that the person handing it over might not be competent or trustworthy. Driver Pritchard Jones and Fireman Owen of the express train were conscientious in inspecting every tablet they received; the crew of the stopping train were not. Finally, the awkward layout of tablet instruments, signals and points levers at Abermule meant that it was possible for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that tablet machines be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system. The obvious, though costly, solution to the problems of working single lines would be to double the tracks. As finances allowed, the Cambrian Railways (and the Great Western Railway, which took over the Cambrian after the grouping of 1923) had been slowly carrying out the necessary work. Ironically, British Rail actually removed much of the doubled track and some of the crossing stations as part of the Beeching Axe. In August 2019, an operating irregularity on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent resulted in two passenger trains being on a single track section of line heading in opposite directions. The trains stopped before a collision occurred. The Abermule accident was cited as having \\"clear parallels with the events leading up to the incident at Romney Sands\\".

It is a member of NASCO. The first coop was established in 1976, and currently there are six houses; Newman, Manley, Dolores, Biko, Merton, and Persimmon. In all, 118 students live in these houses. The purpose of the Santa Barbara Student Housing Co-op (SBSHC) is to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation. SBSHC engages in continuous educational programs that further the principles of cooperation through mutual, self-help living at a minimal cost. The co-ops are located in Isla Vista and are centers of artistic expression, alternative thought, social activism and creativity in the frantic party boom and bust community that is Isla Vista. The co-op system organizes the annual \\"Co-opula\\" festival featuring local musical talent, spoken word, local organic food and outdoor entertainment in Anisq'Oyo' Park in Isla Vista. In 2006, the massively successful and now institutionalized \\"Chillavista\\" festival was organized out of the Biko co-op, and featured musical talent from the Isla Vista community including many bands spawned from and frequently performing at Isla Vista Co- ops. Chillavista was powered through renewable energy, featured local organic produce, screened several films on progressivism and sustainability and proved to be a highly successful zero waste event featuring national touring acts such as Delta Nove, Blue Turtle Seduction, Elijah Manuel & The Revelations and local psychedelic jam masters Silent Wei. In 2006, the Isla Vista co-ops provided pivotal support to the over 200 residents evicted from their homes in Isla Vista by Conquest Housing. Many in the Isla Vista community regarded these evictions as racially motivated, since nearly all of the 200 men, women, and children who were evicted were Hispanic and had little access to legal representation on their behalf. In response, some residents of the co-ops rallied support for the families by throwing benefit concerts, establishing a protest \\"tent city\\" in the center of the UCSB campus and staging marches throughout Santa Barbara to raise awareness of these families' concerns. The efforts have contributed to the larger emerging front in Isla Vista united against the ongoing pattern of discriminatory eviction followed by student rent gouging. SBSHC also has a long-standing partnership with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative through purchasing most of its common houses' food through the food co-op, being the food co-op's biggest customer, making food co-op staff eligible to live in SBSHC houses, and shared leadership. The Houses =Manley= During the summer of 2005, Manley received a remodeled kitchen, new roof, new windows, a converted storage to study room, a complete solar panel system, landscaped garden area and refinished upstairs deck. Residents now participate in a full meal plan with both meat and vegetarian/vegan options. The house charge covers electricity, gas, water, trash, laundry, and cable internet. The Manley house has eleven bedrooms in two separate units. Three bedrooms are located upstairs, where there is a large deck and living room. Downstairs are eight bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, dining room, and study space. The house is named after Steven Manley, who died August 15, 1979, battling a brush wildfire near Santa Maria. He was 21 years old and a Junior Environmental Studies Major at UCSB, working the summer as a firefighter with the California Division of Forestry. =Newman= Although Newman has nine separate apartments (six two-bedroom/one-bath units and three studios), Newman is a housing community. There is no meal plan for the Newman building but some members participate in optional potlucks. The homemade fire pit in front, worm bin composting system, gardens, and mural painting projects on the Newman's doors and walls, allows members to be creative and communal. The House charge for Newman's residents covers laundry, parking, water, trash and cable internet. Newman House is named after Patti Newman, the first Executive Director and staff member of SBSHC. =Dolores= Dolores, formerly called Dashain, is a vegetarian/vegan house. Dolores strives to buy local food and cultivate a partnership with their neighboring organic and whole foods cooperative, the Isla Vista Food Co-op. Of the co-ops, Dolores is the closest to the beach situated on the 67 block of Sabado Tarde Road. Sunsets can be viewed from the window of the top three rooms, and fire loving occurs in the backyard. Dolores maintains its own garden space out back which once hosted a family of chickens. The house has nine bedrooms and three bathrooms. Dolores has traditionally never had television in common space but have hosted community screenings in the living room or front and backyard. The house charge covers water, trash, electricity, gas, cable internet, parking and laundry. Dolores is named after Dolores Huerta, a civil rights activist and co-founder of the National Farmworkers Association (now the United Farm Workers (UFW)) . =Biko= Named after Stephen Bantu Biko, founder and martyr of the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, Biko has been SBSHC's \\"People of Color\\" Co-op. Biko's theme provides a safe, respectful space for people of color in a predominantly white college campus community. A social justice house, Biko has been known to host ethnic studies events and socials for the Queer Student Union (QSU). Biko has twelve bedrooms and six bathrooms. Its kitchen is large and spacious, with industrial-strength cooking facilities and a stocked pantry. Biko has a mandatory meal plan that always offers both meat and vegetarian/vegan options. The House charge includes gas, electricity, water, trash, and laundry, and cable internet. The garage space out front functions as central storage as well as an all-purpose community space for radical meetings, music, art exhibitions and dance. Biko Garage is funded by donation only, and is run and operated by house members. The basketball court and front garden and porch space, as well as ample parking, are some of the other benefits of living at the Biko. =Merton= The Thomas Merton Interfaith House was completed in April 2013, with the first residents moving in June 2013. The co-op house, located on the second floor of the building, has a large kitchen and living room, with semi dorm-style bathrooms. There is a sizable garden on the north side of the building, as well as bike storage lockers, SBSHC's office, and an auditorium and kitchen used for five SBSHC events per year. The theme of the house is Interfaith, continuing the legacy of the University Religious Center who previously owned the building. Through continuing funds, co-op members are enabled to attend interfaith conferences, host interfaith-themed events, and make connections with faith groups around the community and the world. SBSHC members who live at Merton House, are students at University of California, Santa Barbara, and who qualify as low income by the standards set by the County of Santa Barbara receive a scholarship that is a significant reduction in their rent, making Merton House the most affordable UCSB student housing in Isla Vista. Merton House is named after Thomas Merton, an Anglo-American Catholic writer and Mystic who was an advocate of spirituality, social justice, pacifism, and interfaith understanding post-World War II.

A village that developed at the crossing of the trails or roads was usually named after one of the area's first settlers. A general store, tavern, and a few other buildings would be erected. Near these villages, the social, commercial, educational, and religious aspects of the emerging society originated and were supported. To a large extent, crossroads villages provided identity and vitality to the surrounding countryside and a sense of community in the early years of settlement.

Heales was born in London, the son of Richard Heales, an ironmonger. He was apprenticed as a coachbuilder and migrated to Victoria with his father in 1842. He worked for some years as a labourer before establishing himself as a wheelwright and coachbuilder in 1847. Thereafter he grew increasingly prosperous. He was a teetotaller and a leading temperance campaigner. The Temperance Hall in Russell Street was built largely due to his efforts. Heales was elected to the Melbourne City Council in 1850. He resigned in 1852 and returned to England, but was back in Melbourne in time for the first election held under the new Constitution of Victoria in September 1856. He stood for the seat of Melbourne in the Legislative Assembly, but was defeated. He was elected member for East Bourke at a by-election in March 1857. In October 1859, Heales won the seat of East Bourke Boroughs and held it for the rest of his life. In October 1860, Heales was a leading critic of the land bill introduced by the government of William Nicholson. When the Nicholson government was defeated in November 1860, Heales became Premier and Chief Secretary. Heales set about advocating his own land policy, but in June 1861 he was defeated on a vote of confidence. He obtained a dissolution and with strong rural support was returned with an increased majority. In November 1861, however, some of his senior supporters defected, and he resigned as Premier. Although he was an active Congregationalist, Heales was an opponent of the clause in the Victorian Constitution which provided for state funding for religion, and he favoured a unified secular education system. Both Anglicans and Catholics, on the other hand, favoured state-funded religious schools. In 1862 Heales introduced a bill creating a single Education Board to rationalise the school system, which was passed with broad support. When John O'Shanassy was defeated as Premier for the third time in June 1863, Heales was appointed the President of the Board of Land and Works, and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveys in the ministry of James McCulloch. He brought in two further land bills during this time, but both were rejected by the Legislative Council. Heales fell ill in 1864, and died in June. He is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and eight children. The town of Healesville, 52 km north-east of Melbourne, is named after him. In 1964, a Centenary of Healesville medal was commissioned and given to residents of the town. An image of Heales was on the front of the medal.

Esky is an Australian brand of portable coolers. The term \\"esky\\" is also commonly used in Australia to generically refer to portable coolers or ice boxes and is part of the Australian vernacular, in place of words like \\"cooler\\" or \\"cooler box\\" and the New Zealand \\"chilly bin\\". The term derives from the word Eskimo. History The Esky was created by Malley's, a Sydney refrigeration business. Some historians have credited Malley's with the invention of the portable ice cooler. According to the company, the Esky was \\"recognised as the first official portable cooler in the world.\\" The company's own figures claim that by 1960, 500,000 Australian households owned one (in a country of approximately 10 million). Outdoor recreation company Coleman Australia bought the Esky brand from Nylex Ltd after the company went into administration in February 2009. Esky has been producing coolers since 1952. Coleman still produces most of the Esky line in Melbourne. The sale was seen as symptomatic of the decline of Australian made goods due to cheaper imports being available. Construction The current models are constructed with two layers: polypropylene on the outer shell, with a polyurethane inner layer. This makes it lightweight and portable with excellent insulation. The Esky originally had a steel outside shell, and used cork for insulation. In the 1960s, a single layer of thick polystyrene was often used, but they were easily damaged or destroyed. The lightweight construction makes most eskies float in water, and they have been recommended by safety specialists to be used as an improvised lifebuoy, if more specialised equipment is not available. Numerous people have been saved after using either the whole esky or the esky lid as flotation devices after boating accidents. Generic use In Australia, the 'esky' name has become, or as a legal matter nearly has become, genericised: the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any cooler box, regardless of the brand. Many dictionaries, including the Australian National Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary, now include definitions in their publications defining it as such. However, the use of the Esky trademark must be approved by the brand owner to avoid any liability. Government agencies and media outlets in Australia have used the term in preference to generic alternatives. In Australian culture The esky has played a unique role in Australian culture, especially with regard to outdoor activities, camping, and sporting events, and for reasons of novelty. In particular, the design and use of the esky has evolved through its relationship with Australia's drinking culture. A feature of the first Esky model was that it was designed to carry six \\"standard\\" 1-pint bottles as well as a triple level food section. Malley's Esky was created as a tool for camping and caravanning holidays and was called the Esky Auto Box, encouraged by the post-war popularity of the private motor vehicle. The esky became an essential part of the beach, outdoor dining and barbecue culture that developed in Australia during the 60s and 70s. Though not unique to Australia, Australian media have widely reported on a number of high-profile incidents involving motorised eskies fitted with small motors and wheels. Police have impounded offending vehicles and have issued fines to those operating them on public property. Spectators at the closing ceremony at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney each received a promotional pack of a small polystyrene Esky containing other items of memorabilia. In another uniquely Australian piece of culture, poly-foam knee boards used in the surf, more especially by younger surfers learning the sport, are often referred to by the slang term, \\"Esky-lid‚Äù, or ‚Äúshark biscuit‚Äù.

Julio Victoriano Garc√≠a representing the Lenca people at a conference at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras. The Lenca are a Mesoamerican indigenous people of southwestern Honduras and eastern El Salvador in Central America. They once spoke the Lenca language, which is now nearly extinct. In Honduras, the Lenca are the largest indigenous group, with an estimated population of 100,000. El Salvador's Lenca population is estimated at about 37,000. The pre-Conquest Lenca had frequent contact with various Mayan groups as well as other indigenous peoples of the territory of present-day Mexico and Central America. The origin of Lenca populations has been a source of ongoing debate among anthropologists and historians. Research has been directed to gaining archaeological evidence of the pre-colonial Lenca. History Culture Lenca natives, photographed in 1901. Top: Typical Intibuc√° fences. Bottom: Man wearing a gourd mask for the Guancasco peace treaty annual ceremony. M. Rios first man with large hat uncovered face. Lenca culture developed for centuries preceding the Spanish conquest. Like other indigenous groups of Central America, they gradually changed their cultural relationships to the land.Carmack 2007Brady 2009Adams 1956 While there are ongoing political problems in contemporary Central America over indigenous land rights and identity, the Lenca have retained many of their pre-Columbian traditions. Although their indigenous language is nearly extinct, and their culture has changed in other ways over the centuries due to the Spanish influence, the Lenca continue to preserve some traditional ways and identify as indigenous peoples. There are programs and dictionaries to help revitalize the language and traditional Lenca culture. =Economy= Modern Lenca communities are centered on the milpa crop-growing system. Lenca men engage in agriculture, including the cultivation of coffee, cacao, tobacco, varieties of plantains, and gourds. Other principal crops are maize, wheat, beans, squash, sugarcane, and chili peppers. In El Salvador peanuts are also cultivated. Within their communities, Lenca traditionally expect all members to participate in communal efforts.UNHCR 2008Stone 1963 While there has been a growing national acceptance of indigenous rights and culture in both Honduras and El Salvador, the Lenca continue to struggle in both nations over indigenous land rights. In the mid-1990s, indigenous activists formed political groups in order to petition the government over issues of land ownership and indigenous rights. Due to the unresolved land issues and constitutional amendments in those countries that favor land ownership by large-scale investors and agro-industrialists, there has been a decreasing amount of land for indigenous peoples. Many Lenca men have had to find employment in neighboring cities. Many Lenca communities still have their communal land. They devote the majority of cultivation to commodity crops raised for export to foreign markets. Most Lenca still use traditional agricultural practices on their own crops, as well as the crops for investors. =Material culture= During the Pre-Columbian Era, Lencan pottery was very similar to that of other Mesoamerican groups, especially Mayan pottery and that of several groups from central Mexico. Today, Lencan pottery is very distinctive. Handcrafted by Lenca women, the modern traditional pottery is considered an ethnic marking of their culture, as is common among traditional peoples. Many handmade pieces are sold at very high prices in the United States and Europe. In the mid-1980s, NGO cooperatives of women artisans were created in order to market their pottery. To increase sales of their works, the cooperatives were encouraged to orient their designs and styles to meet the tastes of urban buyers and to expand their market. In the 21st century, Lenca women are making modern painted pottery (often painted black and white) not based on traditional designs in an effort to appeal to foreign buyers. Traditional Lencan pottery is still made by women in the town of Gracias, Honduras and the surrounding villages, most notably in La Campa. The pieces are usually a dark orange or brick color. Visitors can watch demonstrations of how traditional pottery is made. =Spirituality= The contemporary Lenca primarily practice Roman Catholicism, adopted, often by force, during the colonial Spanish era after the first war. As with other indigenous groups], their practices often incorporate Pre-Hispanic traditions, and some Lenca communities retain more exclusively indigenous traditions. Similarly to the beliefs of other indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, the Lenca consider sacred mountains and hills to be holy places. Many Lenca have profound respect and adoration for the sun. Their main gods were Ilanguipuca (great father), Itanipuca (great mother), and Icelacam (god of time). Some traditional practices are associated with the cultivation and harvest of crops. During different crop seasons, for instance, Lenca men participate in ceremonies where they consume chicha and burn incense. Guancasco Guancasco is the annual ceremony by which neighboring communities, usually two, gather to establish reciprocal obligations in order to confirm peace and friendship. The guancascos take many forms and have adopted many Catholic representations, but they also include traditional customs and representations. Processions and elaborate exchanges of greetings and Honduran folk dancing are performed for the statue of the patron saint of the town. Towns in central and western Honduras such as Yamaranguila, La Campa, La Paz and Tencoa, all host the annual celebration.Black 1995 Creation story In the Lenca Putum story it is said that Aku created everything. Archaeology Until recently, archaeological research and investigation of Lenca settlements had been limited. In studies of how the indigenous and colonial cultures affected each other, more attention had been given to colonial-era settlements influenced by Europeans. In addition, many indigenous sites are isolated and difficult to access. Researchers may also have difficulty conducting excavations because the sites are found in agricultural fields under cultivation. Surface evidence in rural areas reveals that pre-Columbian indigenous settlements existed in many regions. Many surface-visible earthwork mounds have been damaged from being plowed over by rural farmers. The evidence for pre-Columbian Lenca has come from research and excavation of several sites in Honduras and El Salvador. It shows that Lenca occupation was characterized by a relatively continuous pattern of growth. The Comayagua Valley is located at the highland basin linking the Pacific and Caribbean drainage systems of Honduras. The valley provides evidence for a rich setting of cross-cultural relationships and Lenca settlements. According to Boyd Dixon, research in the area has revealed a complex history spanning approximately 2500 years from the early pre-classic period to the Spanish Conquest of 1537. Prehistoric Lenca settlements were typically located along major rivers to afford access to water for drinking and washing and to waterways for transportation. The lowlands were typically fertile areas. The Lenca built relatively few and small monumental public structures, except for military fortifications. Most constructions were made of adobe rather than stone. Lenca pottery from the mid Mesoamerican Classic period. In his research of the Comayagua Valley region, Dixon finds ample evidence of cross-cultural relationships; many artifacts have been found that show that settlements were linked through ceramics. The production of Usulua Polychrome ceramics has been shown to link Lenca settlements with neighboring chiefdoms during the classic period. The Lenca sites of Yarumela and Los Naranjos in Honduras, and Quelepa in El Salvador, all contain evidence of Usulut√°n-style ceramics.Dixon 1989 Yarumela is an archaeological site in the Comayagua Valley believed to be a primary Lenca center during the middle and late formative periods. The site contained a large primary residential center several times the size of that of its neighboring settlements which were secondary centers in the region. The site was most likely chosen because of its proximity to some of the major floodplains in the valley, whose fertile soil was cultivated for agriculture. The pattern and scale of the late pre-classic settlements suggest the existence of a ranked society. All corners of the basin were located within a half-day walk of Yarumela. Other features found in the area are at the sites of Los Naranjos and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, each dominated by a single constructed earthen mound. Many other sites appear to share site-planning principles and structural forms with these examples, having large, open, flat plazas, leveled by manual grading, and dominated by a massive two- to three- tiered pyramidal earthwork mound.McFarlane 2007 Spanish conquest: Quelepa is a major site in eastern El Salvador. Its pottery shows strong similarities to ceramics found in central western El Salvador and the Maya highlands. Archaeologists speculate that Quelepa was settled by Lenca speakers from Honduras. Population pressure may have prompted their migrations to new territory.Healy 1984 Since the late 20th century, scholars have focused on researching and exploring settlement patterns of the Lenca in order to better understand the chronology of settlement during the pre-Columbian era.Black 1995; Sheets 1984 Tourism Lenca heritage tourism is expanding. It has brought attention to indigenous Lenca traditions and culture, especially in Honduras. The Honduran Tourism Institute, along with the United Nations Development Program, has developed a cultural heritage project dedicated to the Lenca and their culture called La Ruta Lenca. This tourist route passes through a series of rural towns in southwestern Honduras within traditional Lenca territory. The route has designated stops in the departments of Intibuca, La Paz, Lempira, and adjacent valleys. Stops include La Campa, where traditional Lenca pottery is handcrafted by a cooperative; the archaeological sites of Los Naranjos and Yarumela; the town of Gracias, and other towns with Lenca heritage. La Ruta Lenca was designed to attract tourism to Lenca communities and to encourage preservation of remaining indigenous cultural practices by increasing the economic return for artisans and providing new markets. The project has had some successes.McFarlane and Stockett 2007Lonely Planet 2007 Environmental activism Members of the Lenca community have taken larger national roles since the late 20th century, primarily in the areas of human and land rights for the indigenous peoples, which are seen as inextricably linked. They have also been active in a variety of environmental issues, particularly in trying to protect their territories against major development projects that would alter their lands and ecology. The risk of speaking out has been great; indigenous people opposing such major developments have been murdered. Berta C√°ceres was an important leader of the Lenca and founder of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH). C√°ceres strongly protested the development of the DESA Agua Zarca Hydro Project and dam on the Gualcarque River in Honduras. C√°ceres won the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize for her work with the Lenca and her leadership in environmental movements. She was discovered murdered at her home on 3 March 2016.Nuwer 2016;Bosshard 2016Rick Kearns, \\"Murdered While She Slept: Shocking Death of Berta C√°ceres, Indigenous Leader and Activist\\", Indian Country Media, 3 March 2016; accessed 8 July 2017 In a news report published on June 21, a former soldier of Honduras‚Äô Inter-Institutional Security Force (known as Fusina) alleged that C√°ceres‚Äô name, along with the names of other environmentalists in Honduras, had appeared on a military hit list.Rick Kearns, \\"Bertha C√°ceres Among Those on Honduran Military Hit List\\", Indian Country Today, 27 June 2016; accessed 8 July 2017 A few weeks after her murder, major international investors the Netherlands Development Finance Co. (FMO) and FinnFund announced that they would suspend funding for the Agua Zarca project.Rick Kearns, \\"A Win in Honor of Berta Carceres? Investors Pull Funding from Controversial Project\\", Indian Country Media, 6 July 2017; accessed 8 July 2017 On July 8, Secretary of Security Julian Pacheco said that the government had failed to provide adequate protection for C√°ceres, who had received death threats previously. Lesiba Yaneth was another Lenca activist who opposed the Aurora hydroelectric project which was planned in the municipality of San Jos√©, La Paz. This project was very important to the government; \\"the vice-president of the National Congress, Gladys Aurora Lopez,\\" was reported as having \\"direct ties\\" to it.Rick Kearns, \\"Another Activist Killed in Honduras, Ties to Slain Bertha C√°ceres\\", Indian Country Today, 14 July 2016; 8 July 2017 Yaneth's body was found on 7 July 2016; she had been murdered the previous day in the Matamulas sector of Marcala. Police initially claimed that Yaneth was killed during the robbery of her professional bike. Because she was active in COPINH, however, fellow members and supporters believe that she was assassinated because of her political work. United Nations and European Union officials protested her death. Three suspects were arrested within a week of the Yaneth murder.. Numerous other women activists have also been murdered in Honduras.

His family lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when he was still very young, but was evacuated two years after Mobutu Sese Seko's coup d'√©tat. He studied at Bedales School in Hampshire, England. In 1980 he began his studies in Engineering Manufacture and Management at Manchester University, where he met student Richard Turner who invited him to write text adventures for Artic Computing. After completing his degree in 1985 he decided to continue his career in game development and became director of Artic. The following year he established Paragon Programming, a game development company working with British publisher U.S. Gold. In 1987 he moved into publishing as a software development manager for U.S. Gold. A year later he was approached by Activision and was offered the position of manager of their European development studio. In 1990, Cecil founded Revolution along with Tony Warriner, David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. Originally located in Hull, the company moved to York in 1994. Cecil then became Revolution's managing director and focused on writing and design. For the company's first title, Lure of the Temptress (1992), Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, that was designed by Tony Warriner. Cecil's interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments became manifest in Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and the games that followed. Broken Sword 1 was a 2D point-and-click game, but by the end of the nineties Cecil took the company to 3D games with direct control, including Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003). In 2004 with no project at hand, he, as head of the company, let everyone go. Nevertheless, he continued to design by implementing the so-called \\"Hollywood model\\", in which each time a team is assembled to create a movie. For the fourth Broken Sword game, Broken Sword: The Angel of Death, he decided to work with Sumo Digital. By the end of the decade new developments made it possible to renew the back catalogue of Revolution, and in 2011 Develop ranked Revolution Software among the top 50 most successful development studios in the world. Lure of the Temptress was followed by a string of critically and commercially successful adventure games, including Beneath a Steel Sky, the Broken Sword series, In Cold Blood and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado. Beneath a Steel Sky and the Broken Sword series are often referred to as one of the best adventures of all time, appearing on numerous \\"top\\" adventure game lists and receiving several awards and nominations. Sales of Broken Sword 1 and 2 have made over US$100 million and have sold over 3 million copies worldwide. New versions were downloaded by over 4 million people in 2011. Cecil worked on various adventure games outside Revolution, including The Da Vinci Code and Doctor Who: The Adventure Games. Cecil is currently operating as managing director of Revolution. He co-founded Game Republic in 2003 and has been a director on the board. He is a member of the advisory committee for the renewed Game Republic, and has been on the advisory panel of the Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival. He is member of the advisory panel of the Evolve and Develop Conference, a board member of Screen Yorkshire, and a member of Skillset's Computer Games Skills Council. He regularly talks at events and to mainstream press about creative and commercial aspects of the gaming industry. In 2006, he was awarded the status of \\"Development Legend\\" by Develop. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the video game industry. Biography =Early career= As a baby, Charles lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where his father David was sent by Unilever to reconstruct their accounting systems. When Cecil was two and his mother Veronica was about to give birth to his sister, they were evacuated after Mobutu Sese Seko's coup d'√©tat. His taste for adventure may have started in those days, and the Congo would become a background in one of his games. Cecil was then educated at Bedales School in Hampshire, England. In 1980 he began his studies in mechanical engineering at Manchester University. On a course sponsored by Ford he met student Richard Turner, who invited him to write some text adventure games for his new computer game company, Artic Computing. He decided to take up on the invitation, for like all students, he needed beer money. In those days, game development was the true period of being the auteur of a game, of bedroom coders, of direct contact with the customers, a relation that was lost when big game publishers took over. Cecil's first game became \\"Adventure B\\" (aka Inca Curse, published in 1981). It was followed by \\"Adventure C\\" (aka Ship of Doom, published in 1982) and \\"Adventure D\\" (aka Espionage Island, published in 1982). Each were highly successful on the Sinclair ZX81, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad formats. After completing his degree in 1985, Cecil decided to continue his career in game development and became director of Artic Computing. When Artic closed down, he established Paragon Programming (1986), a game development company working with major British publisher U.S. Gold. In 1987 he left development and moved into publishing as Software Development Manager for U.S. Gold. One year later he was approached by Activision and was offered the position of manager of their European development studio. Noirin Carmody, who would become his wife, was general manager at Activision, where she was responsible for establishing the Sierra name in Europe. =Managing director of Revolution Software= In 1989, when Cecil was still working at Activison, he decided to set up his own development studio. He contacted Tony Warriner, who had worked with him at Artic Computing and Paragon Programming, and Warriner brought in a fellow programmer, David Sykes. Together with Noirin Carmody, his then-partner and General Manager at Activision UK, they founded Revolution Software (March 1990). The company was originally located in Hull, but moved to York in 1994. Besides becoming Revolution's managing director, Cecil would focus from the start on writing and design. At that time the graphic adventure genre was dominated by LucasArts and Sierra On-Line, and they wanted to create something in between, an adventure game that didn't take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story. For Revolution's first title, Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, and the engine itself was designed by Tony Warriner. The result was Lure of the Temptress (1992), and though it was their first product, it became one of the successful games that would follow. For the second title, Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), often referred to as a cult classic, Cecil contacted comic book artist Dave Gibbons. He had met Gibbons when he was still at Activision, and he admired Gibbons's work on Watchmen. Gibbons became involved in the design of the game, and their collaboration would inspire Cecil's next move. The divergence of and distinction between film and video games is one of Cecil's pet subjects, and his interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments would become manifest in Revolution's upcoming titles. He started to hire external talent from the TV and film trades for the big-budget production Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (1996). Already in the next year the sequel, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror, was released. By the end of the nineties, when the adventure market changed, he had to change course as well. Instead of the previous games, that were point-and-click adventures, he chose to move to 3D and direct control with In Cold Blood (2000), a narrative driven adventure game with action elements. At the same time a second title, Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado (2000), was developed after DreamWorks's film The Road to El Dorado. As Broken Sword was originally intended to be a trilogy, a third episode was planned. Unlike In Cold Blood, that combined 3D characters with pre-rendered graphics, the third Broken Sword game, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003), became a real-time 3D adventure game, with mild action elements (such as using stealth, climbing, shimmying, and pushing objects). Initially, when he announced that Broken Sword 3 was going to be a 3D game, it caused an outcry by the fans of the series. Cecil had had no choice to adopt 3D though, for when they needed funding in the beginning of 2000, publishers had become obsessed with the idea that everything was going to be 3D. But he had always been keen to move to 3D, as it allowed more special effects and would make the game world more alive. In the same year, he decided to release Beneath a Steel Sky (and Lure of the Temptress) as freeware and the source code was given to ScummVM. The result was that millions of people played the game for free in a very wide range of devices. It would foreshadow Revolution's bright future. He could have said that as a marketing genius he planned it, but as he stated a few years later, that would have been a dreadful lie. However, some hard years were ahead for the company. Over the years it had grown into about 40 people, but the year after Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon one of Revolution's projects was cancelled, and he had no other option than let everyone go. In May 2004 Cecil announced that Revolution would go \\"back to basics,\\" which meant that Revolution, that had set itself up as both designer and producer of video games, would focus more closely on design. As he stated in various presentations, the situation was caused by the fact that big publishing companies had been controlling for years the supply and demand side of the game market, and little was left for independent developers. Though publishers made tens of millions on the games, Revolution was losing money on every title they produced. In the new situation, he implemented the so-called Hollywood model, in which a producer and director come together and assemble a team to create a movie. For the fourth Broken Sword game, Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (2006), he decided to work with Sumo Digital. They took a number of the former Revolution staff and concentrated on production, while Cecil concentrated on design, story and game play. Because Revolution had received a lot of feedback on the decision to abandon point-and-click, the player was allowed to choose between point-and-click and direct control. At the end of the decade things changed by innovations such as broadband, new platforms and digital portals. In the new situation game publishers and other middle-men were no longer needed. Revolution could now start to self-publish and the relation with the audience, a relation that Cecil had always valued, could be restored. In March 2009 Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars ‚Äì The Director's Cut was published by Ubisoft for the Wii and DS that included new material. In July 2009 Revolution announced on their website a new division, called Revolution Pocket, together with the first title of the new division, Beneath a Steel Sky ‚Äì Remastered. In the announcement Cecil stated that the digital revolution had changed the game for developers, and that more titles would follow. He had been contacted by Apple to see if he would consider to bring Revolution's classic titles to the App Store, and Cecil on his turn had contacted Dave Gibbons to work on new editions of Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars ‚Äì The Director's Cut and Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror ‚Äì Remastered (2010). The release of the first Broken Sword game was celebrated at the Apple Store in London in February 2010. According to Cecil the digital revolution, and in particular the App Store, saved Revolution. As was announced on Revolution's site in December 2011, the dramatic change enabled Revolution to self-fund their next game. Develop, that ranks development studios based on Metacritic data and chart success, ranked Revolution Software in 2011 among the top 50 most successful development studios in the world. On 23 August 2012 Revolution revealed that they were working on a new Broken Sword game entitled Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse and they launched a Kickstarter campaign. Though Cecil was approached by a huge publisher to publish a Broken Sword game, Kickstarter was preferred, because they would be able to control development, finances, and marketing. The project was successfully funded within two weeks. =Other activities and events= Cecil has worked on various games outside Revolution. He was a consultant for The Collective's The Da Vinci Code (2006). Disney approached him to design a game on A Christmas Carol (Disney's A Christmas Carol, Disney Interactive Studios/Sumo Digital, 2009), and he became the voice of the narrator. A decade earlier he had already been executive producer of Disney's Story Studio: Disney's Mulan, a co-production between Kids Revolution and Disney Interactive (NewKidCo, 1999). He also became executive producer of the BBC/Sumo Digital's episodic adventure game Doctor Who: The Adventure Games (2010). The fifth episode (The Gunpowder Plot) won the British Academy Cymru Award 2012. Cecil regularly talks at events and to the press about creative and commercial aspects of the video games industry, and is an ambassador for the Yorkshire and UK games industry in general and of course Revolution in particular. He also teaches, gives masterclasses, acts as judge on game proposals and mentors young game designers. Cecil was a founder of Yorkshire games network Game Republic in 2003, and has been a director on the board. He is a member of the advisory committee for the renewed Game Republic. He has been a member of the steering group and member on the advisory board of Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival, and is on the advisory panel of the Evolve and Develop Conferences. He is also board member of Screen Yorkshire, member of Skillset's Computer Games Skills Council, and member of the BFI Board of Governors. In 2006 Cecil was awarded the status of Development Legend by Develop, Europe's leading development magazine. In 2010 Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, asked Cecil (together with Ian Livingstone) to be part of an independent review to assess which university courses best prepare graduates with the skills to succeed in the games industry. Cecil was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the computer games industry. =Revolution's game catalogue= Revolution Software quickly established itself as Europe's leading adventure game developer with a string of titles, which have been critically and commercially successful. Clients included Sony Computer Entertainment, Disney, DreamWorks, Virgin Interactive, Sierra Entertainment (Vivendi), Ubisoft, and THQ. Their first two titles, Lure of the Temptress (published in 1992) and Beneath a Steel Sky (published in 1994) went straight to number one in the GALLUP charts in the UK and topped the charts across most of Europe. Revolution's next title, Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars (published in 1996) and its sequel Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror (published in 1997) both, in turn, received numerous awards such as best adventure game of the year as well as the best adventure game to date. Sales of Broken Sword 1 and 2 have made over US$100 million and have sold over three million copies worldwide. Revolution's next game In Cold Blood, published in 2000 by Sony Computer Entertainment, focused on telling stories through action based gameplay and was met with mixed reviews, though it sold very well. Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado, based on the DreamWorks film The Road to El Dorado, was released in late 2000. In 2002 Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars was also published on the Game Boy Advance and in 2006 the game was also published for the Palm OS and Pocket PC. The third game in the Broken Sword series, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, was released in November 2003 for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game sold the same as the previous Broken Sword games and was nominated for 3 BAFTA awards and Best Writing at the Game Developers Conference in 2004. The fourth game, Broken Sword : The Angel of Death was released on PC in September 2006. In 2009 Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars ‚Äì The Director‚Äôs Cut was released for the Wii and DS, followed by Beneath a Steel Sky ‚Äì Remastered for the iPhone. The \\"Director's Cut\\" was also released for iOS, Mac, PC (2010), and Android (2012). The game was nominated in the category Story at the British Academy Video Games Awards in 2010. Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror ‚Äì Remastered was released in 2010 (iOS, Mac, PC). In 2011 the two Broken Sword games were downloaded by over 4 million people. =Personal life= Charles Cecil and Noirin Carmody have two children, Ciara and David, who are credited in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon and the new editions of Beneath a Steel Sky and Broken Sword. They all love games, and as his wife works with him as well, family life and work life are completely intertwined. Even their holidays are connected to game design, as they visit places that could feature in a game. Cecil loves history and physics-based science, but also enjoys physical activity, like rowing, competing in regattas, football, and tennis. =Quotes on development= Cecil believes that game design involves a different creative process as compared to traditional writing. As a writer of a linear story, \\"all they do is to write the script,\\" he said. \\"In game design, the writer should think about the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium is no excuse for a poorly constructed story, the big thing is that we have a different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories. And that‚Äôs why so many games have bad stories.\\" Cecil is also very serious when doing this research to develop games that have strong ties to historic locales and myths, \\"I take the historical research and research of our locations very seriously and will generally visit the locations to undertake recces. Of course this is almost always a pleasure ‚Äì the games aim to feature locations that are exciting and interesting.\\" In the same interview he stated that the name Broken Sword may have been chosen because it is a symbol of peace. He also added that it might have been a fate of history that this name was chosen: \\"I live in the city of York in England and a few years ago a statue of Constantine the Great was erected next to the cathedral to commemorate his coronation in the city in 306AD. The statue depicts Constantine sitting atop a broken sword; it seemed a fun coincidence, or perhaps it is down to fate.\\" References External links Revolution Software (Mobile version website) * Charles Cecil at MobyGames * Game Nostalgia Charles Cecil biography * 1962 births British video game designers Living people Members of the Order of the British Empire People educated at Bedales School People from York Video game directors Video game writers ","title":"Charles Cecil"},{"id":"1848258","text":"John W.

The dam was the twelfth engineered dam built since Roman times 100BC, the first in Australia, and the second arch built universally that involved calculations for its construction. Water from this dam was not reticulated until 1881 when it was required to augment the then dwindling water supply. The dam wall is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register in recognition of its significance relating to dam technology in Australia arch dams worldwide; and has an indicative listing on the Register of the National Estate. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 March 2012. On 5 December 2012 the Governor proclaimed Lake Parramatta Reserve as a 'Wildlife Refuge‚Äô under Section 68 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. The proclamation was in recognition of the diversity of wildlife and threatened species which occur in the reserve. Swimming in Lake Parramatta was permitted between 1920 and 1940; and after a prolonged period of closure due to poor water quality, was reopened to the public in 2015. Entry to the reserve is from Lackey Street, . History =Indigenous use= The traditional custodians of the land surrounding Lake Parramatta are the Burramatagal and Bidjigal clans of the Darug people, an Aboriginal kinship group of Indigenous Australians. There is evidence of Aboriginal occupation within the boundaries of Lake Parramatta Reserve in the form of remnant shelters, hand stencils, flaking scars and deposits. It is possible that other sites were inundated with the construction of the dam in the 1850s. The area was important to Aboriginal people because of the abundant fresh water and diverse range of food types. Records from 1804 exist of the Reserve's use as a pleasure ground, specifically around Hunts Creek. =Dam= From 1788 to 1909, Parramatta depended on the Parramatta River for its water supply. The history of public supply began in 1815 when a well was sunk for public use. In 1818 Governor Macquarie ordered a dam to be built across the Parramatta River. It was called the Town Dam and held about 30 million gallons of water (136 kL) which was delivered to houses and factories by privately operated water carts. This dam still stands near Lennox Bridge and retains the pond through Parramatta Park. A second dam was built near the present Cumberland Hospital in 1831. Pollution and recurrent shortages led to agitation for a larger and purer supply. By 1847 the population had increased to 4500, and the government was asked to provide the district with a \\"full supply of pure and wholesome water\\". Unfortunately, due to other more pressing demands, the government was unable to comply. Agitation continued and two factions developed: one advocating a dam on Toongabbie Creek, the other favouring Hunts Creek. In 1849 a large public meeting of citizens petitioned the Governor for a grant of pounds sterling 3000 ($6000) to provide a wholesome water supply. A few weeks later the Legislative Council granted pounds sterling 1000 ($2000) to the citizens of Parramatta who were expected to find the other pounds sterling 2000 ($4000). The Government grant was later increased to pounds sterling 3000 ($6000). A Committee of Water Commissioners (the Water Committee) comprising selected Parramatta citizens was appointed by the Governor to carry out the work. The debate over the site continued until the Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell recommended the selection of Hunts Creek. Plans and specifications were prepared and in May 1851 the Water Committee approved the construction of a \\"circular\\" (arch) dam. The tender of Mr John Stewart for this work was accepted but, after starting work, he withdrew from the contract, citing undue interference by the Water Committee. A second contractor failed and a third also withdrew from the task. The Water Committee reverted to the Toongabbie Scheme, and then resigned. A new Water Committee changed back to Hunts Creek and had plans prepared by Captain Percy Simpson who was also appointed Engineer of Works. Later supervision of the work was handed over to Edward Orpen Moriarty, a civil engineer in private practice. In November 1853, the tender of W. Randle was accepted. Before dam construction could begin, it was necessary to cut and shape stones from the quarry and to excavate steps in the abutments to receive each course of masonry. By June 1855, sufficient work had been done for the first stone to be ceremoniously laid in the dam wall. This was done by James Pye. He was a member of both Water Committees and his support for the Hunts Creek Scheme had never wavered. The contractor employed about 150 men and worked them on day and night shifts. By August 1855 the available funds had been expended and work was suspended. When more money was allocated the next year, work resumed and the dam was completed in September 1856, at a cost of about pounds sterling 17 000 ($34,000). The cylindrical arch dam had a vertical water face with a radius of 240 ft (73m). The wall was 41 ft (12.5m) high, 15 ft (4.5m) thick at the base and 8 ft (2.4m) thick at the crest, with an 0.3m high parapet. It was constructed of solid sandstone quarried from the creek. Each block was carefully dressed to accurate dimensions and laid in courses 0.6m high. The dam wall extended about 4m into the abutments on each bank. At Moriarty's suggestion the stones were bonded together with cement mortar to ensure watertightness. Two different cements were imported from England. Roman cement was used where the joints were in contact with the water, and Portland cement elsewhere. For the next 25 years the dam was only used to replenish the Town Dam and as a bathing pool for boys. Plans to reticulate water to the town awaited the granting of appropriate powers to the local authority and the funding of a pump house, filter beds and pipes. This process was not completed until 1881. By the mid-1890s the population of Parramatta had grown to 13 000, and a succession of drought years emptied the reservoir on several occasions. Increased storage became a necessity, and in 1898 C. W. Darley recommended the raising of the wall by 6 ft (2 m). The height was actually increased by 11 feet (3.3 m) in the form of a concrete arch founded on the stonework. The original spillway was a channel excavated at the northern abutment of the dam. This spillway was closed when the dam was raised, and provision was made for floods to pass over the raised dam crest, that incorporated a syphon spillway for low flows. In 1909 the supply was discontinued when Parramatta was connected to the Sydney water system. During the 1920s and 1930s, the reserve served as a popular picnic and bathing spot, that even required its own life saving club. The Hunts Creek water reserve was later vested in Parramatta Council as a public recreation area and is known as the Lake Parramatta Reserve.Heinrichs, 1998 During the 1960s there were a number of drowning in the lake - because the water was very warm and muddy at the surface and very cold underneath - causing cramps - in a time when the average person did not swim so well.Barbara Hickson, pers.comm., 27 March 2012  Description  The dam is located on Hunts Creek, within Lake Parramatta Reserve, 1.5 km north of the centre of the City of Parramatta. Lake Parramatta Dam is a cylindrical masonry arch dam with a vertical water face that has a radius of 240 ft (73m). The original (1856) wall was 41 ft (12.5m) high, 15 ft (4.5m) thick at the base and 8 ft (2.4m) thick at the crest, with a 0.3m high parapet. It was constructed of solid sandstone quarried from the creek. Each block was carefully dressed to accurate dimensions and laid in courses 0.6m high. The dam wall extended about 4m into the abutments on each bank. The stone blocks were bonded together with cement mortar to ensure water-tightness. Two different cements were imported from England. Roman cement was used where the joints were in contact with the water and Portland cement elsewhere. The original spillway was a channel excavated at the northern abutment of the dam. This spillway was closed when the dam was raised, and provision was made for floods to pass over the raised dam crest that incorporated a syphon spillway for low flows. Considering its age, the condition of Lake Parramatta Dam is very good. The original sandstone masonry blocks are in excellent condition with no significant signs of weathering or spalling. Likewise the condition of the mortar is also very good with only minor leakage emanating in various locations. The integrity of the dam is high; it retains water and is safe. Geography The reserve comprises of bush and parkland that is located within of the Parramatta central business district. The main watercourse entering the reserve, Hunts Creek, is a tributary of the Parramatta River. The reserve's boundaries to the west are cut off by suburban development along North Rocks Road, to the north by Hunts Creek, to the east by the private bushland and playing fields of The King's School, and to the south by James Ruse Drive. Geologically, Lake Parramatta is located on the margins of Wianamatta shale and Hawkesbury sandstone formations, with a resulting variation in vegetation communities. Vegetation communities present at the site include sandstone blue-gum forests, iron bark, Cumberland Plain Woodland vegetation communities and some coastal species such as Banksia serrata. Recreational use The swimming area within the lake. When the water supply became insufficient for the growing demands, in 1909 Lake Parramatta was entrusted with its surrounds to the City of Parramatta as a recreational area. Between 1920 and 1940, the lake was a popular swimming hole with at one point the largest inland freshwater lifesaving club in Australia. By the late 1980s, the lack of consistently good water quality led to \\"No Swimming\\" signs being erected. In 2006, the City of Parramtta reopened Lake Parramatta to limited swimming. After investigating different options the Council decided to allow swimming only on special event days. The first of these, called the Freshwater Festival, was held on 3 December 2006 featuring competitive swimming races from 10am till 12pm and public swimming from 1pm till 3pm, supervised by the Royal Life Saving Society Australia. On Saturday 24 January 2015, Lake Parramatta officially became a designated swimming spot, with an area marked out with buoys for swimming and lifeguards present between 9am and 5pm on weekends and public holidays in the warm season. The reserve surrounding the swimming area includes recreational walking tracks within the scenic bushland, barbecue areas, children's playgrounds and a restaurant. Furthermore, visitors can also hire boats to explore the natural habitat. Access Road access to Lake Parramatta is by a convoluted journey down a number of innocuous suburban streets that means the lake is a feature unknown and elusive to a great many Sydneysiders ‚Äì tucked away as it is. Visitors would take Bourke Street off Church Street, Parramatta. Then onto Lacey Street then Illawong Drive, passing under James Ruse Drive. Illawong Drive passes into the reserve and follows the eastern edge of the lake. When travelling by bus from the Parramatta Bus Interchange, the Hillsbus route 609 is an option. Sydney Trains nearest station is at Parramatta.  Heritage listing  Lake Parramatta Dam was the first large dam built in Australia. It was \\"completed in 1856, practically simultaneously with and probably independently of the modern arch dams in Europe\\".(Dam Technology in Australia 1850-1999, ANCOLD) As such the dam has an important place in the history of both dam technology in Australia and in the design of arch dams in the world. In detail: * It is the first large dam built in Australia. * It is the only ashlar masonry arch dam in Australia (B Cole). * It is believed to be:  the eleventh earliest single arch dam constructed in the world since antiquity;  the only masonry dam in the world to combine the use of Roman and Portland cements in the one structure. * It has a very slender cross section when compared with structures of similar age. * It was the storage for one of the earliest suburban water projects in Australia and remained in service for sixty years. * Its design and construction involved three of the most significant public works operatives of the time: Captain Percy Simpson, who was initially appointed engineer for the works and is believed to be the designer; Edward Orpen Moriarty, the supervising engineer for construction; and W. Randle, the contractor. * \\"A dominant feature of the dam is its modest volume of 3,000m3 of masonry, resulting from the fact that the base is only 4.6m thick. Had it been a gravity type, it would have been about twice as thick at the base with a consequent doubling of the material required\\"(Dam Technology in Australia 1850-1999, ANCOLD). * The design of the dam is thought to have been a precursor to the use of the \\"cylinder\\" formula used by C. W. Darley in his design of thirteen thin arch dams constructed between 1896 and 1908 which aroused international attention. * The raising of the dam's height in 1898 by C. W. Darley was part of the earliest arch dam construction programs in the world, and attracted appropriate international attention. * The raising of the dam 3.3 m by the addition of a concrete ring was achieved without diminishing the integrity of the original structure. * The quality of the dam's design, construction and raising is demonstrated by it remaining in excellent condition and being able to withstand Probable Maximum Flood conditions. * The dam remains the focus of an important social and recreational facility for Parramatta and surrounding district. Lake Parramatta was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 March 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Lake Parramatta Dam is associated with four persons of state significance in the mid to late nineteenth century colony of NSW: Captain Percy Simpson, Edward Orpen Moriarty, Cecil West Darley and William Randle (Randall). ;Captain Percy Simpson (1789-1877), surveyor, engineer and administrator. Simpson was initially appointed engineer for the dam works and is believed to be the designer. As a free migrant to NSW in 1822, Simpson gained experience managing convicts as the commandant of the convict agricultural settlement at Wellington (1823). In 1828 he was appointed as an assistant surveyor of roads and bridges and from 1828-32 he supervised the construction of the Devine's Hill section of the technically challenging Great North Road at Wisemans Ferry where he developed his skills in the use of ashlar retaining walls. This section of the Great North Road is testament to Simpson's engineering skills and his supervision of convict labour (some working in irons) to a very high standard of construction. Simpson's ability to manage convict labour and his administrative and engineering skills were recognised by successive governors. Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell knew of \\"no other officer in the Colony to whom I could with better expectation as to the results, intrust any work connected with the formation of roads, bridges and streets.\\".Johnson, ADB, 2005 The challenging road from Lapstone Hill to Mitchell's Pass in the Blue Mountains, bridges at Wollombi, Lansdowne and Duck Creek and the Queens Wharf at Sydney Cove are all attributed to Simpson. Following colonial administrative positions in the 1830s, Simpson returned to Ireland in the 1840s to work on railways. He returned to Sydney in 1850 as a civil engineer and was involved in the radical new design and construction of Lake Parramatta Dam. He remained in Parramatta in the 1850s and 1860s serving as a district registrar.Johnson, ADB, 2005, Supp Vol, pp 362-3 ;Edward Orpen Moriarty (1824-1896), consulting engineer and surveyor About 1849 Moriarty commenced private practice in Sydney as a civil engineer, carrying out various schemes including the development of coal mines at Wollongong; design of the first Pyrmont bridge across Darling Harbour, timber bridges over the Murrumbidgee at Wagga Wagga and the Nepean at Richmond, and supervision of Lake Parramatta Dam. In the latter capacity he may have modified the dam design and recommended the use of specific mortars in the joints between the stones. In October 1858 he was appointed Engineer-in-Chief for Harbours and River Navigation in the Public Works Department which he directed until he retired in December 1888. During that time he carried out many important harbour and hydraulic works including the initial development of the Port of Newcastle. Other works included construction and excavation of breakwaters, basins and docks at Wollongong and Kiama; improvements at the mouth of the Clarence and Richmond Rivers; a harbour of refuge at Trial Bay; extensive wharfage in Sydney harbour, and enlargement of the Sutherland Dock at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Moriarty was also significantly involved in devising the Upper Nepean Scheme for Sydney. ;Cecil West Darley (1842-1928) Cecil Darley became Principal Assistant Engineer Harbours & Rivers of the Public Works Department in 1881, under Moriarty. Under him \\"many of the water supply works in the Colony were constructed\\". Darley succeeded Moriarty as Engineer-in-Chief Harbours & Rivers in 1889 and became Chief Engineer PWD in 1896. In 1898 Moriarty recommended a raising of Lake Parramatta Dam. He is renowned for the thirteen thin arch dams built to his direction around the beginning of the 20th century and described by Wade.Who Was Who, 1916-1928 ;William Randle (Randall) William Randle was responsible for construction of the first steam railway in Australia (in Melbourne) and for building Fort Denison (sandstone masonry) in Sydney Harbour. He built the first railway in NSW from Sydney to Parramatta where he achieved outstanding progress using \\"modern methods\\" of shifting spoil in wagons on rails. His superior and innovative construction skills were again demonstrated in constructing Lake Parramatta Dam. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lake Parramatta Dam has state significance for its technical innovation and achievement because: * It was one of the first arch dams ever built (the first in Australia, the 11th in the world). * It was a very economical dam, requiring the minimum quantities of material, all available locally except the cements. * While there is no conclusive evidence that the design had a theoretical basis, the fact that Percy Simpson, the first known person involved in the dam's design was also involved in the construction of high masonry walls on the Great North Road, leads to the belief that a certain degree of innovation and adaptation was involved in translating the design across to dams. * The mortar used for jointing the masonry blocks is an especially innovative feature of the dam. Chestnut (1982) reports that \\"manufactured Roman Cement (rather than burnt lime or gypsum) is the main cementing component in the mortar. This material forms a strong and dense product and probably explains the lack of leaching in the (permeable) in-service environment.....\\" The use of Roman Cement is confirmed by Moriarty: \\"All the masonry ... in the wall is set in Roman Cement, the stones having been carefully dressed to templates......\\". A contemporary report in the Empire newspaper states \\"That portion of the work which is subject to the continual action of water has been set in Roman cement, and the remaining portion in Portland cement\\". From H.J. Cowan's paper on the history of concrete, it appears \\"Roman Cement\\" dates from the production of this material in England by James Parker in 1796 from clays containing veins of calcareous matter, while Portland Cement was first produced by Joseph Aspdin in 1811 from separately occurring deposits of limestone and clay. It is believed that this is the first dam to incorporate Portland and manufactured Roman Cement in its construction. * Another innovative aspect was Randle's method of handling and placing the masonry blocks in the dam. A description is given in the report of 8 June 1855 on the laying of the foundation stone, and is quoted below. > \\"The commencement already made, consists in the formation of a timber frame > over the entire site of the dam, running at the height of thirty three feet; > along this a travelling-jenny travels, and the operations of raising the > blocks and lowering them in their destination are performed with the utmost > precision. A weight of twenty tons may be moved by this machinery, but the > power applied in the present work will probably range between two and six > tons. The labour is now directed to the excavation of the sides of the > ravine to form footings and abutments for the dam wall, and also to > preparing and laying the courses. The circumstances of the water being at > its lowest ebb is very propitious to the operations....\\" Associated with > this was a rail line to transport the masonry blocks from the quarry to the > gantry at the dam. * The raising of the dam in 1898 using a concrete arch on its crest, was part of a program of thin arch dam construction in NSW by the Public Works Department which attracted international attention because of its reliance on the cylinder formula. * The high quality of the design and construction is demonstrated by its ability to meet modern safety standards after 140 years of service. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Institution of Engineers has declared Lake Parramatta Dam a National Engineering Landmark. The completion of Lake Parramatta Dam in 1856 was an important event for those living in the Parramatta district. The previous water source, the Town Dam on the Parramatta River, was polluted, unreliable and unhygienic, whereas the new source supplied pure and wholesome water, and its storage enabled the supply to continue through the drought years. The breakthrough came when the citizens finally persuaded the government to fund the cost. Twenty-five years later a pump house and reticulation system brought the water from the dam to the streets of Parramatta. The dam is now a central feature of Lake Parramatta Reserve park which is visited regularly by tourists and picnickers. The birdlife (mainly waterfowl) and native fauna around the dam and fish in the lake are pleasant distractions from the otherwise drab suburbia of western Sydney. A nature trail follows the perimeter of part of the storage. The Reserve forms an attractive recreation area in the Parramatta district. The amenities include a small beach, barbecues, picnic areas, car parking facilities, a kiosk, and children's playgrounds. The most popular activity is bushwalking, and there is also an orienteering track within the Reserve. Following on representations made by the Wild Life Preservation Society of Australia, the Parramatta Council in 1958 adopted the bushland area and the maintenance and development of the recreation area as one of its objectives. The Council also applied to the Fauna Protection Panel to have the area proclaimed a Complete Sanctuary and it became the first wildlife refuge in the Sydney area. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lake Parramatta Dam is a rarity. It is the only masonry arch dam in Australia. It was the first large dam, one year ahead of Melbourne's Yan Yean Dam. (Strictly speaking, large dams are over 15m high above lowest foundation level, which Lake Parramatta Dam became in 1898, after a 3.3m raising). It was the first arch dam and 40 years passed before the next arch dam was built (Lithgow Dam, 1896). While Lake Parramatta Dam is the only masonry arch dam in Australia, it is a cylindrical arch dam of which many more were built, but in concrete and several decades later (13 in NSW and one in SA). Consequently, Lake Parramatta Dam cannot be compared with any similar dams in Australia. As such it set a valuable design precedent. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The dam is a fine example of its type. Its thin section and appropriate curvature provided Parramatta with an economical dam. The original stone work is clearly visible from the downstream side and remains in good condition. The dam demonstrates the application of the stonemason's craft to a water-retaining structure of some magnitude. The choice of Roman cement mortar bonding between the stones has proved to be an inspired choice, having withstood 140 years of use with a minimum of leakage or deterioration. The essential character of the dam was retained when the raising was carried out in 1898. Although concrete was the chosen material, it was sympathetically applied. The arch form was maintained, the stones courses were simulated and the original stonework remained in full view, reminiscent of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbour. Considering its age, the condition of Lake Parramatta Dam is very good. The integrity of the original sandstone masonry blocks is excellent, with no significant signs of weathering or spalling. Likewise the condition of the mortar is also very good with only minor leakage emanating in various locations.

It featured a cast of audio animatronics animals that entertained the audience by singing songs from various periods in America's musical history, often in a humorous fashion. History America Sings exterior America Sings opened on June 29, 1974, replacing the General Electric-sponsored Carousel of Progress attraction, which had moved to the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in 1973. America Sings used the same Carousel Theater as its predecessor. The building had an outer ring of six theaters, connected by divider walls, that revolved mechanically about every four minutes around the six fixed stages in the center of the building. Unlike Disneyland's Carousel of Progress, which rotated clockwise, America Sings rotated in a counter-clockwise direction. Also, unlike Carousel of Progress, America Sings only used the lower level of the Carousel Theater. The upper level was eventually used to house the SuperSpeed Tunnel in 1977 (which later became the Game Grid of Tron) that the PeopleMover transportation attraction passed through. D23 Expo Written primarily by Marc Davis and Al Bertino, America Sings was comparable to Disneyland's Country Bear Jamboree, in that it featured a singing cast of audio-animatronics animals. The show's Masters of Ceremonies were an American bald eagle named Sam (voiced by Burl Ives) and an owl named Ollie (voiced by Sam Edwards). Eagle Sam was designed by Disney animator Marc Davis, as were the other characters. Eagle Sam is completely separate from the Sam the Olympic Eagle character designed a decade later by C. Robert Moore (also a Disney employee) for the 1984 Summer Olympics. Like the Carousel of Progress, the first and the last scenes of America Sings involved the loading and unloading of guests, while the other four scenes, or \\"acts,\\" depicted a particular era. However, the identical load and unload theaters each featured a small curtained gazebo with a backdrop showing a park. The curtains would open to reveal Sam and Ollie standing on a two-level podium, with Sam standing on the higher level, introducing or closing the show. Between each act, as the theater rotated, the lights blacked out, and the theater illuminated with flashing stars; during the rotations, Sam sang about the next era the audience was about to enter, reprising the chorus of \\"Yankee Doodle\\".Complete show script from DisneyPhenom.com (via archive.org). and complete script at Operation Preserve Disneyland. Archived October 25, 2009. Also, at some point in each act, the Weasel would suddenly appear on the scene, spouting the title line, \\"Pop, Goes the Weasel!\\" for a total of five times. At the very end of the show, he changed the line to, \\"Goodbye, Goes the Weasel!\\" The characters in America Sings were patterned after the characters from the concept art for an animated movie called Chanticleer that Walt Disney scrapped in the 1960s. =Deborah Gail Stone Incident= On July 8, 1974, nine days after the attraction opened, an 18-year-old hostess, named Deborah Gail Stone, was accidentally crushed to death between two walls of the building between 10:35 p.m. and 10:40 p.m. A narrow channel between a stationary wall and a rotating wall was open and Stone either fell, stepped backwards, or tried to jump from one stage to the other as the rotating wall began to move (it moved every 2 to 4 minutes, which was how long each act was). Her death was pronounced at 11:00 p.m., when the carousel was being reset for a new cycle. One of the audience members heard Stone's screams and notified park staff. By the time the audience member and the staff got to her, it was already too late. Stone had died from her injuries. Stone's parents sued Disneyland for the death of their daughter, which resulted in a small settlement.Remembering Deborah - July 8, 1974Mouseplanet: In Memory Following Stone's death, the attraction was abruptly closed down, remaining closed while safety lights were installed and the area where the incident occurred cleaned. Later, the walls in the theater were remodeled so that they would break away in case a similar accident happened. The attraction reopened three days after the incident on July 11. =Closure= America Sings was born out of the company's desire to celebrate America's Bicentennial. It didn't quite fit the theme of the land, but its relevance to that period in America made it appropriate. However, once the Bicentennial was over, the attraction became more misplaced, in a land dedicated to all things futuristic. Disney's Imagineering team began dreaming up new ideas for Tomorrowland, that included a new show in the carousel theater more fitting for the land of the future. Separately, in the summer of 1983, the idea for a log flume attraction that would become Splash Mountain was conceived by Imagineer and Disney Legend Tony Baxter. Knowing America Sings was eventually to close for a more appropriately themed show, the idea developed to give most of America Sings' audio animatronic figures a new home in Splash Mountain. In 1986, roughly two years before America Sings' impending closure, two audio-animatronic geese were taken out of the attraction. Their \\"skin\\" was removed, leaving only the robotic skeletons. Their heads were then replaced, and they were used as two talkative G2 droids in the queue to Star Tours, which would open in early 1987.America Sings Historical DVD from Extinct Attractions Club One of them (named G2-9T) still sings a modified \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad\\" (retitled \\"I've Been Looking at the Same Bag\\") in Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. As a result, the geese quartets in Acts 1 and 2 became trios until America Sings closed for good. Show sponsor Del Monte having already ended its sponsorship, America Sings officially closed on Sunday, April 10, 1988. Within days, crews began to move most of the Audio-Animatronic animals to Splash Mountain, which opened in the summer of 1989. The rock and roll stork in the finale is now used by Imagineers for training new Animatronics programmers, acting as a final exam of sorts. The remainder of the show's Audio-Animatronics were recycled. The Carousel Theater was used as office space for ten years. During this time, the carousel theater's external appearance was unchanged, and the upper level continued to house the Tron tunnel for the PeopleMover until that attraction ceased to operate in 1995. A large sign in front of the building showed Sorcerer Mickey alongside text reading, \\"Sorry, we're closed to imagineer a brand new attraction.\\" This gave guests some hope that a new attraction was in the works, but the building was not touched for nearly a decade. For many years guests wondered what the new attraction replacing America Sings was going to be. For a few years, during the planned \\"Disney Decade\\" started by then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, a new audio-animatronic show called Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue was to open. It was to have been an outer space-themed musical-variety revue featuring a troupe of Audio-Animatronics itinerant alien musicians whose spaceship had landed in Tomorrowland. The idea was part of the original \\"Tomorrowland 2055\\" plan and was planned to open around 1994. However, Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, ended up costing the Disney company billions of dollars putting them in debt, so \\"Tomorrowland 2055\\" was scrapped due to budget considerations. From its closure until 1996, the inside of the lower level of the Carousel Theater was used for storage and office space leaving only remnants of deteriorating sets and backdrops as well as the empty, unused theater seats. America Sings was finally replaced by Innoventions, a version of the Epcot attraction of the same name, in 1998 as part of the Tomorrowland update of that year. The building was then redesigned and reopened in 2015 as the Tomorrowland Expo Center, hosting the Star Wars Launch Bay.

Early life Born to convict parents at Launceston, Tasmania, he followed his father's trade as a bootmaker. Largely unschooled, barely literate, and with poor eyesight, Trenwith had a gift for oratory and public speaking which was to assist him in union organising and later as a politician. He was involved during the late 1870s with the National Reform League where he agitated for protective tariffs, a land tax, and reform of the Victorian Legislative Council. Labour movement As one of the founding members of the Victorian Operative Bootmakers Union in 1879 he served as its Secretary in 1883. He was instrumental in coordinating the 1884 bootmakers' strike from Melbourne Trades Hall, which saw Victoria's first fullscale picketing and was an important campaign in the fight against sweated labour. He advocated the abolition of outwork in the bootmaking industry to eliminate cheap labour and encourage unionisation. Trenwith honed his public oratory skills at North Wharf on the banks of the Yarra River, in Melbourne on Sunday afternoons, along with Joseph Symes, Chummy Fleming, and Monty Miller and many other Australian labour movement activists and radicals of the time. In 1886, he was elected President of the Trades Hall Council, and was also made a Life Governor of the Homeopathic Hospital that year. By 1890 he was seen as a Trades Hall bureaucrat being opposed by radicals such as Chummy Fleming about working conditions, who accused Trenwith and other moderate THC bureaucrats, of 'working with blood-sucking capitalists. Victorian politics After a number of attempts at nomination, Trenwith was elected in May 1889 for the seat of Richmond (1889‚Äì1903) to the Victorian Legislative Assembly on a labour platform and sought reforms in education, unemployment and tariff protection. He was the lone labour representative in the Victorian Parliament until the following election in April 1892 when 13 labour aligned candidates were elected. During 1892 Trenwith was elected leader of the Victorian Labour Party, but continued to have problems at the grassroots with strong opposition from public meetings chaired by Chummy Fleming. During the 1892 maritime strike he argued strongly for compulsory arbitration over direct action, much to the disgust of labour radicals. In 1893 Trenwith opposed Chummy Fleming's proposal for the affiliation of the Knights of Labor to the Trades Hall Council on the grounds that as a secret organisation it could not be organised industrially. In the Parliament of Victoria Trenwith served as Minister for Railways, commissioner for Public Works and vice-president of the Board of Land and Works between November 1900 and February 1901 in the Sir Alexander Peacock ministry, and briefly as Chief Secretary (1901‚Äì02). The Government he was part of came under attack in November 1902 from a Trades Hall motion from Chummy Fleming protesting against the reduction of old age pensions from 10/- to 8/-. Federal politics Trenwith at the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention Trenwith was the only elected labour representative at the Federal Constitutional Convention (1897‚Äì98) that led to the Federation of the six Australian colonies in 1901. His support of Federation was over the objections of many in the labour movement, and served to ameliorate accusations that the Federation Bill had been \\"wholly shaped in a conservative direction\\" as accused by the Age. From 1903 to 1910 Trenwith served as an Independent Senator for Victoria. His withdrawal of support for the Federal Labor government of Andrew Fisher resulted in his defeat at the following election and retirement from federal politics. He attempted to return to Victorian state politics at the 1911 Victorian state election, contesting the seat of Gippsland North against the sitting Labor MLA James McLachlan, but failed to defeat him.

It is the Army's rapid response airborne formation and is the only brigade in the British Army focused on delivering air assault operations. All personnel in the brigade wear the maroon beret, and those qualified as military parachutists wear the appropriate Parachutist Badge. History Paratroopers from 16 Air Assault Brigade jump from a Royal Air Force C-130 Hercules over Salisbury Plain during Exercise Wessex Storm on 19 November 2014. Soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade preparing for an evening raid near Basra, Iraq =Formation= The brigade was formed as part of the defence reforms implemented by the Strategic Defence Review on 1 September 1999, by the merging of 24 Airmobile Brigade and elements of 5th Airborne Brigade. This grouping created a highly mobile brigade of parachute units and airmobile units, which employ helicopters. =North Macedonia= After a ceasefire was declared in North Macedonia between government forces and rebels known as the National Liberation Army, NATO launched a British-led effort, Operation Essential Harvest, to collect weapons voluntarily given up by the rebels. The brigade HQ and some of its elements deployed in August 2001, acting as the spearhead for the NATO operation. It returned home after the NATO mission was successfully completed in September. =Afghanistan= After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, NATO established a peacekeeping force in December known as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), based in the capital Kabul. The brigade HQ and some of its units deployed to Afghanistan in 2001, 2006, 2008 and again in 2010‚Äì11, 16th Air Assault Brigade has deployed to Afghanistan more than any other formation to date. =Iraq= During the build-up to the invasion of Iraq, the brigade, commanded by Brigadier Jacko Page, was deployed to Kuwait in February 2003. The brigade was part of 1 (UK) Armoured Division and after extensive training in Kuwait it took part in the beginning of the invasion on 20 March. Initial speculation in the British media suggested that the brigade would support the American 82nd and 101st divisions in an airborne assault on the Saddam International Airport in Baghdad. This plan did not, however, come to fruition. The brigade's eventual objective was to secure the southern oil fields before they were destroyed by Saddam Hussein's forces. The brigade's 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery entered Iraq on 20 March to support U.S. Marine Corps forces in their efforts to capture the Rumaila oil fields, nearly all of the oil wells being taken intact. The rest of the brigade, supported by its AAC helicopters, entered Iraq soon afterwards, still tasked with securing Rumaila. The brigade often met sporadic resistance and had to deal with disarming the many explosives attached to the infrastructure. The brigade was subsequently used to guard the oil fields and protect Allied supply lines with elements moving further north of Basra ‚Äì Iraq's second largest city ‚Äì to provide a screen protecting it from Iraqi attack. On 31 March, the brigade, assisted by artillery and air support, attacked an Iraqi armoured column advancing on Basra, destroying 17 T-55 tanks, 5 artillery pieces and 7 armoured personnel carriers. After British forces entered Basra on 6 April 3 PARA was employed to clear the 'old quarter' of the city on 7 April due to the narrow streets making it inaccessible to vehicles. After Basra's capture, the brigade was based in Maysan Province, centred around the province's capital Al-Amarah. The brigade carried out patrols into towns, helped bring normality back to the south, tried to maintain order and destroyed any conventional weapons caches that were found. The war was officially declared over on 1 May and the brigade began to return home that same month. During one patrol into Majar al-Kabir on 24 June, the brigade suffered its largest casualties in Iraq when six Royal Military Policemen of 156 Provost Company were killed by a large Iraqi mob. Structure As the British Army's rapid response formation, 16 Air Assault Brigade has served in the vanguard of all of the Army's recent operational deployments to Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and is the largest brigade in the Army, with 6,200 personnel. It comprises: :* a Formation Reconnaissance Squadron :* an artillery regiment with an attached air defence battery :* an engineer regiment :* two parachute infantry battalions :* two air assault infantry battalions :* three aviation regiments :* logistics, medical and mechanical engineering regiments or battalions :* the Pathfinder group The brigade HQ is based in Colchester Garrison and was under the operational command of the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command (JHC). For administrative purposes, it was under the control of 5th Division, now Support Command. As of September 2015, Commander Land Forces will assume operational control of the brigade. From November 2016, 16 Brigade reports directly to Commander Field Army whilst the Army Air Corps units previously assigned to the brigade will remain under Joint Helicopter Command.Janes Defence Weekly, 23 September 2015, Tim Ripley The Brigade Headquarters has personnel from both the British Army and the Royal Air Force assigned, enabling it to carry out air and land operations. Due to the brigade's mobile role, it is lightly armed and equipped. The brigade's land equipment includes Scimitars, WMIK Land Rovers, Supacats, towed L118 105 mm light guns, Javelin anti-tank and lightweight Starstreak air-defence missile launchers. The aviation element of the brigade consists of three attack regiments equipped with WAH-64 Apache and Lynx helicopters from the Army Air Corps, Chinook and Puma support helicopters from the RAF, and Merlin support helicopters from the Fleet Air Arm (all of which are controlled by Joint Helicopter Command). Furthermore, two four-man Tactical Air Control Parties (TACPs) manned by the RAF Regiment provide airspace deconfliction, integration of air platforms within the battlespace, and terminal control of air assets. Pathfinder Platoon In 1984, 5th Airborne Brigade was in the process of developing its Limited Parachute Assault Capability (LPAC). This required a formation of 15 Hercules aircraft to drop a parachute battalion group over two drop zones (DZs) in under five minutes, by day or night. To do this, there was a requirement for the DZs to be clearly marked, to ensure that the crews had an easily identified reference point to allow them to drop accurately and consistently. With the demise of the 16th Parachute Brigade in 1977, the disbandment of No 1 (Guards) Independent Company meant that the expertise had been lost. Regimental Headquarters was asked to look at the options for providing this capability. Major Phil Neame produced a paper in October 1984 recommending the formation of an independent platoon, with manpower drawn from all three battalions and coming directly under the command of the Brigade Headquarters. It would number a total of 28 in 7 patrols of 4 men and include 2 Royal Signals operators. Today, the Pathfinder Group is made up of selected personnel from the armed forces, who have undergone a rigorous selection and training programme. The Group is formed around a platoon to company strength cadre of reconnaissance and communications specialists. Its roles include locating and marking parachute drop zones and tactical and helicopter landing zones for air landing operations. Once the main force has landed, the group provides tactical intelligence to assist operational decision-making within the brigade headquarters. The pathfinders can utilise various airborne insertion techniques, which range from the current in-service Low Level Parachute (LLP), to High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) systems. Traditions Drop Zone patch. Bottom left to right: Desert Subdued, Full Colour, DPM Subdued versions of the Brigade's original Striking Eagle insignia (1999‚Äì2015) The numeral 16 is derived from the 1st Airborne Division and 6th Airborne Division of the Second World War, first used by the 16th Parachute Brigade formed in 1948.Ferguson, p.34 The brigade's original emblem was a light-blue and maroon shield with a light blue Striking Eagle outlined in maroon emblazoned upon it, and was adopted from the Special Training Centre in Lochailort, Scotland, where Special Forces and Airborne troops were trained between 1943 and 1945. The sign was worn on the left arm. The colours chosen were traditional and showed the make-up of the brigade, maroon for Airborne and light-blue for Army Air Corps. The symbol of 5 Airborne Brigade had been Bellerophon on top of Pegasus (a winged horse of Greek mythology) and became synonymous with British airborne forces during World War II. When 16 Air Assault Brigade was formed there was some controversy when the Parachute units of 5 Airborne had to give up the Pegasus symbol and replace it with the Striking Eagle symbol. However, following Army 2020 restructuring, command of 16 Air Assault Brigade was transferred from Joint Helicopter Command to Commander Field Army, and the Pegasus emblem returned as the symbol of British airborne forces on 25 November 2015.

A Muslim convert, Roche was convicted of conspiring to bomb the Israeli embassy in Canberra in 2000. The plan was never carried out. In June 2004, he was sentenced to nine years in prison effective from 18 November 2002, when he was arrested. A non-parole period of 4¬Ω years was fixed, and as such he was released on 17 May 2007.Terrorist Roche released from jail ABC News He had faced a maximum sentence of 25 years. Early life He was born Paul George Holland in 1953, in the English city of Hull. He then moved to Australia in 1978. In 1992, he converted to Islam. Later life In October 1993 he then travelled to Indonesia to learn more about Islam, where he met his third, and current, wife. Upon his return to Sydney, Australia in November 1995 he began to associate with Australia's Jemaah Islamiyah members. In late 1996 he met the then Amir (Abdullah Sungkar) of the Jemaah Islamiyah group in Sydney and swore allegiance to him as a member of the group. In 2000, Roche travelled to Afghanistan, where he met with al-Qaeda leaders, such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and ultimately Osama bin Laden. After that, he received basic training in bomb making ( a very basic 10-day course). He was then instructed to organize the set up of a terror cell in Australia which was to target Israeli interests in the country, including the plot to bomb the Israeli embassy. Roche admits to having taken part in the plot, but said he did not plan to carry it out. He admitted to carrying out surveillance on Australian targets, but was unsuccessful in bringing in new recruits for the cell. On 12 June 2000, Roche used a video camera that he had borrowed from Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad to film the Israeli embassy in Canberra, Australia. In July 2000 Roche contacted ASIO via telephone 3 times in order to alert authorities as to dangerous elements evolving within Islamic communities in Australia. He had vital information regarding the locations of top Al Qaeda operatives including Khalid Shaikh Muhammd and Osama bin Ladin amongst others (in fact 6 of the FBI's top most wanted at the time). Roche maintains that had the necessary authorities taken the time to listen to his story, the events of 11 September 2001 and the Bali bombings in October 2002 could have been prevented. According to Roche, Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, whom Roche named as the head of Jemaah Islamiyah, eventually called him in August 2000 and ordered him to cancel the plan, having initially given Roche the go ahead to 'do what Hambali had instructed him to do'. Ba'asyir, who is in custody in Indonesia, and who is thought to be linked to terrorist organizations, denies the connection with Jemaah Islamiyah. Since he was released on 17 May 2007, he lives in South Perth.

He was played by Josh \\"J. Elvis\\" Weinstein. Role Dr. Erhardt is a mad scientist and was Dr. Clayton Forrester's first assistant. He is a very different character from Forrester's later assistant, TV's Frank. He is more high-spirited than Frank, speaks with a high, squeaky voice, has curly black hair, and thick glasses. Erhardt is himself a \\"mad scientist\\" like Forrester, whereas Frank is neither a scientist nor, for the most part, mad. Just like Frank, however, Erhardt goes through many tortures by Dr. Forrester. His catchphrase was, after soberly describing a horrible movie's plot or some other dire scenario, to proclaim cheerily, \\"Enjoy!\\" The Mads perform a commercial for their fictitious drive-in restaurant, \\"Clay and Lar's Flesh Barn\\" Little is known of Erhardt's past save that he became a \\"mad scientist\\" while working at a zoo; he went mad when, in his own words: \\"...they promised me students, but all I got were monkeys! Monkeys! Monkeys! So I took off my wetsuit, dropped that hedge clipper, and walked out of that zoo forever!\\" Any additional details are left for the viewers to fill in themselves since MST3K was, after all, \\"just a show\\", and the viewers should \\"really just relax\\". Eventually finding employment at Gizmonic Institute, he became Dr. Forrester's assistant and worked with him to launch Joel Robinson into space, where the pair conducted their movie-watching experiments on him. Dr. Erhardt was only on the show for the KTMA season and the nationally telecast Season 1. When Frank was first introduced on the show and Joel asked what happened to Dr. Erhardt, Frank simply held up a milk carton with Erhardt's picture on it saying, \\"He's missing\\". Because Best Brains, the production company behind MST3K, discouraged the replaying of Season 1 episodes and had no rights to the KTMA episodes, few fans had actually had a chance to see him and therefore Erhardt fell into obscurity. After the milk carton reference, he was mentioned only once more, in episode #313 - Earth vs. the Spider featuring a scene where a policeman closely resembling Erhardt is eaten by a giant spider, and Joel and the bots speculated that this was the true fate of Erhardt. Dr. Erhardt returned in episode #1204 - The Day Time Ended, and is now depicted as a suave space hero changed by thirty years of interstellar travel. He returns to retrieve the ashes of Dr. Forrester (and, incidentally, TV's Frank) from the Gizmonic Institute. Behind the scenes Dr. Forrester and Dr. Erhardt were first shown in episode K07, during the show's original season on KTMA TV23. During this season, and season 1, J. Elvis Weinstein (who was credited under his real name Josh Weinstein) held a dual role as both Dr. Erhardt and the voice of Tom Servo, and he also provided the voice of Gypsy during the KTMA years (replaced in season one by Jim Mallon). Weinstein, the youngest of the MST3K creators, left the show after its first nationally telecast season due to creative differences once the show began being scripted instead of being ad-libbed. His youth and relative inexperience was also said to have rubbed his older co-workers the wrong way. In an interview, he stated the show simply quit being fun for him when they moved from KTMA to The Comedy Channel because it became \\"a business\\". Weinstein elaborated on this unpleasant workplace dynamic in an April 2019 episode of Bill Corbett‚Äôs Funhouse podcast, wherein he claimed that producer Jim Mallon was openly hostile toward him and insisted on his being paid significantly less than other cast members, presumably because of his age and refusal to maintain a level of ‚Äúfaux humility‚Äù displayed by some of his cohorts.

The mints are produced by Tootsie Roll Industries, and packaged in varying amounts from the so-called 'fun-size box' to the much larger 12 oz. box. History Junior Mints were introduced in 1949 by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based James O. Welch Company. The company also manufactured candies and candy bars such as Sugar Babies, Welch's Fudge, and Pom Poms. James O. Welch was born in Hertford, North Carolina, attended the University of North Carolina, and then founded his Cambridge candy company in 1927. His partner in the company was his brother, Robert W. Welch, Jr., who retired from the confectionery business in 1956 and two years later founded the John Birch Society. In 1963, the brand was acquired by Nabisco, who sold the brand to Warner-Lambert Company (now part of Pfizer) in 1988, who in turn sold the brand to Tootsie Roll in 1993. Today, Junior Mints are still manufactured in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge at a factory of Cambridge Brands, a Tootsie Roll Industries subsidiary. The same factory makes all Sugar Babies and Charleston Chews. =Origin of product name= The name of the product is a pun on Sally Benson's Junior Miss, a collection of her stories from The New Yorker, which were adapted by Jerome Chodorov and Joseph Fields into a successful play. The play was directed by Moss Hart and ran on Broadway from 1941 to 1943. According to one past official company history, when James Welch developed and launched the product in 1949, he named the candy after his favorite Broadway show. Yet the candy came six years after the play had closed on Broadway. Current copy on the Junior Mints box incorrectly gives the date of the Broadway play as 1949. Some may argue that this is comparable to the \\"potato potato\\" scenario, as depending on how you read \\"named after a top Broadway play in 1949: \\"Junior Miss\\"\\", it may be interpreted that it is simply referring to the candy being named in 1949.Junior Mints box copy In 1945, the play was adapted to film, with George Seaton directing Peggy Ann Garner in the lead role. The Junior Miss radio series, starring Barbara Whiting, was being broadcast weekly on CBS at the time Junior Mints were first marketed in 1949. Thus, Welch had cleverly created a product sold at movie theater concession stands and identified with a specific movie and radio series and displaying a name that sounded almost exactly like that property-yet different enough that it avoided any fees for licensing and merchandising. Junior Mints quickly became a popular candy at movie concession stands, and one product in the line is the three oz. box marketed as the \\"Theater Size Junior Mints Concession Candy\\". Product Over 15 million Junior Mints are produced daily. Tootsie Roll also makes Junior Caramels (caramel filling with a milk chocolate coating) and limited edition \\"Inside Outs\\" (mint-chocolate filling with a white chocolate shell). Other limited edition Junior Mints include Valentine's Day Pastels/Valentine's Day Regulars (not pastel), Easter Pastels, Christmas edition (featuring red and green fillings), and Christmas Peppermint Crunch edition (featuring crunchy peppermint flakes in the outer chocolate coating). Junior Mints are sold in various amounts from the fun-size boxes to the movie theater-size boxes, since the product continues to sell well in movie theaters. Junior Mints have traveled throughout the world. They are now certified kosher dairy by the Orthodox Union. In 2009, Tootsie Roll introduced a companion product, \\"Junior Mints Deluxe\\". The \\"Deluxe\\" is a larger dark chocolate covered mint that comes foil wrapped (much like a chocolate covered cherry) and is sold in 10, 22, and 72-piece boxes with a fold up sign, designed for individual piece sale on retail counter tops.

After Roy's condition deteriorates, Jerry calls the hospital intending to confess the whole situation, only to discover that Roy's condition has improved.

Lauren and Sandy learn that Michael is a double agent for the CIA who has now gone rogue, also working for the KGB, and that he has stolen a toxin that could destroy huge areas of nature with just a few drops. The CIA wants to find Michael to force him to give back the toxin bio-weapon, while the Russian assassins are men cheated by the double agent who works for Korzenowski, their theatre professor. The chase leads to rural New Mexico when Lauren is taken hostage by Michael and his rogue associates who force a trade with the CIA for the toxin, and with Korzenowski with the stolen cash he intended to give to Michael. When the trade goes awry, Lauren gets away with both the money and the toxin, with Michael in hot pursuit. Cornered on a series of mountain tops, Lauren uses her former ballet skills to evade him, culminating in a grand jet√©, as pursuing Michael slips and is presumably killed on the rocks far below while the money is lost to Native Americans. The women form a lasting friendship, and go on to perform Hamlet together, with Lauren in the title role and Sandy as Ophelia. Cast Shelley Long as Lauren Ames * Bette Midler as Sandy Brozinsky * Peter Coyote as Michael Santers * Robert Prosky as Stanislav Korzenowski * George Carlin as Frank Madras * John Schuck as Agent Atkins * Anthony Heald as Weldon * Christopher McDonald as George Both Shelley Long and Bette Midler were promised top billing when they signed to do the film; however, neither was willing to give up top billing to the other. To compromise, Long received top billing in advertising west of the Mississippi River, and Midler received the honor in the east. This agreement extended through the original LaserDisc and VHS release of the title, with discs shipped to retailers in the west featuring Shelley Long and retailers on the east receiving discs featuring Bette Midler. Midler remarked that working with Long was difficult, echoing similar sentiments amongst Long's bosses on her hit TV series Cheers. Suzanne Somers has said that Michael Eisner offered her a three-movie deal with Disney which included Outrageous Fortune, but she turned it down. She would have played Bette Midler's part. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 50% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, indicating a lukewarm response. For her performance, Midler received a Golden Globe nomination. =Box office= Outrageous Fortune was financially successful, debuting at No. 2 domestically, and grossing $52.9 in the US.

Sladen was born in England near Walmer, Kent, the second son of John Baker Sladen, deputy-lieutenant of the county. He was educated at Shrewsbury and later at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1840, he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB). He migrated to Australia in 1841, and in February 1842 arrived in the Port Phillip District (later Victoria). He was soon admitted to the Victorian bar, and practised as a solicitor in Geelong until 1854, when he took up farming near Winchelsea. In 1840 he married Harriet Amelia Orton. In 1851‚Äì52 he played cricket for Victoria. On 28 November 1855 Sladen was nominated to the Victorian Legislative Council, and was appointed acting Treasurer. When Victoria gained responsible government in 1856, Sladen was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as Member for Geelong, and became Treasurer in the ministry of William Haines, a position he held until March 1857. He advocated the creation of a public bank and increased immigration. Sladen did not contest the 1859 election and contested but lost the 1861 election for Geelong East. A firm conservative, Sladen re-entered politics in November 1864 when he was elected to the Legislative Council for Western Province in a by-election. When the liberal Premier James McCulloch resigned in May 1868 during the conflict between the government and the Council over the proposed grant to retiring Governor Charles Darling, Sladen was asked by the new Governor, Sir John Manners-Sutton, to form a government. Sladen found himself in a hopeless situation, since he was a member of the upper house at a time when it was increasingly accepted that the leader of the government must come from the Assembly ‚Äî he is the only member of the Council ever to serve as Premier. Since he had little support in the Assembly, his government had no prospect of long-term survival. Following the resolution of the Darling grant crisis, he stepped down in July, and in September he retired from the Council. In September 1876 Sladen was again elected to the Council for Western Province, and became the de facto leader of the Council in its conflicts with the Assembly. Despite being very conservative, Sladen recommended that the franchise for the Council be extended, and that the property qualifications for membership be reduced. These reforms were enacted in 1881. Sladen retired in 1882 due to poor health and died in 1884 in Geelong. Sladen was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1875. A portrait of him hangs in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.

Until World War II he lived in southeastern Poland (in Poland's southern Kresy), in an area that is now in western Ukraine. Early years J√≥zef Kasparek was born in 1915 in Broumov (in German, Braunau), Bohemia, Austro-Hungarian Empire, in what is now the Czech Republic, near that country's border with what was then German Silesia and is now Poland's Lower Silesian Province. Kasparek was the son of Teodor Kasparek (1867‚Äì1940) and Emilia, n√©e Obst von Minnenthal.Antemurale, Institutum Historicum Polonicum Romae, 1974 The father was a lawyer who, before World War I, had been a judge in Austrian-ruled Bosnia and was now, aged nearly fifty, serving as a volunteer in J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legions; in his youth, parting ways with his lawyer-father's conservatism and Germanic- culture orientation, he had co-founded the Polish Socialist Party with Ignacy Daszy≈ÑskiIgnacy Daszy≈Ñski, Pamiƒôtniki (Memoirs), vol. I, Krak√≥w, Nak≈Çadem Z.R.S.S. \\"Proletarjat\\", 1925, p. 67. before studying law in Zurich, Switzerland. While Teodor Kasparek was serving in Pi≈Çsudski's Legions, his son J√≥zef spent his first years at ≈ªurawno, on the Dniester River, birthplace of one of the 16th-century founders of Polish literature, Miko≈Çaj Rej. J√≥zef later attended the Lw√≥w Corps of Cadets, a state-run military-style secondary school. He also studied piano at his paternal maiden aunts' well-regarded music school in Lw√≥w. Later, as a young man, he participated in stage plays under the tutelage of the celebrated theater director, Leon Schiller. He drew portraits with the skill of an inspired artist. But J√≥zef, whom his mother called a \\"gawƒôdziarz\\" (story-teller), seemed to find himself especially as a writer. While a law student at Lw√≥w University, he wrote for the Lw√≥w \\"political-opposition\\" newspaper, Dziennik Polski (The Polish Daily), edited by Klaudiusz Hrabyk, and compiled a collection of short stories that was about to be published when World War II supervened. Carpathian Rus In late 1938, soon after the Munich Conference, J√≥zef Kasparek, a 23-year-old Lw√≥w University law student and Polish Army artillery reservist, helped initiate and carry out, under Polish General Staff direction, covert operations in Carpathian Rus. The object of Akcja ≈Åom (Operation Crowbar)‚ÄîKasparek was unaware of the cryptonym‚Äîcoordinated with operations by Hungarian paramilitary forces, was to subvert the Nazi-German-aligned regime of Avhustyn Voloshyn and restore that easternmost, smallest region of Czechoslovakia to Hungary. Carpathian Rus was being turned by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists into a Piedmont to aspirations for Ukrainian national independence, which might have been won for the first time since medieval Kievan Rus. A Ukrainian sich (military camp) outside the Rusyn capital, Uzhhorod, was, under German tutelage, training Ukrainians from southeastern Poland for prospective action in Poland jointly with Germany. This constituted a clear and present danger to the Polish population just across the Carpathian Mountains in largely Ukrainian-populated southeastern Poland, as Adolf Hitler worked to complete a near-total encirclement of Poland on her north, west and south while Poland's eastern frontier faced a hostile Soviet Union. Hungary had ruled Carpathian Rus from the Middle Ages until defeated in World War I, and had been lobbying Adolf Hitler to sanction Hungary's repossession of Rus. Following the Polish- Hungarian covert operations in Carpathian Rus, under the First Vienna Award in November 1938, Hungary received some largely Hungarian-populated areas of Carpathian Rus. Further coordinated Polish-Hungarian partisan operations ultimately led to the restoration, in mid-March 1939, of Hungarian sovereignty over all of Carpathian Rus and the re-establishment of the historic common Polish-Hungarian border. Six months later, during the invasion of Poland in September 1939, that common border would become of pivotal importance when Hungarian Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy's grateful government, as a matter of \\"Hungarian honor\\", declined Hitler's request to transit German forces across Rus into southeastern Poland to speed Poland's conquest. This in turn allowed the Polish government and tens of thousands of Polish military personnel to escape into neighboring Romania and Hungary, and from there to France and French-mandated Syria to carry on operations as the third-strongest Allied belligerent after Britain and France.J√≥zef Kasparek, \\"Poland's 1938 Covert Operations in Ruthenia\\" and Przepust karpacki (The Carpathian Bridge); and Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Referat o dzia≈Çaniach dywersyjnych na Rusi Karpackiej\\" (\\"Report on Covert Operations in Carpathian Rus\\"). Before the outbreak of World War II, for his part in the Carpathian operation, Kasparek received the Cross of Valor (Krzy≈º Walecznych). After the war, in Britain, General Boles≈Çaw Bronis≈Çaw Duch heard of the operation from other participants and nominated Kasparek for Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. At the session of the kapitu≈Ça (chapter), however, the nomination was blocked by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders after Duch adamantly opposed Anders' own nomination of his paymaster for the Virtuti Militari.J√≥zef Kasparek, Memoirs. World War II Kasparek fought in defense of Poland during the country's invasion in September 1939. A particular turning point in the September Campaign for Kasparek, which likely saved his life, occurred when he was sent to ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew for maps and, at 16th-century Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's castle, met Colonel Stanis≈Çaw Maczek (who later in the war, in Great Britain, would become commander of the Polish First Armored Division). Maczek transferred Kasparek, who had just been wounded by a German aerial bomb outside the castle, to a newly formed artillery battery, thereby liberating him from his Virtuti- Militari-decorated sadistic captain. After the Soviet Army entered Lw√≥w, the local Polish Army commander, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Langner, ordered his forces to surrender to the Soviet forces and place themselves in Soviet custody. Kasparek showed the independent streak that he had inherited from his parents and refused to obey the order. He attempted unsuccessfully to convince fellow officers to do likewise. By refusing what he considered a disastrous order on Langner's part, Kasparek avoided becoming, like the officers who obeyed it, a victim of the Katyn massacres. Soon after, he joined the nascent Polish Resistance movement. Denounced to the Soviet authorities, arrested, and interrogated for six months by the Soviet NKVD, Kasparek was sentenced to eight years in Soviet Gulag forced labor camps, called ≈Çagry by the Poles. His pregnant wife had already been deported to Kazakhstan; their first daughter would die there at age two of pertussis. Kasparek himself barely survived two years' hard labor, emaciation and near-fatal typhus before being \\"amnestied\\" with other Poles by the Soviets after Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union (June 1941). Joining General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders' new Polish army, the Second Corps, being formed in the USSR, Kasparek and his wife, reunited after two years, were evacuated to the Middle East. There Kasparek served as adjutant to General Leopold Okulicki. From the Middle East, rather than going on to Italy with most of the Second Corps, Kasparek and his wife transferred into the Polish Air Force in Great Britain. After the war, he was a contract military officer, serving as adjutant to General Boles≈Çaw Bronis≈Çaw Duch, until 1948, when Polish military units were disbanded. United States In December 1951 Kasparek moved his family to the United States, where he would live out the next fifty years. In the United States, resuming an interest in comparative constitutional systems that Kasparek had begun in law school, he wrote a doctoral thesis that became the book, The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States. The book compares, and traces mutual influences upon, the constitutions of the United States and Poland, including the world's first modern codified national constitution, the United States Constitution that went into effect in 1789, and the world's second, Poland's Constitution of May 3, 1791. Kasparek had experienced war at first hand. By the 1950s he had concluded that the world's peoples must replace warfare with global procedures to budget the world's resources to meet the world's needs. His view was borne out by subsequent decades, which brought nuclear-weapons limitation treaties and a growing realization that global environmental threats call for global remedies.

The Liberation Army of the South (, ELS) was a guerrilla force led for most of its existence by Emiliano Zapata that took part in the Mexican Revolution from 1911 to 1920. During that time, the Zapatistas fought against the national governments of Porfirio D√≠az, Francisco Madero, Victoriano Huerta, and Venustiano Carranza. Their goal was rural land reform, specifically reclaiming communal lands stolen by hacendados in the period before the revolution. Although rarely active outside their base in Morelos, they allied with Pancho Villa to support the Conventionists against the Carrancistas. After Villa's defeat, the Zapatistas remained in open rebellion. It was only after Zapata's 1919 assassination and the overthrow of the Carranza government that Zapata's successor, Gildardo Maga√±a, negotiated peace with President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Origins The Zapatistas were formed in the south-central state of Morelos. Morelos is small and densely populated, with an agricultural economy defined by the conflict between villages and large, sugar-producing haciendas. The rights of the villages to their communal lands had been codified during the colonial era, but successive post- independence governments had allied with the hacendados to revoke those rights. Liberal land reforms privatized communally owned land, and the industrialization of agriculture during the Porfiriato intensified the demand for water and land. Friendly courts awarded orchards, fields, and water sources to the haciendas. Between 1884 and 1905, eighteen towns in Morelos disappeared as lands were taken away. Deprived of their means of subsistence, the population of Morelos was suffering from famine and general impoverishment by the turn of the century. Thousands had become wage laborers on the haciendas. In 1909, Pablo Escand√≥n y Barr√≥n became governor in a rigged election, siding even more aggressively with the hacendados. In response, village leaders including Emiliano Zapata, Gabriel Tepepa, and Pablo Torres Burgos formed a local defense committee. They soon declared themselves in support of Francisco Madero, taking up arms in February of 1911. History =Maderista revolution and interim presidency, Feb.‚ÄìNov. 1911= The defense committee originally aligned with Madero due to the promises of land reform in the Plan of San Luis Potos√≠, with Torres Burgos being appointed commanding officer. However, there was essentially no coordination with Pascual Orozco's forces in the north. They saw great early success in recruiting from among the desperate population, amassing a force of around 5,000. Governor Escand√≥n fled the state with a portion of the federal forces, giving the rebels an opening to attack cities. In March, Torres Burgos was killed and Zapata was elected leader. He managed to avoid a trap laid by reactionary rebels under the Figueroa brothers and continue to gather strength. In May, Zapata scored a series of victories, first at Jojutla and then at Cuautla. The Battle of Cuautla was bloody and prolonged, pitting numerically superior rebels against a better-equipped and well-entrenched federal army. After suffering mass casualties from machine guns, the rebels had to take the city street by street. Nonetheless, Zapata's eventual victory put him dangerously close to the capital, and helped convince Porfirio D√≠az to resign the presidency. The rebel forces then occupied Cuernavaca, bringing most of Morelos under their control. During the interim presidency of Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, Madero insisted Zapata disarm and disband his forces. Madero's reluctance to take action on land reform made Zapata reluctant, but he had little choice but to comply. Tensions flared when the hacendado governor attempted to block Zapata from taking up his promised position as commander of the local police. In July, news of a plot to assassinate Madero in the neighboring state of Puebla alarmed Zapata, and he rapidly re-mobilized to march to the politician's defense. Although the march was called off, Zapata and the other rebel commanders were now much more wary of laying down their arms. De la Berra ordered General Huerta to force Zapata to surrender unconditionally. Huerta quickly took over the state, and civil law was suspended in August. Although Madero attempted negotiations to avoid violence, on August 23 Huerta and Ambrosia Figueroa (now allied with the regime) began military operations against the rebels. This made them feel that Madero had betrayed them, and set the stage for their break with him three months later. The small rebel force evaded destruction by first fleeing to Puebla, then reappearing in Morelos once Huerta had moved his army to follow them. The Morelos rebels swelled to around 1,500 and by late October lay claim to important territory near Mexico City. This was a humiliation for Huerta, and he lost his post. =Break with Madero, Nov. 1911= After Madero's inauguration on November 6th, it appeared as if the rebellion in Morelos could end peacefully. Negotiations in Ayala seemed to be proceeding well when the federal army under Casso Lopez suddenly surrounded Zapata's forces. Madero issued an order for Zapata to surrender with the promise the compromise would be honored. Zapata refused, as he received this order as the federal forces were already preparing to attack. His forces escaped into the Puebla mountains and there Zapata issued the Plan of Ayala, written by Otilio Monta√±o. In this document, Zapata denounced Madero and outlined what would become the underpinnings of Zapatismo, a radical agrarianism based on seizing land from the haciendas and restoring it to the villages. =Revolution against Huerta, Feb. 1913‚ÄìJuly 1914= Fighting continued against the successive leaders Victoriano Huerta and Venustiano Carranza. =Convention and civil war, 1914-1917= The Zapatistas briefly occupied Mexico City at the start of the civil war against Carranza. There were significant cultural clashes between the rural villagers and residents of the capital. In 1914, Zapata met at the head of his army with Pancho Villa and his forces at Mexico City to determine the course of the revolution, but they returned to their respective territories without a connected anti- Constitutionalist coalition.Adolfo Gilly,The Mexican Revolution When back in Morelos, the Zapatistas fortified themselves against incursions by the forces eager to reassume control of the liberated territories known as the Morelos Commune. =Zapata's assassination and decline= Zapata's assassination in 1919 struck a mortal blow to Zapatistas, and the army slowly disbanded afterwards. After the death of Zapata, Gildardo Maga√±a played a crucial role in negotiating a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Morelos. Structure The Zapatistas were mainly poor peasants who wished to spend much of their time working their land to produce an income. As a result, Zapatista soldiers tended to serve for several months at a time, and then return home to spend most of the year farming. The structure of the Zapatista army was very loose and the rank system limited in scope. The Zapatista army was united entirely by the charismatic leadership of Zapata. It was divided into small, largely independent units rarely numbering more than one hundred men, each commanded by a chief (jefe). These units spent the overwhelming majority of their time separated from the other units. Officer ranks were eventually introduced to coordinate groups. The chief of a unit over about fifty men was, generally speaking, given the rank of general. Smaller bands were commanded by colonels and captains. Not all captains were official; that is to say, recognised by Zapata and senior Zapatistas, some being unofficially proclaimed captains by their unit. Beyond Zapata's overall command and the leadership of bands, there was limited use of ranks or hierarchy. Sub-officer ranks were introduced late in the revolution in an effort to create a more disciplined force. One of Zapata's famous dictums was \\"al ratero perdono pero al traidor jamas\\"; \\"a robber I can forgive, but a traitor... never.\\" Legacy murals produced about the revolution. After Obreg√≥n's ascension to the presidency, Maga√±a secured the passage of land reform aligned with the Plan of Ayala. During the 1990s, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation drew philosophical and tactical inspiration from the Liberation Army of the South, launching an insurgency that is ongoing in 2020.

Located along the northern coast of Penang Island and about northwest of the city centre, it is the prime beach destination in Penang among locals and tourists. To cater to the influx of tourists, several major high-rise hotels have been established along the stretch of beaches, including Hard Rock Hotel. The beach resorts along Batu Ferringhi also offer various water sport activities, such as parasailing. On a clear day, one could get a picturesque view of the Andaman Sea and Mount Jerai, which is located within the neighbouring state of Kedah. In addition, Batu Ferringhi is famous for its night market that offers a wide variety of merchandise and street food. There had been human activity within Batu Ferringhi as early as 1592, when an Englishman, Sir James Lancaster, arrived and began pillaging other vessels around Penang Island. However, for much of its recent history, Batu Ferringhi was a quiet village, until the urbanisation of the area beginning in the 1970s. Due to its location along the northern coast of Penang Island, Batu Ferringhi was hard hit by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.left Lovers' Isle off Batu Ferringhi The beaches of Batu Ferringhi, interspersed by rocky outcrops Golden Sands Resort at Batu Ferringhi left  Etymology  The word ferringhi or feringgi is a modern spelling of the Classical Malay word peringgi, originally used in reference to the Portuguese conquistadors before being all people of European descent. It is cognate with the Thai farang and Khmer barang. All derive from the Indian word firangƒ´ (‡§´‡§º‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä) which itself originates either with the Arabic ferringi or Persian farangi. In the Middle East and Africa, it originally referred to the Franks but came to mean Europeans in general. Batu Ferringhi, therefore, would mean the place where Westerners had come ashore, with the Malay word batu (meaning rock) referring to the rocky shoreline of this particular area. Among Tamils, the area is known as Paringgi Malai meaning \\"foreigner's hill\\".  History  Batu Ferringhi was first explored in 1592, when Sir James Lancaster, an English privateer, came ashore at this particular area. This made Lancaster the first European to reach Penang Island. Having come ashore aboard the Edward Bonaventure, Lancaster and his crew proceeded to pillage every vessel they encountered for the next four months. The urbanisation of Batu Ferringhi only began in the 1970s. This involved the construction of several hotels along the beaches, attracting locals and tourists alike. Condominiums soon followed, offering gorgeous views of the sea overlooking the Malay Peninsula. However, these developments did not come without problems, such as the deteriorating seawater quality that has led to the infestation of jellyfish around Batu Ferringhi. Batu Ferringhi was one of the hardest hit areas during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that ultimately claimed a total of 52 lives in Penang. In 2009, Hard Rock Hotel opened its Penang branch at Batu Ferringhi, adding to the list of major hotels already within the suburb.  Transportation  The main thoroughfare within Batu Ferringhi is the coastal Batu Ferringhi Road, part of Federal Route 6. Batu Ferringhi Road continues on from Tanjung Bungah Road, cutting through the heart of the suburb until it becomes Jalan Teluk Bahang at the western edge of Batu Ferringhi. The few roads within this suburb, including Batu Ferringhi Road, are prone to traffic congestion due to its popularity as a tourist destination. Rapid Penang buses 101 and 102 serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Batu Ferringhi with George Town and other destinations on Penang Island, such as Tanjung Bungah, Tanjung Tokong, the Penang International Airport and Queensbay Mall. Another bus service, the Hop-On Hop-Off service, caters primarily to tourists. This service, which utilises open-topped double decker buses, includes three stops within Batu Ferringhi - an optional stop at Miami Beach and two standard stops at Holiday Inn and Hard Rock Hotel.  Education  The only school within the Batu Ferringhi suburb is the Uplands International School, which caters primarily to the expatriate community within this suburb as well as those from the neighbouring Tanjung Bungah suburb. The nearest public primary and high schools are situated at Tanjung Bungah.  Shopping  Although Batu Ferringhi does not have a shopping centre, the suburb is notable for its night market. Souvenirs, DVDs, artworks, jerseys, and other apparels and accessories can be found at bargain prices within the night market, which is also lined with various food stalls that sell Penang's famed street cuisine and titbits.

It is located within the Air Itam suburb, west of the center of George Town. Penang Hill is also known by the Malay name Bukit Bendera, which actually refers to Flagstaff Hill, the most developed peak. One of the peaks is known as Strawberry Hill, which was also the name of a house owned by Francis Light, founder of Penang colony. Penang Hill covers a number of hills, with the highest point at Western Hill which is above sea level. The hill stands out prominently from the lowlands as a hilly and forested area. It was used as a retreat during the British colonial period, and is now a popular tourist destination in Penang. The top of the hill is accessible via the Penang Hill Railway from its base station at Hill Railway Station Road. To date, this funicular railway system is the only one of its kind in Malaysia, transporting over a million visitors to the peak of Penang Hill . History Captain Francis Light, founder of the colony in Penang, first plotted a horse track from the Penang Botanic Gardens waterfall up to the top of the hill in 1788. He cleared an area in order to grow strawberries, and it therefore became known as Strawberry Hill. The official name of Penang Hill however was Flagstaff Hill, which is still reflected in its name in Malay, Bukit Bendera (literally \\"Flag Hill\\"). The name was a reference to the flagstaff outside \\"Bel Retiro\\", which was the residence of the Governor of Penang built by Francis Light c. 1789. The area is, however, widely known as Penang Hill which is, in fact, a collective term covering a number of hills, and the other names such as Flagstaff Hill and Strawberry Hill are still used for specific peaks in the area. The hill became a cool retreat for the British colonists from the heat of the lowlands and threat of malaria, and many bungalows were built on the summit of Penang Hill for government servants and army. A convalescent bungalow was built in 1803. One of the earliest buildings on Strawberry Hill was a house built by David Brown on land given by Francis Light. Australian historian Marcus Langdon, however, believes Strawberry Hill house was built by William Edward Phillips, who was also the owner of Suffolk House, and not David Brown. The house however burnt down and it was rebuilt in the 19th century, and it was being used as a restaurant as of 2012. The post office was first opened in 1894, and a hotel, the Crag Hotel, owned by the Sarkies Brothers, was established in 1895 and sold in the 1920s; operational until it was closed in World War II. The building became a boarding school The International School of Penang (Uplands) from 1955 till 1977. The first police station was built in 1929, and the building is still standing here on the same site. In the early days the only way to the top of hill was to travel on foot or horseback, or be carried on a dooly (sedan chair). The first attempt at a mountain railway on Penang Hill began in 1897 but it proved unsuccessful; it was built between 1901 and 1905 but had technical faults. The Straits government then organised a new project to construct the Penang Hill Funicular Railway at a cost of 1.5 million Straits dollars. The railway was first opened to the public on 21 October 1923 and officially opened on 1 January 1924. The funicular railway led to a sharp increase in residential development as it became a location for the building of holiday villas and bungalows by Europeans and wealthy local Chinese towkays alike. It also led to its development into a major tourist destination in Penang. It received well over a million visitors a year by 2012. A major revamp at Penang Hill was initiated in 2010. The railway was overhauled, allowing for faster access to the hill, and facilities for visitors, walkways and viewing decks were constructed. Geography 1884 map of northeast Penang Island showing Penang Hill at top- left, labelled Government Hill =Topography= Penang Hill is mainly a hilly granitic mass. The hill system is higher towards the northern part with its highest point at Western Hill, at an elevation of above sea level. Other than Western Hill, there are a number of peaks in the region, such as Bukit Laksamana (Malay for Admiral Hill), Tiger Hill, Flagstaff Hill, Haliburton's Hill and Government Hill. Flagstaff Hill is above sea level. A number of small rivers and streams originate from the region. Sungai Pinang (Malay for Penang River) is the largest of the rivers, and it starts from a number of tributaries in the area. =Land use= Because Penang Hill has a cooler environment, it has been a popular holiday retreat. A number of bungalows were built around Flagstaff Hill. The northern part of the Hills are not well developed. Government Hill, Bukit Timah (Malay for Tin Hill) and others are designated water catchment areas and no development is permitted. Some recreational potential exists at the upper reaches of the river where the water is relatively clean. In a number of cases, sudden changes in ground level have resulted in a series of small waterfalls and rapids, where bathing, dipping and picnicking are popular. The lower terrain of the Hills is used mainly for agricultural and residential purposes. =Accessibility= Penang Hill Railway funicular rolling stock, which was last upgraded in 2010 The most convenient way up to Penang Hill is by means of the Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway from Air Itam to the top of Flagstaff Hill. The journey used to take about half an hour and the train may stop at intermediate stations upon request. However, upgrades to the system now allows non-stop rides to the top in five to ten minutes. Penang Hill Railway Lower Station, located at the western end of Hill Railway Station Road For Malaysians, the fare for a return (round-trip) ticket is RM12 per adult and RM6 per child aged between three and 12. For foreign tourists, the return fare would be RM30 for adults and RM15 for children aged seven to 12. Senior citizens and students will enjoy cheaper fares at RM6 per person. The ride continues to remain free of charge for disabled persons holding the OKU (Malay acronym for Orang Kurang Upaya) card. Penang Hill residents, licensed traders and hawkers and workers can purchase a monthly season pass at RM24. The blue, air-conditioned Swiss-made coaches, capable of ferrying up to 100 passengers at one go, run from 6:30am to 11pm daily. The ticketing counter opens at 6:30am and will be closed at 10:30pm daily. Alternatively, there is a tarred road known popularly as the \\"jeep track\\". It is open only to the vehicles of hill residents. The \\"jeep track\\" is also used by off-road motorcycle enthusiasts to traverse up the steep terrain. It is a popular hiking route. It begins at the quarry at the entrance of the Penang Botanic Gardens and it takes a two- or three-hour leisurely hike to reach the top. Some of the more famous pit stops at the mountain are 52 and 84. At these pit stops, a view of the island is visible to hikers, who are able to get some water and tea prepared by locals stationed on the hill. Eighty Four is the last pit stop before the top of Penang Hill‚Äîapproximately forty-five more minutes from 84. Penang Hill Railway passing loop Jalan Sultan Yahya Petra, more commonly known as Summit Road, leads from the top station to the western part of the hill right towards Western Hill and Tiger Hill. The eastern face of Penang Hill is well served by a series of roads and paths, for example, Moniot Road, Viaduct Road, and Tunnel Road. Moniot Road is named after a Frenchman, Michael Jules Moniot who surveyed it between 1846 and 1855. Moniot Road has been declared a Heritage Trail in 1995 by the Governor of Penang. A system of bridle paths forms a picturesque labyrinth of walks connecting the different bungalows. Indian penal servitude prisoners shipped from Bencoolen, Sumatra to Penang during the second half of the 19th century built these by-paths. Numerous trekking trails lead from various starting points in the lowlands to Penang Hill. The more popular trails include the Moongate Trail, trail from Air Itam Dam to Tiger Hill, trail from Hye Keat Estate and trail from the Municipal Park (formerly Youth Park). Some of the trails are used by farmers to transport produce to the markets of Balik Pulau and Air Itam. Climate George Town viewed from Penang Hill The most important feature of Penang Hill is the cooler climate. The core summit area has an average temperature ranging from 20¬∞ to 27 ¬∞C. The mean minimum temperature is consistently below 21 ¬∞C. The hottest months are between December and April while the coolest months are between June and October. It is generally 5 degrees cooler than Georgetown. Plant and animal life =Flora= The most common forest type found on Penang Hill is the hill dipterocarp forest.Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. Growing at higher altitudes are some of the submontane oak-laurel as well as coniferous trees. The tree fern which is normally associated with higher elevations is also found growing here. Penang Hill is scientifically important as a type site of many Malaysian plant species. In the past, botanists came here to collect plants for herbaria around the world. It is an area rich in biodiversity and has a great number of endemic species, some of which are so rare that their existence is endangered. The rare and endangered species include the parasitic plant Exorhopalia ruficeps, which grows in the shady and damp undergrowth. The Penang Slipper Orchid (Paphiopedilum barbatum) is fast becoming over-collected and disappearing. The endangered witch hazel Maingaya malayana was rediscovered years ago and has since been propagated. =Fauna= Large mammals are not found on Penang Hill. Wild boars, small and medium-sized mammals such as the squirrels, monkeys and tree shrews can be seen. A number of species found in these hills are nocturnal. These include the civets, flying lemurs, flying civets and bats. In the evenings, the characteristic calls of the cicadas and crickets are often heard. If one is discerning enough, the stick insect and leaf mantis may be found well-camouflaged among the vegetation. Penang Hill has a rich bird fauna. Over 100 species or about 80% of the birds found on Penang Island have been recorded here. They range from the common garden species to rare deep forest inhabitants.  Attractions  = The Habitat Penang Hill = The Habitat Penang Hill offers the most complete and educational Malaysian rainforest experience and is located less than 10km from the UNESCO World Heritage Site of George Town in Penang. Explore their 1.6km Nature Trail which is steeped in history as it was first built in the early 1800s by the British East India Company on the edge of a forest reserve protected since 1911.

She was crowned Miss Lebanon 1970 and represented Lebanon at Miss World but failed to place. Months later, 1971, she represented Lebanon at Miss Universe and won, making her the first Lebanese and Middle Eastern woman to win the title. She is currently a main beauty pageant judge for the Miss Lebanon contest and is the current wife of Lebanese singer and actor Walid Toufic. Biography Rizk was born in Beirut in a Christian household, to a Lebanese father and Hungarian mother. Prior to marrying Rizk's father, her mother was married to an Italian by the name of Rossi. That union produced a daughter (Rizk's half-sister), fashion designer Felicina Rossi. She was crowned Miss Lebanon 1970 and represented Lebanon at Miss World but failed to place. Months later, 1971, she represented Lebanon at Miss Universe and won. She was crowned in the Miss Universe pageant in 1971 in Miami Beach, Florida, United States. She was the first woman from the Middle East and the fourth woman from Asia to win the title. In the pageant, she made a memorable fashion statement by wearing a very revealing top and hotpants. The 1972 Miss Universe pageant was held in Cerromar Beach Hotel in Dorado, Puerto Rico. On 30 May 1972, a month before the pageant telecast, 17 Christian pilgrims from Puerto Rico along with other victims, were killed during an attack at the Lod Airport in Israel (now Ben Gurion International Airport). The massacre was perpetrated by three members of the Japanese Red Army on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Due to the possible retaliation from the massacre, Rizk was not allowed to attend the Miss Universe Pageant to crown her successor in Puerto Rico. Personal life Prior to winning the pageant and at the time of her crowning she dated a French university chemistry student named Philippe Duke. She stated in a press conference in 1971 that she approved of pre-marital sex stating \\"we must have lots of experience\\" and that \\"marriage is not a simple thing\\". Rizk would later claim that her comments were misquoted and what she really meant was she approved of pre-marital sex but only with someone you loved or planned to marry. Rizk then married Ali Hassan Salameh, a Palestinian who was chief of operations for Black September and founder of Force 17. The couple spent their honeymoon in Hawaii, and then stayed at Disneyland. When Rizk got pregnant, she returned to Beirut. Salameh was killed in 1979 by the Mossad. Salameh had been identified as a key participant in the Munich massacre, and was killed as part of Operation Wrath of God. After a couple of years, she married the renowned Lebanese singer Walid Toufic in 1990, and has two children with him. She is a judge for the Miss Lebanon competitions. She has a son Ali Salameh (b. 1979) from her first marriage to Salameh; she was six months pregnant when Salameh was assassinated. Her sister was jailed in Syria for murdering her own husband. In addition to Arabic, she can speak English, French and Italian. Rizk said she learned Italian from her Italian half-sister, fashion designer Felicina Rossi. Rizk has a Canadian maternal nephew known as Ty Wood. Role in the Arab- Israeli conflict and Lebanese civil war Even though she was a model who became a popular figure in her country for her achievements, despite never having any interest or aspirations to be involved in politics, Rizk was often involuntarily drawn into the regional conflict. This was largely due to the current political events at the time, with her country Lebanon caught up in the Arab-Israeli war and strategically positioned near the heart of the conflict. When she was competing in the Miss Universe 1971 contest based in Miami, Florida, she was reported to be on friendly terms with the Miss Israel contestant Etty Orgad which she \\"met and enjoyed knowing\\" according to Rizk. She also responded by stating \\"This is a beauty contest, not politics\\", and stated that the conflict \\"is the government's worry, not mine\\". In 1972, following the Lod Airport Massacre, where 17 Puerto Rican tourists, among others, in Israel were murdered by Japanese militant terrorists under the banner of the PLO, Rizk was forbidden to attend the Miss Universe 1972 in Puerto Rico to crown the title winner in fear of a revenge attack. She stated that she herself was scared to go in fear of what would happen. At the dawning and height of the Lebanese civil war in the mid 1970s she was again drawn into the conflict when she began a romantic relationship with Palestinian PLO militant and intelligence official Ali Hassan Salameh who was nicknamed \\"The Red Prince\\" due to his lavish lifestyle, playboy persona and bloodlust. Salameh was allegedly still married to his first wife Um Hassan when their affair began. The dates on which the pair married is widely disputed. Yasser Arafat was said to disapprove of their pre-marital relationship because it clearly broke traditional conservative Arab status quo, and he remained hostile to Georgina Rizk due to that. After her marriage, in keeping with Salameh's traditional Muslim background and conservative Palestinian culture Rizk quit her modeling and film careers, staying mostly at home. The couple were said to only be known to socialize with fellow wealthy Lebanese and Palestinians. According to close friends Rizk herself had no attachment to the Palestinian cause or supported the PLO, but instead was drawn to and motivated to marry Salameh purely out of love.

A turtle excluder device or TED is a specialized device that allows a captured sea turtle to escape when caught in a fisherman's net. In particular, sea turtles can be caught when bottom trawling is used by the commercial shrimp fishing industry. In order to catch shrimp, a fine meshed trawl net is needed. This results in large amounts of other marine organisms being also caught as bycatch. When a turtle gets caught or entangled in a trawl net, it becomes trapped and is unable to return to the surface. Since sea turtles are air- breathing creatures with lungs, they eventually drown. History The first TED, named the \\"Georgia Jumper,\\" was invented by Sinkey Boone of Darien, Georgia, US in the late 1960s. TEDs were later developed in the 1970s by Wil Seidel, who worked for NOAA. Some resistance to the use of TEDs has arisen from the belief that the use of the devices actually causes fishermen to lose shrimp and other targeted species. In 1987, the United States required all trawling shrimping boats to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices. As a follow-up two years after, the shrimp-turtle law was implemented. This required all countries that the USA was importing shrimp from to certify that the shrimp they shipped were harvested by boats equipped with TEDs. Countries that cannot guarantee the use of the escape devices were banned from exporting shrimp to the USA. In 1996, the Indian government proposed legislation for the requirement of modified \\"indigenous\\" TEDs, which they called TSDs (Turtle Saving Devices) to be used by local fishermen. This was a response to the declining olive ridley population that were nesting in beaches such as in Odisha. The modified TSDs were similar to standard TEDs except for having fewer bars. This resulted in the increase of the distance between each pair of bars to ensure that bigger specimens of shrimp and fish were able to pass through the TSD and into the net. Even in the United States use of TEDs is not universal. As of June 2010, the State of Louisiana has prohibited its marine enforcement officers from enforcing TED and tow time limits.  Mechanism  The use of the devices ideally allow all bycatch larger than ten centimeters (10 cm) to escape the nets unharmed. This selectivity is achieved by metal grids integrated into the trawl net structure. The grids act as a barrier for large creatures such as turtles from passing through the bars into the back of the net. A small opening in the net is then available either above or below the grid so that the creatures that are stopped by the TEDs are allowed to escape the net, relatively unharmed. Targeted species such as shrimp however, are pushed to the back of the net. The target design effectiveness of TEDs is 97%, but the field effectiveness is often far lower. Seagrasses and other debris reduce fishing effectiveness of TEDs and in some situations may block sea turtles from exiting the net.Decline of the Sea Turtles: Causes and Prevention, National Academy Press, 1990 pp147. In addition, it is easy to tamper with TEDs so as to increase the fishing efficiency of the net, while eliminating the turtle-excluding properties of the TED. Failings and drawbacks While turtle excluder devices have been somewhat successful in lessening sea turtle casualties as by-catch, they still have a few failings and drawbacks. It has been acknowledged that the larger sea turtles, primarily large loggerheads and leatherbacks are too large to fit through the escape hatches installed in most TEDs. These turtles remain trapped within the net and perish. U.S. legislation introduced in 2003 has attempted to address this issue by increasing the size of the escape chutes in the devices. It is difficult to enforce TED compliance as TEDs can reduce the efficiency of the net system, resulting in a loss of some of the catch. On a per boat basis, turtles are rarely caught, only one turtle per 322.5 hours in the Gulf of Mexico.Sheryan P. Epperly, Biology of Sea Turtles, Volume II, 2003, pp 342. This creates an incentive for the trawler to cheat. The catch loss can be eliminated by simply tying the turtle escape opening shut with a tie. The tie is removed when the vessel returns to port, thus avoiding detection by enforcement officers, but placing turtles at risk while trawling. It has been theorized that the spike in dead turtles seen in the Gulf of Mexico in June and July 2010 was due to shrimp boats that were taking advantage of lax marine enforcement due to the gulf oil spill. Occasionally TED use becomes impractical due to debris in the water. When a TED is clogged with debris, it can no longer catch fish effectively or exclude turtles. For example, in September 2008 following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) allowed temporary use of \\"Tow Times\\" in lieu of TEDs. Vessels were required to limit their tows to 55 minutes from the time the trawl doors entered the water until they were retrieved from the water. In June 2010 the limit was further reduced to 30 minutes. However, vessels were not equipped with tow time data loggers, so there was no practical method to enforce these time limits.Sea Turtle Conservation, Shrimp Trawling Requirements, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Parts 222 and 223 The TTED The TTED (Trash and Turtle Excluder Device) is a recent refinement of the TED, which, as well as turtles, can additionally free other forms of bycatch. The TTED reduces sorting time and risks of injury due to sharks and rays being caught, improves the quality of shrimps, which are less likely to be crushed in the bottom of the trawl, and may also lead to a reduction in the amount of fuel consumed by the boats. The TTED is the culmination of years of research. With funding provided by the European Union and the DIREN (Regional Environmental Authorities), WWF commissioned a study from IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) to determine which selective gear was the most adapted to fishing conditions in French Guiana. These initial trials, conducted under experimental conditions, were carried out on board a shrimp trawler. Following this work, shrimp industry's members expressed the need to continue these experiments and to become more involved in the project. In response, WWF and the CRPMEMG (French Guiana Regional Fishery and Ocean Farming Committee) began working in close collaboration in order to test and develop the best gear for the French Guiana fleet. With technical support from NOAA and IFREMER, the CRPMEMG carried out numerous at sea trials in close collaboration with French Guiana fleets. Specific parameters where tested such as the shape and spacing between the bars of the selective grid. These trials allowed the fleets and the crews on board the shrimp trawlers to understand the advantages of a more selective fishing gear and the benefits of using it in French Guiana. Based on the results and the captains‚Äô recommendations, the CRPMEMG decided to make the use of this TTED system mandatory by January 2010, when the annual fishing licences are issued.

Savage and lead singer Joe Elliott are the only two remaining original members of the band. The two of them, plus drummer Rick Allen, are also the only members of the band who have performed on every album. Biography Richard Savage was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England . Savage was educated at Tapton Secondary School in Sheffield. In his youth, he learned to play guitar along with his older brother. They played songs like Rod Stewart's \\"Maggie May\\" and Don McLean's \\"American Pie.\\" Savage also pursued a career as a professional football player with Sheffield United, despite his devotion to rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Savage ultimately chose music and formed a band with a few schoolmates including Tony Kenning and eventually Pete Willis. As Atomic Mass they mostly played Queen, Slade, Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix, and other popular covers of the time. At one point, they decided that Willis was the better guitar player so Savage picked up the bass guitar. Needing a singer, the band auditioned an acquaintance of Willis', Joe Elliott. They subsequently picked up guitarist Steve Clark and changed their name to Def Leppard. Savage contracted Bell's Palsy around 1994. This causes his facial muscles to weaken and become partially paralyzed. He has recovered, but effects of the disease are still visible, especially when he is fatigued. From an interview by Gordon Shearer on DefLeppard.com: :Shearer: \\"What about when you developed your Bell's Palsy? Did that change the way you dealt with things? Lots of gossip, lots of comments. I could imagine going from the position that you were in ‚Äì from ultimate rock sex god to....\\" :Savage: \\"It was hard to come to terms with and to understand why. I found it was easy to get into the 'why me?' syndrome. Partly because of the disability. It was more not being able to eat properly, or not being able to sleep without putting a patch on your eye because your eye wouldn't close, and things like that. The effect that it has on your everyday life was the hardest thing. In comparison, it was a very minor debilitating disease. It keeps you humble seeing what Rick Allen went through and how he had to deal with things. So, I would rather have not got the disease, but I did and you make the best of what you got\\". Personal life Savage is married to Paige Savage, with whom he has three children (one from Paige's prior relationship) Jordan, Tyler and Scott. The family moved to Enniskerry in 2013, but returned to Sheffield in 2016. Equipment Savage currently uses custom basses made by Jackson after endorsing Washburn XB920 (4-string) and XB925 (5-string) bass guitars from 1999 to 2009. He formerly used Hamer 4 and 5-string bass guitars for over 17 years, starting with their Gibson Explorer-inspired \\"Blitz\\" model during the High 'n' Dry and Pyromania albums from 1982 to 1985 and Hamer's modernistic take on the Explorer shape, the \\"Scarab\\" model of which he mainly used a white model during the Hysteria recording sessions and tour (although Savage continued to use a black-colored \\"Blitz\\" downtuned C#ADG for the hit single \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" which can be seen on their Live: In the Round, in Your Face live video/DVD, and a Scarab model in black with a reverse headstock was seen in the \\"Rocket\\" video and their performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1989) from 1985 to 1989. At the release of Adrenalize he used an array of Chaparral Max 5-string models in various colours including a black & white \\"Granite\\" finish, one with a variation of the Adrenalize album artwork custom painted on it, and a black- painted model from 1990 to 1999. Savage switched endorsements to Washburn basses in the middle of the promotion cycle for the Euphoria album in 1999, and a Natural Flame XB925 given to him by Washburn in 1999 has been his main instrument since then. However the custom painted Union Jack XB925 is his most well known bass, followed by the Saint George's Cross XB925, with both paint schemes reproduced on his new Jackson basses in 2009. He acquired two more of the Jackson basses, one in a grey-toned Union Jack scheme and the other painted in the colors of Sheffield Wednesday with the team's logo. He used these on the 2011 Mirrorball tour. Savage never has been a fingerstyle guitarist, relying entirely on a plectrum, or \\"pick\\". In an interview with Bass Guitar magazine, he stated: \\"I'm a terrible player with my fingers and I always play with a pick. I love to have consistency within the sound no matter where you are on the fretboard. I've found that when I play with fingers, notes jump out and others are too muted. It would be a nightmare for the sound engineer just trying to compress the thing to make sure there's an equal balance coming off the stage.\\"  Discography The Def Leppard E.P.

The pilgrim knights of Europe, encountering in the East these representations of Saint George, recognised their own accoutrements and at once adopted him as the patron of their noble calling. This popularity of Saint George in the West gave rise to numerous associations both secular and religious. Among secular orders of this name which still exist must be mentioned the English Order of the Garter, which has always had Saint George for its patron. The Kingdom of Aragon was placed under his patronage, and in gratitude for his assistance to its armies King Peter II of Aragon founded (1201) the Order of Saint George of Alfama in the district of that name. Nevertheless, this order received the approbation of the Holy See only in 1363 and had but a brief existence. With the approval of antipope Benedict XIII, it was amalgamated with the Aragonese Order of Montesa, and thereafter known as the Order of Montesa and Saint George of Alfama.

Due to its location adjacent to brain or spinal cord, epidural abscesses have the potential to cause weakness, pain, and paralysis. Types =Spinal Epidural Abscess= Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a collection of pus or inflammatory granulation between the dura mater and the vertebral column. Currently the annual incidence rate of SEAs is estimated to be 2.5-3 per 10,000 hospital admissions. Incidence of SEA is on the rise, due to factors such as an aging population, increase in use of invasive spinal instrumentation, growing number of patients with risk factors such as diabetes and intravenous drug use. SEAs are more common in posterior than anterior areas, and the most common location is the thoracolumbar area, where epidural space is larger and contains more fat tissue. SEAs are more common in males, and can occur in all ages, although highest prevalence is during the fifth and seventh decades of life. =Cranial epidural abscess= A cranial epidural abscess involves pus and granulation tissue accumulation in between the dura mater and cranial bone. These typically arise (along with osteomyelitis of a cranial bone) from infections of the ear or paranasal sinuses. They rarely can be caused by distant infection or an infected cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen. Symptoms include pain at the forehead or ear, pus draining from the ear or sinuses, tenderness overlying the infectious site, fever, neck stiffness, and in rare cases focal seizures. Treatment requires a combination of antibiotics and surgical removal of infected bone.

At around the same time, another group called Krash Kozz were the only group to introduce the new jack swing hip hop sound to Malaysian listeners, but they disbanded after their third album. And in 1991, hqa released baguvix, which was lit. Those were trying times, when the pioneers of the local hip hop scene were trying hard to break monotony of rock music, love ballads and pop sounds, which are staples in the Malaysian music scene, with the fans of these genres refusing to accept this new form of music. However, the younger generation, especially those in the urban areas, were more curious and receptive; they were more positively in- tuned to receive this new culture that was creating waves across the globe, which was further expedited and cemented by the introduction of records from American hip hop artists like the N.W.A, Brand Nubian, Gang Starr, Cypress Hill and many others. The Malaysian music scene was dominated by these poppy- sounding groups until 1995-1996, when Poetic Ammo, composed of Yogi B, Point Blanc, C. Loco & Land Slyde, came out with their classic album It's a Nice Day to Be Alive. Their first hit, \\"Everything Changes\\" revolutionized the local music industry. There were also groups from the underground scene that have established themselves such as Naughtius Maximus and The Rebel Scum, but it was Poetic Ammo that \\"made it big\\". Eventually, the group split up, with each member pursuing solo directions and found success in their own right. One of the \\"powerhouses\\" of hip hop in Malaysia is Too Phat, which consists of Malique and Joe Flizzow. They were signed to EMI International's Positive Tone division and produced their first hit album, Whutadilly and their first single was \\"Too Phat Baby\\". =Early Stages: 1980s= 1984, Malaysia is marked by the arrival of hip hop movies Breakin‚Äô (1984), Breakin‚Äô II: Electric Boogaloo (1984), and Beatstreet (1984). That same year, the biggest local movie of 1984, Azura, starring Jamal Abdillah and Fauziah Ahmad Daud, had a breakdancing scene in it. It spawned some local B-Boys and B-Girls but the development of the hip hop scene as a whole wouldn't happen until much later. In 1989, DJ and owner of Valentine Sound Production, Joe Siva began with KL deejay/rap-based group Krash Kozz, who went on to be the first major hip hop act of Malaysia. = The Beginnings: 1990‚Äì1994 = In 1990, Krash Kozz, releasing the group's debut Pump It!. With their mix of New Jack Swing melodies and Run DMC-influenced rap, Krash Kozz became a sensation in their home country, and even managed to chart on the Asia Billboard charts, one of the first Asian hip hop acts to do so. Siva later joined the group as their DJ. In 1992, a new line-up consisted of Najee, Noramin and Joe Siva- the group then released its self-titled four-song EP. In the same year, Siva hooked up with Mohd Firhad Amat and the friendship led to a musical change for Krash Kozz. Firhad, by the way, was the man who was responsible for introducing new jack swing (NJS) to the Malaysian public. He initiated the launch of NJS ‚Äì yup, it was a party to introduced the music style ‚Äì that was held at The Baze (the premier R&B;/hip-hop club then) in November 1992. In December 23 of that year, he and Siva had a phone conversation with Teddy Riley, the NJS Godfather, who told them to spread the NJS craze in this country. Well, Riley's wish was granted as Krash Kozz third album, New Jack The Streetbeat, that was released in April 1993, became a big hit. Recorded by the new line-up of Najee, Fawzi and Albert, the 10-song album is a collection of NJS tunes that were fused with elements of jazz, gospel, R&B;, classical rap and pop. Songs like the English version of Fiona (originally recorded by one of the first local pop-rap groups 4U2C), the group's interpretation of Berhati-Hati Di Jalanraya, Pada Kasih Cinta Berbunga and Give It All You've Got powered the album national success. It made NJS the hottest thing back then. It got so big that even the ‚ÄúKing of NJS‚Äù, Bobby Brown, flew into the country for a sold-out concert at Putra World Trade Centre's Merdeka Hall on May 3, 1993. On May 15, the first-ever Malaysian hip-hop gig, Konsert Rap Kuala Lumpur took place at the Life Centre in Jalan Sultan Ismail, KL.Apart from Krash Kozz, other groups that performed that day included Les Enfants, V.I.P., City Kids, Feminin, Res 2, D.E.F.X., M‚ÄôSteen, Give Me 5, Nico and Hasnol. While the rest of the performers were neither here nor there, groups like V.I.P. (a comedic hip-hop duo made of composer Benny Ardjuna and cartoonist Poe), Feminin (one of the first all-female pop-rap group) and D.E.F.X. (a seven-member group, comprising two MCs, Yogi and MC E.N.A., and five dancers), showed that the local hip-hop scene had the potential to go far. Speaking of D.E.F.X., they are arguably the next most important group after Krash Kozz in the development of the local hip-hop scene. Dubbed the human beatbox, 18-year-old Yogi was crowned the street rap king in Rappin‚Äô Badd, a contest organised by Central Market on Nov 22, 1992. E.N.A., meanwhile, was runner-up. Both also used to be with Krash Kozz. The group was supposed to cut an album after penning a deal with a record label called Common Networks Malaysia Sdn Bhd, but it never materialised. Krash Kozz, meanwhile, went on to achieve bigger things after the release of their third album. First, they were invited to perform at the First Asian Dance Music Convention in Manila alongside Lisa Stansfield, Black Machine and Apache Indian in June 1993. They then went on to perform at World DJ Mixing Finals that was held at Ministry of Sound in London in January 1994. Sadly, that was also their last performance as the group disbanded as soon as they arrived home in Malaysia... = Phase: 1994‚Äì1997 = THE break-up of Krash Kozz signalled, to an extent, the end of any hope of seeing a local English-medium hip-hop scene. With them no longer in existence, the only place people could get their local fix was from acts like 4U2C, KRU, Les Enfant, Nana Nurgaya and Nico ‚Äì but with all due respect, these acts, apart from Nico, cam hardly be classified as ‚Äòhip-hop‚Äô. In December 1994, we saw a ray of hope when a group called Poetic Ammunition (PMO) ‚Äì made up of former Krash Kozz Posse and D.E.F.X members Yogi B and MC E.N.A. ‚Äì released its debut single, Only You, on the newly formed Positive Tone. (After a deal to record an album fell through, D.E.F.X. had decided it was time for it to start afresh and with a new name to boot). On a chance visit to friend and lyricist Cahaya Pena at Kenny Music Studio, the duo bumped into producers and co-owners of Positive Tone, Paul Moss (formerly of Aishah and The Fan Club) and Kenny Tay. Both Yogi and E.N.A. performed an impromptu jam for Moss and Tay, and by the time they left the studio, they had a record deal. Musically, the reggaeton-sounding, Flying Pickett's cover was nothing to shout about, but the only original number on the set, Run, was unlike anything ever recorded by a Malaysian hip hop act. With its tight delivery, infectious hooks and ill beats, the song got a lot of music execs excited ‚Äì and it seemed, for a while, that the Malaysian hip-hop scene was back on the right path again. But that quickly proved not to be the case. After the single's release, nothing much was heard from PMO again. But there was a silver lining. Krash Kozz and PMO's trailblazing efforts spawned a legion of imitators. No, there was no sudden emergence of a local underground hip-hop scene ‚Äì but new acts were suddenly popping up all over the place. For instance, an East Coast hip-hop-inspired group, Whyness, released a six-track self-titled demo in 1994 ‚Äì and the same demo led to the formation of arguably Malaysia's first ever genuine hip-hop collective, Naughtius Maximus. Apart from members from Whyness ‚Äì Albert Chong (Albert), Ismail Mat Aris (Mail), Ramesh Anthony (Ramesh), Azrin Ishak (Ain), Hiresh Das (Hiresh), Calvin Choi (Illegal), Nicholas Choong (Nicky C), Remy Kalia Perumal (MiSta Rem), Azhar Majid (Dice), Zushahron Dina (Lady D), Nor Azhar (Spit), Francis Jesudas (Jungle Jerry) and Moses L Chan (Moe) ‚Äì the 13 member squad was also made up of three other different groups, Deceased, Under Pressure and Reffugeez. Naughtius Maximus circa 1995 Recorded within the space of four months at Digitron Studio, (legend has it that as the group hadn't the money to book studio time, they ‚Äústole‚Äù some booked by other acts), Naughtius Maximus‚Äô debut album was released on July 1, 1995, by Articulate Sound Sdn Bhd. Produced by Moe, the 13- song set featured three songs by Whyness, two tracks from Deceased, Reffugeez and Under Pressure each, and four songs by the collective. Musically, it is without a doubt Malaysia's first-ever genuine hip hop album, complete with the requisite beats, rhymes, attitude and spirit. If there was anything lacking, it was production quality. Still, songs like Here Comes Trouble, Whyness‚Äô Right On Time and Reffugeez's Ruff Wayz are still regarded as seminal classics by those who've been following the development of the local hip-hop music scene. But just when things were on the up-and-up for hip-hop in Malaysia, the local scene got a blow when nine of the songs were summarily banned by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) two months after the album was released. The reason given for the ban was that the album was ‚Äútoo Westernised‚Äù. The ban was a blessing in disguise the status of being banned immediately made the group and hip-hop music notorious ‚Äì a factor that has a big appeal, especially among the youth. As for the majority of music lovers previously unfamiliar with the genre, the controversy raised curiosity levels enough that many decided to find out what the fuss was all about. The ban halted the collective's progress, as, by 1996, most of its members were already doing their own thing, both inside and outside music. Illegal and Moses went on to become one of Malaysia's most respected hip-hop producers; Lady D went on to form Emberz of Soul, Jungle Jerry and Nicky C went on to make their names in the local clubbing and DJ circuit. Overall though, 1996 was a pretty quiet year for hip-hop. However, below their radar, a scene was slowly developing. Very little information about the underground hip-hop scene at that time is available today, but we do know that two groups were active at the time: Poetic Ammo (with Yogi B as the sole member after MC E.N.A. left in 1995); and Def Rhyme (featuring brother, Land Slyde (Chandrakumar Balakrishnan) and C Loco (Sashi Kumar Balakrishnan). These two groups would later converge to become Poetic Ammo, with the final piece of the jigsaw coming from the then-16-year-old Wu- Tang Clan-devotee from Ipoh, Point Blanc (Nicholas Ong). The expanded Poetic Ammo then spent most of 1996 recording their debut, It's A Nice Day To Be Alive ‚Äì the album that was going to change the future of local hip hop music... =On the Verge of an Explosion: 1997‚Äì1999= ‚ÄúIT was living hell. We slept on the floor; there were times when we had to collect money from each one of us to buy Maggi Mee to eat,‚Äù Yogi B of Poetic Ammo told me about the recording process of It's A Nice Day To Be Alive in an unpublished interview that was conducted in Feb 2003.‚ÄúIt was a very tough time for us. We invested a lot of money in the album. We even slept in the studios at one point,‚Äù said Joe Flizzow, one half of Too Phat in the Press statement to announce the release of their debut album, Whutthadilly? on Dec 30, 1999. Sacrifices and undying passion for the art form are, without a doubt, important factors that led to the explosion of Malaysian hip-hop in the later part of the 1990s. It is a requirement, if one thinks about it. Especially when good hip hop references and expertise when it came to producing and cooking up the beats were almost non-existent back then. If we got it right, the only ‚Äúserious‚Äù composers and producers then were Illegal, G-Soul and Yogi B. And the latter was a producer by default as he had to produce Ammo's debut, It‚Äôs A Nice Day To Be Alive. ‚ÄúIt was like having to make couple of beautiful vases and having to learn how to mould the clay at the same time‚Äù, Yogi said back then. Tough or not, the impossible was achieved when his group's first single Everything Changes was released on January 5, 1998, to positive response and glowing praises. In hindsight, its success is now understandable. The R&B-tinged; hip-hop number was too hard to resist for any casual music listener or radio programme manager. The inclusion of Landslyde and C Loco (from the group Def Rhyme ‚Äì those who are old enough might remember them from Asia Bagus) and Point Blanc (from Ipoh's rap group, Da‚Äô Funk Squad) have also added more depth and packed a stronger punch that made Ammo a tighter unit at that time. When it was released on February 23, 1998, It's A Nice Day To Be Alive took what Naughtius Maximus did on their debut three years ago to a completely new level. Musically, it may not be the most original ‚Äì there's Bone Thugs N‚Äô Harmony ( It's A Nice Day To Be Alive; Cypress Hill (especially C Loco's style of delivery); Wu Tang Clan Approximate Detonation flavour here and there ‚Äì but tracks like Peluru Puitis, Vallavan and the remake of Samuel Hui's Kah Sang Tah Kong Chai was unlike anything produced here before. Lyrically, it was evident the quartet did try to keep it as local as possible, which they did to a certain extent, especially on songs like Everything Changes and Peluru Puitis. Of course, there were glaring weaknesses ‚Äì feeble selection of words in the rhymes here and there, not-so- fluid song arrangements ‚Äì but compared to anything that was released earlier, the album was the best at its time and remains a seminal release. The group, however, had to wait for almost a year before they could reap the fruits of their success.‚ÄúWe nearly gave up at first because sales weren‚Äôt great. There wasn‚Äôt an English hip hop scene then, and not many people in Malaysia knew what the music was all about,‚Äù Yogi B said. =On the Verge of an Explosion: 1997‚Äì1999= Less than a year before Poetic Ammo dropped its debut It's A Nice Day To Be Alive in 1998, underground gigs, a key factor that contributed to the development of local hip-hop, was mushrooming. Though it's far from being an underground gig per se, the Youthquake Malaysia Tour in 1996 did, to a certain extent, spread awareness and interest in hiphop. Spread across five states ‚Äì Penang, Ipoh, Kuantan, Johor Bharu and Kuala Lumpur ‚Äì the tour had R&B; group Soulstreet (its former member includes composer/producer Damian Seet of VE) and a rapper known as Johan Ishak performing at each stop alongside OAG. The impact may not be as powerful as the underground gigs but it's no denying that both Soulstreet and Johan offered suburban kids a different take on the music, especially in its attitude. The first local underground hip-hop gig took place in Malibu Cafe in November 1997. The organiser, believe it or not, was Nazri Noran of now-defunct pioneering rap- rock group Projekt AK and who is now with the hitz.fm Morning Crew. Performing that day were Naugtius Maximus, Innuendo, Suspicious (a rap group from Penang), Soulstreet and Da‚Äô Joint. Speaking of Da‚Äô Joint, it's important to take note that the trio ‚Äì G (Jeyakumar Letchmanan), Sam Sneeze (Samir Sharman) and Rez (Syed Riza Al- Attas) ‚Äì were among the first of the third generation local hip hop acts that emerged in the mid-‚Äô90s. In 2000, the group‚Äôs debut single B.A.N.G.S.A.R. peaked at No. 1 spot on hitz.fm Malaysian English Top 10. Three years later the band released an EP, Sound Therapy via Ruff Selecta Entertainment which gave them two more hits singles, Livin‚Äô In The Streets and After Party. The group disbanded a couple of years back and Samir's now pursuing a solo career. His debut album Reinvented was released late last year and was a success, thanks to hits like R U Ready, Let's Go and Dikir Berbisa. Other notable groups that came out about the same time (1997-1999) were First Borne Troopz (which would later become Teh Tarik Crew), SickSiderz, ILLustrait (members of both group would later converge and form The Rebel Scum), Integrated Soul, Pac of Doja, M.O.B. (Members Of Blood; one of its former members include Sein of Ruffedge) and of course, Too Phat. The seed of the group can be traced in 1997 when a then 17-year-old Subang Jaya kid called Joe Flizzow and the then 19-year-old Muar-based Malique decided to form a creative alliance after an infamous rap battle on the Net. In November that year, after completing his A-Levels, Malique migrated to KL, and together with Joe and Doctah K (Kevin Felix) who later rejoined local underground band Foreground Division, they embarked on a journey that would take them beyond their wildest imagination. It's unclear when did the group call themselves Too Phat, but in an interview with the now-defunct TONE magazine in their April 2001 issue, both said Too Phat was the first name that came to mind after a gig organiser asked them for a group name to be included in a gig flyer. Other names that were also in consideration were Way Too Phat and Nickel and Rhymes.‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt sure whether we wanted to stick with Too Phat or not,‚Äù Malique said in the interview.‚ÄúYeah. We said okay lah, we‚Äôll come up with this name Too Phat, then in the future if we don‚Äôt like it, we‚Äôll change,‚Äù Joe added. It stuck, of course. When a sound engineering friend wanted a group to record for his course assignment, the group jumped on the opportunity. The result was a demo that would soon make its round in the local underground hip-hop circuit. Most importantly, it landed the group a slot at A Tribute To East Coast and West Coast gig that took place in Malibu Cafe on March 28, 1998, where they performed alongside Poetic Ammo, Soulstreet, Suspicious and C‚ÄôEst La Vie. From there, the group went on to establish a reputation as one of the hottest underground hiphop acts in town largely for their slick rhyming, energetic stage persona, and also two of the underground hits, Higgedy Hey and I'll Be Missing Your P, the group interpolation of Puff Daddy's I'll be Missing You. While the underground scene was swamped with activities, above ground, Ammo was slowly seeing the reward from their hard work, thanks to Who Be The Player ‚Äì a song that was not on their debut, but on the country's first ever local R&B;/hip-hop compilation, Tricks & Tales. Released by Positive Tone on Dec 22, 1998, the main highlight of the 10-song compilation had to be the comeback tune by Naughtius Maximus (M.V.P. and Born Ready). Other highlights include the fact that it broke Ferhad into the mainstream scene with Soul In Me and Believe. It introduced Reefa, (arguably) the first solo MC in the country; and Naughtius Maximus alumnae, Lady D's new duo in a group, Emberz Of Soul. It was a perfect documentation of the ‚Äúsemi‚Äù underground local hip-hop scene. But to those who were familiar with the underground scene, the inclusion of Too Phat would have made the set more comprehensive. Over the next 12 months, Dec 1998 to Dec 1999, Malaysian hiphop was all about Poetic Ammo. In April 1999, the group was named Best New English Artiste at Anugerah Industri Muzik (AIM) while It's A Nice Day To Be Alive was Best English Album. As a result of their wins, album sales rocketed to 15,000 copies in a span of less than a month; and having the music video for Everything Changes nominated in the South-East Asia Viewers‚Äô Choice Award category at the 1999 MTV Video Music. Some felt, and said, that it was the pinnacle of the thriving scene, but how wrong they were. Well, these people were not to be blame as no one was prepared for Whuttadilly? =1998‚Äì2000= ‚ÄúWE are not malu of, or regret The World Is Yours, as it‚Äôs a part of the Ammo chapter. It was commercial and it was pop, and some people didn‚Äôt like it. But it was us, nevertheless‚Äù. That was what one-half of Poetic Ammo, Point Blanc, told this writer in an unpublished interview in February 2003 in the wake of their comeback-of-sorts album, Return Of Tha Boombox. In the Malaysian hip hop scene, if the years 1998 to 2000 were all about Ammo, the period 2001 to this day is all about Too Phat. There were many reasons for this power shift ‚Äì by 2001, Ammo were more well known for their endorsement deals than their music. It also didn't help that the follow-up to 2000's It's A Nice Day To Be Alive was exactly as Point described: commercial and pop. Flashback to 1998: with a reputation as the hottest thing in the thriving local underground hip hop scene, the trio Malique, Joe Flizzow and Doctah K were offered a deal to record an EP by the now defunct Strange Culture Records (SCR), which was then the label for local fringe music. The group recorded two songs, Give It Up and Whutthadilly?, with SCR before parting ways with the label in July 1998. Determined to finish what they've started, the group, who had by then became a duo when Doctah K left to sing with a hardcore band called Foreground Division, decided to complete the album using their own resources. In between recording sessions, they were also actively performing on the underground gig circuit. And their biggest, if not most important gig, was The Panasonic Hip-Trip that was held at Sunway Lagoon Amphitheatre in late 1999. Performing alongside Farah, Shayna, Taheera, VE, Soulstreet, Da Joint, Naughtius Maximums, Prisheella (one of the earliest local female MCs to emerge), Vandal, Poetic Ammo, KamiKrazie, DJ Ken, DJ Face, DJ T-Bone and DJ Goldfish, Malique and Joe Flizzow stole the show that day with their strong stage presence, obvious talent and very hooky number, Too Phat Baby. The first single off their yet-to-be-released debut was premiered and went down well with the 2,000-strong crowd that day. The buzz on Too Phat on the street was at an all-time high but the duo had to wait until their debut album was 90 percent complete before they could get a record label to notice their potential. How they finally ended up with Positive Tone is a classic record industry tale. The label's managing director Ahmad Izham Omar (now 8TV chief executive officer) happened to hear one of the tracks off Whutthadilly? when one of the album producers were working on it. Word has it that Izham was completely blown away and demanded a meeting with the group immediately. Things got even more exciting after they officially became a Positive Tone artist in Oct 1999. In November, an unmastered studio mix of Lil‚Äô Fingaz leaked on the radio and surprisingly, became hitz.fm's Most Wanted Hit.Lil‚Äô Fingaz's considerable success was overtaken by the Too Phat Baby when it was released in early December. Finally, after almost a year-long struggle, Whutthadilly? finally saw the light of day on Dec 31, 1999. Produced by Illegal, G-Soul, Haze and the boys themselves, the 15-track album established a whole new set of standards for production, image, presentation and most importantly, rapping in the local hip hop scene. To call it the perfect hip- hop album (by Malaysian standards at that time) may be an overstatement, but considering how very few missteps were made by Malique and Joe, Whutthadilly? was indeed local hip-hop at its finest. Album highlights were aplenty, from the intros sampled from artists as diverse as Sharifah Aini's (Seiring Sejalan) and Kool & The Gang (Too Hot), to the interpolation in Too Phat Baby and heck, even the demo mix of Whutthadilly?, the album is one big irresistible effort. Musical genius aside, there were two other interesting things the boys did. The duo roped in and introduced up-and-coming underground cats by inviting them to guest on the album. Acts who were literally unknown beyond the local underground scene, Ruffedge (Too Phat Baby); and First Borne Troopz and G from Da‚Äô Joint (Skoo Tha Nonsense) were allowed to shine alongside Tricks And Tales alumni like Reefa (Bla, Bla), Lady Dee (bo-M.O.-h). Their other, less generous act was to put down Poetic Ammo in one of the tracks. In bo-M.O.-h, Malique and Joe mocked Poetic Ammo for claiming to be what they were ‚Äì the leader of the pack in the local hip-hop game. It was undoubtedly the first local diss track ‚Äì okay, Krash Kozz and KRU also dissed each other in their tracks in their time, but they were nowhere near this: ‚ÄúAight man? everybody know ain‚Äôt nothing real/Check the CD cover wit‚Äô the classic clown appeal/and still it kinda beats me how you got that record deal/Wit‚Äô no skills, why you tryin so hard to B-Real?‚Äù raps Malique in the first verse.‚ÄúDamn, at first you brought some hope into the game/Now it ain‚Äôt the same, probably fame got you lame,‚Äù adds Joe in the second verse. Ammo lashed back in the song We Hit \`Em Up Too in their second album saying: ‚ÄúI gave you love but you wanna show me hate/Watcha gonna do when it‚Äôs too late/It‚Äôs about the time why don‚Äôt you tell em‚Äô why/Cos back here We Hit Em‚Äô Up Too‚Äù (Yogi B); ‚ÄúYou dissed my album cover bein‚Äô clownish but yours be worse/Cos your s* be lookin‚Äô something straight from the circus/For real though now you phat with that lady in your clique‚Äù says Point. ‚ÄúWe were cool then, you had beef with the other peeps and/Now you got an album, you wanna skoo the nonsense?/Ha! Ha! You see my prominence is imminent/Why you tryin‚Äô so hard so be Eminem?/You visionary? More like fictionary,‚Äù continues C Loco. What triggered that was hard to tell as both parties naturally had their own version of stories, but oh, what fun it was for the fans. It‚Äôs the closest the Malaysia hip-hop rap scene has come to a gang war, and the kids in the local scene were quickly split into two main camps: The Phat Family and Ammo‚Äôs D‚ÄôAlliance.  Rhyming in Malay  The roots of rap in Bahasa Melayu can be traced back to the year 1992. In that year alone, the local music industry saw debut albums by three rap groups ‚Äì KRU, 4U2C and Les Enfant. First to be released was the self-titled debut album by seven-piece rap combo, 4U2C. Under the guidance of Zman Productions, the group‚Äôs album was a success thanks to the song Fiona. The album then went on to sell more than 40,000 copies and opened a lot of eyes on the potential of rap music here. Their music may be leaning more towards pop than hip hop but no one can deny the fact that songs like Kami Rappers and 2BD#1 gave us the first taste on how rapping in Bahasa Malaysia would sound like. Despite having international names like T Kelly and Billy Steinberg producing their album, Les Enfants‚Äô, Permulaan didn't have that much of impact, well, except for the fact that the four group members were barely in their teens when the album was released. Claiming to be The Real Rap Group (TRRG), KRU's debut album Canggih, like 4U2C's was a commercial success. Just for the record, the success led them and 4U2C to a few years ‚Äúfeud‚Äù on who's the best rap group in town. Another group, Nico, may not achieve the same amount of success and attention like 4U2C and KRU, but they were the first group to succeed with their attempt to excellently flow to properly written rhymes in Bahasa Malaysia and sill exist until today with their original members Nico, Dino and Affa. Songs like Inilah Nasibku, Public Figure and Deng Kang Kong Lepak would be a testament to the statement above. In the following year, one of the first English-medium hip hop groups, Krash Kozz had a minor hit with the song Berhati-hati Di Jalanraya. Feminin, the first all-girl ‚Äúrap‚Äù group who released their album in the same year also scored a hit for themselves with the song Untukmu. The rap in Bahasa Melayu boom anyhow was a very brief one. By 1995, most of the acts are nowhere to be seen, well apart from KRU, who would later enjoy success as a pop group. Apart from some songs by KRU and Nico, none of these rap groups really managed to deliver solid rhymes in Bahasa Melayu that would become like a benchmark to the genre. As a matter of fact, most of these groups did more damage than good when it comes to rhyme in Bahasa Melayu. In 1997, a group who called themselves Poetic Ammo, planted the seed for the second wave of Malaysian rappers with their debut album, It's a Nice Day to be Alive. The multi-lingual album ‚Äì it had songs in Bahasa Melayu, Tamil, Cantonese and English ‚Äì delivered some sparks when it comes to rhyming in Bahasa Melayu as can be heard on the song Peluru Puitis. Heavily influenced by Cypress Hill's beats, the song for the first time saw Bahasa Melayu vocabulary used intelligently to complement hip hop's beats. Not yet definitive, but substantial enough to become a template for future MCs. Three years later in 2000, Ammo perfected their art of rhyming Bahasa Melayu on the song Tiada Tandingan (featuring the voice of Sheila Majid) that was featured on their second album, The World is Yours. Choppier and tighter, the song strengthens that if done properly, rhyming in Bahasa Melayu can actually sound interesting and refreshing. It was the first multilingual album in Malaysia and it has the first Tamil rap song in the world, Vallavan, which gained Yogi B recognition as the world‚Äôs first Tamil hip hop artist. The album went on to win the award for best English album at the Anugerah Industri Musik (AIM) awards in 1999, while Yogi B was named the best new English artist. Poetic Ammo‚Äôs success continued with their second album from 2000, The World is Yours, while their fan base spread to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia. After the release of their third album from 2003, Return of Tha‚Äô Boombox, Poetic Ammo called it a day, but Yogi B has continued making waves in the music industry. In 2006, he collaborated with the duo Natchatra ‚Äì rappers Dr Burn and Emcee Jesz ‚Äì on the album Vallavan, which brought Tamil hip-hop to an international audience and brought them success in India. In 2002, Too Phat who by then have already established themselves as the biggest and most popular hip hop group in this country further reaffirm the fact that it is possible to rhyme in Bahasa Melayu and sound international on their third album 360 Degrees. Both its members Malique and Joe Flizzow took turn to spit rhymes in Bahasa Melayu on the second verse of the song Ala Canggung. The duo took a step further when the Bahasa Melayu version of Alhamdulillah and Ala Canggung that was featured on the Platinum Edition of 360 Degrees became huge commercial hits when it was released last year. Throughout the late 2000s, Malay rap has further evolved itself. It moved from becoming a gimmick to a form of art which could stand on its own.

Matthew Paris mentions that Henry III of England authorized them to open a house in a suburb of Cambridge in 1257; but he does not mention their founder, where they originated, and their history. Their habit was similar to that of the Dominicans and that a red star, whose five rays emanated from an azure centre, decorated the breast of their cape. This was in commemoration of the star that appeared to the Magi and led them to Bethlehem. Nothing further is known of this military order. There was an order of knights whose members wore a red star on their costume because of having a house in Bethlehem at the time of the Crusades; this was the Military Order of Crusaders of the Red Star (Ordo militaris crucigerorum cum rube√¢ stell√¢). They came from Palestine to Bohemia in 1217, and Blessed Agnes of Bohemia confided two hospitals to their charge. They have since remained in that country where they devote themselves to the care of the sick, to education, and to the various works of the ecclesiastical ministry. After the taking of Constantinople by the Turks (1453), Pius II founded the Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem. The purpose of these knights was to defend the Island of Lemnos which Cardinal Louis, Patriarch of Aquileia, had recaptured from Mohammed II. The island was to be their headquarters from which they were to oppose the attacks of the Muslims by way of the √Ügean Sea and the Hellespont. The order was composed of brother- knights and priests governed by an elective grand-master. The white costume worn by the members was decorated with a red cross and the rule prescribed for them was very similar to that of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The pope founded this community on 18 January 1459. To supply their needs, the pope turned over to them the property and revenues of older orders which no longer fulfilled their purpose, such as: the Order of Saint Lazarus, Sainte- Marie du Ch teau des Bretons, Bologna, Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Santo Spirito in Sassia, St. Mary of the Crossed Friars, and St. James of Lucca, all of which were suppressed for this purpose. Pius II alluded in a Bull to this foundation and the bravery of its knights, but the second capture of Lemnos by the Turks rendered the institution useless. Thus the order of Our Lady of Bethlehem was suppressed almost as soon as founded and those orders whose goods the pope had transmitted to it were re-established.

Me√Ør Aron Goldschmidt (October 26, 1819 ‚Äì August 15, 1887) was a Danish publisher, journalist and novelist. He was the founding editor of the satirical and political magazine Corsaren. Biography Goldschmidt was born in Vordingborg, Denmark but raised in Copenhagen. He was the son of Aron Goldschmidt (1792-1848) and Lea Levin Rothschild (1797-1870). He belonged to a strictly orthodox Jewish family of merchants. He attended the University of Copenhagen where one of this instructions was Danish theologia Henrik Nicolai Clausen (1793‚Äì1877). He took artium in 1836, graduating with a degree in philology. His meeting with classical Greek culture changed much of his attitude and made him try to balance between Jewish and non-Jewish thoughts. Especially the Greek idea of Nemesis impressed him and imbued much of his later works. In 1837 he founded Pr√¶st√∏ Amts Tidende which in 1839 merged with Callundborg Ugeblad to become Sj√¶llandsposten. He sold that in 1840 and in the same year founded the weekly political and satirical Corsaren where, under the cover of different editors, he criticised the king. As the real editor, he was sentenced to prison and a fined with future censorship on June 7, 1843, in the Supreme Court. In 1846 Goldschmidt sold Corsaren. Goldschmidt had previously praised S√∏ren Kierkegaard for his Either/Or, but the friendship was destroyed after continued attack on Kierkegaard appeared in Corsar. In the years 1847-1859 he ran a political magazine called Nord og Syd. To broaden his horizons culturally and politically, Me√Ør Aron Goldschmidt visited Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland. About 1860 he stopped his career as an opinion former and concentrated on literature. His literature shows an interest in the metaphysical and philosophical. His first novel En J√∏de (1845; Eng. transl. A Jew, 1990) is the first description of the Copenhagen Jewish milieu viewed from within. The large novel Hjeml√∏s (1853) deals with the idea of Nemesis and so does the important Arvingen (1865), the first Danish fine literary treatment of divorce. Very valuable are his tales and novellas dealing with Jewish individuals described in a special mixture of irony and sympathy. Not seldom realism is broken by a special mysticism.

He had a brief spell at English club Manchester United. Club career =Italy= Taibi started his career for Licata until 1989. He appeared only once, before moving to Trentino, where he was a first-choice goalkeeper, playing 23 matches. After one season, he moved to Milan in Serie A for the 1990‚Äì91 season. As in his first club, he was not used at all, and shortly moved to Como, where he played the following season. After that he moved to Piacenza. Taibi stayed there for five seasons, until the 1996‚Äì97 season, and appeared for most of the club's games. Piacenza thought his time was over, so they sold him to the club which had not played him, Milan. This time, Milan played him in half of the 1997‚Äì98 season's games as a backup to teammate Sebastiano Rossi. Then Milan sold him to Venezia in 1998. In his first season with Venezia, he played in nearly every game. =Manchester United= In 1999, Manchester United purchased Taibi for ¬£4.5 million, requiring a new goalkeeper after Peter Schmeichel had left for Sporting Lisbon after winning the treble and injuries to both their 1st and 2nd choice goalkeepers: Mark Bosnich and Raimond van der Gouw respectively. He made his debut against Liverpool, where he flapped at a free kick, allowing Sami Hyypi√§ to score. However, he later made a number of saves, including a one-on-one save from Vladim√≠r ≈†micer. United went on to win 3‚Äì2 with Taibi getting the Man of the Match award. Once Bosnich and van der Gouw recovered from their injuries, Taibi competed with them for the first-team place, but lost out after a gaffe against Southampton in September 1999 that resulted in Matthew Le Tissier scoring a goal, for which he became synonymous. This match led to Taibi being dubbed 'The Blind Venetian' by one newspaper. He only played four matches, one of them a 5‚Äì0 defeat at Chelsea, United's first league defeat since losing to Middlesbrough in December 1998. =Return to Italy= In January 2000, Taibi joined Reggina on loan until the end of the season, where he played regularly. After the loan spell ended, Manchester United made it clear that ‚Äì although Taibi was available for transfer ‚Äì another loan deal was out of the question, rejecting a bid from Napoli. In July 2000, Manchester United agreed to allow Taibi to rejoin Reggina for a fee of ¬£2.5 million. On 1 April 2001, Taibi scored a goal with a header off a corner kick in the 87th minute against Udinese to equalise the score final score to a 1‚Äì1 draw at home. With the goal, Taibi was the second goalkeeper to score from open play in Serie A history after Michelangelo Rampulla in 1992. After the 2000‚Äì01 season finished in relegation for Reggina, he was shifted to Atalanta as a replacement of Ivan Pelizzoli. In the summer of 2005, he went on loan to Torino, serving as first-choice goalkeeper; the move became permanent in 2006, with Taibi however becoming the backup goalkeeper behind Christian Abbiati. He made his seasonal debut on 13 January 2007. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, he joined Ascoli, as Torino acquired the services of Matteo Sereni. Taibi played 47 matches, before he announced his retirement from football in 2009. Style of play A centre-forward in his youth, whose role model was Roberto Boninsegna, Taibi later switched to the position of goalkeeper. He was known in particular for his penalty-saving abilities as a shot-stopper. Taibi played a total of 292 Serie A games between 1993 and 2007; during his career he stopped 12 spot kicks in the Italian top‚Äìflight, the joint‚Äìninth‚Äìmost penalties saved in Serie A history, alongside Emiliano Viviano, Luigi Turci, and Giuseppe Taglialatela.

The giraffe weevil is sexually dimorphic, with the neck of the male typically being 2 to 3 times the length of that of the female. Most of the body is black with distinctive red elytra covering the flying wings. The total body length of the males is just under an inch (2.5 cm), among the longest for any attelabid species. The extended neck is an adaptation that assists in nest building and fighting.

DMDK launched a vigorous campaign to defeat DMK; it made a resolution to call all parties to come together to defeat the ruling DMK in a conference held in Salem on 8 January, presided over by its leader Vijayakanth. S. Ramadoss, leader of Pattali Makkal Katchi, expressed his dissatisfaction with people from the film industry ruling Tamil Nadu since 1967. He also urged voters not to vote for Vijayakanth with his long career as a Tamil actor. Following the election, Jayalalithaa and Vijayakanth had exchanges in the assembly that started the rift between the two parties. Due to this reason, Vijayakanth got separated from AIADMK.

He married Premalatha on 31 January 1990 and has two sons named Vijaya Prabhakaran and Shanmuga Pandian, the latter being a film actor. Upon entering the film industry to pursue an acting career, he changed to \\"Vijayakanth\\", dropping the \\"Raj\\" out of his name and suffixing it with \\"Kanth,\\" by Inikkum Ilamai director M.A.Kaja. Other work He founded Shri Andal Alagar College of Engineering in 2001. His wife is the chairperson of this college. On 1 October 2001, Vijayakanth declared that 1 October, which is actor Sivaji Ganesan's birthday, be observed as Actors' Day in Tamil Nadu. In 2001, he was the former president of South Indian Film Artistes' Association and under his presidency, the debts of the association were cleared by organising celebrity shows overseas. Vijayakanth has launched a 24-hour television channel called Captain TV on 14 April 2010.He later launched a 24-hour news channel called Captain News on 29 August 2012.  Controversy  The media has widely publicized an ongoing dispute between Vijayakanth and comedic actor Vadivelu, who was Vijayakanth's co-star in a number of notable films. On 21 September 2008, Vadivelu's residence, located in Saligramam in Chennai, was pelted with stones by a gang, leaving several windows and furniture damaged. Vadivelu reported that he suspected that it was Vijayakanth's men, because of a court case which he had filed against Vijayakanth for assault, for which the final court hearing was to take place the following day. The attack may have been set up to prevent Vadivelu from attending the hearing. Filing another case for attempted murder against Vijayakanth, Vadivelu mentioned his interest in competing against him in the next assembly elections and \\"teaching him a lesson.\\" In response, Vijayakanth told a press meet on that Vadivelu's allegations are based on hearsay. During the legislative assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in 2011, Vadivelu vehemently campaigned for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its alliance. During his public speeches, he predominantly condemned Vijayakanth, whose party, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), allied with the opposition party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). In a campaign speech in Tiruvarur, Vadivelu stated that \\"(his) only aim is to sweep out Vijayakanth's whole team and to campaign vigorously for DMK's victory\\". Vadivelu was criticized as being biased, only supporting a DMK-led victory for personal gains and not once mentioning the then-official opposition, the AIADMK, or its leader, J. Jayalalitha. In a turn of events, the election was eventually successful for the AIADMK alliance, while Vijayakanth was victorious by a significant margin in his own constituency. While speaking at an election campaign meeting in 2016, he criticized Rajinikanth, causing a considerable backlash from supporters of Rajinikanth. He has been criticized for making obscene gestures in public, often towards journalists.DMDK goes to police against Vijayakanth memes ‚Äì Times of India.

Biography Courlay was the daughter of Cardinal Richelieu's sister, Fran√ßoise du Plessis, and her husband Ren√© du Vignerot. In 1620 Courlay married a nephew of the constable de Luynes, Antoine de Beauvoir du Roure, sieur de Combalet, who died in 1622. In 1625, through her uncle's influence, she was made a lady-in-waiting (dame d'atour) to the queen-mother Marie de Medici, and in 1638 was created duchess of Aiguillon. The Duchess did not marry a second time, although Richelieu wished to marry her to a prince, either to the comte de Soissons or to the king's brother. After the death of the cardinal in 1642, the Duchess retained her honours and titles, but withdrew from the court and devoted herself entirely to works of charity. She became a patron of work involving science and the arts, providing funding for many notable initiatives. She died on 17 April 1675. Patron of science and arts The Duchess worked with St. Vincent de Paul and helped him to establish the Bic√™tre Hospital for foundlings. She also took part in re-organizing the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris and establishing several others in the provinces. Additionally, she founded and funded the establishment of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec for the colonists of New France. The Duchess was the patroness of Pierre Corneille, who in 1636 dedicated his tragedy Le Cid to her. She also had the vision to provide patronage to Marie Crous, a mathematician who introduced the decimal system to France with her published research.

Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) is a major United States Army facility for the production and repair of ground combat vehicles, overhaul of Small Arms Weapon Systems and the storage of chemical weapons, a.k.a. the Anniston Chemical Activity. The depot is located in Bynum, Alabama. The Department of the Army established the site in 1940, buying in Calhoun County, where Anniston is the county seat. The site was originally a munitions storage facility, and, later, a disposal facility. ANAD was placed on the Superfund National Priorities List in 1990 because of soil and groundwater contamination with antimony, chromium, lead, thallium and trichloroethylene. Geography The depot is located in Calhoun County, Alabama, west of Anniston. It covers of land, or . Its northern side is the Pelham Range portion of Fort McClellan. The central and northern portions of the depot span over and serve as an ammunition storage area. The southern side of the depot is the Southeastern Industrial Area (SIA), a industrial operations area with more than 50 buildings and a vehicle test track. Description As of 2014, the depot employs 3,800 civilian workers. Tanks and other equipment are repaired and tested, but historically Anniston's main role since World War II has been as a major munitions storage site. Anniston is one of seven depots in the United States where chemical weapons were stored (7.2% of nation's chemical weapons stockpile).Land Use Database, Anniston Army Depot The Center for Land Use Interpretation, ludb.clui.org, undated The stockpile has included rockets, bombs, projectiles, and land mines armed with Sarin, VX nerve agent, or mustard gas.

The most modern form of these devices are fully electronic and use a screen, instead of a printer. Historical development The airline industry began using teletypewriter technology in the early 1920s using radio stations located at 10 airfields in the United States. The US Post Office and other US government agencies used these radio stations for transmitting telegraph messages. It was during this period that the first federal teletypewriter system was introduced in the United States to allow weather and flight information to be exchanged between air traffic facilities. While the use of physical teletypes is almost extinct, the message formats and switching concepts remain similar. In 1929, Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC) was formed to manage radio frequencies and license allocation in the United States, as well as to support the radio stations that were used by the emerging airlines, a role ARINC still fulfils today. ARINC is a private company originally owned by many of the world's airlines including; American Airlines, Continental Airlines, British Airways, Air France, and SAS; it was acquired by Collins Aerospace in December 2013. [https://www.aviationtoday.com/2013/12/26/rockwell-collins-acquires-arinc- for-1-4-billion/ In 1949, the Soci√©t√© Internationale de T√©l√©communication Aeronautique (SITA) was formed as a cooperative by 11 airlines: Air France, KLM, Sabena, Swissair, TWA, British European Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation, British South American Airways, Swedish AB Aerotransport, Danish Det Danske Luftfartselskab A/S, and Norwegian Det Norske Luftfartselskap. Their aim was to enable airlines to be able to use the existing communications facilities in the most efficient manner. [https://www.sita.aero/about-us/who- we-are/sita-history Morse code was the general means of relaying information between air communications stations prior to World War II. Generally, it was only necessary to relay a message between one or two stations. After World War II, there was an increase in the number of commercial aircraft operating, and these aircraft were capable of flying greater distances than in the past. As a result, the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN) was implemented worldwide as a means of relaying the air traffic communications, sometimes through the use of radioteletype which had become common among military forces in the 1940s. The airline industry continues to use teletypewriter messages over ARINC, SITA or AFTN networks as a medium for communicating via messages to exchange operational information. Most teletypewriter messages are machine-generated by automatic processes. What Airline IT IATA standardised teletype message formats throughout the airline industry.ATA/IATA Reservations Interline Message Procedures - Passenger (AIRIMP) IATA Since 2010 there have been initiatives in the industry to tackle the high cost of the existing Type B network by deploying secured peer-to-peer solutions, e.g. EDIfly, developed by Innovative Software SARL in Luxembourg and used by companies like Cargolux, TAP, AirBridgeCargo, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Air Asia, HACTL, Swissport etc. Such solutions allow users to exchange unrestricted amounts of Type B data over the public internet while maintaining all existing addressing schemes and message identification. Web- based technology also enables the community to expand the usage and removes shortcomings in the existing Type B exchange (limited to 5000 characters). The success of such initiatives will improve the processing of operational data for all stakeholders in the industry and provide expanded usage until newer technology like XML become the norm following IATAs decision to sunset CargoIMP in 2014 in operational systems of all stakeholders in the aviation scene across all continents.

In the past closely affiliated with the Kemalist Republican People's Party (CHP), the center-left newspaper turned to a more independent course over time, advocating democracy, social liberal values and free markets. Today, \\"being a Cumhuriyet reader has become synonymous with embracing democratic values and a pluralistic society\\". The newspaper's advertisements before the 2007 Turkish presidential election and general election caused controversy for \\"warning\\" voters against the AKP government with the message \\"Are you aware of the danger?\\". Notably, the newspaper has also broken the story on the 2014 National Intelligence Organisation scandal in Turkey, reprinted cartoons from Charlie Hebdo, and reported on the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers affairs while linking prominent Turkish figures to the documents.

During the Gulf War, Cumhuriyet suffered a collapse in advertising revenue, and following an unrelated dispute over editorial policy, nearly 40 journalists and commentators walked out in November 1991: \\"Circulation fell by half, and it was saved only by an extraordinary campaign by readers to buy extra copies and even pay money into a special account.\\" Hasan Cemal, chief editor since 1981, resigned in January 1992 over the dispute: \\"I tried to widen the spectrum, to keep the balance.

The Manicouagan crater is the sixth- largest confirmed impact crater known on earth. Name The river's name is believed to come from a Montagnais name meaning \\"Place where Tree Bark is Found\\". However the Innu of Betsiamites call it Menukuanistuk Shipu, meaning \\"River of the Cup\\". Tributaries The major tributaries of the Manicouagan River are in upstream order: * Toulnustouc River  Isoukustouc River  Fontmarais River * Lemay River * Manicouagan Reservoir  Mouchalagane River  Seignelay River  Themines River History Surveying the Manicouagan River at the first falls, 1919 At the end of August 1535, Jacques Cartier, while sailing south, noted the mouth of this large river but gave it no name. In June 1664, Jesuit Henri Nouvel was the first missionary to travel upstream of the \\"Grand Manikouaganistikou River that the French call rivi√®re Noire because of its depth\\". The next year, he \\"returned to the mouth of the Manico√ºagan in June.\\" The river's spelling has remained fairly constant from then on. In the early 1950s, the Manicouagan River attracted Hydro-Qu√©bec's attention for hydro-electric development because of the deep and fast running waters. In 1956, a dam was built at the mouth of Lake Sainte-Anne to regulate the Toulnustouc River, the main left tributary that empties in the Manicouagan between the Manic-2 and Manic-3 dams. Four years later, the main construction work began on the dams and power stations of the Manicouagan River and its neighbor to the west, the Outardes River. By 1978, this project, with a total power supply 4672 MW, was completed.

Situated on the southern bank of the Humber Estuary north- west of Grimsby, Killingholme is divided into two administrative districts, to its south being the civil parish of South Killingholme. The harbour of North Killingholme Haven, and the Humber Sea Terminal (2000‚Äì) are in the northern part of the parish, on the banks of the Humber Estuary. The Lindsey Oil Refinery (1968‚Äì), and the Killingholme A and Killingholme B power stations (1990s‚Äì) are located in the parish, north-east of the village. South Killingholme village is located south-west of the oil refinery ‚Äì it is small in both area and population ‚Äì the church of St Denys dates from the Middle Ages, and adjacent are the remains of two moated sites, formerly belonging to the Booth family who were lords of the manor and patrons of the living of Killingholme until Victorian times. The former RAF North Killingholme is located in the southern part of the civil parish, built and used during the Second World War. Geography The parish of North Killingholme extends from the Humber Estuary foreshore roughly south-west through Lindsey Oil Refinery; the village of North Killingholme; and the former RAF North Killingholme to a boundary with the civil parish of Ulceby formed by the canalized water course, Skitter Beck. The parish is roughly long (north-west to south-east) and wide, widening to wide at the banks of the Humber. The drain outfall, harbour and port of North Killingholme Haven is located in the northernmost corner of the parish on the Humber banks. To the south-east is the civil parish of South Killingholme; to the north-west is the civil parish of East Halton.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 284. 1:25000. 2006 North Killingholme is low-lying land, rising slowly from less than above sea level near the Humber to maxima of over to the south-western edges. A local peak of is found close to the church situated in the middle of the parish. Rail lines for Immingham and refineries passing through the parish (2009) Approximately 50% of the land area of the parish is in industrial or logistical use: land in industrial use includes the Humber Sea Terminal at North Killingholme Haven; the Lindsey Oil Refinery, and its two power stations adjacent north-west of the site (see Killingholme A and Killingholme B); as well as industrial estate development near the disused former RAF airfield. Much of the remainder of the parishes land is in agricultural use, with regular enclosed fields drained by man made channels. Additionally there is a nature reserve at North Killingholme Haven, a former clay extraction pit; some small woods; and the small village of North Killingholme. A branch line for the Immingham Dock (formerly the Humber Commercial Railway) runs through the parish near the southern boundary, and also serves the oil refinery via sidings. The parish had a population of 224 at the 2001 census, and at the 2011 census a population of 292. The parish is in the Ferry ward of North Lincolnshire. South Killingholme village is the only habitation of any note in the parish. History There is evidence of human settlement in the Killingholme area dating to the pre-historical period ‚Äì Neolithic stone axes were found close to the village in the late 1890s; from the Iron Age/Roman period part of a stone quern has been found in land between North and South Killingholme. St Denys' Church, Killingholme (2007) The church of St Denys dates at the earliest to the Norman period, with a 12th-century priest's door, as well as the arch at the base of the tower. The chancel is 13th-century, and the nave 14‚Äì15th century, with a clerestory added in the 16‚Äì17th century. The church was built mainly of limestone and ironstone, with brick, chalk, flint and rubble work, and some ashlar dressing. The church was restored in the 1700s, 1847, 1868, 1889, 1910 and 1926 including a new chancel arch, and brick buttresses. The font is 14th-century. Approximately north of the village is the medieval moated site known as North Garth, with an inner 'island' , and moats of wide and deep. To the south are further enclosures, also ditched or moated to a depth of . The site of the deserted medieval village of Holtham () may lie approximately halfway between North and South Killingholme. Killingholme Manor Farm (2007) A second moated site is found around Manor Farm, consisting of two areas. The larger, , has a moat of around wide by deep, still water filled in parts; a smaller moated area of square is located in the north-west corner of the first with its northern and western moats formed by the outer moat. A red brick and pantile farmhouse (former manor house, where the Booths were seated until the 18th centurywww.ota.ox.ac.uk) within the site dates to the 1500s (east wing), with a west wing added in the 17th century. The older wing is thought to be the remains of a larger manor house. states the old house was thought to date to the reign of Henry VII, though current thought places what remains of it in the reign of Elizabeth I. To the east a stables/granary dates to the mid 1700s. Both North and South Killingholme were enclosed in 1779 when the Booth family were lords of the manor. In 1821 the parish of North Killingholme, including the hamlet of South Killingholme, had a population of 438. By 1872 the parish contained 770 persons of which 196 were in North Killingholme. In this period (1880s) the parish was almost entirely agricultural, excluding a small brick and tile works near North Killingholme Haven; almost all of the agricultural land was regular enclosed fields; there were two small woods, Burkinshaw's Covert and Chase Hill Wood, north-east of the village.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500 1887 Excluding the developments on the Humber Bank at the Haven the general situation in the parish remained unchanged to the Second World War, with only minor growth of the village ‚Äì a subsidiary development of a few houses to the south-west of the village centre, named Garden Village.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500 1887, 1908, 1932, 1966‚Äì70, 1970‚Äì1, 1972 At North Killingholme Haven clay extraction for cement manufacture took place from 1909 to 1913. Additionally a pier for fuelling Royal Navy ships was constructed ;See North Killingholme Haven and a seaplane base opened nearby in 1914 and closed 1919. (see also RNAS Killingholme) As part of the development of the Immingham Dock, a branch line, the Humber Commercial Railway (operational 1901), was constructed from a junction near Ulceby railway station running northeast through the parish towards the new dock.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1907‚Äì8, 1932 An airfield was established southwest of the village during the Second World War, and used extensively by heavy bomber squadrons. (See RAF North Killingholme) Much of the airfield was built during the Second World War including the three concrete runways, and hangars, storehouses and offices. Additionally two heavy anti-aircraft batteries were sited in the parish during the Second World War. In the post Second World War period much of the land near the Humber north- west of Grimsby was developed for heavy or large scale industrial use. (see Industry of the South Humber Bank.) The \\"Lindsey Oil Refinery\\" was developed by Total Oil and Fina north-east of the village of North Killingholme from 1968. The village was relatively unchanged by these developments, though the number of dwellings had roughly doubled by the beginning of the 1970s, mainly scattered detached and semi-detached houses. In 1960 the CEGB acquired a site near Killingholme, and in 1972 obtained consent for a 4 GW oil fired power station, some enabling construction work was begun, but the project was abandoned after the 1973 oil crisis. In 1985 the Killingholme site was listed as a possible NIREX disposal site for low level nuclear waste, causing substantial opposition both locally and from the then Humberside County Council. In 1986 the CEGB listed Killingholme as a potential site for a coal fired power station. In 1992 Powergen constructed a 900 MW combined cycle gas fired powerstation north of the Lindsey Oil Refinery, known as Killingholme B power station. In 1993 National Power selected the proposed oil powerstation site for a CCGT power station, the approximate 650 MW Killingholme A power station. From the 1990s onwards a Roll-on/Roll-off ferry terminal, was constructed at the haven: the first two berths opened 2000; a second pair ; and a third pair after 2006. (see Humber Sea Terminal.) By the 21st century housing development at village had completed infilling at the satellite Garden village, and created two continuous rows of houses near east of the traditional centre along St Crispin's Close and Church Lane, approximately 10 structures per side on each road, mostly semi-detached houses or higher status.

The Prime Minister's office appointed Wilson to the government as a minister on 27 September 2014, following the resignation of Brooks Newmark following allegations in Daily Mirror that Newmark had sent sexually explicit images to an undercover reporterTim Ross \\"Conservative minister resigns over sex scandal\\", The Telegraph, 27 September 2014 He became the Minister for Civil Society which entails charities, volunteering and social enterprise, which he accepted a month after finishing the book, which he assessed as incompatible with being in a senior government or opposition role. =MP in the 2015‚Äì2017 parliament= On 8 May 2015, Wilson was again re-elected by the people of Reading East, with 23,217 votes and a majority of 6,520, compared to 7,605 in 2010. Shortly after retaining his seat in the 2015 general election, Wilson sparked controversy with a remark on Twitter in which he seemed to show a lack of interest in solving his constituency's rising homelessness problem. When asked about how his party's cuts would help solve it, he responded with \\"Don't be a bad loser.\\" This sparked considerable outrage online, including a petition on 38 Degrees for him to be removed from office. In July 2015, he was forced to defend his claims for travel expenses, which included 9p for a 352-yard car journey to a constituency event and 60p for a journey on his bicycle between his constituency office, the railway station and home. He said that putting such small costs on expenses might seem \\"odd\\", but said that over a year mileage \\"does add up\\". He pointed out he had not claimed any accommodation expenses in London since becoming an MP in 2005, saving taxpayers \\"hundreds of thousands of pounds. However, as I do commute most days it does mean I incur parking and mileage expenses instead\\". In the run-up to the EU referendum of 2016, Wilson publicly indicated that he believed the UK should remain a member of the European Union whilst not actively campaigning for it since he believed that he should stay neutral. In 2017 he voted to trigger article 50. =Defeat in the June 2017 election= On 8 June 2017, Wilson was defeated in the general election called by Theresa May in an unsuccessful attempt to increase her majority prior to the negotiations over the exit from the European Union. He received 23,344 votes, but came second to Matt Rodda, standing for the Labour Party, with 27,093 votes, a majority of 3,759.

Founded in 1969, they began manufacturing pre-amps before building complete instruments.  History  The company was founded by Owsley Stanley as a workshop in the rehearsal room of the Grateful Dead in Novato, California, near San Francisco, to help improve the entire sound chain for the band's live recordings, from instruments to PA. Soon the group was active in sound recording, modifying and repairing guitars and basses, and PA systems. Artist Robert Thomas designed and painted the logo of the company in 1969. It had multiple elements that represented the mankind and energy as values that Alembic aimed to show to public.Story of the logo on Alembic website By 1970, Alembic was incorporated with three equal shareholders: Ron Wickersham, an electronics expert who came in from Ampex; Rick Turner, a guitarist turned luthier; and Bob Matthews, a recording engineer. Inspired by the wide frequency response of the Hagstrom Bi-sonic pickups installed in Phil Lesh and Jack Casady's Guild Starfire basses, Ron Wickersham and Rick Turner designed low-impedance pickups and electronics with greater bandwidth than the high- impedance pickups typical in electric guitars and basses of the time. To boost the low output of these pickups, Wickersham designed an active onboard preamp. Turner referred to this process as \\"Alembicizing\\". The company's first instrument was a bass guitar, made in 1972 for Jack Casady. This bass incorporated a massive electronics suite, with state variable filtering capability, and had pickups mounted on brass tubing so that their position could be adjusted. Financial problems (in the recording studio section) were alleviated after a 1973 story on the company in Rolling Stone, which generated enough cashflow for a standardized bass guitar line based on the Guild Starfire. At that time, the company had two locations‚Äîguitars and electronics were built in Cotati, and the main office was in Sebastopol. 1973 was also the year that Stanley Clarke, then with Return to Forever, replaced his Gibson EB-2 with an Alembic, increasing Alembic's profile. Their bass guitars were expensive, costing up to three times as much as a new Fender bass. According to Tony Bacon and Barry Moorhouse, it was Alembic that started the trend of high-quality, high-price bass guitars. In 1974, Matthews left the company. The recording studio had been sold, as was a retail store in San Francisco where they had sold high-end audio equipment besides their own electronics and instruments. The first production Alembic instruments were less ornate, and incorporated the PF-5 electronics circuit, later replaced by the PF-6. The pickups were single-coil, with an active hum-cancelling coil mounted between the pickups. This configuration gave the player the fidelity of single-coil pickups without their inherent noise, and is used to this day. The basses and guitars built using this configuration would later become known as the Series I and II, and were available in a variety of scale lengths and body shapes. In 1976, Alembic built what is believed to be the first modern five string bass (tuned BEADG) for bassist Jimmy Johnson. Alembic's January 21, 1977 price list described the five string bass as a \\"standard\\" model, available for $50 more than its four string bass. In 1977, Alembic presented the world's first graphite neck basses with necks supplied by Geoff Gould (later founder of Modulus Guitars) at a trade show; it was bought by John McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Production of graphite-necked instruments ceased in 1985. In 1978, Rick Turner left the company to found Turner Guitars. In 1979, the Distillate, a more affordable model, was introduced in bass and guitar versions.  Products  Through the 1980s, Alembic introduced several new models. These included the Spoiler, Elan, and Europa basses, and the Electrum and California Special guitars. Alembic's model line has continued to expand to the present day, with models such as the Epic, Orion, Excel, and Darling being introduced. Key design elements from the earliest instruments are still present in Alembic‚Äôs instruments today. Most Alembic basses and guitars are constructed around a laminated neck that runs through the body of the instrument, using various combinations of often exotic woods such as Zebrawood or Cocobolo. They feature active electronics and brass hardware. A variety of body shapes have been introduced. The Standard Point, the iconic Alembic body shape, was conceived to force players to put the instrument in a stand, as headstock repairs resulting from falls were the most common repair performed by the company in its early days. Newer body shapes have been introduced to improve ergonomics and to designate new models. Alembic instruments can be ordered with a wide variety of custom features, including complex inlays and LED position markers in the neck. All Alembic instruments incorporate the proprietary Alembic active electronics, with various options for tone controls and pickup configurations available and are made in Alembic's factory in Santa Rosa, California.  Endorsements  While Alembic has largely eschewed celebrity endorsements, the company has made two exceptions to this rule. Stanley Clarke was given a specially inlaid instrument to celebrate 30 years of working together. Mark King, in 1986, received two 34\\"-scale Series 2 basses and then ordered two more in identical woods with 32\\" scale.

It is also involved in changes to vascular permeability, the oxidative burst, chemotaxis of leukocytes, as well as augmentation of arachidonic acid metabolism in phagocytes. PAF is produced by a variety of cells, but especially those involved in host defense, such as platelets, endothelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. PAF is continuously produced by these cells but in low quantities and production is controlled by the activity of PAF acetylhydrolases. It is produced in larger quantities by inflammatory cells in response to specific stimuli.  History  PAF was discovered by French immunologist Jacques Benveniste in the early 1970s. PAF was the first phospholipid known to have messenger functions. Benveniste made significant contributions in the role and characteristics of PAF and its importance in inflammatory response and mediation. Using lab rats and mice, he found that ionophore A23187 (a mobile ion carrier that allows the passage of Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and has antibiotic properties against bacteria and fungi) caused the release of PAF. These developments led to the finding that macrophages produce PAF and that macrophages play an important function in aggregation of platelets and liberation of their inflammatory and vasoactive substances. Further studies on PAF were conducted by Constantinos A. Demopoulos in 1979. Demopoulos found that PAF plays a crucial role in heart disease and strokes. His experiment‚Äôs data found that atherosclerosis (the accumulation of lipid-rich lesions in the endothelium of the arteries) can be attributed to PAF and PAF-like lipids, and identified biologically active compounds in the polar lipid fractions of olive oil, honey, milk and yoghurt, mackerel, and wine that have PAF-antagonistic properties and inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. During the course of his studies, he also determined the chemical structure of the compound.  Evolution  PAF can be found in protozoans, yeasts, plants, bacteria, and mammals. PAF has regulatory role in protozoans. The regulatory role is thought to diverge from that point and be maintained as living organisms started to evolve. During evolution, functions of PAF in the cell have been changing and enlarging. PAF has been found in plants but its function has not yet been determined. = Fungal PAF = The antifungal protein PAF from Penicillium chrysogenum exhibits growth-inhibitory activity against a broad range of filamentous fungi. Evidence suggests that disruption of Ca2+ signaling/homeostasis plays an important role in the mechanistic basis of PAF as a growth inhibitor. PAF also elicits hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and the activation of ion channels, followed by an increase in reactive oxygen species in the cell and the induction of an apoptosis-like phenotype Cumulative evidence reveals that diabetes is a condition in which cell Ca2+ homeostasis is impaired. Defects in cell Ca2+ regulation were found in erythrocytes, cardiac muscle, platelets, skeletal muscle, kidney, aorta, adipocytes, liver, osteoblasts, arteries, lens, peripheral nerves, brain synaptosomes, retinal tissue, and pancreatic beta cells, confirming that this defect in cell Ca2+ metabolism is a basic pathology associated with the diabetic state. The defects identified in the mechanical activity of the hearts from type 1 diabetic animals include alteration of Ca2+ signaling via changes in critical processes.  Function  PAF is used to transmit signals between neighboring cells and acts as a hormone, cytokines, and other signaling molecules. The PAF signaling system can trigger inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, amplify these cascades when acting with other mediators, and mediate molecular and cellular interactions (cross talk) between inflammation and thrombosis. Unregulated PAF signaling can cause pathological inflammation and has been found to be a cause in sepsis, shock, and traumatic injury. PAF can be used as a local signaling molecule and travel over very short distances or it can be circulated throughout the body and act via endocrine. PAF initiates an inflammatory response in allergic reactions. This has been demonstrated in the skin of humans and in the paws and skin of lab rabbits and rodents. The inflammatory response is enhanced by the use of vasodilators, including prostaglandin E1 (PGE,) and PGE2 and inhibited by vasoconstrictors. PAF also induces apoptosis in a different way that is independent of the PAF receptor. The pathway to apoptosis can be inhibited by negative feedback from PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that catabolizes platelet-activating factor. It is an important mediator of bronchoconstriction. It causes platelets to aggregate and blood vessels to dilate. Thus, it is important to the process of hemostasis. At a concentration of 10‚àí12 mol/L, PAF causes life-threatening inflammation of the airways to induce asthma like symptoms. Toxins such as fragments of destroyed bacteria induce the synthesis of PAF, which causes a drop in blood pressure and reduced volume of blood pumped by the heart, which leads to shock and possibly death.  Structure  Several molecular species of platelet-activating factor that vary in the length of the O-alkyl side-chain have been identified. * Its alkyl group is connected by an ether linkage at the C1 carbon to a 16-carbon chain. * The acyl group at the C2 carbon is an acetate unit (as opposed to a fatty acid) whose short length increases the solubility of PAF allowing it to function as a soluble signal messenger. * The C3 has a phosphocholine head group, just like standard phosphatidylcholine. Studies found that PAF could not be modified without losing its biological activity. Thus, small changes in the structure of PAF could render its signaling abilities inert. Investigation led to the understanding that platelet and blood pressure response were dependent on the sn-2 propionyl analog. If the sn-1 was removed then PAF lacked any sort of biological activity. Finally, the sn-3 position of PAF was experimented with by removing methyl groups sequentially. As more and more methyl groups were removed, biological activity diminished until it was eventually inactive.  Biochemistry  = Biosynthesis = PAF is produced by stimulated basophils, monocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells primarily through lipid remodeling. A variety of stimuli can initiate the synthesis of PAF. These stimuli could be macrophages going through phagocytosis or endothelium cells uptake of thrombin. There are two different pathways in which PAF can be synthesized: de novo pathway and remodeling. The remodeling pathway is activated by inflammatory agents and it is thought to be the primary source of PAF under pathological conditions. The de novo pathway is used to maintain PAF levels during normal cellular function. The most common pathway taken to produce PAF is remodeling. The precursor to the remodeling pathway is a phospholipid, which is typically phosphatidylcholine (PC). The fatty acid is removed from the sn-2 position of the three-carbon backbone of the phospholipid by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to produce the intermediate lyso-PC (LPC). An acetyl group is then added by LPC acetyltransferase (LPCAT) to produce PAF. Using the de novo pathway, PAF is produced from 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (AAG). Fatty acids are joined on the sn-1 position with 1-O-hexadecyl being the best for PAF activity. Phosphocholine is then added to the sn-3 site on AAG creating PAF. = Regulation = The concentration of PAF is controlled by the synthesis of the compound and by the actions of PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AH). PAF-AH are a family of enzymes that have the ability to catabolize and degrade PAF and turn it into an inactive compound. The enzymes within this family are lipoprotein- associated phospholipase A2, cytoplasmic platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 2, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b. Cations are one form of regulation in the production of PAF. Calcium plays a large role in the inhibition of enzymes that produce PAF in the denovo pathway of PAF biosynthesis. The regulation of PAF is still not completely understood. Enzymes that are associated with the production of PAF are controlled by metal ions, thiol compounds, fatty acids, pH, compartmentalization, and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. These controls on these PAF producing enzymes are believed to work in conjunction to control it, but the overall pathway and reasoning is not well understood.  Pharmacology  = Inhibition = PAF antagonists is a type of receptor ligand or drug that does not provoke an inflammatory response upon binding, but blocks or lessens the effect of PAF. Examples of PAF antagonists are: * CV-3988 is a PAF antagonist that blocks signaling events correlated to the expression and binding of PAF to the PAF Receptor. * SM-12502 is a PAF antagonist, which is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme CYP2A6. * Rupatadine is an antihistamine and PAF antagonist used to treat allergies. * Etizolam is a benzodiazepine analog and PAF antagonist used to treat anxiety and panic attacks.https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3307#section=Pharmacology- and-Biochemistry *Apafant *Lexipafant (Zacutex) for treatment of pancreatitis. *Modipafant *A full list in a review: = Clinical significance = High PAF levels are associated with a variety of medical conditions. Some of these conditions include: ‚Ä¢Allergic reactions ‚Ä¢Stroke ‚Ä¢Sepsis ‚Ä¢Myocardial infarction ‚Ä¢Colitis, inflammation of the large intestine ‚Ä¢Multiple sclerosis While the effects that PAF has on inflammatory response and cardiovascular conditions are well understood, PAF is still a subject for discussion. Over the past 23 years, papers written on PAF have almost doubled from approximately 7,500 in 1997 to 14,500 in 2020. Research into PAF is ongoing. = Anti-PAF drugs = Anti-PAF drugs are currently being used in cardiac rehabilitation trials. Anti-PAF drugs are used to block angiotensin II type 1 receptors to lower in the risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with paroxysmal fibrillation. It is also used to lessen the effects of allergies.

This had earned him a reputed nickname in Lahore as Baba-e-Socialism (Father of Socialism).Senior PPP leader passes away (Obituary and profile of Sheikh Mohammad Rashid) on Dawn (newspaper), Published 13 September 2002, Retrieved 30 December 2017 But after the PPP's return to power, following long years of the military rule in the 1980s, Sheikh Rashid had gradually felt alienated within the party, despite being its one time Senior Vice Chairman. Early life and career Sheikh Mohammad Rashid was born in 1915 in Sheikhupura into a family of farmers and entered politics by joining the All India Muslim League in 1940. He was initially attracted by the Khaksar Tehrik but did not join it. Rashid also got involved in the Quit India Movement of the Ghadar Party led by Subhash Chandra Bose. Locally in British-ruled Punjab, he participated in the movement against the pro-British Unionist government of Khizar Hayat Khan Tiwana. In 1947 just before the independence of India and Pakistan, when religious and ethnic tensions arose and riots erupted, he formed a local \\"bombard group\\" against the Unionist government and was arrested while transporting some bombs in a tonga (a horse-driven vehicle commonly used at that time). After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Sheikh Rashid started his career as a lawyer but soon his socialist leanings led him to join the Azad Pakistan Party headed by Pakistan Times newspaper owner Mian Iftikharuddin. This organization had a broadly progressive programme and he was appointed its first secretary- general. True to his socialist ideals, he also led many peasants movements in Pakistan. In 1967, he joined hands with the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the formation of the Pakistan Peoples Party.Obituary of Sheikh Mohammad Rashid on The Guardian (UK newspaper) Published 6 November 2002, Retrieved 30 December 2017 He was a founding member of the party's central executive committee and later a member of the first ever PPP cabinet, initially as Health Minister and then Chairman of the Land Reforms Commission. His efforts at land reforms were said to have made him unpopular with many including some of his own land- owning party colleagues because he confiscated, as Federal Land Reforms Commission chairman, thousands of acres of land of big landowners of Pakistan regardless of what political party they belonged to. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto himself was a big landowner in Sindh. Eventually, the land reforms saw only a half-hearted implementation by the Bhutto administration. Besides Bhutto, Pakistan has been a land of too many influential feudal lords and stiff resistance was expected from them anyway to any socialist-type land reforms. He was elected twice as member of the National Assembly of Pakistan on Pakistan Peoples' Party tickets both in 1970 General Election in Pakistan and 1977 Pakistani general election. Sheikh Mohammad Rashid remained close to the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who treated him as his most senior cabinet colleague, perhaps to retain a balance between the progressive and conservative elements within the party. It was during the period of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq as the military ruler, that Sheikh Rashid's role as an ideologue for thousands of party workers, was boosted. Once the Bhutto government was overthrown by General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan Peoples Party workers including Rashid were repressed and he spent many years in exile in Britain. Then in September 1988, General Zia died in a mysterious plane crash and attempts at restoring democracy to Pakistan were made. Benazir Bhutto returned triumphantly to Pakistan to campaign for the upcoming 1988 Pakistani general election. Out of tune with Benazir Bhutto Sheikh Mohammad Rashid failed to get re-elected in the 1988 national election. He was getting old and was in poor health with asthma. Another reason given for his election defeat was that 1988 election was manipulated by Pakistan's intelligence agencies. However, the PPP's return to power in 1988 marked the beginning of his gradual alienation with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who regarded his socialist ideals as being increasingly out of tune with contemporary trends. Despite ideological differences with the leadership, Sheikh Mohammad Rashid, unlike many other fellow party members, remained steadfast with his commitment to the party and never joined any other political group. He was refused a PPP party ticket to contest the 1990 elections in Pakistan. Death and legacy Sheikh Mohammad Rashid had asthma for a long time and finally died in Lahore, aged 87, on 12 September 2002. His survivors included his wife Shakeela and his four sons from his previous marriage. =An uncompromising socialist= In the early years of Pakistan, there is an often told story of a debate on the party's drafted charter that Faiz Ahmed Faiz had drafted for the Azad Pakistan Party. Everyone accepted Faiz's draft but Sheikh Rashid. This debate took place among the founders of the party over a word which Sheikh Rashid alone wanted changed. Of course the word was about the distribution of land among the peasants. He debated the rest of the party founders over it for many hours because he wanted it expressed a certain way. All through his political career, he was recognized by his contemporaries as a defender of peasant rights.The fighter Sheikh Rashid was Dawn (newspaper), Published 12 September 2003, Retrieved 30 December 2017 Sheikh Mohammad Rashid was ridiculed in the early 1970s for trying to bring a generic drugs scheme to Pakistan. Although his idea was proven valid later because similar generic drug schemes were later implemented in many countries including Egypt, Bangladesh and it was endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Now some people feel in Pakistan that his idea was in common public's interest. Sheikh Rashid was among the first to advise Bhutto to accept Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Six Point Program which later became Six point movement to achieve greater autonomy for East Pakistan. This movement finally resulted in separation of former East Pakistan becoming Bangladesh in 1971.

Ambrosius here simply gives variant glyphs of the Hebrew alphabet, labelled Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, He, Vau, Zain, Hhet, Teth, Iod, Caph, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Samech, Ain, Phe, Zadai, Coph, Res, Sin, Thau. The alphabet is different from the other variants of the Semitic abjad given by Ambrosius in that he mentions that these letters are said to have been invented by Gamaliel and transmitted in the a book called Liber ignis associated with the angel Raphiel. Claude Duret (1570?‚Äì1611) included it in his Thresor (1613, p. 117) under the name \\"the characters of the angel Raphael\\", citing Ambrosius. Edmund Fry included it in his Pantographia (pp. 28‚Äì29), stating: > \\"Theseus Ambrosius asserts that this character was brought from Heaven by > the Angel Raphael by who it was communicated to Adam who used it in > composing Psalms after his expulsion from the terrestrial paradise. Some > authors pretend that Moses and the prophets used this letter and that they > were forbidden to divulge it to mortal man.\\" That alphabet is described in the pseudo-Paracelsian Archidoxis magica, translated into English by R. Turner (1656). S.L. MacGregor Mathers included it in his 1888 edition of the Key of Solomon (plate XV) under the name \\"Alphabet of the Magi.\\" References Theseus Ambrosius, Introductio in chaldaicam linguam, 1539 * Claude Duret, Thresor de l'histoire des langues de cest univers, 1613 * Edmund Fry, Pantographia, 1799 *R.

The club reached the Conference South after winning the play-off final of the Isthmian League Premier Division in the 2010-11 season but were relegated back to the Isthmian League in 2014. They competed in that league until they were promoted back to the National League South at the end of the 2018-19 season. Notable ex-players include England international Malcolm Macdonald, Aston Villa's league championship winning manager Ron Saunders and former England manager Roy Hodgson. History =Formation and early history= Tonbridge Football Club was formed in October 1947 following the suggestion of local businessman and founder chairman Mr. Herbert Portch, and was one of four clubs to be elected to the Southern Football League for the 1948‚Äì49 season. The club took out a lease on the Angel Ground, formerly the home of Kent County Cricket Club and named after the nearby hotel, 'The Angel'. Hence Tonbridge FC became known as 'The Angels'. A crowd of around 5,000 turned up for the club's opening league fixture against fellow newcomers Hastings United but the match was lost 2‚Äì1, with Albert Robson scoring the club's first ever goal. Progress was slow in the early days, with the club rock bottom at Christmas and with Harold Hobbis taking over as manager from Dunoon and Marshall Raybould, but the club would improve their form in the second half of the season to finish third from last. Throughout the 1950s the Angels (as they were nicknamed at the time, although it was not yet formally part of the club's name) would struggle to make any progress in the Southern League and a peak of 11th place was reached in 1949‚Äì50, the club's second season. However, Tonbridge would prove to be a strong side in cup competitions. In 1949‚Äì50, the club reached the semi-finals of the Southern League Cup, losing 3‚Äì2 to Colchester United. In three successive seasons, 1950‚Äì51, 1951‚Äì52 and 1952‚Äì53, Tonbridge reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup, only to lose each of the three after a replay. The Angels' opponents were Chelmsford City, Aldershot and Norwich City respectively. The Aldershot tie at the Angel Ground saw a record attendance of 8,236, while the Norwich City game was shrouded in controversy, with a late goal at Carrow Road settling the tie. The first trophy to be lifted came in 1951/52 with the Angels winning the Kent Senior Shield. Tonbridge would go on to win this trophy a further four times, in 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1964. Two Southern League Cup finals were reached and lost, beaten in 1954‚Äì55 by Yeovil Town and two seasons later by Hereford United, and two Kent Senior Cup finals were also lost in 1956‚Äì57 and 1958‚Äì59. The club were relegated from the Premier Division in 1961‚Äì62, but were promoted two seasons later finishing in 4th place after narrowly missing out the year before. However the club were then relegated back to Division One in 1965‚Äì66. The notable success of the 1960s was the achievement of reaching the First Round Proper for a fourth time, this time being knocked out 1‚Äì0 by Dagenham. The club also won the Kent Senior Cup for the first time in 1964‚Äì65. In 1972‚Äì73 the Angels won promotion to the Premier Division by finishing as runners-up to Maidstone United. In the same season the First Round Proper of the FA Cup was reached once again as Charlton Athletic were the visitors to the Angel Ground. A crowd of 7,770 saw Charlton win 5‚Äì0. Tonbridge won the Kent Senior Cup in 1974‚Äì75 while managed by former World Cup winner George Cohen. After struggling to stay in the Premier Division, the club suffered financial troubles and went into voluntary liquidation in 1976. Tonbridge Angels FC was then formed and allowed to complete the fixture list on the understanding that relegation would result at the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season, wherever the club finished. Another major problem loomed soon after. The club's landlords, the local council, wanted the Angel Ground for development. A battle lasting up to three years that went as far as the High Courts ensued before the club was eventually offered a new ground at Longmead, its present home. The appropriately named Micky Angel scored the last ever goal at the old Angel Ground in 1980. =Move to Longmead Stadium: 1980‚Äì2004= Former Tonbridge and Arsenal goalkeeper Tony Burns took over as manager for the 1980‚Äì81 season and the club's new Longmead Stadium hosted its first game on 18 August 1980, a crowd of 701 watching a Southern League Cup game against Crawley Town. Despite having a new home, finances proved to be a problem for the club. Burns departed for Gravesend & Northfleet in December 1982 to be replaced by John Keirs, who took the club to fourth place in the 1983‚Äì84 season, promotion only denied to the Angels on the final day of the season. Phil Emblen took over the reins in July 1985 and led the club to another Southern League Semi Final appearance in 1987, but his departure along with several key players at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season led to a slump in the 40th anniversary season. 1988‚Äì89 proved to be a disaster for the club. Former Tottenham Hotspur man Terry Naylor took charge and lasted for just seven games, in that time only managing to earn a single drawn match. With the Angels at the bottom of the league Tommy Sampson came in to try to steady the ship but the damage was already done. The Angels bade farewell to the Southern League after 40 years, relegation to the Kent League being the club's \\"reward\\" after ending the season in next to bottom spot. The Angels regrouped for the 1989‚Äì90 season with former player and manager Tony Burns returning to manage the club for a second time. Tonbridge finished in a worthy third place, not enough for a quick return to Southern League football, but silverware was forthcoming in the form of the Kent League Cup. Another former manager returned for the 1990‚Äì91 season, Phil Emblen, and he sparked a revival in the club's fortunes. Emblen patiently built a winning team and after two fourth-placed finishes, money-spinning Cup runs and another Kent League Cup win, the title finally arrived at Longmead in the 1992‚Äì93 season. And so, after a few seasons away, Tonbridge returned to the league which they had graced for so many years. The Angels briefly topped the Southern Division on their return to Southern League football in the 1993‚Äì94 season but settled for a mid-table finish, which was to be repeated the following season. The club struggled in the 1995‚Äì96 season with Phil Emblen resigning as Manager in February 1996 to be replaced by Bill Roffey and the club finished in 18th position. In 1996‚Äì97 Tonbridge had an improved season finishing in 8th place and in the summer of 1997 Paul Emblen broke the club's record transfer fee, moving to Charlton Athletic for ¬£7,000. He was later transferred to Wycombe Wanderers for ¬£60,000. His brother, ex-Angel Neil, has appeared for Millwall, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Crystal Palace and Norwich City. After a disappointing start to the 1997‚Äì98 season Colin Blewden took over as Player- Manager in October and hauled the club away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place and led the Angels to a 16th-place finish in 1998‚Äì99. The 1999‚Äì2000 season was the club's most successful since re-joining the Southern League. A run of fourteen games at the end of the season, in which just one defeat was suffered, secured a final league placing of seventh. The following season, it appeared that the Angels might better that seventh-place finish. A storming start to the season saw just two of their first nineteen league matches lost. However, a run of five defeats in six matches late on left the Angels in eighth spot come the end of the season. The 2001‚Äì02 season was not a successful one for the club. Blewden resigned in October and Tonbridge were one of several clubs involved in a relegation dogfight. They escaped the drop by winning two and drawing one of their last four matches, leaving them four points ahead of relegated Wisbech Town at the end. Alan Walker was appointed manager at the start of season 2002‚Äì03 and that season was arguably the most successful since joining the Southern League, the club eventually finishing ninth after a fine end of season run. That run continued into the 2003‚Äì04 with a club record of 26 league matches unbeaten being ended in December 2003, at which point the Angels were comfortable leaders of the Eastern Division. Walker left the club shortly after due to a loss of sponsorship and the Angels replaced him with player-manager Tony Dolby. After an initial period of mixed results, Dolby steadied the ship and brought in Mike Rutherford as assistant coach before keeping the Angels in the title battle until the penultimate game of the season. The Angels finally finished in third, the club's highest position in the Southern League for more than 25 years. =Isthmian League and Conference South: 2004‚Äìpresent= The 2004 reorganisation of the English football league system saw the Angels placed in the Isthmian League Premier Division. They were relegated in their first season but bounced back at the first attempt, in the most dramatic of fashions, after a rollercoaster 2005‚Äì06 season. Tonbridge were undefeated until October but a bad run of results threatened to undermine the promotion bid, but the Angels always did enough to stay in the play-off places and a late surge secured third place and with it home advantage in the play-offs. Tooting & Mitcham were defeated in the Semi- Final match before a dream Final pitted the Angels at home to old Kent rivals Dover Athletic. The Lilywhites were beaten 3‚Äì2 in front of a new record Longmead Stadium attendance of 1,863. The Angels finished the 2006‚Äì07 season in 11th place with striker Jon Main scoring 44 goals in all competitions. They then went on to better that by finishing 8th in 2007‚Äì08, missing out on the playoffs by a matter of points, despite having been languishing second from bottom when new manager Tommy Warrilow took over. Season 2008‚Äì09 saw the Angels finish in third place, reaching the play-off semi-final where they lost to Carshalton Athletic. In the 2010‚Äì11 season the team confirmed a play-off place with the final league game. They beat Harrow Borough 3‚Äì2 in the play-off semi-final to set up a meeting with Lowestoft Town in the final. Tonbridge won the game 4‚Äì3 with Lewis Taylor scoring the winner just 10 minutes from the end to confirm the Angels' promotion into the Conference South for the 2011‚Äì12 season, the highest achievement ever by the club. The club's inaugural campaign in the Conference South saw them finish in 9th place after enjoying a moderately successful season. The following season, the club narrowly escaped relegation and reached the Kent Senior Cup finals where they lost 7‚Äì1 at home to a Charlton XI. The Angels were relegated from the Conference South to the Isthmian League Premier for the start of the 2014/15 season. Manager Tommy Warrilow left the club after 7 years to be replaced by long-term Sutton United coach Steve McKimm. The Angels remained in the Isthmian League Premier division until the 2018‚Äì19 season. During the 2018/19 season they finished 4th place and gained a spot in the play-offs. Tonbridge played 3rd place Haringey Borough away in the semi-final and beat them 2‚Äì1. The final of the play-offs would be played against 5th placed Merstham in a game that the Angels won 2‚Äì0 at home in front of a crowd of 2,268. Owing to a change in the National League structure for the 2018‚Äì19 season, this meant that Tonbridge would have to play a further 'Step 3 Super Play-off' final against the winners of the Southern Football League Premier Division South play-offs, Metropolitan Police. This took place on 11 May 2019 and Tonbridge ended up the victors after a 3‚Äì2 win after extra time away at Met's ground. This victory gained Tonbridge promotion to the National League South for the 2019‚Äì20 season. Players =Current squad= =Out on loan/dual-registration= Community ownership During the 2014‚Äì15 season, steps were taken by supporters to purchase shares in the club to make it majority owned by supporters. They will contest the 2015‚Äì16 pre-season Supporters Direct shield, with their first match against Fisher F.C. on 25 July. Stadium The Longmead Stadium from the Jack Maddams Stand. The West Stand is on the right. The club plays their home games at Longmead Stadium, Darenth Avenue, Tonbridge TN10 3JF. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 people. Covered terraces are in place behind each goal, which were named after the Mezzanine Floor Company who helped build them. In 2008 the North Stand was renamed The Jack Maddams Stand in memory of the young player who died that year. In the same year, the club installed over 760 seats in the West Stand which was brought over from the old Angel Ground when the club first moved to the Longmead.

After an abandoned 3rd Qualifying Round replay with Hampton in front of over 800 fans, the game was rearranged and drew an impressive attendance of 1,274. Just five days later the 4th Qualifying Round tie against Yeovil drew a crowd of 1,483. Season 1997‚Äì98 saw an attendance of 2,412 when the full Crystal Palace first team squad appeared for a charity match in aid of two local hospices, making 30 March 1998 a memorable evening in the club's history. The current record attendance for a competitive match at Longmead is 2,411, which was set on 7 May 2011 in the Isthmian League Premier Division play-Off final against Lowestoft Town. The largest attendance for any game by the club was witnessed at the Angel Ground where an FA Cup tie in 1951‚Äì52 against Aldershot was attended by 8,236 spectators. =Biggest win/defeat= The Angels‚Äô biggest win came about in the FA Cup in 1951 (Angel Ground) when Worthing were beaten 11‚Äì1. Two seasons before that a 2‚Äì11 loss at Folkestone in the Kent Senior Cup had given the club its record defeat. The biggest win at Longmead Stadium was on 5 September 2017 when the Angels defeated Herne Bay 10‚Äì1 in the Isthmian League Cup. =Goalscoring= Kevin McCurley had held the record for goals in a season for 45 years, having amassed 40 goals in 1961‚Äì62. His record was finally beaten by prolific striker Jon Main who scored 44 goals. This tally included seven hat-tricks which was a record for trebles in a season, and also equalled the record for career hat-tricks set by Jimmy Constantine in the 1950s. Main claimed this record in October 2007 by scoring an eighth treble against Stotfold in the FA Cup. Former players 1\\\\.

It was founded as the Singapore Football Association in 1892, which lays claim to being the oldest football association in Asia. The association changed to the Singapore Amateur Football Association on 14 May 1929http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepresswk19290522-1.2.122 before adopting its current name on 13 January 1966. The FAS is responsible for the organisation and development of football and advancing the game at all levels in Singapore, including its flagship Singapore Premier League, and the men's, women's and youth national football teams. Providing a structure for the game to flourish and governing the running of football in Singapore, the FAS also ensures that the Laws of the Game are adhered to, from the professional S.League to amateur leagues. The FAS also manages the organisation and running of league and cup competitions, the stewardship of international teams, the establishment of youth development, women's football, refereeing and coaching frameworks. FAS president had been appointed by the governing People's Action Party for three decades. In 2015, global football governing body FIFA requested an end to political interference in the appointment of the national body's council members, and non-compliance would make Singapore ineligible to take part in international competitions. FAS has since changed its constitution in 2016 and held general elections for its council members. Singapore national team The Singapore national football team, administered by FAS, is the most successful side that incorporated foreign-born players in ASEAN Football Championship history, winning the regional international tournament four times in 1998, 2004/5, 2007 and 2012. Singapore is behind Thailand after the Thais won their 5th time in the regional competition (as of 2016). Youth Development Programmes The FAS focuses on football development and operates national age group programmes with U-15, U-16, U-17, U-18 and U-23 teams (known as Young Lions, who compete in the country's professional Singapore Premier League). All Singapore Premier League clubs have also fully implemented their own programmes for the Under-14s, adding on to the existing U-16s and U-18s program. Controversies =Political interference= The FAS council was first appointed by the government since 1968, and has been controlled continually by government appointees for more than three decades from the 1980s to 2015. From 2004 to 2015, the FAS president had been an elected member of the ruling People's Action Party, and was appointed by the Minister for Sports. In 2015, global football governing body FIFA took issue with the politically-appointed leaders of the organisation. It requested an end to political interference in the appointment of the national body's council members and non-compliance would cause a suspension in Singapore's FIFA membership, making the country ineligible to take part in international competitions. FAS has since changed its constitution in 2016, and held general elections for its council members in 2017. FAS president and then PAP member of parliament Zainudin Nordin declared the association had \\"not done anything wrong\\". \\"We have always been in consultation with FIFA over the last 30 years. They are aware of the uniqueness of our situation, and have always given us special dispensation.\\" =Outrage over lack of investment in grassroots football= During the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on September 2016, it was revealed that organising expenses on grassroots competitions like the National Football League (NFL), Island Wide League (IWL) and FA Cup amounted to about $70,000 during the previous financial year from April 2015 to March 2016. This figure which represented a mere 0.2 per cent of the FAS' total annual budget of S$35.8 million sparked outrage within the local football community with many perceiving it as a clear indication of FAS's lack of regard for grassroots football. In a press conference on 13 October 2016, FAS vice-president Bernard Tan clarified that the amount did not include prize money and participation fees contributed by the teams counted under S. League account. =Probe into alleged misuse of funds= In April 2017, Bill Ng, owner of 2 Singapore football clubs, Hougang United and Tiong Bahru Football Club (TBFC), claimed that he had donated S$850,000 to the FAS with the intention of helping Singapore football, but that the money had gone to the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) instead. The allegations came in the prelude to the first open election of the FAS council. FAS secretary Winston Lee responded that Ng was aware of where the funds were used, that $200,000 went to the LionsXII, while $500,000 was used to support the AFF's Football Management System. Lee said that it was former FAS president and Member of Parliament Zainudin Nordin who asked Ng to donate to the AFF, while Ng disputed the claim. FAS responded with a statement that Ng's allegations of financial impropriety within FAS to damage the credibility of the association was regretable, and it was unusual that Ng had chosen to hide Zainudin‚Äôs role in the transaction. On 20 April 2017, the police raided the Football Association of Singapore over reports of financial misuse of funds filed by Sport Singapore. Zainudin Nordin, Winston Lee, Bill Ng and his wife Bonnie Wong, were arrested and subsequently released. The four assisted with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) with the probe into the alleged misuse of funds and obstruction of club audits of TBFC.

Drawings from the 15th century by Filippo Brunelleschi, author is Curator of Horology at the British Museum and Leonardo da Vinci, p.227 show fusees. The earliest existing clock with a fusee, also the earliest spring-powered clock, is the Burgunderuhr (Burgundy clock), a chamber clock whose iconography suggests that it was made for Phillipe the Good, Duke of Burgundy about 1430, now in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum The word fusee comes from the French fus√©e and late Latin fusata, 'spindle full of thread'. The torque provided by a mainspring decreases linearly as the spring unwinds during a clock's running period. The fusee's purpose is to even out this torque. Watch from 1500s with stackfreed (near top). Springs were first employed to power clocks in the 15th century, to make them smaller and portable. These early spring-driven clocks were much less accurate than weight-driven clocks. Unlike a weight on a cord, which exerts a constant force to turn the clock's wheels, the force a spring exerts diminishes as the spring unwinds. The primitive verge and foliot timekeeping mechanism, used in all early clocks, was sensitive to changes in drive force. So early spring-driven clocks slowed down over their running period as the mainspring unwound, causing inaccurate timekeeping. This problem is called lack of isochronism. Two solutions to this problem appeared with the first spring driven clocks; the stackfreed and the fusee. The stackfreed, a crude cam compensator, added a lot of friction and was abandoned after less than a century.Milham 1945, p.230 The fusee was a much more lasting idea. As the movement ran, the tapering shape of the fusee pulley continuously changed the mechanical advantage of the pull from the mainspring, compensating for the diminishing spring force. Clockmakers apparently empirically discovered the correct shape for the fusee, which is not a simple cone but a hyperboloid., p.29 The first fusees were long and slender, but later ones have a more squat compact shape. Fusees became the standard method of getting constant force from a mainspring, used in most spring-wound clocks, and watches when they appeared in the 17th century. At first the fusee cord was made of gut, or sometimes wire. Around 1650 chains began to be used, which lasted longer. Gruet of Geneva is widely credited with introducing them in 1664, although the first reference to a fusee chain is around 1540. Fusees designed for use with cords can be distinguished by their grooves, which have a circular cross section, where ones designed for chains have rectangular-shaped grooves. Around 1726 John Harrison added the maintaining power spring to the fusee to keep marine chronometers running during winding, and this was generally adopted. How it works Fusee and mainspring barrel, showing operation.This drawing has a slight mechanical inaccuracy. In the mainspring barrel, more turns of the mainspring around the arbor are shown in the bottom drawing than in the top, indicating that the mainspring is in the wound-up state in the bottom drawing, while in actuality the barrel is in the wound-up state in the top drawing, when all the fusee chain is on the fusee, and unwound in the bottom drawing. (A) mainspring arbor, (B) barrel, (C) chain, (D) attachment of chain to fusee, (E) attachment of chain to barrel, (F) fusee, (G) winding arbor, (W) output gear. The mainspring is coiled around a stationary axle (arbor), inside a cylindrical box, the barrel. The force of the spring turns the barrel. In a fusee clock, the barrel turns the fusee by pulling on the chain, and the fusee turns the clock's gears. #When the mainspring is wound up (Fig. 1), all the chain is wrapped around the fusee from bottom to top, and the end going to the barrel comes off the narrow top end of the fusee. So the strong pull of the wound up mainspring is applied to the small end of the fusee, and the torque on the fusee is reduced by the small lever arm of the fusee radius. #As the clock runs, the chain is unwound from the fusee from top to bottom and wound on the barrel. #As the mainspring runs down (Fig. 2), more of the chain is wrapped on the barrel, and the chain going to the barrel comes off the wide bottom grooves of the fusee. Now the weaker pull of the mainspring is applied to the larger radius of the bottom of the fusee. The greater turning moment provided by the larger radius at the fusee compensates for the weaker force of the spring, keeping the drive torque constant. #To wind the clock up again, a key is fitted to the protruding squared off axle (winding arbor) of the fusee and the fusee is turned. The pull of the fusee unwinds the chain off the barrel and back onto the fusee, turning the barrel and winding the mainspring. The presence of the fusee means that the force required to wind up the mainspring is constant; it does not increase as the mainspring tightens. The gear on the fusee drives the movement's wheel train, usually the center wheel. There is a ratchet between the fusee and its gear (not visible, inside the fusee) which prevents the fusee from turning the clock's wheel train backwards while it is being wound up. In quality watches and many later fusee movements there is also a maintaining power spring, to provide temporary force to keep the movement going while it is being wound. This type is called a going fusee. It is usually a planetary gear mechanism (epicyclic gearing) in the base of the fusee \\"cone\\") which then provides turning power in the opposite direction to the 'winding up' direction therefore keeping the watch or clock running during winding. Most fusee clocks and watches include a 'winding stop' mechanism to prevent the mainspring and fusee from being wound up too far, possibly breaking the chain. As it is wound, the fusee chain rises toward the top of the fusee. When it reaches the top, it presses against a lever, which moves a metal blade into the path of a projection sticking out from the edge of the fusee. As the fusee turns, the projection catches on the blade, preventing further winding., p.63-69 The normal fusee can only be wound in one direction. Drunken fusees were developed, but rarely used, to allow the fusee to be wound in either direction. John Arnold unsuccessfully used them in a few marine chronometers. Obsolescence A clock with the back plate off showing the fusee The fusee was a good mainspring compensator, but it was also expensive, difficult to adjust, and had other disadvantages: *It was bulky and tall, and made pocket watches unfashionably thick., p.143 *If the mainspring broke and had to be replaced, a frequent occurrence with early mainsprings, the fusee had to be readjusted to the new spring. *If the fusee chain broke, the force of the mainspring sent the end whipping about the inside of the clock, causing damage. Achieving isochrony was recognised as a serious problem throughout the 500-year history of spring-driven clocks. Many parts were gradually improved to increase isochronism, and eventually the fusee became unnecessary in most timepieces. The invention of the pendulum and the balance spring in the mid-17th century made clocks and watches much more isochronous, by making the timekeeping element a harmonic oscillator, with a natural \\"beat\\" resistant to change. The pendulum clock with an anchor escapement, invented in 1670, was sufficiently independent of drive force so that only a few had fusees.Milham 1945, p.441 In pocketwatches, the verge escapement, which required a fusee, was gradually replaced by escapements which were less sensitive to changes in mainspring force: the cylinder and later the lever escapement. In 1760, Jean- Antoine L√©pine dispensed with the fusee, inventing a going barrel to power the watch gear train directly. This contained a very long mainspring, of which only a few turns were used to power the watch. Accordingly, only a part of the mainspring's 'torque curve' was used, where the torque was approximately constant. In the 1780s, pursuing thinner watches, French watchmakers adopted the going barrel with the cylinder escapement. By 1850, the Swiss and American watchmaking industries employed the going barrel exclusively, aided by new methods of adjusting the balance spring so that it was isochronous. England continued to make the bulkier full plate fusee watches until about 1900. Oliver Mundy, Glossary, The Watch Cabinet They were inexpensive models sold to the lower classes and were derisively called \\"turnips\\". After this, the only remaining use for the fusee was in marine chronometers, where the highest precision was needed, and bulk was less of a disadvantage, until they became obsolete in the 1970s.

It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland. In June 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced that it was to be added as an Olympic event to the 2020 Summer Olympics. Early years The earliest photographic documentation of BMX freestyle shows Devin and Todd Bank in 1974 riding BMX bikes on an eight foot tall skateboard ramp they built at their childhood home in West Los Angeles, California. This was the birth of BMX ramp riding. Devin Bank was also documented doing 360 degree freestyle spinning tricks on the street and also in the air by jumping off curbs. Skateboarder Magazine then published photos of kids on bikes riding in empty household swimming pools in 1975.[1]. In 1975 kids started riding bikes in concrete reservoir channels in Escondido San Diego, California. In 1976 Devin and Todd Bank began riding BMX bikes inside the Runway Skatepark in Carson California. And, bike riders were also seen in 1976 riding at Carlsbad Skatepark in Carlsbad, California.[2]. Bob Haro and John Swanguen rode BMX bikes at Skateboard Heaven, a concrete skatepark in San Diego, California, late 1976. Later they transformed freestyle beyond skateparks by creating new bike tricks on flat streets.[3] In the fall of 1977 Bob Haro was hired as a staff artist at BMX Action Magazine where he be friended R.L. Osborn, son of the magazine publisher Bob Osborn. Haro and R.L. often practiced freestyle moves in their free time.[4] Freestyle BMX video In the summer of 1978, Paramount, Lakewood, and other Southern California skateparks began reserving sessions or whole days exclusively for BMX bikes. BMX racer Tinker Juarez was innovating freestyle moves in vert bowls at Lakewood Ca Park, while William \\"Crazy Lacy\\" Furmage was innovating freestyle at the Paramount Ca Skatepark.Skateboarder Magazine, February 1980 BMX Action Magazine published the first freestyle how to article in their January/February 1979 issue which showed Bob Haro doing a \\"rock walk.\\" BMX Action Magazine, January/February 1979, pg.34 BMX bike riders also performed a demonstration freestyle show in 1979 during a skate competition at Rocky Mountain Surf Skatepark in Salt Lake City, Utah.Skateboarder Magazine, February 1989 Towards the end of 1979, William \\"Crazy Lacy\\" Furmage and Tony Ray Davis formed the Super Style II BMX Trick Team and later began performing freestyle shows at BMX races and other events. After the Super Style II BMX Trick Team became known, other organized trick teams were founded and quickly gained prominence. The freestyle movement at this point was all underground. Although several BMX manufacture-sponsored freestyle teams were touring the US, they were promoting the sport of BMX in general, not specifically freestyle. The American Freestyle Association (AFA) was the first governing body for BMX freestyle, founded by Bob Morales in 1982. Bob Osborn founded a slick quarterly magazine devoted solely to freestyle BMX. In the summer of 1984, Freestylin' Magazine made its debut. The BMX world suddenly noticed the sport's massive potential. Manufacturers hurried to the drawing boards to develop new freestyle bikes, components, and accessories, and began searching for talented riders to sponsor. Bike shops began stocking freestyle products. The AFA began to put on organized flatland and quarter-pipe competitions. Peak and decline in popularity From 1980 until 1987, freestyle BMX increased in popularity to a peak in 1987. During this period, the sport progressed with the release of new bike models, components, and accessories designed strictly for freestyle. For example, Haro released the Haro FST, Sport, and Master each year, with blazing graphical colors, new look, and new frame designs. In the early 1990s, BMX freestyle suffered a decline in its commercial popularity; subsequently a number of large companies reduced or terminated their investment in the sport. In this economic climate, communities of new rider-owned companies and initiatives began to re-define the sport according to their own needs and interests, paving the way for what is now a largely new lead in the industry with clothing companies and material companies. This decline and subsequent new phase of the sport's development into an independently driven industry was notably referenced in the introduction to the BMX video Ride On (directed by Eddie Roman).  Practice disciplines  Freestyle BMX riders participate in several well-established disciplines. As in the other forms of freestyle riding, there are no specific rules; style/aesthetics, skills, and creativity are emphasised. = Street = Street riders make use of urban and public spaces to perform tricks. These tricks can be performed on curbs, handrails, stairs, ledges, banks, and other obstacles. Styles among street riders vary, as riders often depend upon their own urban surroundings. BMX street rose to prominence as an increasingly defined discipline in the late 1980s. In modern BMX, the progression of more technical tricks on street obstacles has led to this discipline becoming more divided from other freestyle disciplines. BMX bikes aimed at street riding typically have steeper angles and shorter wheelbases, making them easier to maneuver, but less stable at the higher speeds associated with ramp and dirt riding. Within street BMX there are a handful of competitions, however the majority of professional street riders tend to focus on making videos for DVDs and YouTube videos on behalf of their sponsors. Only a handful of riders tend to focus on both, with competition courses and corporate sponsorships not considered 'core' street riding by many riders. One rider that has succeeded in both competitions and video projects is Garret Reynolds. Garret has won 13 X Games medals, as well as Ride BMX Nora Cup Awards for Video Part of The Year and Street Rider of the Year, and is largely considered one of the best BMX Street riders ever. = Park = Park denotes the BMX discipline of exclusively riding skateparks, often with an emphasis on riding bowl transitions or ramp jumps. Skateparks are used by BMX riders as well as skateboarders, inline skaters and freestyle scooter-riders. Skateparks themselves can be made of wood, concrete or metal. Styles of riding will depend on the style of the parks. Wood is more suited to a flowing style, with riders searching for gaps and aiming to get the highest airs from the coping. Concrete parks usually tend to contain bowls and pools. However, it is not unusual for riders to merge the two styles in either type of park. Concrete parks are commonly built outdoors due to their ability to withstand years of exposure to the elements of conditions. Concrete parks are also often publicly funded due to their permanent and low cost nature in comparison to wood parks. Parks made from wood are popular with commercial skateparks, but harder to maintain, as the wood can start to decompose over time, or the features can be damaged through extensive use. Wooden parks are often considered safer than concrete, as during an impact, the wooden surface deflects by a small amount, in contrast to concrete, which is inelastic. Parks designed with BMX use in mind will typically have steel coping along the side that is less prone to damage than concrete or pool coping. There are a number of competitions that focus on the BMX Park discipline, with X Games typically focussing on progressive tricks and large jumps, and other competitions such as the Vans BMX Pro Cup focusing more on flowing and stylish riding on bowl style courses. In June 2017, the Olympic Committee announced that BMX Freestyle Park would be featured at the Summer 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. = Vert Ramp = Vert ramp Vert is a freestyle BMX discipline performed in a half pipe consisting of two quarter pipes set facing each other (much like a mini ramp), but at around 10‚Äì15 feet tall (around 2.5 to 3.5 meters high). The biggest ramp ever used in competition is the X-Games big air ramp at tall. Both ‚Äòfaces‚Äô of the ramp have an extension to the transition that is vertical, hence the name. Coping is a round metal tube at the lip of the vert that helps freestyle BMXers do grinds, and stalls on the lip of the vert. Riders go up each jump, performing air tricks before landing into the transition having turned 180 degrees. A typical run involves going from one side to the other, airing above the coping each side. Also possible are 'lip tricks' - tricks on the platform at the top of the ramps before dropping into the ramp. Many tricks consist of the rider grabbing a part of the bike or removing body parts off the bike. =Trails= Freshly faced dirt jumps at a set of BMX trails in Indiana. Trails are paths that lead to jumps made of heavily compacted dirt. Jumps in the same path, or \\"line\\", are sometimes referred to as packs, such as a four pack, a six pack, or an eight pack, which would have two, three, and four jumps respectively. A dirt jump consists of a steep take off, called a lip, with an often slightly less steep landing. The lip and landing are usually built as separate mounds, divided by a gap. The gap is measured from the topmost part of the lip, horizontally to the topmost part of the far side of the landing. Gaps typically range from only a couple of feet to over twenty feet. A moderate gap is around twelve feet. Trails riding is sometimes also referred to as \\"dirt jumping\\". Most trails riders maintain that a subtle difference exists in the style and flow of \\"dirt jumps\\" and \\"trails\\"; trails riders focus more on a flowing smooth style from one jump to the next while performing other stylish tricks, while dirt jumpers try to perform the craziest tricks they can over larger, less flow-oriented jumps. Trails riders usually run a rear brake only as they have no use for a front brake, and usually a rotor (gyro) to make it easier to do barspins, so they do not have to spin the bars back the other way to untangle them, which is hard to do on trails. In general, trail/dirt jumping bikes have longer wheelbases (chainstays) than other BMX bikes to aid with stability in mid-air. =Flatland= BMX Flatland rider Caleb Rider at Santa Monica beach. Flatland BMX occupies a position somewhat removed from the rest of freestyle BMX. People who ride in the above disciplines will generally take part in at least one of the others, but flatlanders tend to only ride flatland. They are often very dedicated and will spend several hours a day perfecting their technique. Flatland also differs from the others in that the terrain used is nothing but a smooth, flat surface (e.g. an asphalt parking lot, basketball courts, etc.). Tricks are performed by spinning and balancing in a variety of body and bicycle positions. Riders almost always use knurled aluminum pegs to stand on to manipulate the bike into even stranger positions. Flatland bikes typically have a shorter wheelbase than other freestyle bikes. Flatland bikes differ from dirt jumping bikes and freestyle bikes in one way. The frames are often more heavily reinforced because the people riding flatland often stand on the frames. This shorter wheelbase requires less effort to make the bike spin or to position the bike on one wheel. One of the primary reasons flat landers often ride only on flatland is the decreased stability of a shorter bike on ramps, dirt courses and streets. A variety of options are commonly found on flatland bikes, because it is in an open space. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes is the use of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatland riders will choose to run either a front brake, a rear brake, both brakes, or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference. Tricks = Air tricks = These tricks take place in the air. Freestyle dirt BMX involves many air tricks. * Gap: Jumping over a gap. * Tabletop: While in the air the rider will bring the bike up to one side of him/her by turning the handlebars and using body movement making the bike look like it is flat like the top of a table. Commonly confused with the \\"invert\\" trick which does not include much turning of the bars, but still executes the move in a tabletop manner. * Invert: Bringing the bike up to one side without turning the bars. * Superman: The rider removes both feet and extends them outwards to resemble Superman in flight. * Superman seat grab: A variation of the superman where the rider takes one hand off the handle bars and grabs the seat while extending their body before grabbing back on to the bars and landing * Dive Bomber: A variation of the Superman created by James Hirst where the rider becomes inverted and taps their nose on the front tire. * Barspin: Spinning the handle bars one full rotation around and catching them. * Bus Driver: A unique variation of the barspin, spinning the handle bars one full rotation around while keeping 1 hand on the bars to spin them like a bus steering wheel and catching them. * Jeep Driver: A unique variation of the barspin, grabbing the crossbar and spinning the handle bars one full rotation around and catching them. * Tailwhip: The rider throws the bike out to one side while still holding onto the handle bars so that the frame goes 360¬∞ around the steering tube; the rider then catches the frame again and stands back on the pedals. Variations include the double whip, triple whip, etc. * Decade: Similar to the flatland decade, the riders throw themselves around the bike while still holding on the handlebars before coming back round to meet the bike and land on the pedals. * Backflip: Both rider and bike do a backward flip while in midair. * Frontflip: Both rider and bike do a forward flip while in midair. * Flair: Both rider and bike do a backflip combined with a 180, to land facing back down the ramp. Usually performed on a quarter pipe. * Fast plant: A rider jumps or rides off a ramp and plants their foot down quickly. This is usually done on a gap or ramp and tied with a 180 coming out of a ramp. * Disaster: A rider jumps and purposely lands the back tire and sprocket on a ledge or ramp, usually done on a quarter pipe from a 180. * 180¬∞: The rider and bike spin 180¬∞ in the air and land backwards, in what is called fakie (riding backwards). * 360¬∞: The rider and bike spin 360¬∞. * 360¬∞ nose tap: rider does a 360 then inverts into a nose tap on a bench, box, ramp, etc. * 540¬∞: The rider picks up the bike and spins it 540 degrees. * X-up: The rider turns the bars at least 180 degrees, so the arms are crossed and then turns them back. * Can can: The rider brings a foot over the bike's top tube to the other side. * No-footed can: The rider does a can can but takes the other foot off the pedal as well, so that both legs are on one side of the bike. * Nac nac: The rider bring one foot over the back tire to the other side. * No-footed nac: The rider does a nac nac but takes the other foot off the pedal as well, so that both legs are on one side of the bike. * Candy cane: The rider takes 1 foot off the pedal and puts it over the bar making the shape of a candy cane with their legs. * Tire grab: The rider grabs the front tire. * Peg grab: The rider grabs a peg, usually on the front of their bike. * Pedal grab: The rider grabs a pedal. * Toboggan: The rider takes one hand off the bars and turns the bars and grabs their seat, then returns their hand to the bars before landing. * Tuck no Hander: The rider tucks in the handlebars and takes both hands off. * Turn down: The rider will whip the bike out to one side and turn the handle bars into his or her legs wrapping them around their leg. * Crankflip: The rider bunny hops and kicks the pedals backwards so the crank arms spin one full crank around and then the feet catch back onto the pedals to stop the cranks. * Pedalflip: The rider bunny hops and kicks the pedals to spin them then lands on them. * ET: The rider is in mid air and pedals one full crank as though he is riding normally. * TE/Chainsaw: The rider is in mid air and pedals backwards one full crank quickly. Basically an ET, but in reverse. * Bikeflip: The rider flips his bicycle without moving his body in mid air. * Truckdriver: The rider spins the bike 360 degrees whilst doing a barspin in mid air. * Half cab: The rider fakies/rollouts and makes a 180 degree rotation, completing the fakie, rollout. * Full cab: The rider fakies/rollouts and makes a 360 degree rotation, making the bike return in the same position, and having to finish the fakie/rollout. * 540 cab: The rider fakies/rollouts and makes a 540 degree rotation, with no need to finish to fakie/rollout. * Nothing: The rider lets go of the handlebars and pedal at the same time in mid air. * Suicide no-hander: The rider lets go of only the handle bars similar to a tuck no-hander, but rather stretches his/her arms out to the sides without tucking the bike. * double peg stall: the rider jumps and lands the pegs on a ledge without grinding and balances in a still position. * Sprocket stall: A rider jumps and lands on the sprocket, usually done with a guarded sprocket to reduce wear on the bike. * 720: two 360's in one jump. * Cash roll: Invented by Daniel Dhers, similar to a 360 backflip but instead of rotating while upside-down the rider does a 180-backflip-180. * 360 windshield wiper: the rider does a 360 downside tailwhip (Decade) then an opposite tailwhip in one air. * Carcrash/Helicopter: barspin and a crankflip http://bmx.transworld.net/1000146723/videos/how-to-suicide-no-h tander-with- shane-weston/ * 540 tailwhip: The rider does a 540 in the air then a tailwhip. * Transfer: A transfer is when you go up one ramp then go onto another ramp. * Wall ride: A rider jumps and rides on a wall, then rides or jumps off. * Running Man: A rider jumps towards a wall, taking both feet off the bike, runs on the wall, then jumps back on the bike. * Ninja Drop/dropin: A standing rider holds the bars and seat of the bike over a ramp or drop, then jumps into the air and on the bike, landing in a riding position. Variations and combinations of these tricks also exist, for example a 360¬∞ tailwhip would be where the rider spins 360¬∞ in one direction and the frame of the bike spins 360¬∞ around the steer tube, both bike and rider will then meet again, with the rider catching the pedals, facing the same direction as before the trick. = Flatland tricks = BMX flatland tricks usually involve much balance, more often than not with only one wheel in contact with the ground. * Wheelie or Catwalk: The most basic of flatland tricks, the wheelie is when the rider rides the bike on only the back wheel whilst pedaling. * Endo: Basic flatland trick where the rider uses the front brake or a curb to lift the back wheel and balance on the front tire. * Front or Back Pogos: Basic flatland trick where the rider stands on the wheel pegs (front or back), locks the wheel's brake, and hops with the other wheel in the air. * Manual: A step-up from the wheelie, the manual is essentially the same only the rider does not pedal; this makes the trick more difficult to perform as point of balance between the front and back of the bike has to be reached. Professional riders can often do this until their bike runs out of momentum. * Pogo: The most popular advanced basic trick. Created in the 80's, it is executed by swinging the bike to a vertical position on its rear wheel while the rider sits and hops on it to maintain balance. * Nose manual: The same concept as a manual, only performed with the back wheel in the air and the front wheel on the ground. * Bunny hop: A bunny hop is achieved when a rider jumps the bike into the air from flat ground (this can also be done close to the lip of ramp to gain more height) so that neither wheels are touching the ground. * Miami Hop: Endo to Pogo on front wheel turned sideways rather than on rear wheel upright, best executed with Z-Rims or mags. * Grip ride: The rider jumps their feet from the pedals to the top of the handle bars then releases their hands to stand up while steering with their feet. * Dork manual: When rider puts one foot on the peg, and the other foot in the air, controlling balance, and ride down the street in a manual with the foot on the peg. * Fork manual: When a rider puts one foot on the front peg and spins the handlebars around, to lift the bike up into a fakie manual, with both feet on pegs. * Footjam tailwhip: The rider jams his/her foot in the fork to start a foot jam endo then kicks the tail of the bike around. When the tail of the bike goes 360 degrees the rider puts his/her foot back on the pedals. An alternate trick is to jump the frame as it comes around repeatedly until the rider elects to put his/her foot back on the pedals. * Footjam: The rider jams his foot between the forks and tire, stopping the bike, and he balances with the back tire airborne. * Hang-5: The rider performs a nose manual whilst having one foot on the front axle peg and the other foot dangling, usually used to keep balance and steady. * Steamroller: An Advanced trick. The rider stands on one front peg, and sends the bike to front with his other foot, then balances on one wheel while holding the body of bike with one hand and moving at front. * Time machine: An extremely hard trick. Rider stands on one back peg, then starts to make a manual, after balances it, changes hands on bar while manualing and grabs the front peg with his free hand. After that, rider starts to turn at extremely high speed as if he's drawing an \\"O\\" on the ground. * Indian giver: This is where the rider naturally or purposely fakies/rollouts in the opposite direction than the way of that they spun in. This is usually easily fixed by learning how to fakie/rollout the correct way, thus making the execution and finishing look cleaner. * Fakie: When the rider is riding backwards and pedalling in an anti-clockwise direction with the sprocket movement or coasting as you are moving backwards then at the right point turning your bars the opposite direction you want to turn and sliding out so you are riding forward again.

The piece of metal is called a reed. Specific types of pump organ include the reed organ, harmonium, and melodeon. More portable than pipe organs, free-reed organs were widely used in smaller churches and in private homes in the 19th century, but their volume and tonal range were limited. They generally had one or sometimes two manuals, with pedal-boards being rare. The finer pump organs had a wider range of tones, and the cabinets of those intended for churches and affluent homes were often excellent pieces of furniture. Several million free-reed organs and melodeons were made in the US and Canada between the 1850s and the 1920s. During this time Estey Organ and Mason & Hamlin were popular manufacturers. History Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein (1723‚Äì1795), professor of physiology at Copenhagen, was credited with the first free-reed instrument made in the Western world, after winning the annual prize in 1780 from the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. The harmonium's design incorporates free reeds and derives from the earlier regal. A harmonium-like instrument was exhibited by (1756‚Äì1837) in 1810. He called it an orgue expressif (expressive organ), because his instrument was capable of greater expression, as well as of producing a crescendo and diminuendo. Alexandre Debain improved Greni√©'s instrument and gave it the name harmonium when he patented his version in 1840. There was concurrent development of similar instruments. A mechanic who had worked in the factory of Alexandre in Paris emigrated to the United States and conceived the idea of a suction bellows, instead of the ordinary bellows that forced the air outward through the reeds. Beginning in 1885, the firm of Mason & Hamlin, of Boston made their instruments with the suction bellows, and this method of construction soon superseded all others in America. Beatty's Parlor Organ, 1882 Harmoniums reached the height of their popularity in the West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were especially popular in small churches and chapels where a pipe organ would be too large or expensive; in the funeral-in-absentia scene from Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the protagonist narrates that the church procured a \\"melodeum\\" (a conflation, likely intended by Twain for satirical effect, of the names \\"melodeon\\" and \\"harmonium\\") for the occasion. Harmoniums generally weigh less than similar sized pianos and are not easily damaged in transport, thus they were also popular throughout the colonies of the European powers in this period not only because it was easier to ship the instrument out to where it was needed, but it was also easier to transport overland in areas where good-quality roads and railways may have been non-existent. An added attraction of the harmonium in tropical regions was that the instrument held its tune regardless of heat and humidity, unlike the piano. This \\"export\\" market was sufficiently lucrative for manufacturers to produce harmoniums with cases impregnated with chemicals to prevent woodworm and other damaging organisms found in the tropics. air stop knobs At the peak of the instruments' Western popularity around 1900, a wide variety of styles of harmoniums were being produced. These ranged from simple models with plain cases and only four or five stops (if any at all), up to large instruments with ornate cases, up to a dozen stops and other mechanisms such as couplers. Expensive harmoniums were often built to resemble pipe organs, with ranks of fake pipes attached to the top of the instrument. Small numbers of harmoniums were built with two manuals (keyboards). Some were even built with pedal keyboards, which required the use of an assistant to run the bellows or, for some of the later models, an electrical pump. These larger instruments were mainly intended for home use, such as allowing organists to practise on an instrument on the scale of a pipe organ, but without the physical size or volume of such an instrument. For missionaries, chaplains in the armed forces, travelling evangelist etc., reed organs that folded up into a container the size of a very large suitcase or small trunk were made; these had a short keyboard and few stops, but they were more than adequate for keeping hymn singers more or less on pitch. The invention of the electronic organ in the mid-1930s spelled the end of the harmonium's success in the West, although its popularity as a household instrument had already declined in the 1920s as musical tastes changed . The Hammond organ could imitate the tonal quality and range of a pipe organ whilst retaining the compact dimensions and cost-effectiveness of the harmonium as well as reducing maintenance needs and allowing a greater number of stops and other features. By this time, harmoniums had reached high levels of mechanical complexity, not only through the demand for instruments with a greater tonal range, but also due to patent laws (especially in North America). It was common for manufacturers to patent the action mechanism used on their instruments, thus requiring any new manufacturer to develop their own version;{{cn}{ as the number of manufacturers grew, this led to some instruments having hugely complex arrays of levers, cranks, rods and shafts, which made replacement with an electronic instrument even more attractive. The last mass-producer of harmoniums in North America was the Estey company, which ceased manufacture in the mid-1950s; a couple of Italian companies continued into the 1970s. As the existing stock of instruments aged and spare parts became hard to find, more and more were either scrapped or sold. It was not uncommon for harmoniums to be \\"modernised\\" by having electric blowers fitted, often very unsympathetically. The majority of Western harmoniums today are in the hands of enthusiasts, though the instrument still remains popular in South Asia. Modern electronic keyboards can emulate the sound of the pump organ. Acoustics Two reeds from a reed organ The acoustical effects described below are a result of the free-reed mechanism. Therefore, they are essentially identical for the Western and Indian harmoniums and the reed organ. In 1875, Hermann von Helmholtz published his seminal book, On the Sensations of Tone, in which he used the harmonium extensively to test different tuning systems:Helmholtz, L. F., and Ellis, A., On the Sensations of Tone, London: Longmans, Green, And Co., 1875. > \\"Among musical instruments, the harmonium, on account of its uniformly > sustained tone, the piercing character of its quality of tone, and its > tolerably distinct combinational tones, is particularly sensitive to > inaccuracies of intonation. And as its vibrators also admit of a delicate > and durable tuning, it appeared to me peculiarly suitable for experiments on > a more perfect system of tones.\\"Helmholtz, H. L. F., 1875, p. 492, Part III, > Justly-Intoned Harmonium. Using two manuals and two differently tuned stop sets, he was able to simultaneously compare Pythagorean to just and to equal-tempered tunings and observe the degrees of inharmonicity inherent to the different temperaments. He subdivided the octave to 28 tones, to be able to perform modulations of 12 minor and 17 major keys in just intonation without going into harsh dissonance that is present with the standard octave division in this tuning.Helmholtz, H. L. F., 1875, p. 634, Appendix. XVII. This arrangement was difficult to play on.Helmholtz, H. L. F., 1875, p. 682, Appendix. XIX. Additional modified or novel instruments were used for experimental and educational purposes; notably, Bosanquet's Generalized keyboard was constructed in 1873 for use with a 53-tone scale. In practice, that harmonium was constructed with 84 keys, for convenience of fingering. Another famous reed organ that was evaluated was built by Poole.Helmholtz, H. L. F., 1875, p. 677, Appendix. XIX. Lord Rayleigh also used the harmonium to devise a method for indirectly measuring frequency accurately, using approximated known equal temperament intervals and their overtone beats. The harmonium had the advantage of providing clear overtones that enabled the reliable counting of beats by two listeners, one per note. However, Rayleigh acknowledged that maintaining constant pressure in the bellows is difficult and fluctuation of the pitch occurs rather frequently as a result. Portable 19th-century reed organ with one rank of reeds In the generation of its tones, a reed organ is similar to an accordion or concertina, but not in its installation, as an accordion is held in both hands whereas a reed organ is usually positioned on the floor in a wooden casing (which might make it mistakable for a piano at the very first glimpse). Reed organs are operated either with pressure or with suction bellows. Pressure bellows permit a wider range to modify the volume, depending on whether the pedaling of the bellows is faster or slower. In North America and the United Kingdom, a reed organ with pressure bellows is referred to as a harmonium, whereas in continental Europe, any reed organ is called a harmonium regardless of whether it has pressure or suction bellows. As reed organs with pressure bellows were more difficult to produce and therefore more expensive, North American and British reed organs and melodeons generally use suction bellows and operate on vacuum. Reed organ frequencies depend on the blowing pressure; the fundamental frequency decreases with medium pressure compared to low pressure, but it increases again at high pressures by several hertz for the bass notes measured. American reed organ measurements showed a sinusoidal oscillation with sharp pressure transitions when the reed bends above and below its frame. The fundamental itself is nearly the mechanical resonance frequency of the reed. The overtones of the instrument are harmonics of the fundamental, rather than inharmonic, although a weak inharmonic overtone (6.27f) was reported too. The fundamental frequency comes from a transverse mode, whereas weaker higher transverse and torsional modes were measured too. Any torsional modes are excited because of a slight asymmetry in the reed's construction. During attack, it was shown that the reed produces most strongly the fundamental, along with a second transverse or torsional mode, which are transient. Radiation patterns and coupling effects between the sound box and the reeds on the timbre appear not to have been studied to date. The unusual reed-vibration physics have a direct effect on harmonium playing, as the control of its dynamics in playing is restricted and subtle. The free reed of the harmonium is riveted from a metal frame and is subjected to airflow, which is pumped from the bellows through the reservoir, pushing the reed and bringing it to self-exciting oscillation and to sound production in the direction of airflow. This particular aerodynamics is nonlinear in that the maximum displacement amplitude in which the reed can vibrate is limited by fluctuations in damping forces, so that the resultant sound pressure is rather constant. Additionally, there is a threshold pumping pressure, below which the reed vibration is minimal. Within those two thresholds, there is an exponential growth and decay in time of reed amplitudes . Repertory A Victorian-era pump organ A smaller variety of pump organ Mason & Hamlin pump organ A pump organ Harmonium compositions are available by European and American composers of classical music. It was also used often in the folk music of the Appalachians and South of the United States. Harmoniums played a significant part in the new rise of Nordic folk music, especially in Finland. In the late 1970s, a harmonium could be found in most schools where the bands met, and it became natural for the bands to include a harmonium in their setup. A typical folk band then‚Äîparticularly in Western Finland‚Äîconsisted of violin(s), double bass and harmonium. There was a practical limitation that prevented playing harmonium and accordion in the same band: harmoniums were tuned to 438 Hz, while accordions were tuned to 442 Hz. Some key harmonium players in the new rise of Nordic folk have been Timo Alakotila and Milla Viljamaa. In the Netherlands, the introduction of the harmonium triggered a boom in religious house music. Its organ-like sound quality allowed Reformed families to sing psalms and hymns at home. A lot of new hymns were composed expressly for voice and harmonium, notably those by Johannes de Heer.Jan Smelik, \\"Stichtelijke zang rond het harmonium\\" in: Louis Grijp c.s., Een muziekgeschiedenis der Nederlanden. Amsterdam University Press/Salome, Amsterdam, 2001: pp. 547-52. =Western classical= The harmonium repertoire includes many pieces written originally for the church organ, which may be played on a harmonium as well, because they have a small enough range and use fewer stops. For example, Bach's Fantasia in C major for organ BWV 570 is suitable for a four-octave harmonium. Other examples include: *Alban Berg. Altenberg Lieder *William Bergsma. Dances from a New England Album, 1856 for orchestra. It includes parts for melodeon (movements I-III) and harmonium (movement IV). *William Bolcom.

John Lennon played a Mannborg harmonium on the Beatles' hit single \\"We Can Work It Out\\", released in December 1965, and the band used the instrument on other songs recorded during the sessions for their Rubber Soul album. They also used the instrument on the famous \\"final chord\\" of \\"A Day in the Life\\", and on the song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\", both released on the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The group's hit single \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" and the track \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" were both written using a harmonium. Many other artists soon employed the instrument in their music, including; Pink Floyd on the title song \\"Chapter 24\\" of their first album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in 1967, Elton John on his 1973 album Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player, 1976's Blue Moves, the 1978 album A Single Man, and 1995's Made in England. German singer Nico was closely associated with the harmonium, using it as her main instrument, during the late 60s and 70s, on albums such as The Marble Index, Desertshore and The End.... Donovan employed the harmonium on his 1968 album The Hurdy Gurdy Man where he played it in droning accompaniment on the song \\"Peregrine\\", and where it was also played on his song \\"Poor Cow\\" by John Cameron. More recently Roger Hodgson from Supertramp used his harmonium on many of the group's songs including \\"Two of Us\\" from Crisis? What Crisis?, \\"Fool's Overture\\" from Even in the Quietest Moments..., the title track to their 1979 album Breakfast in America and \\"Lord Is It Mine\\". Hodgson also used a harmonium on \\"The Garden\\" from his 2000 solo album Open the Door. Greg Weeks and Tori Amos have both used the instrument on their recordings and live performances. The Damned singer Dave Vanian bought a harmonium for ¬£49 and used it to compose ‚ÄúCurtain Call‚Äù, the 17-minute closing track from their 1980 double LP The Black Album. In 1990, Depeche Mode used a harmonium on a version of their song \\"Enjoy The Silence\\". The Divine Comedy used a harmonium on \\"Neptune's Daughter\\" from their 1994 album Promenade. Sara Bareilles used the harmonium on her 2012 song \\"Once Upon Another Time\\". During the 1990s the Hindu and Sikh-based devotional music known as kirtan, a 7th-8th century Indian music, popularly emerged in the West. The harmonium is often played as the lead instrument by kirtan artists; notably Jai Uttal who was nominated for a Grammy award for new-age music in 2004, Snatam Kaur, and Krishna Das who was nominated for a Grammy award for new age music in 2012. In the Indian subcontinent Ustad Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan was widely known as Harmonium Raj Sahib (King of the Harmonium) for playing with the legendary qawwal Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The harmonium is popular to the present day, and the harmonium remains an important instrument in many genres of genres of Indian and Pakistani music. For example, it is a staple of vocal North Indian classical music and Sufi Muslim Qawwali concerts. It is commonly found in Indian homes. Though derived from the designs developed in France, the harmonium was developed further in India in unique ways, such as the addition of drone stops and a scale-changing mechanism. In Kolkata, Dwarkanath Ghose of the Dwarkin company modified the imported harmony flute and developed the hand-held harmonium, which has subsequently become an integral part of the Indian music scene. Dwijendranath Tagore is credited with having used the imported instrument in 1860 in his private theatre, but it was probably a pedal-pumped instrument that was cumbersome or possibly some variation of the reed organ. Initially it aroused curiosity, but gradually people started playing it, and Ghose took the initiative to modify it. It was in response to the Indian needs that the hand-held harmonium was introduced. All Indian musical instruments are played with the musician sitting on the floor or on a stage, behind the instrument or holding it in his hands. In that era, Indian homes did not use tables and chairs. Also, Western music being harmonically based, both a player's hands were needed to play the chords, thus assigning the bellows to the feet was the best solution; Indian music, being melodically based, only one hand was necessary to play the melody, and the other hand was free for the bellows. The harmonium was widely accepted in Indian music, particularly Parsi and Marathi stage music, in the late 19th century. By the early 20th century, however, in the context of nationalist movements that sought to depict India as utterly separate from the West, the harmonium was portrayed as an unwanted foreigner. Technical concerns with the harmonium included its inability to produce meend (slides between notes) which can be done in instruments like Sitar and Sarod, and the fact that, once tuned, it cannot be adjusted in the course of performance. The former prevents it from articulating the subtle inflections (such as andolan, gentle oscillation) so crucial to many ragas; the latter prevents it from articulating the subtle differences in intonational color between a given svara in two different ragas. For these reasons, it was banned from All India Radio from 1940 to 1971; a ban still stands on harmonium solos. On the other hand, many of the harmonium's qualities suited it very well for the newly reformed classical music of the early 20th century: it is easy for amateurs to learn; it supports group singing and large voice classes; it provides a template for standardized raga grammar; it is loud enough to provide a drone in a concert hall. For these reasons, it has become the instrument of choice for accompanying most North Indian classical vocal genres, with top vocalists (e.g., Bhimsen Joshi) routinely using harmonium accompaniment in their concerts. However, it is still despised by some connoisseurs of Indian music, who prefer the sarangi as an accompanying instrument for khyal singing. A popular usage is by followers of the Hindu and Sikh faiths, who use it to accompany their devotional songs (bhajan and kirtan) respectively . There is at least one harmonium in any gurdwara (Sikh temple) around the world. The harmonium is commonly accompanied by the tabla as well as a dholak. To Sikhs, the harmonium is known as the vaja or baja. It is also referred to as a peti (literally, box) in some parts of North India and Maharashtra. The harmonium plays an integral part in Qawwali music. Almost all Qawwals use the harmonium as their sole musical accompaniment. It has received international exposure as the genre of Qawwali music has been popularized by renowned Pakistani musicians, including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. There is some discussion of Indian harmonium makers producing reproductions of Western-style reed organs for the export trade. Dr. Vidyadhar Oke with 22-microtone harmonium Vidyadhar Oke has developed a 22-microtone harmonium, which can play 22 microtones as required in Indian classical music. The fundamental tone (Shadja) and the fifth (Pancham) are fixed, but the other ten notes have two microtones each, one higher and one lower. The higher microtone is selected by pulling out a knob below the key. In this way, the 22-shruti harmonium can be tuned for any particular raga by simply pulling out knobs wherever a higher shruti is required. A craftsman repairs a harmonium in his shop in Amritsar, India. Bhishmadev Vedi is said to have been the first to contemplate improving the harmonium by augmenting it with a swarmandal (harp- like string box) attached to the top of the instrument. His disciple, Manohar Chimote, later implemented this concept, also making the instrument more responsive to key pressure, and called the instrument a samvadini‚Äîa name now widely accepted. Bhishmadev Vedi is also said to have been among the first to contemplate and design compositions specifically for the harmonium, styled along the lines of \\"tantakari\\"‚Äîperformance of music on stringed instruments. These compositions tend to have a lot of cut notes and high-speed passages, creating an effect similar to that of a string being plucked. In 1954, Late Jogesh Chandra Biswas first modified the then-existing harmoniums, so it folds down into a much thinner space for easier-maneuverability. Prior to that, if the instrument was boxed, it used to need two people to carry it, holding it from either side. This improvisation became a generic design in most harmoniums since then and coined with the term \\"Folding Harmoniums\\". See also: the Shruti box, a keyless harmonium used only to produce drones to support other soloists.

Daniel Library is a building of award-winning design and one of the recently renovated libraries in the District of Columbia Public Library's system. Originally constructed in 1975 as a two-story structure in the Shaw neighborhood, the building was extensively renovated and reopened as a three- story structure in August 2010. With its distinctive translucent facade, glass enclosure, and light flooded interior, it has been hailed as a model for future libraries.  History  The Shaw library opened on September 27, 1975 at the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and 7th Street NW with a ceremony led by Mayor Walter Washington. It reflected a design for the library, drawn up after the 1968 riots that devastated Shaw, which was so prison-like that the National Capital Planning Commission directed the District to open it up with larger windows, bigger setbacks, and arcades. The artictect, Eason Cross of the Alexandria VA-based firm Cross and Adreon, rejected the advice and persisted with the original Brutalist design that had only slits for windows. He continued with his plans, despite an attempt to get a federal injunction to stop, with the justification that the small, irregular size of the lot prohibited any redesign. The original library, constructed at a cost of $1.2 million, came from Federal appropriations budgeted by the D.C. Commissioners. The two story building contained adult reading room, a lounge area, and a listening booth on the first floor while the second floor provided space for a children's room complete with a specially designed enclosure for story hours. The original building was razed in 2004. The massive renovation, started with plans received in 2007, was part of a wave of upgrades to DC Public Library facilities undertaken by Chief Librarian Ginnie Cooper. Costs were estimated to be $15,707,441 or $433 per square foot, though final costs were reported at $12 million. Of any of the projects, the renovation of the Shaw Library showed the greatest transformation from its previous state, according to Cooper. The building was named after Watha T. Daniel, a master plumber, Shaw resident and community leader who was the first chairman of the DC Model Cities Commission and died in 1971. In March 2016, a security guard at the library was observed by multiple patrons harassing a Muslim patron for wearing a hijab.Cop Who Told Woman In Library To Remove Hijab: I Thought It Was A Hoodie by Christopher Mathias; 03/25/2016 01:15 pm ET Huffington Post Protests were held outside the library and the security guard admitted to harassing the woman although he claimed he thought she was wearing a hoodie.

The entry plaza on the east end of the cite opens to the main lobby that provides access to the lower level which houses community spaces. Peter D. Cook, principal in charge of design at the Davis Brody Bond Aedas architectural firm responsible for the project, explained that ‚ÄúThe Library will anchor the neighborhood by providing a civic facility rich in aesthetic, environmental and programmatic assets that is representative of DC Public Library‚Äôs commitment to a standard of excellence for all residents.‚Äù The defining features of the building is a corrugated, perforated aluminum screen wall system across its southern fa√ßade which forms a distinctive jutting prow. With a 40% open area, the screen wall sits three feet in front of an expansive glazed curtain wall and provides shading of the upper level reading room while allowing natural daylight to enter the space. The shading system allows a reduced dependence on artificial lighting and protects the Library‚Äôs collection from harmful solar exposure. To take full advantage of the location's potential for unobstructed natural light, clerestory windows and translucent, insulated fiberglass panels on the north provide illumination from the sun on all sides. Lighting design firm MCLA validated light levels in the large, open room through a detailed analysis. The lighting designers developed an electric lighting system based primarily on the T5 linear fluorescent with a 3500-Kelvin color temperature‚Äîthe lamp preferred by the client for energy and maintenance efficiency. Special fixtures are cantilevered from the tall stacks for vertical illumination on the books, and suspended luminaires are mounted over reading tables and workstations. The renovated building was designed to meet LEED Silver Certification and incorporates a vegetative green roof, displacement air system, solar control and daylight management and uses of recyclable and renewable materials. It received LEED Gold Certification. The design for the new library went through several iterations. At one point, amidst budget constraints, model was proposed that scrapped much of the glass and proposed a structure similar to the old version. This was driven by the discovery that Metro has both a tunnel and a large vent under and abutting the library site, making it more expensive to do construction there.  Resources  In addition to functioning as a library, the building has been hailed as a \\"hybrid community, recreation and learning center.\\" The library contains 40,000 books, DVDs, CDs and other library materials with capacity for 80,000 items. Computer access includes 32 public access computers, free Wi-Fi Internet access, and 8 Mac computers in the teen space. There is comfortable seating for 200 customers, one large program room for up to 100 people, two 12-person conference rooms, and a vending area. Among its community offerings are yoga and Bollywood dance classes. The facilities have been used for mayoral announcements.  Other features  The entry plaza at the east end of the site welcomes the public to the library and displays a 22-foot neon sculpture by local artist Craig Kraft. Entitled Vivace, according to the artist the piece was inspired by jazz and is intended to capture \\"the spirit of creativity, vibrancy and color\\" that he associates with the Shaw neighborhood. A graphic mural in the upper level displays a collage of portraits depicting over 250 members of the community and an inspirational quote from President Barack Obama‚Äôs inaugural address which reads, ‚ÄúWe know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.‚Äù  Response  The District of Columbia‚Äôs Mayor Adrian M. Fenty presented the architects with a National Association of Builders and Contractors Proclamation Award. The Urban Land Institute named the library one of the Top 10 Buildings in Washington DC and it received the Developers and Builders Alliance Community Advancement Award for the Best Developments of the Year, USA & Canada. The Wall Street Journal named it one of the top 10 buildings in the US for 2010. Other awards include the Associated General Contractors Washington Contractor Award, NAIOP Award of Excellence and ENR Mid-Atlantic Construction Award.

The MacOS and Microsoft Windows schedulers can both be regarded as examples of the broader class of multilevel feedback queue schedulers.Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction, Max Hailperin, 2007, p. 61 This scheduling algorithm is intended to meet the following design requirements for multimode systems: #Give preference to short jobs. #Give preference to I/O bound processes. #Separate processes into categories based on their need for the processor. The Multi-level Feedback Queue scheduler was first developed by Fernando J. Corbat√≥ et al. in 1962, and this work, along with other work on Multics, led the ACM to award Corbat√≥ the Turing Award.  Process scheduling  Unlike multilevel queue scheduling algorithm where processes are permanently assigned to a queue, multilevel feedback queue scheduling allows a process to move between queues. This movement is facilitated by the characteristic of the CPU burst of the process. If a process uses too much CPU time, it will be moved to a lower-priority queue. This scheme leaves I/O-bound and interactive processes in the higher priority queues. In addition, a process that waits too long in a lower-priority queue may be moved to a higher priority queue. This form of aging also helps to prevent starvation of certain lower priority processes. = Algorithm = Multiple FIFO queues are used and the operation is as follows: #A new process is inserted at the end (tail) of the top-level FIFO queue. #At some stage the process reaches the head of the queue and is assigned the CPU. #If the process is completed within the time quantum of the given queue, it leaves the system. #If the process voluntarily relinquishes control of the CPU, it leaves the queuing network, and when the process becomes ready again it is inserted at the tail of the same queue which it relinquished earlier. #If the process uses all the quantum time, it is pre- empted and inserted at the end of the next lower level queue. This next lower level queue will have a time quantum which is more than that of the previous higher level queue. #This scheme will continue until the process completes or it reaches the base level queue. ::*At the base level queue the processes circulate in round robin fashion until they complete and leave the system. Processes in the base level queue can also be scheduled on a first come first served basis. ::*Optionally, if a process blocks for I/O, it is 'promoted' one level, and placed at the end of the next-higher queue. This allows I/O bound processes to be favored by the scheduler and allows processes to 'escape' the base level queue. For scheduling, the scheduler always starts picking up processes from the head of the highest level queue. Only if the highest level queue has become empty will the scheduler take up a process from the next lower level queue. The same policy is implemented for picking up in the subsequent lower level queues. Meanwhile, if a process comes into any of the higher level queues, it will preempt a process in the lower level queue. Also, a new process is always inserted at the tail of the top level queue with the assumption that it will complete in a short amount of time. Long processes will automatically sink to lower level queues based on their time consumption and interactivity level. In the multilevel feedback queue a process is given just one chance to complete at a given queue level before it is forced down to a lower level queue. = Scheduling parameters = In general, a multilevel feedback queue scheduler is defined by the following parameters: *The number of queues. *The scheduling algorithm for each queue which can be different from FIFO. *The method used to determine when to promote a process to a higher priority queue. *The method used to determine when to demote a process to a lower priority queue. *The method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service.

It is sometimes described as a form of artistic cycling with a blend of breakdancing. Flatland occupies a position somewhat removed from the rest of freestyle BMX. They are often very dedicated, and will spend several hours a day perfecting their techniques. Flatland also differs from the others in that the terrain used is nothing but a smooth, flat surface. Tricks are performed by spinning and balancing on the bike in a variety of unexpected positions. Riders almost always use either knurled/grip taped aluminum or plastic pegs to stand on to manipulate the bike into even more imaginative positions. Flatland bikes typically have a shorter wheelbase than other freestyle bikes. This shorter wheelbase requires less effort to make the bike spin or to position the bike on one wheel. One of the primary reasons flatlanders often ride only flatland is the decreased stability of using their shorter bikes on ramps, dirt and street. A variety of options is commonly found on flatland bikes. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes is the use of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatlanders will choose to run a front brake (or a dual front brake; one front brake with two brake levers using one brake cable), front and rear brakes, or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference. Flatland bikes Although the flatland bicycle is similar to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited to the needs of flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front brake cable, and a rear brake cable detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backward without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backward as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth). Style A Flatland BMX rider practicing in Japan, 2017 In competition, talent and skill are judged by the ability to maintain coordination, and balance while performing a variety of difficult and elegant moves. There are usually several categories for judging purposes which can include: *Number of touches: The number of times a trick is not completed and/or the number of touches of the foot to the ground *Number of tricks completed in the allotted time *Difficulty of the tricks, which can be very subjective, as flatland techniques have in many ways become as refined as those in figure skating or breakdancing *Originality of the tricks performed, which again can be somewhat subjective *Style and flow, or how smoothly and/or stylishly moves are performed during the contest run *Showmanship: The ability to present your routine to the crowd. Hugo Gonzales and Dave Vanderspek, while not the top pros were known for their elaborate showmanship and antics. Flatland is an involving, time-consuming discipline in which the rider learns different balance/counterbalance points and center-of-gravity in motion techniques through repetition and trial-and-error. Some tricks can be learned in hours, while others may take years to master. Various riders emphasize different aspects of the discipline: the artistic nature of flatland and the originality of tricks, the number and difficulty of tricks, or the simple enjoyment of the activity. Only contest riders need to be concerned with the competitive side of the discipline, as there are many riders who prefer doing shows, taking parts in videos, or simply riding with their friends and enjoying themselves. Riders usually pedal a few times for speed, and then perform various stunts often involving difficult and/or awkward stances on pegs, mounted to the axles of their front or back wheels. Pegs are aluminum or plastic tubes, which are bolted onto both sides of the front and back axles. When flatland riding first began, most riders would do one trick and then return to the pedals. However, by combining different body and bicycle positions into \\"combos\\" and \\"linking\\" them together, riders began to do several tricks in a row without stopping between each move. Flatland riding is now usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together non-stop as the rider goes through as many as 10-12 consecutive moves, and position/direction changes, before returning to the pedals. History Flatland originated from three pioneers; R. L. Osborn, Bob Haro, and Bob Morales. R. L. Osborn was a fan favorite in the mid 80s, being the highest paid BMX flatland professional ever after signing a contract with General Bicycles for around US$100,000. Bob Haro went on to become founder of Haro Bicycles. Bob Morales was the founder of the once elite American Freestyle Association. The AFA was the dominating league for both professional and amateur flatland and quarter pipe events. While there were several amateur AFA events the Masters series contest, held throughout the US was the biggest pro/am flatland/quarter pipe event of the time. Flatland's roots can be dated back to the 1950s. Flatland has gone through many stylistic changes since its beginnings in the late 1970s. Riders once wore full protective gear and full face helmets, starred in feature- length films such as Rad (film), and performed in large-scale events such as NBA halftimes. Following the decline in popularity and subsequent recession in most action sports at the end of the 80s, flatland went \\"underground\\". It resurfaced in the late 90s with the return of media attention in the form of events such as the X Games. Flatland was dropped from the X Games and other large-scale events in the early 2000s, forcing the sport/artform to become more independently run and owned. Most flatland companies and events now exist outside of other BMX circles, although there is still, somewhat limited, coverage in mainstream BMX magazines and videos. With the removal of flatland from events such as the XGames, many independent event organizers have stepped up and taken flatland to the masses through creative, independently organized events such as the Red Bull Circle Balance, Circle Cow, and BMX Masters events in Europe, the Elevation Flatland series and Voodoo Jams in the US, and smaller \\"jams\\" such as the Athens Jam and Hollywood Jams which take place in the US. These independent events and jams are what has helped keep flatland \\"alive\\" and thriving over the years. Flatland tricks Flatland tricks are given names, usually by the first person to invent it. For example, the first flatland \\"bunnyhop tailwhip\\" was first landed in a Burger King parking lot by Bill Nitschke, and there named a \\"whopper\\". Terry Adams invented a trick following Hurricane Katrina (since Terry lives in Louisiana), and named his new trick \\"The Katrina\\". The name may be modified (referencing whether it is rolled, scuffed, g-turned, stationary, etc.) or included in a list of other tricks, with \\"links\\" such as \\"bar-flip into\\" or \\"jump to\\", to indicate a combination, often shortened to \\"combo.\\" These names generally apply to popular positions, or combinations of tricks:  Tricks and Spins Endo: The original flatland trick. Done by either sharply applying the front brakes at low speed or running the front wheel into a curb causing the rear wheel to lift off of the ground above the front. An Alternate way to do this is by jamming either of your feet into the fork. Also used to gain momentum to lead into other tricks like the Decade or the Backside walkaround. *Miami Hopper: The rider stands on the pedals and grasps the seat tip in right hand, and the front brake lever in left hand. The rider quickly applies the front brake and simultaneously rotates the handlebars 90 degrees counterclockwise towards the seat and pulls up sharply on the seat. This will cause the rear of the bike to rise up and seemingly flip over the front. If landed correctly, the front wheel will lay parallel to the ground and the right handlebar grip will be balancing on the ground leaving the rider perched above the rear wheel. From this position, the rider can make various poses, kick the bike out to the side and lay it down, or lean back sharply and reverse the trick and ride away. Note: The hands and handlebar directions would be reversed if the bike was set up with the front brake lever on the right hand side. (Uncommon set up) *Cherry Picker: The rider places a foot on the rear tire behind the bottom bracket and swings their other leg over the head tube and rests the other foot on the seat tube. Then either using the handlebars for stability or clamping the legs tightly, the rider bounces up and down causing the entire bike to hop on the rear wheel. *Boomerang: The rider applies the front brakes and jumps from either the pedals or rear dropouts while tucking the legs into the chest and spins around with the handlebars 360 degrees. *note* Can be done without brakes, also known as a Rolling Boomerang. A variant of the Rolling Boomerang exists known as the Stick Man, with the rider leaving the legs straight out and to the side while locking the handlebars level with the hips. *Fork Glide: The rider stands on the front peg and spins 180 degrees. From here the rider can use their foot on the tire to move along. This trick is commonly used as a starting point to other tricks. *Steamroller: Forward Fork Glide on the front wheel holding the seat, usually rode into with a Half Lash. * Footjam Tailwhip: The rider uses the front brake to swing the frame 360 degrees around while keeping one foot on the front tire. *Fire Hydrant: The rider performs a basic Fork Glide and then swings the frame back round towards them. *G-Turn: Whipping the frame into a spinning Endo with feet on the pedals. *Decade: Lifting the front wheel up and jumping over the head tube and landing with the left foot on the top tube to ride out. *Rolaid: Rolling Decade. Brakeless. The Decade and Rolaid can be done in multiples. *Backside Walkaround: The rider lifts the front wheel up while standing on the rear axle pegs. Using the outside leg, the rider brings that leg in a crossing pattern in between the bike and riders' body. The rider then swings the leg around and over the head tube and places that foot on the seat tube. In a very precarious position, the rider then brings around the other leg from behind and over the head tube ending on the other side of the bike in an almost backwards position. *note* Can be done one-handed, with only the right hand on the grip and the other hand thrown out similar to a bull rider. *Whiplash: Rolling Tailwhip. Can be done without brakes. Can be done in multiples. *Cliffhanger: A rolling Endo with either foot on the front pegs and the torso behind the seat for a balance point. *Hang Five: Placing one foot on one of the front pegs and pulling the frame up until seat meets contact and a balance point is established; a rolling Endo. The foot not on the peg is used as a counterbalance. *Hang Ten: Similar to the Hang Five, but with both feet on the front pegs. *Hang Nothing: Similar to the Hang Five, but without either foot on the peg. Both feet are used as a counterbalance. *Elbow Glide: Placing one foot on one of the front pegs with one side of the body and the opposite elbow tucked with the seat to control the balance point. *Hitchhiker: Tilting the bike completely forward on the front wheel while rolling, standing both feet on the front pegs; holding the bike in front of you, by the underside of the backwheel or holding an axle peg. *Backpacker: Related to the Hitchhiker, but with the body positioned forward with the bike behind the body. *Cow maneuver or Smith Decade: Placing the frame up and tucking a rotation on the pegs backwards into the pedals first performed by Gerry Smith; this trick has many variants and can be performed without brakes (Chase Gouin). *Surfer: Placing one foot on the seat and the other foot on the handlebars' crossbar while rolling; popular in some videos and commercials. *Scurfer: Same as the Surfer, but with only one foot on the handlebars' crossbar. *Death Truck: Rolling a back Peg Wheelie and pulling the body over the handlebars; one of the most feared tricks in flatland not because of its difficulty, but because of the potential tangled bail. *Bar Ride: Standing up while both feet are on the grips of the bars or the crossbar and using only the torso and hands for a balance point while rolling. *Backwards Rubber Ride: Similar to a bar ride in execution, but with the rider standing on the handlebars facing the rear of the bike and rolling backwards. *Bar Hop: While standing up on the pedals, the rider jumps up and over the handlebar crossbar while tucking their knees into the chest. Upon landing your buttocks on the crossbar, one can scuff the front wheel and continue to roll or climb back over the handlebars. *Backyard: A scuffing trick performed by a foot push and control on the tires, while facing away from the frame on the back pegs. *Gerator (also \\"lardyard\\"): Similar to the backyard, but holding on to one handlegrip while scuffing and more off the side and back while scuffing in a circle. *Megaspin: Spinning on the back tire in a circular motion. *Front Yard: Front yards are one of the basis tricks for front wheel scuffing. They are pretty easy to learn, and then you can take them one handed and no-handed. Rolling very slowly, step over the bars with scuffing foot and rest it on the front tire. Your other leg/foot on the pedal. When ready, apply the brakes and put your foot firmly on the front tire getting ready to scuff. Move your other foot off the pedal and onto the front corresponding peg. The braking and moving your other foot need to happen at the same time while you push a little bit forward on the bars to get the backend to come a little off the ground.

At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period, the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\" unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. A typical great hall was a rectangular room between one and a half and three times as long as it was wide, and also higher than it was wide. It was entered through a screens passage at one end, and had windows on one of the long sides, often including a large bay window. There was often a minstrels' gallery above the screens passage. At the other end of the hall was the dais where the high table was situated. The lord's family's more private rooms lay beyond the dais end of the hall, and the kitchen, buttery and pantry were on the opposite side of the screens passage. Even royal and noble residences had few living rooms until late in the Middle Ages, and a great hall was a multifunctional room. It was used for receiving guests and it was the place where the household would dine together, including the lord of the house, his gentleman attendants and at least some of the servants. At night some members of the household might sleep on the floor of the great hall. Architectural detail Plan of Horham Hall, including a screens passage, leading from the entrance porch; a dais; a bay window. The main staircase is at the dais end, and the hall was the full height of the two-storey house The hall would originally have had a central hearth, with the smoke rising through the hall to a vent in the roof, examples can be seen at Stokesay Castle and Ludlow Castle.Michael Thompson, The Medieval Hall (Aldershot, 1995), pp. 101-3, 120. Later chimneys were added, and it would then have one of the largest fireplaces of the palace, manor house or castle, frequently large enough to walk and stand inside. The hearth was used for heating and also for some of the cooking, although for larger structures a medieval kitchen would customarily lie on a lower level for the bulk of the cooking. Commonly the fireplace would have an elaborate overmantel with stone or wood carvings or even plasterwork which might contain coats of arms, heraldic mottoes (usually in Latin), caryatids or another adornment. In the upper halls of French manor houses, the fireplaces were usually very large and elaborate. Typically, the great hall had the most beautiful decorations in it, as well as on the window frame mouldings on the outer wall. Many French manor houses have very beautifully decorated external window frames on the large mullioned windows that light the hall. This decoration clearly marked the window as belonging to the lord's private hall. It was where guests slept. The Great Hall at Stirling Castle built for James IV. The larger windows lit the high table In Scotland, six common furnishings were present in the sixteenth-century hall: the high table and principal seat; side tables for others; the cupboard and silver plate; the hanging chandelier, often called the 'hart-horn' made of antler; ornamental weapons, commonly a halberd; and the cloth and napery used for dining.Michael Pearce, 'Approaches to Household Inventories and Household Furnishing, 1500-1650', Architectural Heritage 26 (2015), p. 79 In western France, the early manor houses were centred on a central ground-floor hall. Later, the hall reserved for the lord and his high- ranking guests was moved up to the first-floor level. This was called the salle haute or upper hall (or \\"high room\\"). In some of the larger three-storey manor houses, the upper hall was as high as second storey roof. The smaller ground-floor hall or salle basse remained but was for receiving guests of any social order., Jones, Michael and Gwyn Meirion-Jones, Les Ch√¢teaux de Bretagne (Rennes: Editions Quest-France, 1991), pp. 40-41. It is very common to find these two halls superimposed, one on top of the other, in larger manor houses in Normandy and Brittany. Access from the ground-floor hall to the upper (great) hall was normally via an external staircase tower. The upper hall often contained the lord's bedroom and living quarters off one end. Occasionally the great hall would have an early listening device system, allowing conversations to be heard in the lord's bedroom above. In Scotland, these devices are called a laird's lug. In many French manor houses, there are small peep-holes from which the lord could observe what was happening in the hall. This type of hidden peep-hole is called a judas in French. Examples The mid-14th century Great Hall at Penshurst Place, looking towards the Screens Passage, pierced by two large rectangular doorways. Gothic arched doorways lead into service quarters, the Kitchen, Buttery and Pantry The classic mediaeval layout of three doorways to service rooms, at the Old Rectory, Warton. These doorways would originally have been hidden by the wooden screen of the screens passage. The central doorway leads to an outside kitchen. The other two doors are to the pantry and buttery Great Hall of Stirling Castle, Scotland, view towards the north showing screens passage, with minstrels' gallery above Many great halls survive. Two very large surviving royal halls are Westminster Hall and the Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle (although the latter was only used for public events, never used as a great hall here described). Penshurst Place in Kent, England has a little altered 14th century example. Surviving 16th and early 17th century specimens in England, Wales and Scotland are numerous, for example those at Eltham Palace (England), Longleat (England), Deene Park (England), Burghley House (England), Bodysgallen Hall (Wales), Darnaway Castle (Scotland), Muchalls Castle (Scotland) and Crathes Castle (Scotland). There are numerous ruined examples, most notably the roofless hall at Linlithgow Palace (Scotland). Survival The domestic and monastic model applied also to Collegiate institutions during the Middle Ages. Several colleges at Cambridge and Oxford universities have medieval halls which are still used as dining rooms on a daily basis. So do the Inns of Court and the Livery Companies in London. The \\"high table\\" (often on a small dais or stage at the top of the hall, farthest away from the screens passage) seats dons (at the universities) and Masters of the Bench (at the Inns of Court), whilst students (at the universities) and barristers or students (at the Inns of Court) dine at tables placed at right angles to the high table and running down the body of the hall, thus maintaining the hierarchical arrangement of the medieval domestic, monastic or collegiate household. Numerous more recently founded schools and institutions have halls and dining halls based on medieval great halls or monastic refectories. Decline By the late 16th century the great hall was beginning to lose its purpose.Michael Thompson, The Great Hall (Aldershot, 1995), pp. 182-192. Increasing centralization of power in royal hands meant that men of good social standing were less inclined to enter the service of a lord to obtain his protection, and so the size of the inner noble household shrank. As the social gap between master and servant grew, the family retreated, usually to the 1st floor, to private rooms. In fact, servants were not usually allowed to use the same staircases as nobles to access the great hall of larger castles in early times, and servants' staircases are still extant in places such as Muchalls Castle. Other reception and living rooms in country houses became more numerous, specialized and important, and by the late 17th century the halls of many new houses were simply vestibules, passed through to get to somewhere else, but not lived in. Several great halls like that at Bank Hall in Lancashire were downsized to create two rooms. Decline and revival From the 15th century onwards halls lost most of their traditional functions to more specialised rooms, first for family members and guests to the great chamber and parlours, withdrawing rooms, and later for servants who finally achieved their own servants hall to eat in and servants bedrooms in attics or basements).Michael Thompson, The Medieval Hall (Aldershot, 1995), p. 186. The halls of late 17th, 18th and 19th-century country houses and palaces usually functioned almost entirely as impressive entrance points to the house, and for large scale entertaining, as at Christmas, for dancing, or when a touring company of actors performed. With the arrival of ballrooms and dedicated music rooms in the largest houses by the late 17th century, these functions too were lost. There was a revival of the great hall concept in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with large halls used for banqueting and entertaining (but not as eating or sleeping places for servants) featuring in some houses of this period as part of a broader medieval revival, for example Thoresby Hall. In popular culture In the Harry Potter franchise of books, movies, and video games, the Great Hall within Hogwarts is the site of meals, feasts, assemblies, and awards ceremonies. https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the- story/the-great-hall * Winchester Castle's Great Hall is an important site in British history; it was the location of the trial of Walter Raleigh and partially of the Bloody Assizes and it also contains a well-preserved imitative Arthurian Round Table.

They are called TLV mirrors because symbols resembling the letters T, L, and V are engraved into them. They were produced from around the 2nd century BCE until the 2nd century CE. Development The first mirrors with TLV symbols appeared during the 2nd century BCE, with some believing that they were related to Liu An's astrological and cosmological interests.Bulling, (1960), 20. The dragon was an important symbol of these early TLV mirrors. In early mirrors from the 2nd century BCE, the dragons were often used as an arabesque, however by the 1st century BCE, the dragons lost their arabesque form and became full-fledged figures.Bulling, (1960), 22. In the later part of the Western Han period, the dragons were replaced by winged figures, monsters and immortals. These new mirrors also saw the division of the main area into two separate rings, with the TLV symbols being placed in the inner part of the main area, and other decorations being placed in the outer area.Bulling, (1960), 38. By the end of the 1st century BCE, the band dividing the main area into two concentric rings had largely lost its structural function of separating the mirror into two sections. Instead it existed merely as a line, or not at all.Bulling, (1960), 42. Mirrors from the Xin Dynasty (8‚Äì23 CE) usually have an outer band with cloud or animal motifs, and an inner circle with a square containing a knob. The inner circle often contains a series of eight 'nipples,' and various mythological animals and being, often including the Queen Mother of the West.Bulling, (1960), 52. The central square could have an inscription, or contain the characters of the Twelve Earthly Branches. Inscriptions placed in between the mirror's sections frequently discuss Wang Mang and his reign.Bulling, (1960), 51. Symbolism TLV mirror from the Han dynasty Scholars are engaged in a debate as to what the symbols on TLV mirrors mean. Some scholars believe that they represent ideas from Chinese cosmology, while others believe that they could also be used to play the boardgame of liubo. =Cosmological significance= TLV mirrors are circular. At their centers is a circular boss inset on a square panel. According to Schuyler Camman, the design of TLV mirrors was cosmologically significant. The V shapes served to give the inner square the appearance of being placed in the middle of a cross. This forms an illustration of the Chinese idea of the five directions ‚Äì North, South, West, East and Center. The central square represents China as the ‚ÄòMiddle Kingdom.‚Äô The area in between the central square and the circle represented the ‚ÄòFour Seas.‚Äô During the Han Dynasty the ‚ÄòFour Seas‚Äô represented territories outside China, and did not literally refer to water. The central square within the round mirror likely alludes to the ancient Chinese idea that heaven was round and earth was square. The Ts represented the concept of the ‚ÄòFour Gates of the Middle Kingdom,‚Äô an idea present in Chinese literature. They could have also represented the idea of the four inner gates of the Han place of sacrifice, or the gates of the imperial tombs built during the Han period. The Ls possibly symbolized the marshes and swamps beyond the ‚ÄòFour Seas,‚Äô at the ends of the earth. The bending of the Ls could possibly have served to create a rotating effect which symbolized the four seasons, which were very closely related to the cardinal directions. The nine nipples in the central square likely represented the ‚Äònine regions of the earth as discussed by Cammann as having come from the Shiji. The eight nipples outside of the central square were most likely a representations of the Eight Pillars, mountains that held up the canopy of heaven. The area between the inner round border and the outer rim of the mirror was often filled with swirls that represented the clouds in heaven. =The game of liubo= Some scholars believe that the design of TLV mirrors is derived from an ancient Chinese boardgame called liubo, which was played on a square board with the same markings as seen on this type of mirror.

It is situated close to the city of Thun, and connected to traffic through the A8 motorway and the BLS AG's Thun-Belp-Bern railway line. Due to its favourable geographic situation, it is home to several small to medium-sized industry companies, most notably the \\"Sarner Cristal\\" Glass Hut. History Uetendorf is first mentioned in 994 as udendorf. The number of scattered neolithic, Bronze Age and La T√®ne artifacts indicate that the area around Uetendorf was home to many prehistoric settlements. During the Roman era, in the 2nd century AD, there was a large country estate near the modern village. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the estate probably remained in operation and eventually became a royal estate under the Kings of Burgundy. In 994, Emperor Otto III donated many of his royal estates, including Uetendorf, to support the imperial Selz Abbey in Alsace. The estate and village apparently passed through several owners over the next centuries. In 1232 the Lords of Uetendorf appear in records as members of the city council of Bern. In 1370 they apparently sold Uetendorf to Johann Zeinigen of Thun. He and his descendants owned the village and lands until some time in the 15th century, when they were sold to the hospital in Thun. In 1521 the hospital combined Uetendorf, L√§ngenb√ºhl and Uttigen together into the municipality of Uetendorf in the district court of Seftigen where it remained for over two centuries. In 1783 it became a municipality in the Thun District where it remains today. The village of Uetendorf was part of the parish of Amsoldingen. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the entire parish converted. In 1578 it became part of the nearby parish of Thierachern, but remained without its own church until 1955. The village economy was based on raising crops and livestock in the flood plains and valley floors of the Gl√ºtschbach and Kander rivers. However, the frequent floods forced the villages to build and maintain an extensive network of levees and dikes. During the 1860s the Aare River correction projects finally reduced the flood risk and drained the swampy land around the rivers. The projects opened up additional farm land and reduced losses due to flooding. The completion of the G√ºrbetal railroad in 1902 connected the village with its neighbors and the growing city of Thun. The railroad brought industry and jobs to the municipality. In 1953 the Selve AG metal works opened in the village. The large factory brought other machinery and engineering companies into the municipality and fueled population growth. Completion of the A8 motorway in 1971 provided another connection for the growing population. Along with small businesses and factories, a waste water treatment plant was built. Today the plant treats water for 32 neighboring communities. When the factory closed in 1993, the local economy was diversified enough that the population remained steady. In 2005 about 70% of the working population commuted to jobs outside the municipality, however about 48% of the jobs in Uetendorf were filled by workers who commuted into the municipality. The Eichberg estate, which was built in 1792-93 for Carolus von Fischer, became a boarding school in 1932. The boarding school remained open until 1984. The Uetendorfberg Switzerland Foundation opened a school and residence for the deaf in 1921. Uetendorf had its own primary school and shared a secondary school with Thierachern. However the secondary school district dissolved in 1959, forcing the municipality to build their own school in that year. Geography Uetendorf has an area of .

Plot The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, and Ching begins to fear for her life when Ling starts making threats to remove her kidney too. One night, Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man that seems to be an ally of Ling's. Here, Ching reveals that her kidney is weak, and the man will not be able to sell it for much. She passes out, and wakes to find Ling injured beside her. Ching takes her to the hospital, and it isn't long before Ching finds out that Ling is actually a kind person, more true then the friendships Ching shares with her superficial socialite friends. She learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity she does not reveal. Ching and Ling then make a deal with the mysterious man so that Ching can get a kidney. However Ching informs the police beforehand, and when they arrive, the man holds Ling hostage. However, Ling supposedly kills the man. Wai begins to suspect Ling, and breaks into her house. Meanwhile, Ching invites Ling to her house where she learns that the man who was killed was none other than Ling's childhood sweetheart. Ling tells her that since she was in need of money for her mother, she and the man planned to make a living selling kidneys. However, because of Ching's 'betrayal', the man killed himself. Ling then discovers that Wai has been searching her house. She holds Wai hostage and asks Ching to come to her workplace, a research center, and give her kidney. Ching, armed with an axe chases Ling, her anger intensifying when she learns that Wai is dead. But Ling suffocates her with plastic. In the end, Ching wakes up in hospital, where a doctor tells her that she was in critical condition, but saved by a kidney that belonged to the dead at the scene where she was found. She realizes that Ling hacked herself to death to give her the kidney she always wanted. Unable to digest this information, she starts screaming, begging the doctor to remove her kidney, as the camera cuts to a shot of Ching telling Ling they will always be together, and another of Ling lying dead with her voiceover saying, \\"You'll owe me this forever.\\" There is a final shot of Ching, under the effect of sedatives, falling unconscious.

It emerged in the 1970s and early 1980s. The doctrine of the movement emphasized the \\"one another\\" passages of the New Testament, and the mentoring relationship described in the Second Epistle to Timothy.  Early history and model  A charismatic Bible study that met weekly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the \\"Fort Lauderdale Five\\" evolved into The Holy Spirit Teaching Mission. This interdenominational group was incorporated in 1966 and expanded its scope with teaching conferences in Florida, later sponsoring conferences in other states. In 1969, it launched a magazine, New Wine, and, in 1972, changed its name to Christian Growth Ministries (CGM). The Shepherding movement arose out of a concern for the weak commitment, shallow community, and the general worldliness characteristic of many American churches. But their solution was extra-biblical requirements - membership in a house-group which included having life-decisions ‚Äúcovered‚Äù by the house-group leader, elder, or pastor. Such decisions included things like where to live and work, whom to marry, or whether to see a doctor when someone was ill. Jonathan Leeman, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be a 9Marxist,‚Äù 9Marks Journal, 2016, 88. At the zenith of the movement, \\"They had a national network of followers who formed pyramids of sheep and shepherds. Down through the pyramid went the orders, it was alleged, while up the same pyramid went the tithes.\\"H.D. Hunter, \\"Shepherding Movement,\\" Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, p. 784, Zondervan The relationships that were formed became known theologically as \\"covenant relationships.\\" A network of cell groups were formed. Members had to be submitted to a \\"shepherd\\", who in turn was submitted to the Five or their subordinates. \\"...large numbers of charismatic pastors began to be shepherded by the CGM leaders, a development that went uncharted but not unnoticed. It was uncharted because these relationships were personal and not institutional, so there were never any published lists of pastors and congregations being shepherded by CGM leaders....\\"P.D. Hocken, \\"Charismatic Movement,\\" Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, p. 137, Zondervan. Other movements influenced by the Shepherding doctrine were the Shiloh houses scattered across the USA (some of them transitioned into Calvary Chapels when they abandoned the shepherding movement ideas), International Churches of Christ, Maranatha Campus Ministries, the Jesus People USA (in or around 1991 were adopted by the Evangelical Covenant Church), and Great Commission International (today known as Great Commission Ministries/Great Commission Association of Churches).  Pat Robertson's opposition  The Shepherding movement became controversial: :\\"The heat of the controversy can be captured by reading an open letter, dated June 27, 1975, from Pat Robertson to Bob Mumford. Robertson said that in a recent visit to Louisville, Kentucky, he found cultish language like \\"submission\\" rather than churches, \\"shepherds\\" not pastors, and \\"relationships\\" but not Jesus. Robertson traveled to Oral Roberts University and found a twenty-year-old \\"shepherd\\" who drew tithes from fellow students as part of their submission. Robertson, drawing from Juan Carlos Ortiz's \\"Call to Discipleship\\", charged the leaders with placing personal revelations (rhema) on par with Scripture. He quoted a devotee as saying, \\"If God Almighty spoke to me, and I knew for a certainty that it was God speaking, and if my shepherd told me to do the opposite, I would obey my shepherd.\\" Figures within the charismatic movement (such as Pat Robertson) denounced the Shepherding movement: :\\"Pat Robertson banned the CGM leaders and erased all tapes that included them. Robertson used Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) to pronounce the shepherding teaching 'witchcraft' and said the only difference between the discipleship group and Jonestown was 'Kool-Aid.' Kathryn Kuhlman refused to appear together with Bob Mumford at the 1975 Conference on the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem. Demos Shakarian the founder and director of FGBMFI declared the CGM leaders persona non grata. The number of voices swelled as criticism came from Dennis Bennett, Ken Sumrall, Thomas F. Zimmerman (General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God), and David duPlessis.\\"  Dispersal  The Fort Lauderdale Five eventually parted company. Derek Prince and Bob Mumford both publicly distanced themselves from the teachings. Derek Prince withdrew in 1983, stating his belief that \\"we were guilty of the Galatian error: having begun in the Spirit, we quickly degenerated into the flesh.\\" Bob Mumford issued a \\"Formal Repentance Statement to the Body of Christ\\" in November 1989 and was quoted as saying, \\"I repent. I ask forgiveness.\\"\\"Mumford Repents of Discipleship Errors,\\" Charisma & Christian Life, pp. 15,16, February, 1990, Strang Communications, Inc In the same article, Mumford also acknowledged abuses that had occurred because of his teaching on submission: > \\"Mumford decided that he needed to publicly 'repent' of his responsibility > in setting up a system where so many people were hurt by misuses of > authority. 'Some families were split up and lives turned upside down,' says > Mumford. 'Some of these families are still not back together.'\\" This emphasis resulted in \\"perverse and unbiblical obedience\\" to leaders, Mumford said. > \\"In his statement, Mumford admitted that he had not heeded earlier warnings > about doctrinal error from Hayford and two others. \\"While it was not my > intent to be willful,\\" he said, \\"I ignored their input to my own hurt and > the injury of others.\\" ...He admitted that there had been an \\"unhealthy > submission resulting in perverse and unbiblical obedience to human leaders.\\" > He took personal responsibility for these abuses, saying that many of them > happened under his sphere of leadership.\\" Steven Lambert, Charismatic > Captivation, p. 38 Australian controversy The Shepherding movement within Australia was represented by the Logos Foundation under the leadership of Howard Carter. It came to a sudden end when Carter was found to be immoral, although it did persist beyond the peak of the North American movement. Relocating from the Blue Mountains of NSW in 1987, its headquarters were in the Queensland city of Toowoomba, providing a conservative and sympathetic demographic. During this period Carter was living an extravagant lifestyle which frequently involved first class air travel to North American and other international locations, five-star hotels and many other luxuries. Carter drove a Mercedes Benz and lived in a large mansion with magnificent views from the Toowoomba escarpment.Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990 The Logos Foundation owned and operated with Australian staff, a Bible College and motel in Canada. The financial affairs of the Logos Foundation were shrouded in secrecy from most followers with little or no true accountability regarding the vast sums of money that were now involved.Courier-Mail Newspaper, 9 August 1990Harrison, John. \\"The Logos Foundation: The rise and fall of Christian Reconstructionism in Australia\\", p.11 Carter is arguably most infamous for the Logos Foundation's political campaign in the 1989 Queensland State election where he pushed the position that adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine was a more important consideration than opposition to the widespread corruption in the conservative Queensland government that had been exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. The campaign was anti-homosexual and at times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law.Harrison, John. \\"The Logos Foundation: The rise and fall of Christian Reconstructionism in Australia\\", p.3\\"Sex Scandal - Bible Belt\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, p.74 The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when they published, \\"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\\"Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990 The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \\"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\\". These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals, who stated \\"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\\".Lyons, J., God Remains an Issue in Queensland, Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989 At the peak of his power towards the end of this period, Carter was virtually unquestioned in authority.Harrison, John. \\"The Logos Foundation: The rise and fall of Christian Reconstructionism in Australia\\" The Sydney Morning Herald published an article in October 1990 which quoted several disillusioned followers, including the statement, \\"...we felt we had lost control over our lives. It was all dictated to us from above and that was very oppressive. Everything centered around Howard Carter; he had all the power\\".Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990 Logos Foundation ceased to operate from the early 1990s. Today The degree to which the Shepherding movement still exists today is unclear. While both Charles Simpson and Bob Mumford have made public statements disavowing the movement, or at least distancing themselves from it, Simpson's biography on the website of Charles Simpson Ministries highlights his co-founding of New Wine Magazine and specifically mentions Baxter, Mumford, and Prince as \\"notable Bible teachers\\" associated with the magazine. The website also lists Derek Prince Ministries and Lifechangers by Bob Mumford as \\"ministry allies.\\" David Moore's 2004 book on the Shepherding Movement includes interviews with many relevant individuals. The Shepherding movement ideologies live on today in some groups, most notably the Korean group called University Bible Fellowship, which is currently active on over 70 US college campuses.http://www.cisneoinc.org/articles/shepherding.htm CISNEO References Additional sources Moore, S.D.: \\"Shepherding Movement\\" in Stanley M.

In other words, a high functional load will make it hard to guess a phoneme that is not known because of noise or omission. Overview The term \\"functional load\\" goes back to the days of the Prague School; references to it can be found in the work of Vil√©m Mathesius in 1929. Its most vocal advocate was Andr√© Martinet, a historical linguist who claimed it was a factor in the likelihood of a phonological merger. √âconomie des changements phon√©tiques: Trait√© de phonologie diachronique. Par ANDR√â MARTINET. (Bibliotheca romanica, Series prima: Manualia et cornrnentationes, No. 10.) Pp. 396. Berne: editions A. Francke S. A., 1955 The first suggested measurement for functional load was the number of minimal pairs, but that does not take into account word frequency and is difficult to generalize beyond binary phonemic oppositions. Charles Hockett proposed an information theoretic definition in 1955 ,A manual of phonology. By CHARLES F. HOCKETT(International journal of American linguistics, Vol. 21, No. 4, Part 1 October 1955 = Indiana University publications in anthropology and linguistics, Memoir 11 of IJAL.) Pp. v, 246. Baltimore: Waverly Press (for Indiana University, under the auspices of [the] Linguistic Society of America [and the] American Anthropological Association), 1955. which has since been generalized.Surendran and Niyogi, Quantifying the functional load of phonemic oppositions, distinctive features, and suprasegmentals, chapter in Current trends in the theory of linguistic change. In commemoration of Eugenio Coseriu (1921-2002), Ole Nedergaard Thomsen (editor), Amsterdam & Philadelphia: Benjamins. Now, with a large text corpus, one can compute the functional load of any phonological contrast including distinctive features, suprasegmentals, and distinctions between groups of phonemes. For instance, the functional load of tones in Standard Chinese is as high as that of vowels: the information lost when all tones sound alike is as much as that lost when all vowels sound alike.Surendran and Levow, The functional load of tone in Mandarin is as high as that of vowels, Proceedings of Speech Prosody 2004, Nara, Japan, pp. 99-102. Martinet predicted that perceptually similar pairs of phonemes with low functional load would merge. This has not been proved empirically; indeed, all empirical tests have come out against it; for example, merged with in Cantonese in word-initial position in the late 20th century although of all the consonants in binary opposition to , only the opposition had a higher functional load than the opposition. Examples =English= English vowels, for example, have a very high functional load. There are innumerable sets of words distinguished just by their vowels, such as pin, pen, pan, pun, pain, pine. Voicing is similar, as can be seen in pat - bad, few - view. Speakers who do not control these differences make it very difficult for others to understand them. However, although voicing is generally important in English, the voicing difference between the two fricatives written ‚ü®th‚ü©, , has a very low functional load: it is difficult to find meaningful distinctions dependent solely on this difference. One of the few examples is thigh vs. thy although the two can be distinguished from context alone. Similar is the difference of (written ‚ü®j‚ü©, ‚ü®ge‚ü©, etc.) versus (resulting from , or the ‚ü®j‚ü©, ‚ü®ge‚ü©, etc. in some recent French loanwords), as in virgin vs. version. The difference between the two ‚ü®ng‚ü© sounds, , found in singer and finger, is so unimportant that it makes no practical difference if confuses them, and some dialects pronounce the sounds the same in both words. The functional load is nearly zero, which is unsurprising since the phoneme originated as a coalescence of when it was word-final. An ongoing example would be the merger of the AIR and EAR vowels in New Zealand English. The phonetic similarity between words like here and hare does not seem to hamper oral communication greatly if context is provided. Therefore, those vowels have low functional load in New Zealand English despite their high frequency of occurrences in that dialect. The distinction is fully maintained in nearby Australian English, where many find comedy and confusion in mergers such as sheep-sharing vs. sheep-shearing and bare-chested vs. bear-chested. =Mandarin= Another example is the functional load of tone in Mandarin Chinese, which is nearly as high as that of their vowels. That means that the loss of information when all tones sound alike in Mandarin is approximately equal to that when all vowels sound alike. By contrast, in many Bantu languages, the tones have a low functional load, and in Swahili, tones have disappeared altogether.

Enric Miralles, who died in the year 2000 is buried in one of the tombs.Strum p.13.2 Architectural concept Miralles and Pin√≥s were concerned, not just to design a cemetery, but to explore poetic ideas regarding the acceptance of the cycle of life to enable a link between the past, the present, and the future.Zabalbeascoa The project is conceived, in part, as an earthwork that transforms the surrounding landscape and also, in part, as a metaphor for the river of life.

The spaces are designed to provoke thoughts and memories.

His work is \\"more than simply interpreting the programme [brief] or observing a site's geographical landscape, however attentively, his architecture explores pre-existing traces in the cultural landscape of each project.\\" The cemetery can thus be considered as architecture of the land that involves a humanisation of the brief and appreciation of the topography - that is, the visible, physical land as well as the memories contained within it. This is seen by Zabalbeascoa in contrast to the particular form of critical regionalism which prevailed in the Spanish architectural scene of the 1970s which had tended towards a more sentimental or scenographic type of architecture.Zabalbeascoa p.9 \\"What sort of cultural landscape is it, in other words, that takes up sides with nature against the monumentalist enterprise of culture, especially when it was to offer visitors an intimation of immortality? ......[it is] one that redefines the terms, such that nature is no longer understood as the unproblematic opposite of culture, death no longer the mere antithesis of life.\\"Robinson, Joel D (2005) Cultural landscapes in the 21st century paper presented to UNSECO 700px Notes References * External links *Architecture of time - Enric Miralles *Book synopsis *Powerpoint analysis * Cemeteries in Catalonia Buildings and structures completed in 1994 Enric Miralles buildings Igualada ","title":"Igualada Cemetery"},{"id":"1848891","text":"quilled basket of flowers Paper craft is a collection of crafts using paper or card as the primary artistic medium for the creation of one, two or three- dimensional objects. Paper and card stock lend themselves to a wide range of techniques and can be folded, curved, bent, cut, glued, molded, stitched, or layered. Papermaking by hand is also an important paper craft. Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people. In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the education of children. Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy, \\"Paper crafts\\", (2006), p. 221-34.

S., 1990, \\"Sauropoda\\" in The Dinosauria, Edited by David B. Weishampel, Peter Dodson, and Halszka Osm√≥lska. University of California Press, pp. 345‚Äì401.Upchurch, P., Barrett, P.M. and Dodson, P. 2004. Sauropoda. In The Dinosauria, 2nd edition. D. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H. Osm√≥lska (eds.). University of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 259‚Äì322. Only three species are known:Re: Family Nemegtosauridae Nemegtosaurus, Quaesitosaurus and Tapuiasaurus, each from the Cretaceous. History of classification Due to the diplodocid-like nature of the taxa placed in Nemegtosauridae, the systematic position of this family in Sauropoda was disputed until recently. McIntosh (1990) included both these animals in the family Diplodocidae, subfamily Dicraeosaurinae, as they resemble the skull of Dicraeosaurus, although differing in certain details. Although the skull of Nemegtosaurus was found in the same formation as the headless skeleton of Opisthocoelicaudia, McIntosh (1990) kept Nemegtosaurus in Diplodocoidea while keeping Opisthocoelicauda separate from the former, a position reiterated by Upchurch (1995, 1999), and Upchurch et al. (2004). A cladistic analysis published in 2002 transferred Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicauda from Diplodocoidea to Titanosauria. Apesteguia (2004), in a paper describing a new Patagonian sauropod, Bonitasaura salgadoi, may have been the first to properly define the taxon, although without the use of cladistic analysis: the stemclade consisting of all titanosaurs more closely related to Nemegtosaurus than to Saltasaurus. He argued for a close relationship between Nemegtosaurus, Quaesitosaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Bonitasaura and referred to the previous phylogenetic analysis and use of Nemegtosauridae by Wilson (2002). In his redescription of the Nemegtosaurus holotype, Wilson (2005) elaborated on the titanosaurian nature of Nemegtosaurus, defining Nemegtosauridae as a stem- based clade that includes all titanosaurs more closely related to Nemegtosaurus than to Saltasaurus. He also suggested that Opisthocoelicaudia may eventually be shown to be a junior synonym of Nemegtosaurus. For her part, Kristina Curry Rogers (see also Cuury Rogers and Forster [2001]) agreed with Wilson that both Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus were titanosaurs rather than diplodocoids, but rejected the validity of Nemegtosauridae and the clade concepts given under that name. Quaesitosaurus was placed in the Saltasaurinae and Nemegtosaurus in a new, unnamed \\"Rapetosaurus clade\\" (which, under ICZN rules, would, if named, be termed subfamily Nemegtosaurinae or tribe Nemegtosaurini, depending on its position). Opisthocoelicaudia was placed in a separate clade, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. All three clades are included in the Saltasauridae (= Titanosauridae). In a paper discussing new anatomical data on the skull of Tapuiasaurus, Wilson and his colleagues cast doubt on the monophyly of Nemegtosauridae, judging from a rescoring of the Zaher et al. 2011 cladistic analysis regarding cranial characters. Tapuiasaurus was recovered as basal to Lithostrotia, rendering its position within Nemegtosauridae questionable. A 2014 cladistic analysis gleaning new anatomical data from Diamantinasaurus also rendered Nemegtosauridae paraphyletic, with Rapetosaurus falling out as a member of Saltasauridae closer to Isisaurus than to Nemegtosaurus. The cladistic analysis of Patagotitan recovered Tapuiasaurus as the sister taxon of Rapetosaurus and Isisaurus but not Nemegtosaurus.

Although somewhat related to Spider, the method of game play is akin to Yukon. The object of this game is to form four columns of suit sequence cards from king down to ace. Gameplay A legal move in Scorpion: any face up card is available for play (as indicated by the darkened card) and is moved along with the cards on top of it. The game starts with 49 cards dealt into seven columns of seven cards each on the tableau. The first four columns each have three face-down cards with four face-up cards placed over them. The cards in the remaining three columns are all faced up. The three leftover cards are set aside for later. Cards in the tableau are built down by suit and every face up card is available for play, no matter where in the column it is. That means that any card can be placed on top of a card that is a rank higher. Once a card from the bottom or middle of a column is moved, all cards on top of it are moved as well, as one unit. Nothing can be placed on an ace and gaps on the tableau can only be taken by kings or sequences with Kings as their top cards. Once a face-down card is exposed, it is turned face up. When no more moves are possible, the three leftover cards are dealt onto the first three columns and put into play. As earlier mentioned, the object of the game is to build four columns of suit sequences from king down to ace. So when one such column is built successfully, it is a general rule to leave this column alone, unless it covers a face-down card. The game is won when the object is fulfilled. Variants Scorpion II is an alternate version of the game in which the number of columns containing three face-down cards and the number of columns in which all cards are faced up are the reverse of the prevalent version, i.e. the first three columns each have three face-down cards with four face-up cards placed over them while the cards in the remaining four columns are all faced up. Despite the reversal, the game remains the same but making it easier than regular \\"Scorpion\\". Wasp is almost identical to Scorpion, except that when a space is formed in the tableau, any card or sequence can be placed in it. This gives the player more chances of winning than in Scorpion. Three Blind Mice is another Scorpion variation with a starting tableau of 10 columns of five cards.\\"Three Blind Mice\\" (p.247-248) in The Complete Book of Card Games by Peter Arnold, Hamlyn Publishing, 2010. The three rightmost columns should each have three bottom cards faced down and two top cards face up. The three cards in each of those columns gave the game its name after the nursery rhyme. The five cards in each of the rest of the columns are all face up. The two leftover cards are set aside face up to be used any time in the game whenever necessary. Game play is the same as in Scorpion. Curds and Whey is another spider type game in the style of Scorpion, and was created by David Parlett.Parlett, David (2020).

Other local names for them used in Latin America include barbeiros, vinchucas, pitos, chipos and chinches. Most of the 130 or more species of this subfamily feed on vertebrate blood; a very few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found and widespread in the Americas, with a few species present in Asia, Africa, and Australia. These bugs usually share shelter with nesting vertebrates, from which they suck blood. In areas where Chagas disease occurs (from the southern United States to northern Argentina), all triatomine species are potential vectors of the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, but only those species (such as Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus) that are well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors. Proteins released from their bites have been known to induce anaphylaxis in sensitive and sensitized individuals. History At the beginning of the 19th century, Charles Darwin made one of the first reports of the existence of triatomines in America in his Journal and Remarks, published in 1839 and commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle. The following is an extract which he based on his journal entry dated 26 March 1835: Considerable medical speculation has occurred as to whether or not Darwin's contact with triatomines in Argentina was related to his later bouts of long-term illness, though it is unlikely to have been caused on this specific occasion, as he made no mention of the fever that usually follows the first infection. =Discovery of triatominae's relation with Chagas disease= In 1909, Brazilian doctor Carlos Chagas discovered that these insects were responsible for the transmission of T. cruzi to many of his patients in Lassance, a village located on the banks of the S√£o Francisco River in Minas Gerais (Brazil). Poor people living there complained of some insects they called barbeiros that bite during the night. Carlos Chagas put his first observations in words: Another Brazilian, Herman Lent, former student of Carlos Chagas, became devoted to the research of the triatomines and together with Peter Wygodzinsky made a revision of the Triatominae, a summary of 40 years of studies on the triatomines up to 1989. Biological aspects Rhodnius prolixus nymphs and adult =Lifecycle= Triatomines undergo incomplete metamorphosis. A wingless first-instar nymph hatches from an egg, and may be small as 2 mm. It passes successively through second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Finally, the fifth instar turns into an adult, acquiring two pairs of wings. =Ecology= All triatomine nymph instars and adults are haematophagous and require the stability of a sheltered environment, where they aggregate. Most species are associated with wild, nesting vertebrates and are named \\"sylvatic\\" triatomines. These live in ground burrows with rodents or armadillos, or in tree dwellings with bats, birds, sloths, or opossums. Few species (5%) live in human dwellings or in the surroundings of human houses (peridomicile) in the shelters of domestic animals, these are named \\"domestic\\" species. Many sylvatic species are in process of domiciliation (i.e. \\"semidomestic\\"). =Behavior= Most triatomines aggregate in refuges during day and search for blood during night, when the host is asleep and the air is cooler. Odors and heat guide these insects to their hosts. Carbon dioxide emanating from breath, as well as ammonia, short-chain amines, and carboxylic acids from skin, hair, and exocrine glands from vertebrate animals, are among the volatiles that attract triatomines. Vision also serves triatomines for orientation. At night, adults of diverse species fly to houses attracted by light. Adults produce a pungent odor (isobutyric acid) when disturbed, and are also capable of producing a particular sound by rubbing the rostrum over a stridulatory sulcus under its head (stridulation). = Epidemiology = Domestic and sylvatic species can carry the Chagas parasite to humans and wild mammals; birds are immune to the parasite. T. cruzi transmission is carried mainly from human to human by domestic kissing bugs; from the vertebrate to the bug by blood, and from the bug to the vertebrate by the insect's feces, and not by its saliva as occurs in most bloodsucking arthropod vectors such as malaria mosquitoes. Triatomine infestation especially affects older dwellings. One can recognize the presence of triatomines in a house by its feces, exuviae, eggs, and adults. Triatomines characteristically leave two kinds of feces like strikes on walls of infected houses; one is white with uric acid, and the other is dark (black) containing heme. Whitish or pinkish eggs can be seen in wall crevices. After having had a blood meal, the insects sometimes show a limited mobility and can be identified easily.  Controlling triatomine infestations =Insecticide treatment= Synthetic pyrethroids are the main class of insecticides used to control triatominae infestations. Insecticide treatment is more effective on nonporous surfaces, such as hardwood timber, fired bricks, and plastered walls, than on porous surfaces such as mud. A single treatment with insecticide typically protects against triatomine infestation for a year or more on timber walls vs. 2‚Äì3 months on adobe walls. Wettable powders, suspension concentrates, and insecticide paints can improve treatment effectiveness on porous surfaces. Rates of insecticide resistance among triatomines are fairly low due to their long lifecycle and low genetic variability, but some instances of resistance have been reported, particularly among Triatoma infestans populations in Bolivia and Argentina.  Tribes, genera, and numbers of described species  The monophyletic nature of the Triatominae subfamily is strongly supported by molecular data, indicating that their blood-sucking character has occurred only once within the Reduviidae. Alt URL The classification within the subfamily is not stable, with different proposed relationships among the tribes and genera.

It is a resin plastic reinforced with fibers (either cotton or wool) making it a fiber-reinforced plastic similar to fiberglass. Uses Duroplast was used by the German Democratic Republic state-owned automobile manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau from 1955 until just after German Reunification in 1991. It was the material used to produce the outer body of the Trabant. There were four main versions of the Trabant; the 1964‚Äì1990 Trabant 601 was the longest running. The successor company is called HQM Sachsenring GmbH. The product was first used in the body of the IFA F8 and later also the AWZ P70 or Zwickau P70 and the Trabant. It was also used to make suitcases. Duroplast is light and strong. It is made of recycled material, cotton waste and phenol resins. Because it can be made in a press similar to shaping steel, it is more suitable for volume car production than fiberglass. Disposal Similar to fiberglass, Duroplast has limited possibilities for efficient disposal. As discarded Trabants began to fill junkyards, creative solutions sprung up for disposing of them. One of these was developed by a Berlin biotechnology company, which experimented with a bacterium to consume the body in twenty days. Urban legends, depicted in the movie Black Cat, White Cat and described in a song by the Serbian band Atheist Rap, described recycling Duroplast by feeding the cars to pigs, sheep and other farm animals. In the late 1990s, the same Trabant factory in Zwickau developed a solution for disposing of the Duroplast shells by shredding them and using them as an aggregate in cement blocks for pavement construction. This was featured in an episode of the program Scientific American Frontiers on the American PBS TV channel. Public perception The use of Duroplast in Trabants and subsequent GDR jokes and mockery in western auto magazines such as Car and Driver gave rise to an urban myth that the Trabant is made of corrugated cardboard.Tony Davis (2005) \\"Lemon!: Sixty Heroic Automotive Failures\\", , Chapter \\"Trabant P601, p.156-158 References Composite materials German inventions Plastics ","title":"Duroplast"},{"id":"1848933","text":"brickOS (previously legOS, developed by Markus Noga) is an alternative operating system for the Lego Mindstorms RCX Controller.

This passage moves between the main modes of playing (A,B,C). The A section is the basic lock or ride, as it is known in North America. It spans one clave (measure). An alternate phrase (B) is also one measure in length. Cross-beats, the basis of the third section (C), contradict the meter. By alternating between the lock and the cross, the quinto creates larger rhythmic phrases that expand and contract over several clave cycles. The great Los Mu√±equintos quintero Jes√∫s Alfonso (1949‚Äì2009) described this phenomenon as a man getting \\"drunk at a party, going outside for a while, and then coming back inside.\\"Pe√±alosa, David (2011: 86). Alfonso quoted by Pe√±alosa. Rumba Quinto. Redway, CA: Bembe Books. Song The term guaguanc√≥ originally referred to a narrative song style (coros de guaguanc√≥) which emerged from the coros de claves of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rogelio Mart√≠nez Fur√© states: \\"[The] old folks contend that strictly speaking, the guaguanc√≥ is the narrative.\\"Mart√≠nez Fur√©, Rogelio (1963) Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional de Cuba. Catalogue. The guaguanc√≥ song often begins with the soloist singing meaningless syllables, which is called the diana. According to Larry Crook, the diana is important because it \\"... also contains the first choral refrain. The lead singer provides a phrase or motive for the choral sections, or they may present new, but related material. Parallel harmonies are usually built above or below a melodic line, with thirds, sixths, and octaves most common.\\" Crook, Larry (1982: 92).\\"A Musical Analysis of the Cuban Rumba\\" Latin American Music Review. 3.1 Therefore, the singer who is presented with singing the diana initiates the beginning of the guaguanc√≥. He then may proceed to improvise lyrics stating the reason for holding the present rumba ('decimar'; span.: to make ten-line stanzas), During the verses of the song the quinto is capable of sublime creativity, while musically subordinate to the lead vocalist. There are natural pauses in the cadence of the verses, typically one or two measures in length, where the quinto can play succinct phrases in the \\"holes\\" left by the singer. Once the chorus (or montuno section) of the song begins, the phrases of the quinto interact with the dancers more than the lead singer.

An interim government headed by Commodore Frank Bainimarama was set up, and handed power over to an interim administration headed by Ratu Josefa Iloilo, as President, on 13 July.  The overthrow of the Chaudhry government  Parliamentary elections in May 1999, had resulted in a decisive victory for the People's Coalition, a multiracial grouping that was dominated by the predominantly Labour Party but which also included three other parties supported. Mahendra Chaudhry had become the country's first Prime Minister of Indian descent. The election result and Chaudhry's subsequent appointment as Prime Minister angered hardline i-Taukei nationalists. His government's hints at land reform caused further alarm. When a group led by George Speight, a businessman who had been declared bankrupt following the cancellation of several contracts by the Chaudhry government, entered Parliament buildings on 19 May 2000, disaffected elements of the i-Taukei population rallied to his side. For 56 days, Prime Minister Chaudhry and most of his cabinet, along with many Parliamentarians and their staff, were held as hostages while Speight attempted to negotiate with the President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who denounced the coup and declared a state of emergency, and with the military administration which took office on 29 May. On 26 May, fifteen soldiers and two officers defected to the rebels, and, the following day, gunfire was exchanged. In a move that constitutional experts have described as of questionable constitutionality, Mara dismissed the government from office (for being \\"unable to act\\") prorogued Parliament for six months, and assumed executive authority himself. In doing so, he claimed to be following the advice of the Chief Justice, Sir Timoci Tuivaga, but he refused to abrogate the constitution, which Tuivaga had also advised. Mara admitted that his actions were at the very edge of constitutionality but said he believed they were within that boundary and necessary.  Alleged motives for the coup  Speight's claims to be a Fijian nationalist and a champion of indigenous rights attracted support from certain elements of the Fijian population who were angered by the results of the 1999 election, which had swept away a government dominated by ethnic Fijians and brought to power a multiracial government led by Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Fiji's first-ever Indo-Fijian Prime Minister. Hints that the Chaudhry government might institute some form of land reform also generated considerable resentment among sections of the indigenous population, despite Constitutional guarantees of ethnic Fijian land ownership. Speight thus found sizeable number of sympathizers when he launched his putsch on 19 May. Speight proceeded to appoint a \\"Cabinet\\". He initially named himself President, before appointing Ratu Jope Seniloli to the post two days later. Ratu Timoci Silatolu was appointed Prime Minister, downgraded to Deputy Prime Minister two days later, when Speight himself was named to the post by Seniloli. Other appointments included Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu as Minister for Fijian Affairs, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure as Minister for Home Affairs, and Simione Kaitani, Isireli Leweniqila, Levani Tonitonivanua, Berenado Vunibobo, Ratu Tu'uakitau Cokanauto and Ratu Inoke Kubuabola as Ministers without portfolio. Some, including Seniloli, Lalabalavu, and Vakalalabure were later convicted of coup-related offences, but whether all of the others had consented to their ministerial \\"appointments\\" as announced by Speight is not known. Claims have been made that Fijian nationalism may have been nothing more than a political ploy to attract supporters to what was, in reality, a personal grab for money and power on the part of Speight and his co-conspirators. During the 1990s, Speight had built up a modestly successful marketing business, but many contracts were lost after the Chaudhry government came to power in 1999. Charging corruption, Chaudhry revoked the contracts of two marketing firms chaired by Speight that were involved in the country's lucrative timber trade. By the time of the coup he was allegedly bankrupt. Several of his accomplices were undischarged bankrupts as well. Conspiracy theories hold that the real motive for the coup was to loot the treasury. Ratu Isireli Vuibau, the deposed Assistant Minister for Fijian Affairs, declared on 31 August 2000, after the rebellion was over, that many of those involved with Speight had links to the Timber Resource Group, comprising Fijian politicians who were investors in Speight's Timber Resource Management Limited company, which had interests in pine, mahogany, and hardwood. He said these politicians had joined Speight against the government when their proposals were rejected. \\"Indigenous Fijians were used but little did they know that the coup was for a little group here and abroad,\\" Ratu Vuibau said. Mahendra Chaudhry has supported the view that ethnic nationalism was only a mask to gain the support of nationalist Fijians, and that the true purpose was to loot the treasury. He alleged in court papers and on his party's website that some of those who helped to finance and support certain aspects of the coup, such as the mutiny that took place at the Sukunaivalu Barracks in Labasa on 7 July 2000, were, in fact, Indo-Fijians. Another view sees the rebellion as one supported by a very disparate group of individuals, all for diverse reasons for their own. It was also alleged that the coup was supported by the Methodist church.  The resignation of President Mara  Two days later, on 29 May 2000, Mara resigned under disputed circumstances. Following orchestrated threats to his life and his family, he was evacuated to a naval vessel where a delegation including Armed Forces Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama, Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, Great Council of Chiefs Chairman and former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka (who had instigated two earlier coups in 1987), and his own son-in-law, Ratu Epeli Ganilau (a former Army commander) met him and pressed him to abrogate the constitution. He refused, and resigned. Whether or not Mara's resignation was forced remains (as of 2005) the subject of a police investigation. Some, including Mahendra Chaudhry, believe that he was forcibly deposed. However, Mara's daughter Adi Ateca Ganilau, who is married to Ratu Ganilau, maintains that her father chose to resign and subsequently refused to be reinstated because he was upset at the abrogation of the constitution. Almost a year later, Mara publicly accused the police chief, Colonel Isikia Savua and former Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, of instigating the coup. In an interview with Close-Up on Fiji Television on 29 April 2001, he claimed that Speight (who was then in custody and was later convicted of treason) was only a front. Mara said that he had confronted Savua and Rabuka two days after the coup about their possible involvement. \\"I could see it in their faces,\\" said Mara, emphatically rejecting their denials. Mara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight's forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned Government House (the official residence of the President) to offer to form a government. Mara said that he was shocked to learn that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit of the Army had been involved in the coup. He alleged that they took George Speight to Parliament, and that their senior officers supplied them with weapons, blankets, and food. Mara also declared that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare officers who joined Speight's coup had trained on a farm owned by Rabuka.  The interim military government  Commodore Bainimarama announced on radio and television that he had taken over the government, and declared martial law at 6 pm. He abrogated the constitution on 30 May, and proceeded to appoint an interim government. He initially nominated Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (a son-in-law of Mara's and the husband of Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was one of Speight's hostages) as Prime Minister, but withdrew the nomination the next day. It was not until 4 July that he actually appointed a Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase (who remained in office until he was ousted from power by another coup in December 2006). Rebels, still holding hostages, staged a number of incidents around the country, cutting off Suva's power supply on 6 July, and over-running an army base on Vanua Levu Island and exchanging fire with the military in Suva the next day.  The Iloilo administration  The interim military government signed an accord with Speight on 9 July, granting him immunity from prosecution and a review of the constitution in return for the release of the hostages. Nine were freed on 12 July, and the others, including Chaudhry, on the 13th. Ratu Josefa Iloilo was sworn in as President the same day, with Ratu Jope Seniloli as Vice-President. The appointment of Seniloli, a supporter of the rebels who had sworn himself in as President at Speight's behest, was seen as a gesture of appeasement to the rebel forces. On 27 July, Aparama Vulavou and Peter Hazelman was arrested along with 369 supporters. The government reneged on the accord granting Speight immunity from prosecution, with Bainimarama saying that the military had signed it \\"under duress.\\"  The Queen Elizabeth Barracks mutiny  A second attempt by hardline elements to seize power took place on 2 November that year, when rebel soldiers mutinied at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The mutiny resulted in the death of four loyal soldiers. Four rebels were subsequently beaten to death after the mutiny had been quelled. Bainimarama accused Rabuka of involvement, but as of April 2015, Rabuka has never been charged.  Aftermath  On 15 November, the High Court declared that the interim government was illegal. Mara remained the lawful President; Parliament had not been dissolved but only suspended, and should now be reconvened, and by implication, Chaudhry remained the lawful Prime Minister. As Mara had not been performing his duties, however, Iloilo had been rightly exercising the prerogatives of the office in his place. Mara subsequently resigned officially, with his resignation backdated to 29 May. The Qarase government appealed the court ruling; on 1 March 2001, the Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court decision reinstating the constitution. The government accepted the decision. An estimated 7,500 jobs were lost because of the coup.

Notice the corded heat sealer to the left. Heat sealer used to prepare plastic bag of lettuce for shelf life testing A heat sealer is a machine used to seal products, packaging, and other thermoplastic materials using heat. This can be with uniform thermoplastic monolayers or with materials having several layers, at least one being thermoplastic. Heat sealing can join two similar materials together or can join dissimilar materials, one of which has a thermoplastic layer. Heat sealing process Heat sealing is the process of sealing one thermoplastic to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure. The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives, film media, plastic ports or foil sealing. =Applications for the heat sealing process= Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where heat staking or ultrasonic welding are not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations. Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Plastic bags and other packaging is often formed and sealed by heat sealers. Medical and fluid bags used in the medical, bioengineering and food industries. Fluid bags are made out of a multitude of varying materials such as foils, filter media, thermoplastics and laminates. Types of heat sealingHot bar sealers- have heated tooling kept at a constant temperature (also known as Direct Contact Thermal Sealing). They use one or more heated bars, irons, or dies which contact the material to heat the interface and form a bond. The bars, irons and dies have various configurations and can be covered with a release layer or utilize various slick interposer materials (i.e. Teflon films) to prevent sticking to the hot tooling. *Continuous heat sealers- (also known as Band type heat sealers) utilize moving belts over heating elements. *Impulse heat sealers- have heating elements (one or two) of Nichrome placed between a resilient synthetic rubber and a release surface of film or fabric. The heating elements are not continuously heated; heat is generated only when current flows. When the materials are placed in the heat sealer, they are held in place by pressure. An electric current heats the heating element for a specified time to create the required temperature. the Jaws hold the material in place after the heat is stopped, sometimes with cooling water: this allows the material to fuse before stress can be applied. *Hot melt adhesive can be applied in strips or beads at the point of joining. It can also be applied to one of the surfaces during an earlier manufacturing step and reactivated for bonding. * Hot wire sealing ‚Äì involves a heated wire that both cuts the surfaces and joins them with a molten edge bead. This is not usually employed when barrier properties are critical. *Induction sealing is a non-contact type of sealing used for inner seals in bottle caps. *Induction welding heat sealing by non-contact induction * Ultrasonic welding uses high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a weld. A type of heat sealer is also used to piece together plastic side panels for light-weight agricultural buildings such as greenhouses and sheds. This version is guided along the floor by four wheels. Seal quality Good seals are a result of time, temperature and pressure for the correct clean material. Several standard test methods are available to measure the strength of heat seals. In addition, package testing is used to determine the ability of completed packages to withstand specified pressure or vacuum. Several methods are available to determine the ability of a sealed package to retain its integrity, barrier characteristics, and sterility. Heat sealing processes can be controlled by a variety of quality management systems such as HACCP, statistical process control, ISO 9000, etc. Verification and validation protocols are used to ensure that specifications are met and final materials/packages are suited for end-use. Seal Strength Testing The efficacy of heat seals is often detailed in governing specifications, contracts, and regulations. Quality management systems sometimes ask for periodic subjective evaluations: For example, some seals can be evaluated by a simple pull to determine the existence of a bond and the mechanism of failure. With some plastic films, observation can be enhanced by using polarized light which highlights the birefringence of the heat seal. Some seals for sensitive products require thorough verification and validation protocols that use quantitative testing. Test methods might include: =Seal Strength per ASTM F88 and F2824= Seal Strength testing, also known as Peel Testing, measures the strength of seals within flexible barrier materials. This measurement can then be used to determine consistency within the seal, as well as evaluation of the opening force of the package system. Seal strength is a quantitative measure for use in process validation, process control and capability. Seal strength is not only relevant to opening force and package integrity, but to measuring the packaging processes‚Äô ability to produce consistent seals. =Burst and Creep per ASTM F1140 and F2054= The burst test is used to determine the packages strength and precession. The burst test is performed by pressurizing the package until it bursts. The results for the burst test include the burst pressure data and a description of where the seal failure occurred. This test method covers the burst test as defined in ASTM F1140. The Creep test determines the packages ability to hold pressure for an extended period. The creep test is performed by setting the pressure at about 80% of the minimum burst pressure of a previous burst test. The time to seal failure or a pre-set time is measured. =Vacuum Dye per ASTM D3078= Determination of package integrity. The package is submerged in a transparent container filled with a mixture of water and dye. Vacuum is created inside the container and maintained for a specific length of time. When the vacuum is released, any punctured packages will draw in dye revealing the imperfect seal.

The Sukunaivalu Barracks mutiny (7 July 2000) On 7 July 2000, rebel soldiers supporting George Speight overran the Sukunaivalu Barracks in Labasa, the largest town on the northern island of Vanua Levu. Besides seizing the barracks, these soldiers harassed ordinary Indo-Fijian citizens of Labasa, kidnapping bus commuters, ransacking homes, and seizing crops. Indo-Fijian women were also raped. Deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, an Indo- Fijian, condemned a number of businessmen, also Indo-Fijians, as \\"traitors to their people\\" for having financed and fed the mutineers in a rebellion ostensibly aimed at promoting nationalistic indigenous Fijian political interests. Chaudhry has made these allegations in court papers, as well as on his party's website. The Queen Elizabeth Barracks mutiny (2 November 2000) The second mutiny, which took place on 2 November 2000 at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks, was led by Captain Shane Stevens. It left four dead. In the aftermath of the failed attempt to depose the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, four of the rebels were beaten to death by loyal soldiers. A total of 42 soldiers from the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit were subsequently convicted of involvement in the mutiny. =Rabuka accused= Accusations were levelled against former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who had himself instigated two military coups in 1987. In an interview with the Fiji Times on 12 November 2000, Commodore Bainimarama charged that while the revolt was in progress, Rabuka had visited the barracks with his army uniform in the car, ready to take over command of the army. He also allegedly started issuing orders to soldiers, telling them to obey his orders. \\"Rabuka's words to one of my colonels at the height of the shootings raised my suspicions,\\" Bainimarama said. \\"He said the Colonel should listen to his instructions. He also criticised my leadership.\\" Bainimarama accused Rabuka of leading soldiers astray by using \\"confusing\\" and \\"deceiving\\" words. Bainimarama also accused Rabuka of having \\"politicised\\" the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) unit, which he had founded as a bodyguard in 1987, to favour both the mutiny and the earlier takeover of parliament in May. Members of the CRW were involved in both the May coup and the November mutiny. Bainimarama's version was supported by Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula, who led the counteroffensive to put down the mutiny. On 13 November 2000, he said that rebels interrogated by the military had implicated Rabuka. He accused Rabuka of trying to take civilians into the barracks to act as human shields for the mutineers, and stated that Rabuka's intention was to \\"claim military leadership and ultimately overthrow the Government of the day.\\" Rabuka, a retired officer, denied supporting the mutiny, but refused to comment on an accusation from Bainimarama that he had called a meeting of senior officers loyal to him to depose Bainimarama. Despite his continued protests of innocence, the allegations continued to dog Rabuka, and thwarted his intended appointment as Fiji's Ambassador to the United States. On 14 May 2005, Commissioner of Police Andrew Hughes said the police were close to making a decision on whether to formally charge a number of unnamed individuals, one of whom the New Zealand Herald believed to be Rabuka. =Tarakinikini investigated= On 5 November 2000, Foreign Minister Phil Goff of New Zealand publicly accused Lieutenant Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, who had served as the Military's principal spokesman during the main events of the coup, of complicity in the mutiny of 2 November. According to Goff, the rebels' plan was to depose Commodore Bainimarama in favour of Tarakinikini. The next day, Tarakinikini angrily denied the charges, and said that in the light of the Military's decision to investigate, he was reconsidering his career with the Army. Shortly after the allegation were made, Tarakinikini left Fiji for New York to take up a post as a security adviser at the United Nations. His resignation from the Army, handed to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo in 2002, was rejected by the President at the request of Commodore Bainimarama, who has continued in his efforts to have Tarakinikini deported to face a court martial for his alleged role in the mutiny and in the coup itself. Tarakinikini is fighting the President's refusal of his resignation in the courts. The trial was supposed to begin on 12 September, but was postponed because Tarakinikini's lawyer, Samuela Matawalu, was recovering from a minor stroke. On 30 November, High Court Justice Gerald Winter scheduled a hearing for 22 February 2006 and ordered Matawalu to file submissions by 16 January, and the President's Office to reply by 17 February. =Takiveikata convicted= Stevens later testified that Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, the Qaranivalu, a senior chief of Naitasiri Province and a Senator and former Cabinet Minister, had visited the barracks during the mutiny to offer moral and practical support, which included supplying the mutineers with cellphones. On 23 November, Takiveikata was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the mutiny. =Court Martial= On 16 August 2005, the Fiji Court of Appeal delivered a landmark ruling, ordering a retrial of 20 soldiers from the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit (CRW) who had been convicted in a court martial of participating in the 2000 coup and in a subsequent mutiny in November 2000, and sentenced to prison terms of between three and six years. Various legal technicalities have resulted in several adjournments in the court martial retrial since the naming of the court martial panel, under Judge Advocate Graeme Leung, on 5 October.

The inscription reads in German, \\"In this house, Dr. Erika Fuchs (1906-2005) lived and translated for more than five decades. Her texts have profoundly crafted the world of Duckburg and enriched the German language.\\" Erika Fuchs, n√©e Petri (7 December 1906 in Rostock ‚Äì 22 April 2005 in Munich), was a German translator. She is largely known in Germany due to her translations of American Disney comics, especially Carl Barks' stories about Duckburg and its inhabitants. Many of her creations (re)entered the German language, and her followers today recognize her widely quoted translations as standing in the tradition of great German-language light poetry such as by Heinrich Heine, Wilhelm Busch, and Kurt Tucholsky. Unlike the English originals, her translations included many hidden quotes and literary allusions. As Fuchs once said, \\"You can't be educated enough to translate comic books\\".  Life  Born into a well to do large family, Fuchs spent most of her childhood and youth in Belgard in Pomerania, where in 1921 she was the first girl to be admitted to the boys' Gymnasium (grammar school) - she passed her Abitur exam there in 1926. She went on to study art history in Lausanne, Munich and London and took her degree in 1931-1932\\\\. In 1935 her dissertation was entitled \\"Johann Michael Feuchtmayr: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des deutschen Rokoko\\" - \\"a contribution to the history of German Rococo\\". It received a summa cum laude. Her husband, Dipl.-Ing. G√ºnter Fuchs (1907‚Äì1984), was an industrialist and inventor and tried various inventions at home. After the Second World War she worked as a translator for the German edition of Reader's Digest, before carrying out translating jobs for other American magazines. In 1951, she became chief editor of Disney's newly founded German Micky Maus magazine, where she worked until she retired in 1988.  Work  Many of her creations as translator of Carl Barks comics entered or reentered the German language. The phrase \\"Dem Ingeni√∂r ist nichts zu schw√∂r\\" - \\"nothing is too hard for an engineer\\" but with the vowels (umlauts) at the end of \\"Ingenieur\\" and \\"schwer\\" altered to make them rhyme amusingly was often attributed to Fuchs, as she had made it Gyro Gearloose's German catchphrase. However, it was originally based on a song written by Heinrich Seidel. A somewhat more clumsy version of the phrase was the first verse of \\"Seidels Ingenieurlied\\" (\\"The Engineer's Song\\") and had been used by fraternities at technical universities for the German equivalent of The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer. Fuchs had heard it from her husband, who was an engineer himself. A classical Fuchs is as well to be found in her translation of Barks's 1956 story \\"Three Un-Ducks\\" (INDUCKS story code W WDC 184-01), where Huey, Dewey, and Louie speak the oath \\"Wir wollen sein ein einig Volk von Br√ºdern, in keiner Not uns waschen und Gefahr\\" (\\"We Shall be a United People of Brethren, Never to Wash in Danger nor Distress\\"), thereby parodying Friedrich Schiller's version of the R√ºtlischwur from his 1804 play William Tell in a suitable way. She also used verbs shortened to their stems not only to imitate sounds (onomatopoeia), such as schluck, st√∂hn, knarr, klimper (gulp, groan, creak, chink/jingle), but also to represent soundless events: gr√ºbel, staun, zitter (ponder, goggle, tremble). The word for these soundwords in German is now an Erikativ,Or as a technical term, an Inflektiv, for which see Oliver Teuber (1998): fasel beschreib erw√§hn ‚Äì Der Inflektiv als Wortform des Deutschen. in: Germanistische Linguistik 141/142, p. 7‚Äì26. ‚Äî Note that the German Inflektiv refers to uninflected words because the English inflect/inflection translate to flektieren/Flexion. a tongue-in-cheek word utilizing Fuchs's first name, made to resemble grammatical terms such as Infinitiv (infinitive), Indikativ (indicative mood), Akkusativ (accusative case), etc. Erikative are commonly used in Internet forums and chatrooms to describe what people are doing as they write, which has become the common German form of the Internet slang behavior known in English as emoting. English examples: *ducks*, *runs away*, etc. The Erikativ is the German form of those (*duck*, *weglauf*, respectively).  Honors and legacy  The Erika-Fuchs-Haus in Schwarzenbach a.d. Saale in 2015. In 2001 she was awarded the Heimito von Doderer Prize for Literature for her work on Duckburg.

This was a series of mainly small-ship actions which occurred along the coast of what is now Ukraine during the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792) as Russian and Turkish ships and boats supported their land armies in the struggle for control of Ochakov, a strategic position. The main actions at sea happened on 17, 18, 28 and 29 June and 9 July 1788. On 9 July also, the larger Turkish ships left and on 14 July they fought the Russian Sevastopol fleet about 100 miles to the south. The parties The Russians had a small sailing ship fleet, commanded by Alexiano, but finally taken command of by John Paul Jones on 6 June, and a gunboat flotilla (the makeup of which changed over the course of the fighting), commanded by Prince Charles of Nassau- Siegen. Both of these men had been made Russian Rear-Admirals, and were themselves commanded by Prince Potemkin. The Russian land armies were commanded by Alexander Suvorov. The Turks had a large mixed fleet, commanded by Kapudan Pasha (admiral in chief) Hassan el Ghazi, part of which came in close to support the fighting, and part of which stayed out. It is hard to determine the makeup of this force accurately. Most of its ships were probably armed merchantmen, carrying around 40 guns, a few were probably larger. Different accounts give different numbers, but according to an 8 April list from Istanbul, the fleet consisted of 12 battleships, 13 frigates, 2 bombs, 2 galleys, 10 gunboats and 6 fireships. There were some xebecs (oared vessels of 30 or more guns) as well, but perhaps these were counted as frigates. Ships involved =Russia= Sailing ship fleet (Jones): (Only the first 3 were built as warships) Vladimir 48 (reduced from 66 due to shallow water) Aleksandr Nevskii 40 (reduced from 50 due to shallow water) Skoryi 40 Cherson 32 Sv.

Anna Grigorii Potemkin Melent Bityug (bomb) Flotilla (Nassau-Siegen): ? =Turkey (Hassan el Ghazi)= 12 battleships, mostly small 13 frigates or xebecs 2 bombs 2 galleys 10 gunboats 6 fireships Chronology On 19 March 1788, the Russian sailing fleet moved from its position near Cherson to Cape Stanislav. On 21 April, Nassau-Siegen reached Cherson with his flotilla and on 24 April moved into the Liman. On 27 May, the Russian Sevastopol' fleet under Count Voinovitch attempted to leave port but was forced back almost immediately by adverse conditions. If it had sailed, it might have met the Turkish fleet earlier than it did. On 30 May Jones arrived, but left to confer with Suvorov about the building of a new battery at Kinburn (on the south coast, facing Ochakov) before returning on 6 June. Meanwhile, on 31 May the Turkish fleet had arrived. The Russian flotilla waited too long before retreating, and one of its vessels, the double-sloop No. 2, was overtaken by small craft and its commander, Saken, blew himself up. After a minor action on 17 June, on 18 June at about 7.30 am 5 Turkish galleys and 36 small craft attacked the inshore end of the Russian line, which was perpendicular to the coast. At first the Russians had only 6 galleys, 4 barges and 4 double-sloops to oppose them. At about 10 a.m. el Ghazi arrived with 12 more vessels, but Nassau-Siegen and Jones had advanced the offshore ends to bring their whole forces into action and at 10.30 the Turks withdrew with the loss of 2 or 3 vessels burnt and blown up. At about 11 a.m. firing stopped and by 12 p.m. the Russian flotilla had rejoined the sailing ships. On 27 June at 12 p.m., the Turkish fleet steered for the left (windward) end of the Russian line but at 2 p.m. their flagship ran aground and the other ships anchored in disarray. Adverse winds prevented the Russians from attacking until about 2 a.m. on 28 June when it shifted to the NNE, but the Turkish ship had been refloated and the Turks tried to form a line. At about 4 a.m. all the Russians advanced and at 5.15 a.m. they were in action. The Turkish second flagship ran aground and Nassau-Siegen sent in the left wing of his flotilla to attack her. This left his right wing weak, and Malyi Aleksandr was sunk by Turkish bombs. However, the Turkish battleship was burnt, this fate also falling to her flagship later. At 9.30 p.m., the Turks withdrew under the Ochakov guns; el Ghazi decided to withdraw his sailing ships completely, but the new battery at Kinburn forced him so far to the north that 9 of his ships ran aground, and the next morning the Russian flotilla surrounded these and several small craft and destroyed them all except for one 54-gun battleship, which they refloated. The Turks had lost 2 battleships and 885 captured on 28 June, and perhaps 8 battleships, 2 frigates, 2 xebecs, 1 bomb, 1 galley and 1 transport and 788 captured on 29 June. Russian casualties were 18 killed and 67 wounded in the flotilla, and probably slight losses in the sailing ships. The Turkish fleet appeared near Pirezin Adasƒ±, west of Ochakov, on 1 July, to try to rescue the small craft, but decided not to pass the batteries again and on 9 July it put to sea to meet the Russian Sevastopol' fleet, which it fought in the Battle of Fidonisi to the south on 14 July. On 9 July also the Russian army began to assault Ochakov and the Russian flotilla attacked the Turkish vessels there. Forces involved in this were as follows: Russian: 7 galleys, 7 double-sloops, 7 floating batteries, 7 \\"decked boats\\" and 22 gunboats. Turkish: 2 20-gun xebecs/frigates, 5 galleys, 1 kirlangitch (very similar to a galley), 1 16-gun brigantine, 1 bomb and 2 gunboats. At 3.15 a.m. firing started. The 2 Turkish gunboats and 1 galley were captured by the Russians and the rest were burnt. Firing ceased at 9.30. Russian casualties were 24 killed and 80 wounded. References Sources Anderson, R.

It featured the Justice League of America, several members of the Legion of Super-Heroes and more than two dozen allied heroes, villains and scientists of the DC Universe banding together in the face of global calamity when an extraterrestrial entity called the Sun-Eater envelopes and extinguishes the Sun, causing Earth to freeze and wither into ecological collapse. Unlike other crossover events published by DC, the conflict of The Final Night did not revolve around a conventional villain. It was primarily a story of survival that focused on the main characters performing disaster response, while attempting to prevent impending mass extinction of all life on Earth. At the end of each issue was an in-story website feature written by S.T.A.R. Labs, giving information updates and emergency support to residents of the DC Universe as the crisis progressed. The storyline is notable in DC canon for the death and disputed redemption of Green Lantern Hal Jordan, whose character at the time had been transformed into the villainous Parallax. Jordan's character was later restored to life and to his role as Earth's Green Lantern in the 2004 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth.  Plot  In a brief prologue originally published as a promotional preview to the miniseries, before traveling to Earth's solar system, the Sun- Eater consumes the sun neighboring Starfire's newly-settled planet, New Tamaran and eventually triggers a supernova, seemingly killing all of New Tamaran's inhabitants. An unspecified amount of time later, Dusk arrives on Earth to warn the population that a giant extraterrestrial being, known as the Sun-Eater, is heading our way. Dusk is a member of an unknown alien race and does not speak or understand a word of English, so Saturn Girl uses her telepathic powers to translate and teach her the language. Dusk has attempted to warn hundreds of worlds, prior to Earth, about the Sun-Eater. Each planet had tried, in its own way, to stop the Sun-Eater, but every attempt was as unsuccessful as the last one. This has convinced Dusk that the Sun-Eater is indestructible. Despite her warnings, the Justice League still try to stop the Sun-Eater. For their first attempt, Mister Miracle tries using his boom tube to send it into another dimension. This proves unsuccessful, since they discover that the Sun-Eater is not entirely in our dimension. As a last resort, Superman and several other \\"heat-producing\\" heroes combine their energies to create a second sun and try to lure the Sun-Eater away from the Sun. The Sun-Eater quickly consumes that sun before moving on to the Sun. As the Sun is extinguished, Earth falls into chaos and the planet starts to freeze. There are only five days to restore the Sun, after which Earth will become uninhabitable. Powerless to do anything to stop the freeze, the League tries to help control the chaos and to keep hope alive. Many people freeze to death. Wildcat is badly injured. Etrigan the Demon offers the entire world heat at the cost of their souls; the world rejects him, primarily because his plan was to shift Earth into Hell. Lex Luthor teams up with the League to try to reignite the Sun. The events of this series cross over into other books as well. Superman encounters Ferro Lad, who would later make an abortive attempt to destroy the Sun-Eater. The Ray devotes his attentions to a small Mexican town. Tommy Monaghan (Hitman) holes up in his favorite bar, Noonan's. Seeing Earth as just another failure (and after being attacked by an angry mob who had accused her of bringing the Sun-Eater to Earth in the first place), Dusk decides that it is time for her to move on. As she prepares for takeoff, she encounters a stranger, and is shocked that he understands her language. The stranger takes Dusk on a quick trip around the world and shows her the League's efforts to keep hope alive. Dusk doubts that there is any hope left for the world. Eventually, the stranger disappears and Dusk is left alone in an alleyway. She is found by a small group of people and, thinking they are going to attack her again, prepares to defend herself. To her surprise, the group offer to take her to a shelter where she will be safe. This act of kindness gives her hope for the planet. Meanwhile, scientists have realized that the Sun is losing energy, but not mass, to the Sun-Eater. This will cause the Sun to go nova and the explosion will catapult the Sun-Eater into another solar system, where it will consume another sun. The assembled heroes construct a technological means of destroying the Sun-Eater. Lex Luthor angrily bows out of piloting the ship needed, revealing that he was in it simply to save his own skin, prompting Superman to volunteer in the hope that his powers will be restored by the solar surge as the Sun is restored. Ferro Lad steals the ship, only to be shunted back to Earth by Hal Jordan, the former Green Lantern then known as Parallax. Parallax sacrifices his life to absorb the Sun-Eater and reignite the Sun, simultaneously using his powers to safely restore it to its original form without causing any side-effects, such as the mass flooding that would have resulted if the Sun had been restored purely by Luthor's plan. The League watches in astonishment and Dusk says she no longer believes that anything is impossible. Key events and aftermath The Final Night culminates in the death of Hal Jordan and is the first in a series of storylines that eventually redeem him for his crimes committed as Parallax in Emerald Twilight and Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!. Hal Jordan returns in the 1999 crossover storyline Day of Judgement, in which his soul becomes a host for the Spectre-Force. He later returns to life and is reinstated as Earth's Green Lantern in 2004's Green Lantern: Rebirth miniseries. His death in defeating the Sun-Eater remains a key point in the character's history, as it has been referenced in numerous storylines since, including 2009's Blackest Night crossover storyline. * Ferro Lad is re- introduced in post-Zero Hour continuity as Ferro. The young hero's death was a major event in the Legion of Super-Heroes' Silver Age adventures, but was no longer in continuity at this time. This new incarnation of the character later joins the faction of Legionnaires stranded in the present and eventually returns to the 30th Century with them. * Starfire's recently settled home world of New Tamaran is destroyed, marking the second Tamaranean world to die. Though Starfire survives the cataclysm, casualties include her sister and former Teen Titans villain, Blackfire, who is presumed dead until 2005's Rann- Thanagar War. The death of her world and people prompts Starfire to return to Earth some time later, eventually rejoining the Titans. * Superman remains powerless after the Sun is re-ignited. This plotline continues throughout the Superman comics as his body converts into a being of pure energy and he develops new, energy-based powers requiring a specialized containment suit to maintain control of them and stay alive, while also causing his skin to assume a blue pigment when his powers are fully active. Superman adapts the suit into a new blue-and-white costume, which he sports for a period of time before he eventually regains his original powers and defaults back to his traditional costume. * In a later flashback to The Final Night occurring in the final page of Green Arrow (vol. 2) #137 (Oct. 1998), it is revealed that, prior to sacrificing his life, Hal Jordan had used his power as Parallax to resurrect his longtime friend Oliver Queen, the Green Arrow, who died in his own series in 1995. Queen made his official return to the DC Universe in Quiver storyline of Green Arrow (vol. 3) #1 in 2001. Reading order The Final Night was primarily self-contained to a weekly four-issue limited series, with a number of tie-in issues reflecting the impacts of the storyline across the DC Universe in different characters' ongoing series.

This led to an intensification of warfare over the period, but also led to economic and cultural developments on a large scale. Of the Seven Warring States, Qin eventually grew to be the strongest and successfully annexed the other six states; Han was the first to fall, in 230 BCE, while Qi was the last to surrender in 221 BCE. Zheng, the King of Qin, created the new title of huangdi (emperor), and became China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi. Formation The formation of the Seven Warring States was the culmination of trends during the preceding Spring and Autumn period, when the patchwork of states created by the Western Zhou dynasty were conquered and absorbed through warfare, coalescing into seven larger polities. Qin, Qi, Chu and Yan already existed as states during that period; Qin and Yan, owing to their remote locations, were traditionally considered second-tier powers, while Chu and Qi were among the dominant states of the period, in direct competition with the State of Jin. In 403 BCE, King Weilie of Zhou recognized Jin's partition, leading to the creation of three new states: Wei, Zhao and Han. Other major states included Wu and Yue, with the latter conquering the former in 473 BCE. Minor Chinese and sinicized states and polities continued to exist well into the Warring States Era, such as Shu (annexed by Qin in 316 BCE), Zhongshan (annexed by Zhao in 296 BCE), Song (annexed by Qi in 286 BCE), Lu (annexed by Chu in 256 or 249 BCE). These political changes led to changes amongst the ruling families as well: in 481 BCE, the Tian clan usurped the state of Qi in a coup and replaced the ruling Jiang clan. Meanwhile, the state of Jin, which had been controlled by different noble clans for decades, was partitioned between the Han, Zhao and Wei clans in 403 BCE.

It also gives its name to a community. Trelech village The population taken at the 2011 census was 745. The community is bordered by the communities of: Cenarth; Cynwyl Elfed; Abernant; Meidrim; and Llanwinio, all being in Carmarthenshire; and by Clydau in Pembrokeshire. The village is home to the Welsh-medium Ysgol Hafodwenog (Hafodwenog Community Primary School), which has around 60 pupils aged 4 to 11, and was opened in 1972 to serve the children of the surrounding settlements of Alma, Bryn Iwan, Cilrhedyn, Dinas, Gelliwen, Pandy, Penybont, and Talog, as well as those of Trelech itself. Trelech has a community centre (in the building, across the road, which housed the modern school's predecessor) and a pub, the Tafarn Beca. However, given the area's very rural and lightly populated nature, the village no longer has a shop or post office. There is a children's play area, and the school also has a small soccer field. Trelech was the birthplace on 14 November 1801 of David Rees (Y Cynhyrfwr), the reforming Welsh Congregationalist minister, and on 3 November 1879 of the reporter, poet, and short-story writer Perceval Gibbon, who travelled extensively in Europe, Africa, and the Americas and died in Guernsey on 30 May 1926.

This ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 1 March 2001. Since then, a police investigation has begun (though it has proceeded too slowly for the satisfaction of some critics), and a number of high-profile trials have taken place, resulting in the conviction and imprisonment of some members of the present government, which came to power in the wake of the coup. It was announced on 2 May 2005 that 2499 people had been implicated to date in offences related to the coup. Eleven out of 24 alleged plotters had been tried, along with six executors of the coup. Of 21 alleged financial supporters, none had been dealt with, and investigations were still in progress. On 21 September, Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola announced that 556 people had been tried either thorough the justice system or by court martial. He rejected a call from Labour MP Ganesh Chand to name them, however, saying that many were either serving or had served their sentences, and that to name them would breach their privacy. 120 soldiers had been tried ‚Äì 56 for their roles in the coup, 28 for the Sukanaivalu mutiny, and 38 for the Suva mutiny on 2 November 2000. He said that there were currently 208 cases pending before the Director of Public Prosecutions. The charges ranged from unlawful assembly and public order breaches to murder, sedition, and treason; apart from a few who were acquitted for lack of evidence, most had been convicted, Vosanibola said. Police investigation A number of separate, but overlapping, investigations have been conducted by the police into various aspects of the 2000 coup. Some of these investigations are ongoing as of 2005. These investigations include the organization and financing of the coup, and the identity of the perpetrators. Some have alleged that George Speight was only a front-man for a shadowy group of politicians and businessmen; former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka is reported to be one of those under investigation. Other cases being investigated include the removal of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara from the Presidency and the installation of an Interim Military Government by the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and an alleged plot to remove the subsequently appointed President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes revealed on 4 January 2006 that a total of seven major investigations related to the coup were in progress, with four offices assigned to them full-time. Three files had been reopened, he said, following allegations made by Maciu Navakasuasua, a coup-convict, and Josaia Waqabaca, a self-declared party to the planning of the coup. Controversial trials and verdicts A number of prominent participants in the coup have been tried, and some convicted, in 2004 and 2005. Many of those tried have links to the present government, which has come under criticism from some quarters for releasing on parole some of the persons convicted. Reconciliation commission proposed Prime Minister Qarase announced on 4 May 2005 that the government would establish a \\"Reconciliation and Unity Commission\\" empowered to recommend amnesty for persons involved in the coup, provided that their motive had been \\"political\\" and that they had not done so with \\"criminal intent.\\" Opposition Leader Chaudhry condemned the proposed Commission, alleging that it would be a cover for pardoning members of the present government who were implicated in the coup. Chaudhry insisted that one set of rules should apply to everyone, regardless of their position in society, and regardless of their motives for having broken the law. He was supported by National Alliance Party president Ratu Epeli Ganilau and by United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes. Ganilau said that the notion that politically motivated crimes could be justified was \\"insulting to the intelligence of ordinary people,\\" and that it represented a naive and uncaring attitude toward the hurt suffered by many during the 2000 coup. \\"The intention to bring a closure to investigations and litigation regarding the 2000 coup would be a severe interference of politics into the work of law enforcement in this country,\\" Ganilau said. On 18 May, he added that he saw \\"nothing reconciliatory about the bill,\\" which he believed to be aimed at legalizing the Muanikau Accord, which had been proposed by George Speight in 2000. \\"To use the word reconciliation is a gross violation of the rights of everyone in this nation,\\" he said. Beddoes, for his part, called the proposal a recipe for disaster which would license any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so. He accused the government of kow-towing to its junior coalition partner, the Conservative Alliance, on which it depends for its parliamentary majority, in order to keep them on board until the next parliamentary election, expected for 2006. On 7 May, Adi Koila Nailatikau added her own voice to the opposition to the commission, saying that if her father were alive, he would not approve of interfering with the course of justice, and that unless all perpetrators of the coup were brought to justice, \\"Fiji cannot put to rest the ghosts of the coup.\\" Yet another opponent of the proposal is Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who has called the bill \\"Reconciliation bull.\\" Expulsion of Ridgeway On 3 May 2005, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Peter Ridgeway, resigned in protest against political interference in the judicial system, namely the early release of prisoners. On 20 June, he was ordered to leave Fiji and return to his native Australia after Prime Minister Qarase vetoed a two-month extension of his contract. Ridgeway had been responsible for a number of high-profile prosecutions, and opposition politicians thought that his dismissal and expulsion were politically motivated. Speaking on ABC Radio Australia, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale said that it was the government's prerogative to decide on the employment of foreign workers in the civil service. Ridgeway's contract had been for a fixed term and had already expired. \\"It was subject to renewal at the option of the employer,\\" Bale said. \\"It is not at his option or the option of any other person who may support him or whatever else.\\" He denied that there was anything sinister about refusing Ridgeway the requested two-month contract extension to complete cases he had been working on. Ridgeway's expulsion was condemned by Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry and by United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes, who claimed that the decision motivated by Ridgeway's prosecution of persons close to the government. He said that \\"two very prominent figures\\" were among those being pursued by Ridgeway; he did not name them, but one is believed to be former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. Beddoes predicted that these cases would \\"now gather dust.\\" On 23 June, Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes said he hoped that Ridgeway's expulsion would not affect the investigations and prosecutions underway. The Australian High Commission in Suva also said that it had been in touch with Fiji's Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the matter. It did not give details. Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola was \\"too busy\\" to comment at the immediately, but later said that he had discussed the affair with Australia's High Commissioner, Jennifer Rawlins. Relations with Australia, he said, would have to go on despite the \\"unfortunate\\" circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Ridgeway in what he called \\"a one-off situation.\\" He did not believe the controversy would tarnish Fiji's image. The Military commander, Commodore Bainimarama, reacted angrily to Ridgeway's expulsion, saying on 25 June that it would seriously hinder investigations, which would have to start all over again. Ridgeway himself concurred. \\"There is nobody in the DPP‚Äôs office who has the knowledge of the coup cases that I do,\\" he said. \\"And the reason for that is obvious: I have had an instrumental role in each and every coup case; I know it backwards. Nobody knows it as well as I do. For somebody to read into those sort of cases would be a six months job.\\" Bainimarama further alleged that Ridgeway was \\"almost closing in on\\" some major perpetrators of the coup when he was ordered to leave. Compensation lawsuit Forty-nine parliamentarians from the Fiji Labour Party and their People's Coalition partners in the 1999‚Äì2000 government have been suing George Speight and co-conspirator Timoci Silatolu for compensation. Former Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, whom the late President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara accused in his last recorded interview of involvement in the coup, is being sued also. The plaintiffs have been ordered by the court to cover the travel expenses of Savua, who is now Fiji's Ambassador to the United Nations in New York. It was announced on 25 July 2005 that the hearing had been postponed to 12 August. In addition, former Prime Minister Chaudhry, along with some others who were held as hostages during the coup crisis (including his son Rajendra), are preparing to sue the government for what they say was Military and Police negligence. They allege that the Military and Police knew that a coup was likely, and did nothing about it. \\"They did not take the necessary steps to insulate the Prime Minister, Government Ministers, Parliamentarians and other staff against the threats,\\" said Rajendra Chaudhry.\\"As a result of their negligence, I had to endure physical torture and psychological trauma and am seeking compensation for these and related matters.\\" On 15 August, Rajendra announced that he was suing for F$500,000, to cover loss of superannuation, medical expenses, and loss of future earnings. He said that his lawsuit was separate from his father's. A pre-trial conference for the lawsuit laid by the Fiji Labour Party will be held in the High Court on 9 September. Lawyer Vipul Misha is representing both Mahendra and Rajendra Chaudhry, as well as Dr Ganesh Chand, Giyannendra Prasad, Anand Singh, and the estate of Muthu Sami. A Queens Counsel has been asked to join the team. On 31 August, Justice Gerard Winter decided to adjourn until 30 September the hearing of the lawsuit of former FLP parliamentarians Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi and Gaffar Ahmed, after defence lawyer Akuila Naco asked for more time to prepare his case. On 15 September, Justice Winter set 14 October for Mahendra Chaudhry's compensation trial to begin. He refused a request from Timoci Silatolu's lawyer for a Military investigation into the 2000 upheaval to be made public, after the Military lawyer claimed Military privilege. Speight and his co-defendants appeared in Court on 27 January 2006 for a preliminary hearing, pending the full hearing scheduled for 1 May. 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat Fijian coup ","title":"Aftermath of the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat"},{"id":"1849040","text":"St Michael's College (Irish: Col√°iste Naomh M√≠che√°l) is a voluntary Catholic boys' school located on Ailesbury Road in Dublin 4, Ireland.

He began working for Playboy magazine in 1976 and at one time was one of only two photographers who produced the Playboy centerfold photographs. Freytag grew up in Chicago, Illinois, attending Sutherland grammar school and Luther South High School. He graduated from the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in 1970, and from Brooks Institute of Photography (Santa Barbara, California) in 1974. After an initial period as an apprentice at Playboy, he joined Mario Casilli, Richard Fegley and Ken Marcus as the principal photographers at Playboy's California studio. During his studies at Brooks, Freytag became proficient with the 4‚Äùx5‚Äù view camera, a skill that served him well shooting the monthly multi-page (gatefold) Playboy centerfold. Attempting to produce the very highest quality possible for the centerfold image, Playboy used the very large 8\\"x10‚Äù view camera. Due to the amount of strobe (electronic flash) light needed to expose that large a sheet of film, Freytag, at first of necessity and later by choice, specialized in the use of elaborate lighting setups, often using dozens of flash heads. Later, after Playboy abandoned film and moved to digital cameras, Freytag continued to create images using up to fifty flash heads, each light meticulously placed and targeted to illuminate a small area of the photo. Freytag likens his technique to that of a painter, using each light as his brush strokes, selectively illuminating each area as he incrementally builds the final image. Freytag's last centerfold shoot was of Playmate Amanda Streich, Miss December 2012. Personal life Freytag lives in Woodland Hills, California.

Originally operated by the Ministry of Highways as part of their inland ferry services, a single vessel ‚Äì M.V. T'Lagunna ‚Äì provided service every hour from 1:00am to 6:00am and every 30 minutes during the rest of the day. It ran continuously when there were overloads.. Named for the Halqemeylem name for the Golden Ears, it had originally served the communities of Agassiz and Rosedale as M.V. Agassiz. Built in 1931, it had a vehicle capacity of just 16 cars. Tolls of 40 cents per car and driver, and 10 cents per additional passenger, were initially charged but these were removed on February 15, 1972, and the service remained free thereafter. In 1978, after many years of complaints about safety and reliability another ferry ‚Äì M.V. Kulleet ‚Äì was put into service alongside T'Lagunna. In 1985, Kulleet's sister ship, M.V. Klatawa replaced T'Lagunna, which was kept as a spare until 1986. Both Kulleet and Klatawa had previously been servicing short routes in the Gulf Islands. T'Lagunna was sold for use as a cargo barge, and eventually sank in Howe Sound; it was salvaged in 2011. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transit Authority (later known as Translink) was created to handle all transportation in greater Vancouver, including the Albion ferry. A subsidiary company, Fraser River Marine Transportation Ltd., was created to operate the ferry. At a 50th anniversary celebration in June 2007, a commemorative plaque was placed by Maple Ridge's Community Heritage Commission at the Albion ferry terminal. The ferry service was retired shortly after the Golden Ears Bridge opened to traffic on June 16, 2009. The last sailings for Kulleet and Klatawa took place on July 31, 2009, just after noon. At the end of its life the ferry employed 58 full-time and as many as 20 auxiliary employees; 2006 traffic amounted to 1.5 million vehicles and 4.0 million passengers. The two ferries were sold in 2011 for $400,000 to a local marine transportation company.

He is perhaps best known for his book Techgnosis: Myth, Magic and Mysticism in the Age of Information, as well as his work on California counterculture, including Burning Man, the human potential movement, and the writings of Philip K. Dick. Biography =Early years= Born in Redwood City, California in 1967, Davis grew up in Del Mar before attending Yale University, where he graduated magna cum laude with a degree in English. He wrote a senior thesis on science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, and has since written a number of articles in the popular press about Dick and his unusual religious experiences. Davis would go on to co-edit The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick, which was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2011. While at Yale, Davis began writing for Nadine, an on-campus magazine that turned out a number of rock critics and pop culture writers in the 1980s and 1990s. Soon after graduation in 1988, Davis pitched his first story to the Village Voice, a review of the Swiss heavy metal band Celtic Frost. =1990s= Writing for the Village Voice throughout the early 1990s, Davis also contributed to Spin, Details, Rolling Stone, and Wired magazines, writing about music, art, film, pop culture and technology. In July 1995, Davis published a piece in Wired magazine called \\"Technopagans\\",https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/technopagans.html which was one of the precursors for Techgnosis: Myth, Magic and Mysticism in the Age of Information, a dense cultural history of the mystical, magical, and apocalyptic dreams and fantasies that haunt modern technoculture. Published by Harmony Books, the book is a cult classic of media studies and was eventually translated into five languages. It was re-released in paperback by Serpent's Tail in 2004 with a new afterword. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, Davis continued to write for both popular magazines and scholarly publications, and also expanded his speaking career, where his eclectic interests in subject ranging from music, art, popular culture and esoterica led to speaking engagements at such diverse venues as Stanford University, the British Museum, Burning Man, the Boom Festival, the Houston Jung Center, the Ojai Foundation, and Esalen. =2000s= In 2000, Davis won a Maggie Award for his profile of UFO contactee and Silicon Valley mogul Joe Firmage. In 2005, he released his second book, Led Zeppelin IV, a monograph on the signature album from one of rock‚Äôs most celebrated bands, published by 33‚Öì. In 2006, Blender magazine included it in their list of the 40 Greatest Rock ‚ÄòN Roll Books. In 2006, Davis cemented his reputation as a seminal writer of California counter- culture when he released The Visionary State: A Journey Through California‚Äôs Spiritual Landscape, a coffee table book of pictures and rich essays about California‚Äôs alternative spiritual movements and architecture. With photographs by Michael Rauner, the book was published by Chronicle Books. A prolific blogger for his site Techgnosis.com, Davis also released a fourth book in 2010, a collection of essays and journalism entitled Nomad Codes: Adventures in Modern Esoterica, published by Yeti Publishing. In early 2006, Davis started working with composer Mark Nichols on the libretto for a rock opera inspired by Burning Man. The resulting production debuted in October of 2009 and was entitled How to Survive the Apocalypse: A Burning Opera, in which Davis also performed as the bunny-suited, bullhorn-wielding narrator. Davis also wrote extensively about West Coast festival culture in photographer Kyer Wiltshire's 2009 book Tribal Revival. =2010s= In 2010, Davis began pursuing a PhD in Religious Studies at Rice University in their Gnosticism, Esotericism and Mysticism program. He has taught courses at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Rice University, Pacifica, and CIIS. Davis has appeared in a number of documentaries about technology and countercultural topics, including DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Electronic Awakening, and The Source Family.

She married firstly Jan Tar≈Ço (d. 1750), who left her the town of Opole Lubelskie in his will. In 1754, she married the magnate, Antoni Lubomirski, with whom she was actively involved in state affairs. She reportedly persuaded Lubomirski to end his alliance with Austria and instead become a French agent by accepting an alliance with France. Both her first spouse and her brother, Stanis≈Çaw, were pro-French. = Enlightenment activist = On finding out about it after the event, she opposed the marriage of her niece, Franciszka Korwin-Krasi≈Ñska to Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland, but relented having been persuaded by her husband and brother who saw it as an advancement, since Charles had prospects for the Polish throne. She and August Aleksander Czartoryski insisted that the marriage be made legitimate and public. However abroad, outside Polish Szlachta circles, it was considered a Morganatic marriage. During the interregnum of 1763-64, she supported the candidacy of Charles for the throne, while attempting to build a bridge between the Patriotic Party, which she represented, and the Familia (political party) of her ally, Czartoryski. During the Radom Confederation, she visited Warsaw with her niece, Franciszka.

She spent most of her life on her domains in Opole, Przeworsk and Dobromi≈Ç, where she reformed farming and stock management. She set up a vast Textile mill with the help of foreign expertise. After the fall of the Radom Confederation, she lived in her palace in Przeworsk with Franciszka Krasi≈Ñska, whom she eventually reunited with her husband, Charles in Opole in 1775.

He was first elected on November 8, 2005, unseating incumbent Jane Campbell, and re-elected in 2009, 2013, and 2017. Now serving in his fourth term, he is the longest- serving mayor in Cleveland history.Jackson wins historic 4th term - Cleveland 19.com (WOIO/WUAB) Early life and education Jackson is the son of an African-American father and an Italian-American mother. Jackson grew up in the Kinsman and Central neighborhoods. After graduating from Max S. Hayes High School, Jackson served in the United States Army. After his discharge, Jackson attended Cuyahoga Community College where he earned an associate degree. He later attended Cleveland State University (CSU), earning a bachelor's degree in Urban Studies and History, a master's degree in Urban Affairs from the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs, and a J.D. degree from Cleveland State University. Early career Jackson entered politics with the influence of former Cleveland Councilman Lonnie L. Burten. He passed the Ohio bar exam and started his legal career as an assistant city prosecutor. In 1989, Jackson won a seat on the Cleveland City Council for Ward 5. As Councilman, Jackson spearheaded efforts to bring in approximately a half billion dollars of community investments, working to clean up and stabilize his ward. He fought for the redevelopment of Arbor Park Place, the construction of the only Home Ownership Zone in the city, and worked with the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) as it began to rebuild its estates. Jackson became an active critic of then-Mayor Michael R. White, who had vowed in his campaign to clean up neighborhoods but had instead dedicated the bulk of his tenure to downtown development. Jackson's progress in Ward 5 aided his election to Council President in 2001, succeeding Michael D. Polensek.Jackson administration - Case Western Reserve University 2005 Cleveland mayoral election Mayor Jackson gives his inaugural address. As Council President, Jackson became increasingly frustrated with the leadership of Mayor Jane L. Campbell. As the 2005 mayoral election approached, Jackson announced his candidacy on April 7. He received endorsements from several notable Cleveland and Cuyahoga County politicians, including Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, County Auditor Frank Russo, County Treasurer Jim Rokakis, and most of his colleagues on City Council. In the October 4 mayoral primary, Jackson was the top vote-getter, ahead of the incumbent Campbell. Other candidates in the primary included former Cleveland Public Safety Director, James A. Draper; former mayor of Euclid, Ohio and businessman, David Lynch; former Cleveland Councilman Bill Patmon, and Municipal Court Judge Robert Triozzi, whom Jackson eventually asked to become his law director. In the November 8, 2005 general election, he was elected mayor with 55% of the vote, while Campbell received 45%. At 11:25 p.m. (EST), she conceded to Jackson. On January 2, 2006, Jackson was sworn in as Cleveland's 56th mayor at East Technical High School on the city's East Side. Among those in attendance were Congresswoman Tubbs Jones and Bishop Anthony Pilla of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. In his inaugural address, Jackson vowed to make Cleveland a city where we are \\"one people, one community, living and working together, with respect, justice and equality.\\" He promised improvements in the city's school system and better relations with Cleveland's neighboring suburbs. 2009 Cleveland mayoral election Frank Jackson in April 2009 announced his bid to run for another term. In the September 2009 primary Jackson garnered the most votes; in second place was former Cleveland City Council member Bill Patmon. On Election Day 2009, Jackson defeated Patmon by a large margin, with Jackson receiving 78% of the vote and Patmon receiving 22%. 2013 Cleveland mayoral election Jackson announced his intention to run for a third term on June 29, 2013. Since Jackson's bid for a third term drew only one challenger, there were no primary elections in the mayoral race. The sole challenger to Jackson was Cleveland businessman Kenneth Lanci. On Election Day 2013, Jackson defeated Lanci, with Jackson receiving 66% of the vote and Lanci receiving 34%. Upon completing his term, Jackson will become just the second Cleveland mayor, along with Michael R. White to serve three terms. 2017 Cleveland mayoral election On November 7, 2017, Jackson won his fourth term, beating councilman Zack Reed, who had finished second behind Jackson in the September nine-way primary election. This made Jackson the first ever four- term mayor in the city's history. As mayor Jackson at Cleveland's 2008 St. Patrick's Day Parade. On December 1, 2005, he announced that he would appoint the city's first point person for regional issues. On December 15, Jackson announced the appointment of his former opponent Triozzi as law director (under the city charter, the law director becomes mayor if the elected mayor is out of the city, resigns or becomes incapable of serving). From the former Campbell administration, Darnell Brown retained his position as the city's chief operating officer. Valarie J. McCall, who had previously served as Clerk of City Council, was appointed chief of government affairs. Shortly after his inauguration, Jackson began working with the Cleveland Police Department. He introduced a new use of force policy that clearly states what previous versions only implied: \\"Excessive force shall not be tolerated.\\" Jackson has restored the Cleveland Police Aviation Unit (helicopters) and the Cleveland Police Mounted Unit (horses). He is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of \\"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\\" The Coalition was co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. =Residency= On January 18, 2008, the Ohio House of Representatives passed a bill to eliminate residency rules passed by local voters. This included the amendment to the Cleveland municipal charter that restricted city workers from living outside the city, approved by voters in 1982. In response, Mayor Jackson and law director Robert Triozzi threatened to take the issue to court. Jackson contended that if the city's residency restrictions are overturned, Cleveland would suffer the ill effects of city workers fleeing the city, and its related effects on the economy and city safety. \\"This is about the issue of home rule\\", Jackson said at a City Hall news conference. \\"They are attempting to usurp our constitutional rights, and we are defending our rights\\". He threatened to fire any city worker who moved out of their district of employment. The Cleveland Fire Fighters Association Local 93 and four individual union members filed a complaint on January 30 with the 8th Ohio District Court of Appeals to block any actions that Jackson, Triozzi, or the city might take on the matter. On June 10, 2009, the Supreme Court of Ohio struck down the residency requirements of Cleveland and several dozen other Ohio communities in the case of Lima v. State of Ohio.

Somewhat torpedo-shaped, they are fatter than fresh corn tortillas and stuffed with cooked ground beans, cheese, fava beans, chicharron or other ingredients and fried or toasted. Tlacoyos can be served as an accompaniment to soups and stews or as appetizers for celebrations. Most traditional tlacoyos do not have lard or salt in the masa, and if not eaten soon after they are cooked, they become very tough and dry, even if reheated. In Mexican markets, vendors keep their tlacoyos warm by putting them in a covered basket, with the additional effect that the steam keeps them moist for a longer time.

However, the traditional tlacoyo is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it except for fresh salsa. This is the form in which they are typically found in the streets.

The most common is blue masa, made from blue corn kernels. File:Tlacoyo.jpgblue corn meal tlacoyo File:Tlacoyera.jpgWoman preparing tlacoyos over the sidewalk in Colonia Condesa in Mexico City.

A new model was introduced in 2004, followed by a facelift in 2010 and another new model in 2013. The latest version is available in gross vehicle weights of 6.5 to 16 metric tonnes (t) and is powered by a straight 4- or 6-cylinder engine. Atego 1 (1998-2004) The first generation Atego debuted in 1998. It was intended as a successor to the LK model range. At the time of its launch, the Atego offered a total of 25 different basic types and 240 model variants. Around 170,000 units were produced until 2004. The truck won the International Truck of the Year award in 1999 which would later be supplemented with another win by the Atego 2 in 2011. In 2000, a new 240-kW (326-hp) top-of-the-range version of the heavy Atego chassis was brought onto the market. In 2001, the new Axor model series emerged from the heavy-duty Atego weight class with gross vehicle weights of 18 to 40 tonnes. The Axor combined the heavy chassis of the Actros with the long Atego cab. Atego 2 (2004-2013) The second generation Atego debuted in 2004 at the International Commercial Vehicle Show. The front section was redesigned, with new H7 clear-glass headlamps, high-set white-glass indicators, wind deflectors and new exterior mirrors. The interior of the four different cab variants was also completely redesigned, with the cockpit more grouped around the driver and a new climate control system which was more similar to the heavy-duty Actros models. A new nine-speed transmission replaced the previous twelve-speed transmission. The new Telligent automated gearshift was also introduced as an optional extra up to 175 kW (238 hp) along with a roll-back lock built into the Telligent brake system. Soon after launch, the Atego was linked to the Fleetboard telematics system. In 2005, a 12-ton payload-optimised model was introduced, which had a low chassis, 17.5-inch tyres and a new 160 kW (218 hp) four-cylinder engine. Also in the same year, Atego models over 18 t were renamed Mercedes-Benz Axor. In 2006, dump truck versions of the Atego were fitted with high-performance disc brake technology on all axles. The 250,000th Antego was delivered in June 2008. From March 2010 the entire Mercedes-Benz Atego series was made available with EEV (Enhanced Environmentally Friendly Vehicle) compliant engine versions. The second generation Atego was initially available with three basic engine variants. The 4,250 cc inline-four OM 904 LA with power, torque, 1:17.75 compression ratio and Unit-Pump System (UPS) technology single-nozzle fuel- injection pumps. The 6,374 cc inline-six OM 906 LA with power and torque or power and torque. Both variants with Unit-Pump System technology with single- plunger fuel-injection pumps and centrally arranged 6-hole injection nozzles. There were five different gearboxes available for the Atego. Firstly, the G56, G60 and G85 all-synchromesh manual gearboxes with six forward gears and one reverse gear. They were available with engine-mounted linkage gearshift (G56 and G60), hydraulic gearshift (G85) or Telligent automated gearshift. The G131-9 was a direct-drive gearbox with eight synchronised forward gears, one constant-mesh crawler gear and one reverse gear. It consisted of a 4-speed basic gearbox with pneumatic rear-mounted range unit. Gears were shifted hydropneumatically. Last but not least was the Allison 3000P electronically controlled automatic gearbox. It featured five forward gears and one reverse gear. The chassis was available in wheelbase lengths between 3,260 mm and 5,360 mm at standard spacing of 300 mm. The frame rails featured a continuous hole spacing of 50 mm. Frame components were made of cold-formed E 380 TM and E 500 TM high-strength steel. It consisted of a two-piece modular frame with two symmetrical Z-profile members on front end and straight, untapered, U-shaped longitudinal flange at the rear which were interconnected by means of riveted gusset plates. The front suspension had parabolic leaf springs and for the rear there was a choice of leaf springs or air-suspension with Telligent level control. Steering was power assisted, recirculating ball with variable steering gear ratio. =Facelift (2010-2013)= The new facelifted Atego appeared in 2010. The design of the front section was given more resemblance to the current Actros. With regards to the interior, a multifunction steering wheel was made standard on all versions of the Atego, the instrument cluster was redesigned and seats received new fabrics. There were three BlueTec Euro V standards compliant engines to choose from, with power output ranging from to . The new model could also be fitted with a new permanent magnet retarder with up to 180 kW braking power (maximum torque 650 Nm) to help reduce brake and tyre wear on demanding roads. =Atego BlueTec Hybrid= The Atego BlueTec Hybrid was premiered in November 2007 at the opening event of the \\"Shaping Future Transportation\\" initiative in Stuttgart. Daimler developed it together with Eaton, who supplied the hybrid system which included the lithium-ion battery pack and electric motor and helped develop the power management logic and controls. The first five prototype vehicles were deployed by DHL to conduct tests and the first 50 vehicles were sold at the end of 2009. Series production was scheduled to start in 2010. The initial hybrid truck was based on the 12-ton Atego 1222 L EEV and featured a 160-kW (218-hp) OM 924 LA turbodiesel engine and a 44-kW water-cooled AC permanent magnet electric motor. The engine also featured a start/stop system. It used a G85-6 automatic transmission. The electric motor was located behind the internal combustion engine and clutch, but in front of the transmission. Electrical energy was stored in lithium-ion batteries, which was fed via the electric motor when braking and allowed moving off under electric power, but also helped optimise the diesel engine's characteristic map. Additional components included a converter, hybrid control system and cooling system. The additional weight compared to a regular Atego was around 350 kg. According to Daimler the Atego hybrid could achieve fuel savings of around 10 - 15 percent compared with an equivalent conventional diesel-powered vehicle. =Coaches= 007 Automet Apollo The chassis of the Atego is also used by Unvi to produce 27-41 seat coaches, designated Cimo, Voyger GT and Touring GT, which are custom built in Spain. Polish coach company Automet produced a 30-36 seat coach the Apollo based on the chassis. Also, the chilean bodybuilder LR bodied some midibuses on Atego 1016 chassis. Cab area and dashboard on the coach conversions are identical to those used in the Atego goods vehicles. Atego 3 (2013-present) The third generation Atego was introduced in 2013 with gross vehicle weight ranging from 6.5 t to 16 t. It was made available with seven new engines based on the inline four-cylinder OM 934 model with 5.1 l displacement and inline six-cylinder OM 936 model with 7.7 l displacement. Performance for the four new OM 934 engines range from to and for the three new OM 936 engines from to . The engines conform to the Euro VI emissions standard and feature common rail injection, cooled exhaust gas recirculation, an exhaust box with an integrated selective catalytic reduction system and closed particulate filter. The trucks are available with six or eight speed Mercedes PowerShift 3 automatic transmission and six or nine speed power- assisted manual transmissions. Electronic stability control is also available along with a permanent magnet retarder. Furthermore, it features a newly designed bumper with integrated daytime running lamps. Motorsport =Race truck= Race truck versions of the trucks are called Mercedes-Benz Race Truck. Built by LARAG in the Eastern Switzerland canton of St. Gallen. The race trucks have competed in the ADAC Truck Grand Prix and the NRW Truck Cup. Ludovic Faure won the FIA European Truck Racing Championship in 1998 using an Atego Renntruck. FIA ETRC vehicles develop 1200 hp and 5,600 Nm of torque. Minimum weight is 5400 kg, and the trucks have 6-speed ZF transmissions, with water-cooled disc brakes. This gives a similar power-to-weight ratio as a World Rally Car.typically 300 hp with 1350 kg =Rally Raid= In 2008, a Mercedes-Benz Atego 1725 race truck took a part in the Brazilian rally raid Rally dos Sert√µes. The vehicle won this rally in its class (T4.2, for trucks with full weight from 4801 to 5800 kg). This truck develops more than 400 hp and torque of 1800 Nm.

A member of the Liberal Democrats, she was previously an MP for the Labour Party and Change UK. She was also an Independent politician before joining the Liberal Democrats. Initially elected as a Labour MP, Smith was an early opponent to leader Jeremy Corbyn. In 2018 Smith lost a motion of no confidence by her constituency party. Smith resigned from the Labour Party in February 2019 alongside six other MPs in protest at Corbyn's leadership, and they formed The Independent Group (later renamed Change UK). In June 2019, she left Change UK to sit as an independent MP. In September she joined the Liberal Democrats. In the 2019 general election, she stood as a Liberal Democrat in Altrincham and Sale West, where she finished third. Early life and career before Parliament Smith was born on 16 August 1961 in Grimsby. She grew up in Grimsby, where her grandfather had been Mayor. She attended Waltham Leas Primary School (now The Leas Junior School) in Waltham and Tollbar Secondary School, in New Waltham, Lincolnshire. She joined the Labour Party at the age of 16 and worked for the NHS for five years, before taking A-levels on an evening course. She studied English at the University of Nottingham in September 1987. Smith began a PhD at Newnham College, Cambridge, but did not complete it. She was an English lecturer at Dearne Valley College in Wath upon Dearne from 1994 until 2003. She stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate for the Castle Ward of Cambridge City Council in May 1994. She was elected a Labour member of Sheffield City Council in 1996 for the ward of Broomhill, before winning in Birley ward in 2000 and 2004. She stood down in 2005 and the new Labour candidate won the by-election in May 2005. Parliamentary career At the 2005 general election, Smith was elected Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hillsborough. In 2007, she was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary and chief aide to Yvette Cooper. The Sheffield Hillsborough seat was abolished at the 2010 election, but Smith was elected as the MP for the newly created Penistone and Stocksbridge constituency. She was re-elected at the 2015 general election and 2017 general election. In 2016, Smith backed a vote of no confidence in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in events which led to a leadership election in which Corbyn was re-elected as leader with an increased majority. =Positions= After a period as opposition Whip, Smith was promoted to the front bench as the Shadow Deputy Leader of the House in October 2010. In Parliament, she is a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, and is a former member of the Administration Committee, the Procedure Committee, the Regulatory Reform Committee and Transport Committee. She is a trustee of the Industry and Parliament Trust, which works to promote an understanding of business amongst parliamentarians and policymakers. In 2013, she became a vice-president of the League Against Cruel Sports. Since February 2016, Smith has served as a member of the Advisory Board at Polar Research and Policy Initiative. She was a member of Labour Friends of Israel. =Campaigns= During her tenure Smith worked to reinstate the former Woodhead line between Hadfield and Penistone. Smith is one of 71 MPs who have signed a petition to re-open the trans-Pennine route, and she has on more than one occasion headed debates in Westminster on the need for more railway investment in the north. In July 2009, she introduced a symbolic Ten Minute Rule Bill to the House of Commons which, if accepted by government, would have changed the law to give people more legal protection against attacks by dogs. She worked with the RSPCA and the Communication Workers Union on the issue. It failed. Smith was voted Constituency MP of the year 2011‚Äì12, voted for by fellow MPs, honouring her campaign against the axing of an ¬£80 million loan to Sheffield Forgemasters. She followed this up by being awarded the League Against Cruel Sports' Parliamentarian of the Year in 2013 for her efforts against the trial badger cull, in which she worked with campaigner Brian May, as well as recognition for her wider campaign in protecting animals from cruelty. In 2018, Smith opposed Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell's policy of re-nationalising England and Wales's water networks, saying such plans were \\"an expensive indulgence in the politics of the past ... founded on the altar of ideology and constantly vulnerable to politicial interference\\". She has called for \\"rigorous reform\\" of Ofwat (England and Wales's water regulator). =Motion of no confidence= On 16 November 2018, her Constituency Labour Party passed a motion of no confidence in her on the grounds of her lack of support for the party leadership, her support for fracking and her opposition to water re- nationalisation. Smith tweeted that her \\"first priority is always to do my job, to the best of my ability\\" and that her defeat was as a result of \\"a cabal of hard left members\\" who had \\"absorbed everyone‚Äôs precious time and energy on an inaccurate and divisive motion of no confidence\\". =Expenses= Smith was one of 98 MPs who voted unsuccessfully to keep their expense details secret in 2007. She defended her vote on the grounds that it would help member-constituent confidentiality and help prevent the private addresses of MPs being readily available to the public. In 2009, Smith was one of the MPs whose expenses were highlighted by The Daily Telegraph during the Parliamentary expenses scandal, as she had submitted expenses claims for four beds for a one-bedroom flat in London. Smith employed her husband as her Senior Parliamentary Assistant on a salary of up to ¬£40,000. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media on the grounds that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective. =The Independent Group and The Independents= On 18 February 2019, Smith and six other MPs (Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker, and Ann Coffey) resigned the Labour whip to sit as The Independent Group of MPs in the House of Commons. These resignations were prompted by issues with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party, including allegations of the mishandling of antisemitism and his approach to Brexit. In June 2019, she left this group to sit as an independent MP. In 2019, Smith attracted condemnation when, shortly after citing antisemitism as one of her reasons for leaving Labour at the Independent Group launch earlier that day, she appeared on BBC Two's Politics Live where she referred to fighting racism as \\"not just about being black or a funny tin...\\" before hesitating and then finishing the sentence with \\"from the BME community\\": the unfinished word was widely taken to have been 'tinge'. She later issued a video statement in which she said she \\"misspoke very badly\\". Smith later told Sky News that she had been \\"very, very tired\\". In July 2019, Smith was a founding member of a grouping of MPs called The Independents. =Liberal Democrats= On 8 September 2019, it was announced that Smith had joined the Liberal Democrats. In the 2019 general election, she stood as a Liberal Democrat in Altrincham and Sale West, where she was placed third, with 11% of the vote. In anticipation of her defeat, she complained in advance of the election she was being discriminated against because she would not receive the MP's LOOP (double redundancy payment) as a consequence of changing constituencies. Post-parliamentary career In July 2020, Smith joined the board of Portsmouth Water as an independent non-executive director. She had previously voiced opposition to nationalising England's water industry. Personal life and family In 2005, Smith married Steve Wilson, a Sheffield city councillor. She is a Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season ticket holder, a Rolling Stones fan, and a keen walker.

BC Transit is headquartered in Victoria, British Columbia. BC Transit is the successor to the British Columbia Electric Railway, which started in 1897 and in 1961 became a division of BC Hydro. In 1979, the province separated the transit authority into a separate agency called the Urban Transit Authority which was later restructured into BC Transit in 1983. BC Transit carries out overall planning and delivery for all of the different municipal transit systems in British Columbia. In 1999, responsibility for the management of transportation in Greater Vancouver, including public transit, was taken over by the newly formed TransLink. In the future, TransLink's jurisdiction is planned to expand into adjacent regions east and north of Greater Vancouver. (see TransLink 2007 reorganization) History The logo of the UTA, the predecessor of BC Transit. Pre-2000 logo The BC Electric Railway was incorporated in 1897 to take over the property and business of the Consolidated Railway Company. The Consolidated Railway Company had been formed the previous year, taking over ten other companies engaged in electric light systems or tramways in Vancouver, Victoria and New Westminster. Slowly the streetcars and interurban trams were converted to trolley and gas-powered buses. The province formed the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority in 1962, bringing the transit systems under BC Hydro.leftIn 1979 the province's Livable Region Plan led to the transfer of transit responsibilities to three agencies: the Greater Vancouver Regional District was to be responsible for transit policy and planning; the Urban Transit Authority, to represent provincial government interests in public transit; and the Metro Transit Operating Company, a separate crown corporation that took over operations from BC Hydro. The new structure was meant to provide local governments with more decision-making power and funding of their local systems. BC Transit was created when, in 1982, the province merged the UTA and MTOC. The GVRD no longer had a role, and regional transit commissions were created in Vancouver and Victoria. The new regional commissions were tasked with approving local tariffs, planning, and some funding. In 1999, the responsibility for the transit system in Greater Vancouver was reassigned to TransLink, which had been founded a year earlier. The rest of BC remains under BC Transit. In 2018, BC Transit began the operation of its first dedicated intercity buses in Northern British Columbia after Greyhound Canada ended all services in Western Canada. This was in the form of BC Bus North. In 2019, to address rising concerns of driver safety, the installation of driver safety doors on all buses began. The first bus with this modification was in Victoria. In 2020, during the coronavirus outbreak, BC Transit went to a province-wide free-fare operation and required boarding through the rear door of buses with multiple doors. This lasted just over two months, with fares and front-door boarding resuming on in June of the same year. Transit systems BC Hydro markings on a 1964 GMC busThe Victoria Regional Transit System, in the provincial capital of Victoria, is the only system operated by BC Transit itself. Beyond Victoria, there are regional transit systems. In four locations (Nanaimo, Nelson, Powell River, and the Sunshine Coast) the municipality operates the service, while private operators are contracted to deliver the transit services elsewhere. =Regional transit systems= =Future systems= The Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District announced in 2017 that it was studying the feasibility of public transit connecting Tofino and Ucluelet. Feasibility studies concluded in November 2019, with approval from the ACRD provided in late December 2019. BC Transit began their first tests of the routes in February 2020. =HandyDART= HandyDART is an accessible transit service in British Columbia that uses vans or small buses to transport disabled or elderly passengers who cannot use the normal transit system. This service provides door-to-door service and is available in all of the province's larger centres, as well as in many smaller communities.

It is usually considered to stretch from 145 Ma to 100.5 Ma. Geology Proposals for the exact age of the Barremian-Aptian boundary ranged from 126 to 117 Ma until recently (as of 2019), but based on drillholes in Svalbard the defining early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a) was carbon isotope dated to 123.1¬±0.3 Ma, limiting the possible range for the boundary to c. 121‚Äì122 Ma. There is a possible link between this anoxic event and a series of Early Cretaceous large igneous provinces (LIP). The Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi large igneous province, emplaced in the South Pacific at c. 120 Ma, is by far the largest LIP in earth's history. The Ontong Java Plateau today covers an area of 1,860,000 km¬≤. In the Indian Ocean another LIP began to form at c. 120 Ma, the Kerguelen Plateau-Broken Ridge together covering 2,300,000 km¬≤. Another LIP on the Liaodong Peninsula, China, 131‚Äì117 Ma lasted for 10 million years. It was the result of the subduction of the Kula and Pacific plates, which was probably caused by a superplume. During the opening of the South Atlantic the Paran√°‚ÄìEtendeka LIP produced 1.5 million km¬≥ of basalts and rhyolites per year beginning 133 Ma and lasting for a million years. The opening of the Central Atlantic continued as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge spread north to separate the Iberian Peninsula from the banks of Newfoundland and connect to the Canada Basin in the Arctic Ocean. With the opening of the Labrador Sea Greenland became a separate tectonic plate and Laurentia became North America. The Proto-Caribbean Sea continued to grow and the Paran√°- Etendeka LIP began to break Africa into three pieces. The Falkland Plateau broke-up from southern Africa at 132 Ma and Madagascar ceased to move independently c. 120 Ma. In the Panthalassic Ocean the Pacific Plate continued to grow; the Arctic Alaska-Chukotka terrane formed the Bering Strait. Continued rifting opened new basins in the Indian Ocean, separating India, Antarctica, and Australia. By 110 Ma the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reached south into the Proto-Caribbean and South Atlantic, effectively separating South America from Africa, and continued rifting in the northern end completed the longitudinal extent of the Atlantic. In Panthalassa the Ontong-Java Mega-LIP resulted in the formation of new tectonic plates and in the Indian Ocean the Kerguelen LIP began to push India northward. Evolution During this time many new types of dinosaur appeared or came into prominence, including ceratopsians, spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurids and coelurosaurs, while survivors from the Late Jurassic continued to persist. Angiosperms (flowering plants) appeared for the first time during the Early Cretaceous; Archaefructaceae, one of the oldest fossil families (124.6 Ma) was found in the Yixian Formation, China. This time also saw the evolution of the first members of the Neornithes (modern birds). Sinodelphys, a 125 Ma-old boreosphenidan mammal found in the Yixian Formation, China, is one of the oldest mammal fossils found. The fossil location indicates early mammals began to diversify from Asia during the Early Cretaceous. Sinodelphys was more closely related to metatherians (marsupials) than eutherians (placentals) and had feet adapted from climbing trees. Steropodon is the oldest monotreme (egg- lying mammal) discovered. It lived in Gondwana (now Australia) at 105 Ma.

The next day, Wellesley drove Soult from Porto in the Second Battle of Porto.

It was originally bred on the fell farms of northwest England, and is used as a riding and driving pony. The breed is closely related to its geographic neighbour, the Dales Pony, but is a little smaller and more pony-like in build. The Fell Pony is noted for hardiness, agility, strength, and sure-footedness. Breed characteristics Fell Ponies vary a good deal in weight and size, so ponies may be found to carry almost any rider. The average height of the breed is , and the upper height limit for the breed is . The breed was bred for the unforgiving mountainous environment of Cumbria in north-west England, so they are adaptable to almost any temperate climate. The colours accepted in the breed are black, brown, bay, grey. Chestnuts, piebalds, and skewbalds are not allowed. A star on the head and/or a small amount of white on or below the hind fetlock is acceptable. However, excess white markings are discouraged. The Fell Pony should be hardy and show good pony characteristics, including strong, flat bone. It should exhibit intelligence and self-preservation considered common to British mountain and moorland pony breeds, and at the same time, have a lively and alert attitude. The breed generally has a steady temperament. The Fell Pony has the regular gaits, noted for correct movement and is considered sure- footed in rough terrain. Fell Ponies are reliable jumpers and agile, which makes them useful for cross-country riding or hunting. Most animals of the breed lack the scope to make top-class jumping ponies, but Fells generally are well up to local show or Pony Club event standards. Breed history Modern Fell Pony The Fell Pony shares its origins with the now-extinct Galloway Pony, which was also the root of the Dales Pony. It is believed to have originated on the border between England and Scotland, quite probably antedating Roman times. The Fell Pony Society makes no claims about any input from imported Roman war stallions being crossed with these ponies. In the early stud books, 50% of ponies were brown in colour, though over the last few decades, black has become predominant, followed by brown, bay, and grey. They are primarily a working breed of pony with activity, stamina, hardiness, and intelligence that enables them to live and thrive in tough conditions out on the fells in the Lake District. =Use as packhorses= The Fell Pony was originally used as a packhorse, carrying slate and lead, copper, and iron ores. They were also used for light agriculture and the transportation of bulky farm goods such as wool. With their sturdy bodies, strong legs, and equable disposition, and being good, fast walkers, they would travel up to a week. They were favoured by the Vikings as packhorses, as well as for ploughing, riding, and pulling sledges. Their use as pack ponies continued into the 20th century, when they were also used in pack-pony trains and by postal services. Some Fells were famed in the north as fast trotters. Tales are told of distances covered at great speeds by these ponies. In recent times Fells at the present are being used for pleasure riding and competitive uses, pack-work, trekking, and shepherding. The Fell Pony can be seen in the horse show world, seen in in hand, under saddle, and working hunter pony classes. They also do well in driving and endurance riding.Newsletters of the Fell Pony Society, Autumn 2009 They are very suitable for riding and driving for persons with disabilities. A Fell Pony can be used as an all-round family pony. It is capable of carrying both children or adults, and versatile enough to fulfill a variety of jobs otherwise carried out by two or three more specialised animals. The rise of carriage driving as a recreational activity has provided the Fell a renewed job, which it traditionally performed for centuries. A few Fell Ponies are still used in Scotland carrying the stags and grouse panniers down from the moors. Some of the ponies of Queen Elizabeth II are sometimes used for this purpose at Balmoral, while others are used for both riding and driving by the royal family. Fell Ponies have recently been used to carry equipment into the hills for repair of footpaths in the Lake District and they are increasingly being used for British Dressage \\"Team Quest\\" competitions (FPS Magazine, Spring 2016, p61) Fell Pony Society The Fell Pony Committee resolved to become a society in 1916,The Fell Pony Society \\"to keep pure the old breed of pony that has roamed the northern hills for years\\". However, with the end of World War I, the resolution became reality. In 1922, the society restructured itself on \\"more liberal lines\\" to attract more members to the support of the Fell Pony.The Fell Pony Society in the 20th century at Fell Pony and Countryside Museums Nonetheless, the breed's numbers decreased considerably, until 1945, when a breeding \\"stallion enclosure\\" program and a grading-up system were started. The program was discontinued in 1970. In the affluent 1950s, riding for pleasure began to gain popularity, securing the future of many British native breeds. The number of ponies being registered with the Fell Pony Society has risen gradually. All Fell Ponies are registered through the society, with an annual stud book published each year. The society's patron is Queen Elizabeth II.

Localization may be effected by a number of technologies, such as using multilateration of radio signals between (several) cell towers of the network and the phone, or simply using GPS. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of mobile radio signals, it must emit at least the idle signal to contact nearby antenna towers, but the process does not require an active call. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is based on the phone's signal strength to nearby antenna masts. Mobile positioning may be used for location-based services that disclose the actual coordinates of a mobile phone. Telecommunication companies use this to approximate the location of a mobile phone, and thereby also its user.\\"Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards‚Äú, Shu Wang, Jungwon Min and Byung K. Yi, IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC) 2008, Beijing, China  Technology  The location of a mobile phone can be determined in a number of ways. =Network-based= The location of a mobile phone can be determined using the service provider's network infrastructure. The advantage of network- based techniques, from a service provider's point of view, is that they can be implemented non-intrusively without affecting handsets. Network-based techniques were developed many years prior to the widespread availability of GPS on handsets. (See for one of the first works relating to this.Mobile Positioning Using Wireless Networks) The technology of locating is based on measuring power levels and antenna patterns and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates wirelessly with one of the closest base stations, so knowledge of the location of the base station implies the cell phone is nearby. Advanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by interpolating signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in urban areas where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high. Rural and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely. GSM localization uses multilateration to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, or dedicated trackers, usually with the intent to locate the user. The accuracy of network-based techniques varies, with cell identification as the least accurate (due to differential signals transposing between towers, otherwise known as \\"bouncing signals\\") and triangulation as moderately accurate, and newer \\"advanced forward link trilateration\\" timing methods as the most accurate. The accuracy of network-based techniques is both dependent on the concentration of cell base stations, with urban environments achieving the highest possible accuracy because of the higher number of cell towers, and the implementation of the most current timing methods. One of the key challenges of network-based techniques is the requirement to work closely with the service provider, as it entails the installation of hardware and software within the operator's infrastructure. Frequently the compulsion associated with a legislative framework, such as Enhanced 9-1-1, is required before a service provider will deploy a solution. =Handset-based= The location of a mobile phone can be determined using client software installed on the handset.Handset-based mobile phone tracking app example 1: MobileTrack This technique determines the location of the handset by putting its location by cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with GPS then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier. Another approach is to use a fingerprinting-based technique, where the \\"signature\\" of the home and neighboring cells signal strengths at different points in the area of interest is recorded by war-driving and matched in real-time to determine the handset location. This is usually performed independent from the carrier. The key disadvantage of handset-based techniques, from service provider's point of view, is the necessity of installing software on the handset. It requires the active cooperation of the mobile subscriber as well as software that must be able to handle the different operating systems of the handsets. Typically, smartphones, such as one based on Symbian, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, BlackBerry OS, iOS, or Android, would be able to run such software, e.g. Google Maps. One proposed work-around is the installation of embedded hardware or software on the handset by the manufacturers, e.g., Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD). This avenue has not made significant headway, due to the difficulty of convincing different manufacturers to cooperate on a common mechanism and to address the cost issue. Another difficulty would be to address the issue of foreign handsets that are roaming in the network. =SIM- based= Using the subscriber identity module (SIM) in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) handsets, it is possible to obtain raw radio measurements from the handset.ETSI TS 102 223 V9.1.0 SIM standard Available measurements include the serving Cell ID, round-trip time, and signal strength. The type of information obtained via the SIM can differ from that which is available from the handset. For example, it may not be possible to obtain any raw measurements from the handset directly, yet still obtain measurements via the SIM. =Wi-Fi= Crowdsourced Wi-Fi data can also be used to identify a handset's location. The poor performance of the GPS-based methods in indoor environment and the increasing popularity of Wi-Fi have encouraged companies to design new and feasible methods to carry out Wi-Fi- based indoor positioning. Most smartphones combine Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and GLONASS, with Wi-Fi positioning systems. = Hybrid positioning system = Hybrid positioning systems use a combination of network-based and handset-based technologies for location determination. One example would be some modes of Assisted GPS, which can both use GPS and network information to compute the location. Both types of data are thus used by the telephone to make the location more accurate (i.e., A-GPS). Alternatively tracking with both systems can also occur by having the phone attain its GPS-location directly from the satellites, and then having the information sent via the network to the person that is trying to locate the telephone. Such systems include Google Maps, as well as, LTE's OTDOA and E-CellID. There are also hybrid positioning systems which combine several different location approaches to position mobile devices by Wi-Fi, WiMAX, GSM, LTE, IP addresses, and network environment data.  Operational purpose  In order to route calls to a phone, the cell towers listen for a signal sent from the phone and negotiate which tower is best able to communicate with the phone. As the phone changes location, the antenna towers monitor the signal, and the phone is \\"roamed\\" to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple antenna towers, a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and phase discrimination. Newer phones may also allow the tracking of the phone even when turned on and not active in a telephone call. This results from the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.  Consumer applications  A phone's location can be shared with friends and family, posted to a public website, recorded locally, or shared with other users of a smartphone app. The inclusion of GPS receivers on smartphones has made geographical apps nearly ubiquitous on these devices. Specific applications include: * GPS navigation and maps * Locator apps like Find My Friends * Dating apps like Grindr * Recording a journey, for example to show a hiking accomplishment * For quantified self purposes such as fitness tracking * GPS drawing In January 2019, the location of her iPhone as determined by her sister helped Boston police find kidnapping victim Olivia Ambrose.A common smartphone feature helped find missing woman  Privacy  Locating or positioning touches upon delicate privacy issues, since it enables someone to check where a person is without the person's consent. Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning. In 2012 Malte Spitz held a TED talk on the issue of mobile phone privacy in which he showcased his own stored data that he received from Deutsche Telekom after suing the company. He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of Germany's data retention at the time, saying, \\"This is six months of my life [...] You can see where I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing.\\" He partnered up with ZEIT Online and made his information publicly available in an interactive map which allows users to watch his entire movements during that time in fast-forward. Spitz concluded that technology consumers are the key to challenging privacy norms in today's society who \\"have to fight for self determination in the digital age.\\" =China= Chinese government has proposed using this technology to track commuting patterns of Beijing city residents. Aggregate presence of mobile phone users could be tracked in a privacy-preserving fashion.D. Quercia, Ilias Leontiadis, Liam McNamara, Cecilia Mascolo, Jon Crowcroft (2011). SpotME If You Can: Randomized Responses for Location Obfuscation on Mobile Phones. IEEE ICDCS =Europe= In Europe most countries have a constitutional guarantee on the secrecy of correspondence, and location data obtained from mobile phone networks is usually given the same protection as the communication itself. =United States= In the United States, there is a limited constitutional guarantee on the privacy of telecommunications through the Fourth Amendment. The use of location data is further limited by statutory, administrative, and case law. Police access of seven days of a citizen's location data is unquestionably enough to be a fourth amendment search requiring both probable cause and a warrant. In November 2017, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v.

Hinge and Bracket spent two years in the 1970s performing in London pubs and clubs. This included the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (a popular gay venue), and the Kensington restaurant AD8, owned by Desmond Morgan and April Ashley. Hinge and Bracket appeared in 1974 at the Edinburgh Festival. They toured for several years before appearing on the BBC Radio 4 series The Enchanting World of Hinge and Bracket, which ran from 1977 to 1979.

K≈çsa (and the M≈çri) requested aid from both Takeda Katsuyori (son of Shingen) and Uesugi Kenshin, as well as the Ikk≈ç armies of other provinces, to attack Nobunaga, relieving the siege. But neither Takeda nor Uesugi answered his call. When Nobunaga attacked the fortress with 3,000 troops, the monks answered with 15,000; Nobunaga then turned to attacking K≈çsa's allies, the Asakura, Uesugi, and Azai clans as well as other outposts of Ikk≈ç-ikki monks. The Abbot wrote a desperate letter to Ikko followers in Musashi and Sagami Provinces, asking them to stand fast, and to send supplies and reinforcements. The fortress' supplies were nearly exhausted, and their outposts were nearly all destroyed by 1580. Nobunaga ordered the Abbot to evacuate the fortress, and to leave Osaka. K≈çsa deliberated with his allies, particularly the M≈çri, and then left for Kii Province, hoping to raise reinforcements. He left his son in charge of the fortress, who surrendered after an Imperial Messenger arrived with an official request from the Emperor that he do so. The fortress mysteriously burned down after the monks left it. Despite this incredible defeat, K≈çsa remained devoted to the Ikko sect, and to the idea of regaining a central cathedral fortress for the sect. He began to enlist the help of Ikko sectarians to aid Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in order to gain Hideyoshi's favor. In 1583, K≈çsa sent Ikko warriors to harass Hideyoshi's enemy Shibata Katsuie, and in 1587 he sent messengers to Kyushu, asking Ikko leaders there to act as guides for Hideyoshi's army in Satsuma Province. In 1589, Hideyoshi granted K≈çsa his wish for a new Hongan-ji. The site was the shrine to the patriarch Shinran, in Kyoto; it was moved in 1591, and is now known as the Nishi Hongan-ji. In popular culture In fiction, K≈çsa usually appears with the name Honganji Kennyo. Kennyo appears as a non-playable character in Koei's video games Samurai Warriors, Kessen III and M≈çri Motonari: Chikai no Sanshi, and as a playable character in Capcom's Sengoku Basara 2, where he is depicted as an obese, greedy leader of a religious sect. Kennyo is also a character in Ik√©men Sengoku, a dating simulator otome game released by Cybird in 2015. SourcesGeorge Sansom. A History of Japan: 1334‚Äì1615.

A primary organizer of the Love Canal Homeowners Association, Lois Gibbs brought wide public attention to the environmental crisis in Love Canal. Her actions resulted in the evacuation of over 800 families. She founded the non-profit, Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste in 1981, to help train and support local activists with their environmental work. She continues to work with the organization, renamed the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice (CHEJ). Career job Gibbs's involvement in environmental causes began in 1978 when she discovered that her 5-year-old son's elementary school in Niagara Falls, New York was built on a toxic waste dump. The complete story was reported on and discovered by Niagara Gazette reporter Michael H. Brown as well as Calspan, a private research group who discovered the chemical leak at Love Canal. Subsequent investigation revealed that her entire neighborhood, Love Canal, had been built on top of this dump. With no prior experience in community activism, Gibbs organized her neighbors and formed the Love Canal Homeowners Association. Gibbs created a petition and reached out to the residents of her neighborhood by going door-to-door to gather support. Gibbs' efforts centered her role as a mother fighting to protect her children's health. She led her community in a battle against the local, state, and federal governments by presenting the signatures to the New York State Department of Health. After years of struggle, 833 families were eventually evacuated, and cleanup of Love Canal began. National press coverage made Lois Gibbs a household name. In addition, president Jimmy Carter mentioned Gibbs as the key grassroots leader in the Love Canal movement during 1980. Her efforts also led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund, which is used to locate and clean up toxic waste sites throughout the United States. In 1980, Gibbs formed the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, later renamed the Center for Health, Environment and Justice (CHEJ) in 1998, where she currently serves as Executive Director. CHEJ is a grassroots environmental crisis center that provides information, resources, technical assistance and training to community groups around the nation. CHEJ seeks to form strong local organizations in order to protect neighborhoods from exposure to hazardous wastes. Gibbs has authored several books about the Love Canal story and the effects of toxic waste. The earlier and most quoted is Love Canal. My story, written with Murray Levine and published in 1982. Her story was dramatized in the 1982 made-for-TV movie Lois Gibbs: the Love Canal Story, in which she was played by Marsha Mason.

This belief is held by individuals in a great number of places around the world, including Europe, China, Africa, and North and South America. In variations of this superstition, the donor rabbit must possess certain attributes, such as having been killed in a particular place, using a particular method, or by a person possessing particular attributes (e.g., by a cross-eyed man). It has been suggested by Benjamin Radford that the rabbit's foot could be connected to a European good luck charm called the Hand of Glory, a hand cut from a hanged man and then pickled. Humorist R. E. Shay is credited with the witticism, \\"Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit.\\"R.E. Shay quotation. In North American culture The belief in North American folklore may originate in the system of folk magic known as \\"hoodoo\\". A number of strictures attached to the charm are now observed mostly in the breach, namely that it must be the left hind foot of a rabbit which was shot or otherwise captured in a cemetery. Some sources tell that the rabbit must be taken by the full moon, and others specifying the new moon. Some say instead that the rabbit must be taken on a Friday, or a rainy Friday, or Friday the 13th. Some sources say that the rabbit should be shot with a silver bullet, while others say that the foot must be cut off while the rabbit is still alive.Ellis, Bill: Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture (University of Kentucky, 2004), The various rituals suggested by the sources, though they differ widely one from another, share a common element of the uncanny, and the reverse of what is considered good-omened and auspicious. A rabbit is an animal into which shapeshifting witches such as Isobel Gowdie claimed to be able to transform themselves. Witches were said to be active at the times of the full and new moons. The cover to \\"Rabbit Foot Blues\\", a blues song by Blind Lemon Jefferson, links the rabbit's foot tradition with the bones of the dead. These widely varying circumstances may share a common thread of suggestion that the true lucky rabbit's foot is actually cut from a shapeshifted witch. The suggestion that the rabbit's foot is a substitute for a part from a witch's body is corroborated by other folklore from hoodoo. Willie Dixon's song \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" mentions a \\"black cat bone\\" along with his mojo and his John the Conqueror: all are artifacts in hoodoo magic. Given the traditional association between black cats and witchcraft, a black cat bone is also potentially a substitute for a human bone from a witch. Hoodoo lore also uses graveyard dust, soil from a cemetery, for various magical purposes. Dust from a good person's grave keeps away evil; dust from a sinner's grave is used for more nefarious magic. The use of graveyard dust may also be a symbolic appropriation of the parts of a corpse as a relic, and a form of sympathetic magic. Rabbit's feet were also considered lucky because of their association with the dead body of a criminal. According to Newbell Niles Puckett, a 20th-century folklorist, ‚Äúthe more wicked the person who is dead, the more effective the charm associated with his remains.\\" Puckett observed that during the 1884 election campaign of Grover Cleveland, he was said to have received the foot of a rabbit that had been killed on the grave of Jesse James, the American outlaw. In any case, the rabbit's foot is dried out and preserved, and carried around by gamblers and other people who believe it will bring them luck. Rabbit's feet, either authentic or imitation, are frequently sold by curio shops and vending machines. Often, these rabbit's feet have been dyed various colors, and they are often turned into keychains. Few of these rabbit's feet carry any warranty concerning their provenance, or any evidence that the preparers have made any effort to comply with the rituals required by the original tradition. Some may be confected from fake fur and latex \\"bones\\". President Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography that he had been given a gold-mounted rabbit's foot by John L. Sullivan, as well as a penholder made by Bob Fitzsimmons out of a horseshoe. A 1905 anecdote also tells that Booker T. Washington and Baron Ladislaus Hengelmuller, the ambassador from Austria, got their overcoats confused when they were both in the White House to speak with President Roosevelt; the ambassador noticed that the coat he had taken was not his when he went to the pockets searching for his gloves, and instead found \\"the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit, killed in the dark of the moon.\\" Other newspaper stories reported the incident, but omitted the detail about the rabbit's foot. In addition to being mentioned in blues lyrics, the rabbit's foot is mentioned in the American folk song \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\", once popular in minstrel shows; one line goes: \\"And you've got a rabbit's foot To keep away de hoo-doo\\".

It came into effect in 1998 and by 2009 it had been ratified by 39 member states. History The Council of Europe first discussed according specific protection for national minorities in 1949, but it was not until 1990 that the Council of Europe made a firm commitment to protect these minority groups. Recommendation 1134 (1990) contained a list of principles which the Assembly considered necessary for this purpose. The Parliamentary Assembly did in the beginning call for adoption of a protocol to the ECHR.RECOMMENDATION 1201 (1993) The Framework was signed on February 1995 by 22 member States of the Council of Europe and became active in 1998. By mid-2005, 43 member states had signed and 39 ratified it.http://www.coe.int/en/web/minorities/etats-partie Aims and criticism The broad aims of the convention are to ensure that the signatory states respect the rights of national minorities, undertaking to combat discrimination, promote equality, preserve and develop the culture and identity of national minorities, guarantee certain freedoms in relation to access to the media, minority languages and education and encourage the participation of national minorities in public life. Article 25 of the Framework Convention binds the member states to submit a report to the Council of Europe containing \\"full information on the legislative and other measures taken to give effect to the principles set out in this framework Convention\\" (Council of Europe, 1994, 7). The convention has come under some criticism. First of all, not all member states of the Council of Europe have signed and ratified it. France and Turkey have done neither. Iceland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece have signed and have yet to ratify. Also, the provisions offer little new on already existing international treaties. Furthermore, they are hedged around with many phrases including 'as far as possible' (Art 10.2). The convention does not define \\"national minority\\" and several countries set their own definition of the term when they ratified the treaty. For example, the United Kingdom ratified the convention on the understanding that it would be applied with reference to \\"racial groups\\" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976.Hansard ‚Äì Andrew George ‚Äì March 2007 Since this excluded the Cornish people, this resulted in pressure, including from Cornwall Council, for the UK Government to recognise the Cornish as a national minority. In April 2014, it was announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, that the UK Government would recognise the Cornish as a national minority under the FCNM. Overall however, Phillips (2002) has argued that because the FCNM is flexible it has allowed such a great number of states to ratify it so quickly. Therefore, it should not be considered a failure, but a start. Many authors agree with this arguing that it needs to be implemented in 'good faith' with the political will to support commitment to minority rights.

Career Caldwell was drafted in the 12th round of the 1971 amateur draft by the San Diego Padres after graduating from North Carolina State University, where he played college baseball for the Wolfpack. He made his major league debut on September 4, 1971 against the Atlanta Braves. In October 1973, the Padres traded Caldwell to the San Francisco Giants for Willie McCovey and Bernie Williams. Caldwell was traded again in 1976, this time to the St. Louis Cardinals with John D'Acquisto and Dave Rader for Willie Crawford, Vic Harris and John Curtis. Before the start of the 1977 season, Caldwell was traded for the third time, going to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Darcy. After just 14 games, the Reds traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor leaguers Dick O'Keefe and Garry Pyka. Caldwell had his best season in 1978 when he went 22‚Äì9 with a 2.36 ERA and led the AL in complete games with 23. Caldwell was named the AL Comeback Player of the Year by The Sporting News and finished second in the Cy Young Award balloting to Ron Guidry. Caldwell finished in double figures in victories for six consecutive seasons for the Brewers (1978‚Äì1983) and won two games in the 1982 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals in a losing effort. Caldwell was given his unconditional release by the Brewers organization in 1985. Caldwell, as of 2019, is still the Brewers' all-time leader in wins by a left-handed pitcher, with 102. In 1978, he was one of the three left-handed pitchers named \\"Mike\\" (the others being Mike Flanagan and Mike Willis) to hand the New York Yankees' Ron Guidry a loss in his 25‚Äì3 season. He and the Brewers shut out the New York Yankees and Guidry 6‚Äì0 on July 7, . During his prime years in Milwaukee, Caldwell was known as a \\"Yankee killer\\", and proved to be very successful against them. From 1977 to 1982, Caldwell was 12-5 with a 2.66 ERA against the Yankees.

Weber became a historian because of his interest in politics, an interest dating back to at least the age of 12. He described his political awakening as a realization of social injustices: \\"It was my vague dissatisfaction with social hierarchy, the subjection of servants and peasants, the diffuse violence of everyday life in relatively peaceful country amongst apparently gentle folk\\".Weber, My France, p.2 Weber's books and articles have been translated into several languages. He earned many accolades for his scholarship, including membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies and the Fulbright Program. His 1,300-page Modern History of Europe: Men, Cultures, and Societies from the Renaissance to the Present (1971) was described \\"a phenomenal job of synthesis and interpretation that reflects Eugen's wide and deep learning,\\" by his UCLA history colleague Hans Rogger.UCLA, In Memoriam In addition to his distinguished American Awards and honors, he was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques in 1977 for his contribution to French culture. Career He was born in Bucharest, Romania, the son of Sonia and Emmanuel Weber, a well-to-do industrialist. When he was ten, his parents hired a private tutor. But the tutor did not stay long. From the age of 10 Weber was already reading The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas, adventure novels by Karl May, poetry by Victor Hugo and Homer. He was also reading George Sand, Jules Verne and \\"every cheap paperback I could afford\\". At age 12, he was sent to boarding school in Herne Bay, in south- eastern England, and later to Ashville College, Harrogate.Burns (1999) During World War II, he served with the British Army in Belgium, Germany and India between 1943 and 1947 rising to the rank of captain. Afterward, Weber studied history at the Sorbonne and Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) in Paris. In 1950, Weber married Jacqueline Brument-Roth. He graduated with a BA in 1950 and an MA from the University of Cambridge in 1954. He then taught at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1953‚Äì1954) and the University of Alberta (1954‚Äì1955) before settling in the United States, where he taught first at the University of Iowa (1955‚Äì1956) and then, until 1993 on his retirement, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).Quinn, 2009 At Cambridge University, Eugen Weber studied with the historian David Thomson. He studied for his PhD but the dissertation was refused because the outside examiner, Alfred Cobban, of the University of London, gave a negative review of his dissertation, saying it lacked sufficient archival sources. Eugen Weber wrote a column titled \\"LA Confidential\\" for the Los Angeles Times.https://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/20/local/me-weber20 He also wrote for several French popular newspapers and, in 1989, presented an American public television series, The Western Tradition, which consisted of fifty-two lectures of 30 minutes each. He died in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, aged 82. Methodology Weber took a pragmatic approach to history. He once observed: > Nothing is more concrete than history, nothing less interested in theories > or in abstract ideas. The great historians have fewer ideas about history > than amateurs do; they merely have a way of ordering their facts to tell > their story. It isn‚Äôt theories they look for, but information, documents, > and ideas about how to find and handle them.Eugen Weber, \\"History Is What > Historians Do,\\" The New York Times, July 22, 1984 Impact Weber is associated with several important academic arguments. His book: Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1870‚Äì1914 is a classic presentation of modernization theory. Although other historians such as Henri Mendras had put forward similar theories about the modernization of the French countryside, Weber's book was amongst the first to focus on changes in the period between 1870 and 1914. Weber emphasizes that well into the 19th century few French citizens regularly spoke French, but rather regional languages or dialects such as Breton, Gascon, Basque, Catalan, Flemish, Alsatian, and Corsican. Even in French-speaking areas provincial loyalties often transcended the putative bond of the nation. Between 1870 and 1914, Weber argued, a number of new forces penetrated the previously isolated countryside. These included the judicial and school systems, the army, the church, railways, roads, and a market economy. The result was the wholesale transformation of the population from \\"peasants,\\" basically ignorant of the wider nation, to Frenchmen. His book Apocalypses: Prophecies, Cults, and Millennial Beliefs through the Ages chronicles \\"apocalyptic visions and prophecies from Zarathustra to yesterday ... . beginning with the ancients of the West and the Orient and, especially ... the Jews and earliest Christians,\\" finding that \\"an absolute belief in the end of time, when good would do final battle with evil, was omnipresent,\\" inspiring \\"Crusades, scientific discoveries, works of art, voyages such as those of Columbus, rebellions\\" and reforms including American abolitionism.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674003958 Weber proclaimed in \\"The Western Tradition\\" lectures of 1989: \\"...here we are at the end of the 20th century with a lot of people lonely in a Godless world‚Äîand now they are denied not only God but the solid substance of judgment and perception\\". \\"The world has always been disgracefully managed but now you no longer know to whom to complain.\\" After he traversed the whole spectrum of western thought, tradition, civilization, and progress in The Western Tradition, Weber pointed at some of the profound ancient lessons from the Bible and laments the fact that many people today do not read it themselves. As an agnostic, Weber viewed the Bible primarily as an important piece of historical literature, calling it: \\"the epitome of wisdom, violence, high aspiration, and the hurtful achievements of mankind\\". He concluded his final lecture in the Western Tradition series by praising Western man as Promethean and then with Wordsworth's poetic phrase, \\"we feel that we are greater than we know.\\" A 2010 biography by Stanford Franklin, \\"Eugen Weber The Greatest Historian of our Times: Lessons of Greatness to the Future\\", presents Weber's life and works in grandiose terms as the greatest modern historian.

Career Having graduated from college with an OND in electronic principles, Parsons started her career working in the television industry, where she was a sound engineer and later a vision mixer. She was a DJ on the pirate soul station JFM before moving to a Saturday night pop music programme at County Sound in Guildford.KISS FM: From Radical Radio To Big Business By Grant Goddard. In radio, she joined London's Capital London in 1987 as a weeknight presenter, before moving to BBC Radio 1 in 1991. Initially she was an overnight presenter, but later hosted other shows, and during her time with the network she became the last person to interview the comedian Peter Cook. After leaving Radio 1, she joined Virgin Radio in 1996, spending two years as a presenter there. In 1998, Parsons joined BBC Radio 2, taking over the Friday and Saturday overnight slot, where she remained as a full-time presenter until 2003. She was also briefly a presenter of the weekday late show during 1999 whilst fellow DJ Richard Allinson covered the drivetime slot. In 2001, Parsons' show received two hours of phone calls after rival Virgin Radio DJ Jon Holmes requested that his listeners call Parsons to request John Denver's Annie's Song be played. From 2003 she was a stand-in presenter on the network. She had her own early Sunday morning show on Radio 2 from January to April 2010, and later that year stood in for Sarah Kennedy after Kennedy was absent from her Dawn Patrol programme.

Located in the north of the country, it is Botswana's third largest park, after Central Kalahari Game Reserve and Gemsbok National Park, and has one of the greatest concentrations of game in all of Africa. This park is noted for having a population of lions which prey on elephants, mostly calves or juveniles, but even subadults.  History  The original inhabitants of this area were the San bushmen (also known as the Basarwa people in Botswana). They were nomadic hunter-gatherers who were constantly moving from place to place to find food sources, namely fruits, water and wild animals. Nowadays one can find San paintings inside rocky hills of the park. At the beginning of the 20th century, the region that would become Botswana was divided into different land tenure systems. At that time, a major part of the park's area was classified as crown land. The idea of a national park to protect the varied wildlife found here as well as promote tourism first appeared in 1931. The following year, around Chobe district were officially declared non-hunting area; this area was expanded to two years later. In 1943, heavy tsetse infestations occurred throughout the region, delaying the creation of the national park. By 1953, the project received governmental attention again: were suggested to become a game reserve. Chobe Game Reserve was officially created in 1960, though smaller than initially desired. In 1967, the reserve was declared a national park. At that time there were several industrial settlements in the region, especially at Serondela, where the timber industry proliferated. These settlements were gradually moved out of the park, and it was not until 1975 that the whole protected area was exempt from human activity. Nowadays traces of the prior timber industry are still visible at Serondela. Minor expansions of the park took place in 1980 and 1987.  Geography and ecosystems  The park can be divided up to 4 areas, each corresponding to one distinct ecosystem: * The Serondela area (or Chobe riverfront), situated in the extreme Northeast of the park, has as its main geographical features lush floodplains and dense woodland of mahogany, teak and other hardwoods now largely reduced by heavy elephant pressure. The Chobe River, which flows along the Northeast border of the park, is a major watering spot, especially in the dry season (May through October) for large breeding herds of elephants, as well as families of giraffe, sable and cape Cape buffalo. The flood plains are the only place in Botswana where the puku antelope can be seen. Birding is also available. Large numbers of carmine bee eaters are spotted in season. When in flood spoonbills, ibis, various species of storks, ducks and other waterfowl flock to the area. This is likely Chobe's most visited section, in large part because of its proximity to the Victoria Falls. The town of Kasane, situated just downstream, is the most important town of the region and serves as the northern entrance to the park. * The Savuti Marsh area, large, constitutes the western stretch of the park ( north of Mababe Gate). The Savuti Marsh is the relic of a large inland lake whose water supply was cut a long time ago by tectonic movements. Nowadays the marsh is fed by the erratic Savuti Channel, which dries up for long periods then curiously flows again, a consequence of tectonic activity in the area. It is currently flowing again and in January 2010 reached Savuti Marsh for the first time since 1982. As a result of this variable flow, there are hundred of dead trees along the channel's bank. The region is also covered with extensive savannahs and rolling grasslands, which makes wildlife particularly dynamic in this section of the park. During dry seasons, tourists going on a safari often sight rhinoceros (both black and white), warthog, kudu, impala, zebra, wildebeest and a herd of elephants. During rain seasons, the rich birdlife of the park, 450 species in the whole park, is well represented. Prides of lions, hyenas, zebras or more rarely cheetahs are sighted as well. This region is reputed for its annual migration of zebras and predators. * The Linyanti Marsh, located at the northwest corner of the park and to the north of Savuti, is adjacent to the Linyanti River. To the west of this area lies Selinda Reserve and on the northern bank of Kwando River is Namibia's Nkasa Rupara National Park. Around these two rivers are riverine woodlands, open woodlands as well as lagoons, and the rest of the region mainly consists of flood plains. There are large concentrations of lion prides, leopard, African wild dog, roan antelope, sable antelope, a hippopotamus pod and herds of African bush elephant. The rarer red lechwe, sitatunga and a bask of Nile crocodiles also occur in the area. Bird diversity is rich. * Between Linyanti and Savuti Marshes lies a hot and dry hinterland, mainly occupied by the Nogatsaa grass woodland. This section is little known and is a great place for spotting elands.

Elephant concentration  A baby African bush elephant on the banks of the Chobe River The park is widely known for its large elephant population, estimated to be around 50,000. Elephants living here are Kalahari elephants, the largest in size of all known elephant populations. They are characterized by rather brittle ivory and short tusks, perhaps due to calcium deficiency in the soils. Damage caused by the high numbers of elephants is rife in some areas. In fact, concentration is so high throughout Chobe that culls have been considered, but are too controversial and have thus far been rejected. At dry season, these elephants sojourn in Chobe River and the Linyanti River areas. In the rainy season, they make a 200-kilometre migration to the south-eastern stretch of the park. Their distribution zone however outreaches the park and spreads to north-western Zimbabwe.  Roads  Road conditions in Chobe National Park depend greatly on the season and rainfall and one would need a 4x4 vehicle to travel in the Park. Thick sand becomes a problem in the Chobe River Front during the dry months, particularly as the temperature rises and during the wet season the roads near the river become muddy. = Savuti = Savuti roads, mainly the western Sandridge Road from Mababe Gate and the roads both north and south of the Savuti channel are typically thick sand and tricky to drive. When rain has fallen, driving along the marsh roads, as the wet black cotton soil becomes unnavigable, carries the risk of getting stuck. = Nogatsaa = Nogatsaa roads are waterlogged during the wet months and very little of the road network can be driven at this time. During the dry months, game drives from one pan to the next are on roads with small, thick sandy patches. Once leaving the tar road from Kasane, people would have to drive through thick sand for the first , before reaching a sand road.

It is located north of Spring Garden Street, east of 40th Street, south of Mantua Avenue, and west of 31st Street. The neighborhood's northern and western reaches are predominantly working-class and African American, although its southern border with Powelton Village has seen recent gentrification and an influx of Drexel University and University of Pennsylvania student renters. The location of Mantua according to Google Maps. History =1600s= Part of this neighborhood was purchased from the Lenni Lenape Indians in 1677 by William Warner. In 1692, a young Welsh carpenter, William Powel, opened a ferry over the Schuylkill River at the foot of the present Spring Garden Bridge. Lancaster Pike and Haverford Road were the first routes providing access from the west. =1800s= Mantua was named in 1809 by Judge Richard Peters, who designed a grid of lots with 36th St. and Haverford Ave. as the center. He named the area for a city in Italy. Powelton Village, the neighborhood just south of Mantua, was named for the family of William Powell, whose son purchased additional land. By the mid-1880s, Powelton Village was a fashionable area, becoming part of Philadelphia after the Consolidation Act of 1854. =1940s-1950s= Prior to the 1940s, Mantua was a predominantly white, Lutheran neighborhood. However, these decades mark the time when black families began moving into the area‚Äôs boundaries. The 1950s are what is seen as the peak of the neighborhood, which boasted a stunning commercial district on Haverford Avenue. =1960s= Beginning in the early- to mid-1960s, the 19,000 neighborhood residents started seeing the beginnings of gang warfare. Despite the prevalence of crime and violence on the streets, community activists like Herman Wrice and Andrew Jenkins came together to form the Young Great Society and the Mantua Community Planners. These committees held community functions almost daily. Functions included arts and crafts, vocal groups, day trips, and tutoring sessions. As Police Commissioner, Frank Rizzo gave Mantua community leaders access to local police stations. If a local kid was arrested due to gang-related activities, community leaders would post bail and safely escort these residents home. In return, these activists would work with police to help deter kids from future participation in street life. Although these committees were ultimately trying to keep young residents off the streets, Mantua was one of the most crime-laden neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Over the course of the decade, six major gangs called the 10.5 block area of Mantua their home. Between 1960 and 1969, Mantua recorded about 10% of total city gang killings. Mantua became one of the worst areas of the 16th precinct, and the Philadelphia Police Department often assigned patrols in Mantua to officers as punishment. =1970s= Andrew Jenkins and the Mantua Community Planners began working with the city to build a recreation center in Mantua. However, gang violence continuously delayed these efforts. The neighborhood‚Äôs first recreation center finally opened on what is now 34th Street and Haverford Avenue. In addition to the playgrounds, ball courts, and offices featured at most recreation centers, this one also housed a free library, and holding a library card was a requirement for entrance to the play centers. Despite the crime, Wrice's Young Great Society and Jenkins' Mantua Community Planners fought to incorporate urban renewal programs, such as the planting of trees and building of housing units. Mt. Vernon Manor, a collection of apartment buildings, was once such development project. Designed as part of the multipurpose Mantua Community Center, the Mantua library branch opened July 9, 1979. The building also includes a Department of Recreation gymnasium, a community office, and a meeting room. =1980s= Like many industrialized cities, the 1980s saw a rise of drug-related gang warfare. The use of crack cocaine, combined with the existing heroin market, caused many residents to flee. Andrew Jenkins began an eight-year stint as Deputy Mayor, and in 1988 Herman Wrice formed Mantua Against Drugs (MAD). Wrice led community marches against drugs and put up wanted posters of the drug dealers that operated freely on the corners. Despite Wrice‚Äôs efforts, infighting between community leaders prevented a lot of potential progress. According to Jenkins, ‚ÄúThe lowest point of the neighborhood was in the late 80s. The biggest failure of the Mantua Community was the jealousy of the leaders who were not successful; they attacked the leaders that were. They put rumors and stigmas on active leaders ‚Äì that‚Äôs what destroyed the neighborhood.‚Äù =1990s= Although the drug trade began winding down in the 1990s, the community was feeling its lasting effects. The number of residents in the community fluttered around 6,000 most of the decade, and several hundred vacant lots dotted the streets. The movie theaters, retail outlets, and galleries that resided in Mantua during the 1950s were replaced by small delis and grab-and-go beer stores. In the late-1990s, many of the abandoned lots and buildings were bought, renovated, and put on the market for rent. The neighborhood saw an influx of college students from Drexel University, among other institutions, move into the area in search of affordable housing. The Mantua library branch was renamed the Charles L. Durham Free Library in 1995. Born in Mantua, Durham served on City Council from 1967 to 1974, when he was appointed to the Common Pleas Court. He was a strong advocate for the community, and was deeply involved in the struggle for civil rights and was part of the first black caucus on Council. The library was renovated in 1999 as part of the Free Library of Philadelphia \\"Changing Lives\\" campaign, which refurbished branches and ensured Internet access. =2000s= It is estimated that between 500 and 1000 college-aged students are living in Mantua. This growing number of students has brought renewed interest to the Mantua community from the expanding university system to the south, consisting mainly of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania. In 2005 the formation of Mantua Cares by community residents including the family of the former community activist Herman Wrice was launched to address the youth perspective on developing the community. Since its inception Mantua Cares has been able to launch youth programs rooted in entrepreneurship, place students in internships and provide jobs after school to Mantua's youth with the sole intent of engaging them in the community. Their unique approach with the inclusion of youth involvement to develop and maintain programs has been successful. Under the direction of E. Darnell Ryans III, the organization has won several local and city awards for their commitment to this community. On September 11th, 2008, Miles Mack was shot and killed at the McAlpin Playground on the corner of 36th and Aspen streets. Miles Mack was a well-respected man of the community for his creation of the X-Tra Miles Basketball League that he started himself for young African-American males to stay out of trouble. His death was a major loss for the community and in memory of his legacy, the McAlpin Playground was renamed the Miles Mack Playground.

World Precision Instruments (WPI) SP120PZ. A syringe driver or syringe pump is a small infusion pump (some include infuse and withdraw capability), used to gradually administer small amounts of fluid (with or without medication) to a patient or for use in chemical and biomedical research. Applications include electrospinning, electrospraying, microdialysis, microfluidics, dispensing/dilution, organ/tissue perfusion and fluid circulation. Another use of syringe drivers is in palliative care, to continuously administer analgesics (painkillers), antiemetics (medication to suppress nausea and vomiting) and other drugs. This prevents periods during which medication levels in the blood are too high or too low, and avoids the use of multiple tablets (especially in people who have difficulty swallowing). As the medication is administered subcutaneously, the area for administration is practically limitless, although edema may interfere with the action of some drugs. Syringe drivers are also useful for delivering IV medications over several minutes. In the case of a medication which should be slowly pushed in over the course of several minutes, this device saves staff time and reduces errors. Syringe pumps are also useful in microfluidic applications, such as microreactor design and testing, and also in chemistry for slow incorporation of a fixed volume of fluid into a solution. In enzyme kinetics syringe drivers can be used to observe rapid kinetics as part of a stopped flow apparatus. They are also sometimes used as laboratory media dispensers.

History HMS Erebus Periscope eyeview from USS Triton (1960) On April 20, 1511, a Portuguese Navy fleet composed of six caravels under the command of Captain Garcia de Noronha discovered the islets by accident while on their journey to India. While navigating in the open sea late at night, the Saint Peter caravel, under the command of Captain Manuel de Castro Alcoforado, crashed against the islets. The crew was rescued by the Saint Paul caravel, forming the name given to the islets.Saint Peter and Saint Paul‚Äôs Archipelago - Tectonic uplift of infracrustal rocks in the Atlantic Ocean Campos, T.F.C.; Virgens Neto, J.; Srivastava, N.K.; Petta, R.A.; Harmann, L.A.; Moraes, J.F.S.; Mendes, L.; Silveira, S.R.M.

On the morning of February 16, 1832, the rocks were visited by Charles Darwin on the first leg of his voyage on HMS Beagle around the world. Darwin listed all the fauna he could find, noting that not a single plant or even a lichen could be found on the island. Darwin found two birds, a booby and a noddy, a large crab that stole the fish intended for chicks, a fly that lived on the booby and a parasitic tick. He found a moth that lived on feathers, a beetle, a woodlouse that lived on dung, and numerous spiders that he thought lived on scavengers of the waterfowl. Darwin felt that these rocks represented how life first took hold on a newly formed outcrop.Darwin's description from Voyage of the Beagle Retrieved on 2009-07-16. Darwin was correct in noting that, unusually, these small islands were not volcanic, but were instead formed by a geologic uplift. Darwin's account formed the basis of a fictionalized episode in Patrick O'Brian's historical novel HMS Surprise, when the naturalist Stephen Maturin is briefly marooned and survives by drinking fouled rainwater and the blood of boobies.*O'Brian, Patrick: H.M.S. Surprise, W.W. Norton & Company, New York, 1973, Chapter 5, p. 117. The then called ‚ÄúSt. Paul's Rocks‚Äù were visited by James Clark Ross on 29 November 1839. He was in charge of an expedition to the Antarctic regions with two vessels, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. Robert McCormick gave some geological and biological remarks on St. Paul's Rocks in the report on the expedition. Another famous person to visit the rocks was Ernest Shackleton, on his last expedition to Antarctica (1921‚Äì1922). In 1942, during World War II, the islets were declared to be part of the Federal Territory of Fernando de Noronha (which also included the Rocas Atoll). In early 1960, the rocks served as the starting-point and terminus for the first submerged circumnavigation of the world by the American nuclear-powered submarine . =Scientific station= On June 25, 1998, the Brazilian Navy inaugurated the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago Scientific Station (; ECASPSP). The station is manned with four researchers, who are rotated in and out every 15 days.Nova Era no Arquip√©lago de S√£o Pedro e S√£o Paulo Brazilian Navy. Retrieved on June 6, 2009. By maintaining permanent occupation of the archipelago, the Brazilian Navy extends Brazil's Exclusive Economic Zone, territorial waters and airspace into the North Atlantic Ocean.Lan√ßamento da nova Esta√ß√£o Cient√≠fica do Arquip√©lago de S√£o Pedro e S√£o Paulo Brazilian Navy. Retrieved on June 6, 2009. On June 5‚Äì6, 2006, an earthquake with a magnitude of above six on the Richter magnitude scale rocked the archipelago. The strong tidal surge following the earthquake caused the battery compartment to crash against the station's outer wall, allowing sea water to flood the station. The four researchers who were on the archipelago took shelter in the lighthouse, while maintaining constant contact with the Brazilian Navy. A fishing vessel located nearby rescued the researchers, who were then transferred to a Brazilian Navy patrol boat. The incident caused considerable damage to the station and equipment.Acidente no Arquip√©lago de S√£o Pedro e S√£o Paulo Brazilian Navy. Retrieved on 2009-07-16.

The new station was built with seismic isolation, and is considerably larger and better equipped than the previous one.A constru√ß√£o da nova Esta√ß√£o Cient√≠fica Brazilian Navy.

The station is composed of a main building ‚Äì equipped with reverse osmosis salt water desalination system, photovoltaics system and satellite communications system; deposits and a mooring dock.Manual do Pesquisador Brazilian Navy. Retrieved on 2009-07-16. The Brazilian Navy also maintains a lighthouse on the archipelago, (ARLHS: SPP-001), built in 1995 to replace a previous one from 1930. =Air France Flight 447= On June 1, 2009, Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330-200 jetliner en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 persons on board, crashed on the Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, killing all its occupants. Bodies and fragments from the aircraft were found just to the northwest of the archipelago. Geography The Saint Peter and Saint Paul Rocks are situated in the Atlantic Ocean, north of the Equator and are the only group of Brazilian oceanic islets in the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest point in the Brazilian coast, is Cabo do Calcanhar, Rio Grande do Norte, approximately from the archipelago. The total emerged area is about and the maximum land elevation is , on Nordeste Island. The archipelago is composed of several rocks, five small rocky islets and four larger islets: *Belmonte Islet: *Challenger Islet (also known as S√£o Paulo): *Nordeste Islet (also known as S√£o Pedro): *Cabral Islet: *South Islet: . Their base is over below sea level. None of the islets has a permanent fresh water supply available. Biology Only the largest of the islets, Belmonte, is vegetated with mosses and grasses. The other rocks are mostly barren, except for some sea algae and fungi that can tolerate the salt spray. The rocks are inhabited by seabirds, including the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), brown noddy (Anous stolidus), and black noddy (Anous minutus), as well as crabs (Grapsus grapsus), insects and spiders.S√©rie de reportagens sobre o arquip√©lago de S√£o Pedro e S√£o Paulo e as ilhas de Trindade e Martim Vaz O Globo.

It is the opposite of ascribed status and reflects personal skills, abilities, and efforts. Examples of achieved status are being an Olympic athlete, a criminal, or a college professor. Status is important sociologically because it comes with a set of rights, obligations, behaviors, and duties that people occupying a certain position are expected or encouraged to perform. Those expectations are referred to as roles. For instance, the role of a professor includes teaching students, answering their questions, and being impartial and appropriate. Compared to ascribed status Ascribed status is a position assigned to individuals or groups based on traits beyond their control, such as sex, race, or parental social status. It is usually associated with closed societies. Achieved status is distinguished from ascribed status by virtue of being earned. Many positions are a mixture of achievement and ascription. For instance, a person who has achieved the status of being a physician is more likely to have the ascribed status of being born into a wealthy family. That is usually associated with open societies or social-class societies. Social mobility Social mobility refers to one's ability to move their status either up or down the social stratification system, compared with their family's status in early life. Some people with achieved status have improved their position in the social system by their own merit and achievements. Someone may also have achieved status that decreases their position within the social system, such as by becoming a notorious criminal. A society in which people's position in that society can change by their actions, by increasing or decreasing, can be referred to as an open system. A closed system society allows less social mobility. Cultural capital Cultural capital is a concept, developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. It can refer to both achieved and ascribed characteristics, which are desirable qualities (either material or symbolic) that contribute to one's social status: any advantages that a person has and give him or her a higher status in society. It may include high expectations, forms of knowledge, skill, or education. Parents provide children with cultural capital, the attitudes and knowledge that make the educational system a comfortable familiar place in which they can succeed easily. There are other types of capital as well. Social capital refers to one's membership in groups, relationships, and networks. It can also have a significant impact on achievement level. =Education= Industrialization has led to a vast increase in the possible standard of living for the average person but also made that increase necessary. For the productivity of the average worker to rise, he or she had to receive far more education and training, which successively made the average worker much less replaceable and thus more powerful. Hence, it became necessary to satisfy workers' demands for a larger share. =Employment= According to the sociologist Rodney Stark, few Americans believe that coming from a wealthy family or having political connections is necessary to get ahead. In contrast, many people in other industrialized nations think those factors are necessary for advancement. Americans are more likely than the people in those nations to rate \\"hard work\\" as very important for getting ahead. Most nations value hard work, but Italians, for example, are hardly more likely to rate it as very important than they are to think that political connections are needed. =Income= People with a lower income will generally be a better example of moving up in the social stratification and achieving status. That holds to be evident in most cases because those who accrue a lower income usually have the motivation to achieve a greater status through their own ambitions and hard work. Those of higher income are typically the result of achieving status. In other cases, the people with higher incomes may have unjustly acquired that position or were ascribed their status and income (such as monarchs, family-run businesses, etc.). Those without the privilege of ascribing their status generally have the greater motivation of achieving their own status. The general economic well-being of the society in which they live also tends to be another factor in their status and the extent that they are able to achieve their status. For example, Americans are less likely than people in other industrialized nations to object to current income variances. According to Rodney Stark, in 1992, only 27% of Americans strongly agreed that income disparities in their country were too large. In contrast, more than half of Russians, Italians, and Bulgarians agreed with that statement. Stratification systems around the world In all societies, a person's social status is the result of both ascribed and achieved characteristics. Societies differ markedly on several dimensions in that process: the attributes that are used to assign status, the relative importance of ascribed or achieved attributes, the overall potential for social mobility, the rates of mobility that actually occur, and the barriers to particular subgroups enjoying upward mobility. Cultural differences around the world =Medieval Europe= One's status in medieval Europe was primarily based on ascription. People born into the noble class were likely to keep a high position and people born of peasants were likely to stay in a low position. This political system is known as feudalism and does not allow for much social mobility. =Feudalism in Latin America= Bolivia used to have newspaper advertisements that claimed to have land, animals and peasants for sale. The peasants were not necessarily slaves but placed in their social class and required to work because they were bound to the land on which they lived and that they farmed. That sort of social interaction is based mainly on the people's strong belief of tradition and to uphold the actions of the past. In 1971, Ernesto Laclau addressed the argument of Latin America was feudalist or capitalist. He determined that the social system was very different from the capitalist system in Europe and the United States and so Latin America would be more closely related to having a feudalist approach to social interaction. =Caste system= The formation of a hierarchy differs from the polarities of both given and achieved status.Japan's Invisible Race: Caste in Culture and Personality, p., George A. De Vos, Hiroshi Wagatsuma In caste systems, ascription is the overpowering basis for status. Traditional society in South Asia and other parts of the world such as Egypt, India, and Japan were composed of castes. Each group was limited to certain occupations. Low-paying occupations such as collecting garbage were reserved for one caste, whose members were excluded from holding any other occupation. Correspondingly, highly-skilled occupations, such as being a priest or a goldsmith, were reserved for another caste. However, some people managed through talent and luck to rise above their given caste. For example, great aptitude as a soldier was often a way to reach a higher status.

One of the most famous examples of the Archaic Smile is the Kroisos Kouros, and the Peplos Kore is another. The dying warrior from the west pediment of the Temple of Aphaia, Aegina, Greece is an interesting context, as the warrior is near death. In the Archaic Period of ancient Greece (roughly 600 BCE to 480 BCE), the art that proliferated contained images of people who had the archaic smile. A Brief History of the Smile, Angus Trumble, 2005, , p.11, Google Books link: [https://books.google.com/books?id=G3OQAv16R6oC&pg;=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq;=%22archaic+smile&source;=web&ots;=X7LkvskGgE&sig=umna9HKZOkbd4CVnS- uohM36fV8&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi=book_result&resnum;=77&ct;=result books-google- AT11]. \\"Archaic smile\\", Britannica Online Encyclopedia, 2009, webpage: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/32637/Archaic-smile EB-Smile]. For two centuries before the mid-5th century BCE, the archaic smile was widely sculpted, as evidenced by statues found in excavations all across the Greek mainland, Asia Minor, and on islands in the Aegean Sea. It has been theorized that in that period, artists felt it either represents that they were blessed by the gods in their actions and so was the smile, or that it is similar to preplanned smiles in modern photos.. The significance of the convention is not known although it is often assumed that for the Greeks, that kind of smile reflected a state of ideal health and well-being. It is best anthropological practice to assume expertise in execution of craft and to look for formal/stylistic reasons for cultural artifacts to appear as they do.Middle Archaic Phase(Smile) Retrieved 24 September 2010 It has also been suggested that it is simply the result of a technical difficulty in fitting the curved shape of the mouth to the somewhat-blocklike head typical of Archaic sculpture. Richard Neer theorizes that the archaic smile may actually be a marker of status, since aristocrats of multiple cities throughout Greece were referred to as the Geleontes or \\"smiling ones\\". There are alternative views to the archaic smile being \\"flat and quite unnatural looking\\". That is how John Fowles describes the archaic smile in his novel The Magus (Chapter 23): \\"...full of the purest metaphysical good humour [...] timelessly intelligent and timelessly amused. [...] Because a star explodes and a thousand worlds like ours die, we know this world is. That is the smile: that what might not be, is [...] When I die, I shall have this by my bedside. It is the last human face I want to see.\\" To viewers habituated to realism, it could be seen as a movement towards naturalism.

She was named for Fleet Admiral Ernest Joseph King (1878‚Äì1956), King was laid down by the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton in Washington on 1 March 1957, launched on 6 December 1958 and commissioned on 17 November 1960. King was reclassified as a guided missile destroyer leader on 14 November 1956 and designated DLG-10. King was again reclassified as a guided missile destroyer on 30 June 1975 and designated DDG-41.  Service history  After shakedown along the coast, and in Hawaiian waters, King continued training out of San Diego for the remainder of 1961. Following extensive preparations the guided-missile frigate sailed on her first WestPac cruise, 7 June 1962, strengthening the 7th Fleet with her Terrier missile arsenal. Operating with this peacekeeping force, King helped to check Communist aggression in Southeast Asia. Upon returning San Diego on 31 December, she resumed tactical exercises off the West Coast until 1 August 1963 when she departed on her second WestPac cruise. Once again her operations with the 7th Fleet helped maintain stability in the Far East. King returned San Diego 10 March 1964 and conducted operations along the coast, for the rest of the year constantly perfecting her fighting skills and increasing the peacekeeping ability of the Navy. King headed back for the Far East 5 April 1965 escorting the aircraft carrier . She operated from the South China Sea during May screening carriers and participating in air-sea rescue work. She continued to serve off Vietnam until returning to San Diego on 2 November. The guided missile destroyer operated off the West Coast until heading back for the Western Pacific 26 May 1966. On this cruise she carried a helicopter for search and rescue missions to save American pilots during strikes against North Vietnam. She arrived at Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 27 June. During July she saved five downed aviators, including one who was rescued from deep within North Vietnam by the ship's helicopter crew. In August the ship was stationed in a positive identification and radar advisory zone (PIRAZ) in the Gulf of Tonkin to help protect American ships from enemy aircraft. Before she was relieved, she had checked over 15,000 aircraft. During this duty she also rescued seven pilots whose planes had gone down during strikes against enemy targets. She continued this duty, except for brief runs to Hong Kong and Subic Bay, until relieved by on 29 November. In February 1980, three crew members were lost at sea in the Atlantic northeast of Cape Hatteras during a snowstorm. A fourth crew member was also washed overboard, but was rescued. She won the 1982 Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. King was sold on 15 April 1994, and broken up for scrap by J&L; Metals, Wilmington, North Carolina during 1995.

The story is notable for the introduction of recurring foes the Yeti and The Great Intelligence. Only one of the six episodes is held in the BBC archives; five remain missing. Plot Professor Edward Travers, an anthropologist and explorer, is awoken from his sleep when he hears the screams of his companion. He is horrified to see a lumbering, hairy creature standing over his friend's lifeless body. The TARDIS lands in Tibet in the Himalayas. The Second Doctor talks about a monastery's bell he has from a previous journey and then goes to explore by himself. He sees a large footprint and, while he is examining it, a hairy creature passes behind him unnoticed. The Doctor goes back to the TARDIS to take the bell and advises Jamie and Victoria to stay in the TARDIS. The Doctor finds the two empty sleeping bags, the twisted remains of a rifle and a dead man. The Doctor arrives at Detsen Monastery, which seems to be deserted. A group of men comes in and the Doctor is accused of having killed Travers' companion, based on the fact that the Doctor is carrying their sack. While the Doctor is locked in a cell, Travers tells him about his mission: finding the Yeti. It appears there have been some deaths recently, but the Professor says the Yeti cannot be the culprit because of its shy nature. Meanwhile, Jamie and Victoria decide to step outside. They find the big footprints all around the TARDIS. Jamie would like to obey the Doctor and go back to the TARDIS, but Victoria insists and they find a cave, in which they are soon trapped. The two try to find another exit and accidentally discover a chamber containing a pyramid of metal spheres. Suddenly a Yeti moves the boulder that blocked the cave. Jamie tries to fight it with a scimitar, but the Yeti is too strong. Jamie causes some rocks to fall on it and he and Victoria are able to escape with one of the strange illuminated spheres. They head toward the monastery, where the Doctor is still being detained on Khrisong's orders. He has, nevertheless, been able to pass on the Ghanta to the friendly monk Thonmi. Thonmi takes it to Abbot Songsten, who is in communion with the master of the monastery, Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava knows the Doctor from his previous visit, and though he knows of the Doctor's wisdom, he fears he will intervene in The Great Plan. Thonmi is told to depart, his memory wiped of what he has heard, though given the instruction that the Doctor should be released unharmed. The Doctor has meanwhile been placed on trial and, as a test of whether he controls the Yeti, is tied to the doors of the monastery to lure the Yeti out. Travers has by now met Jamie and Victoria, who convince him the Doctor is no threat. The trio return to the monastery to see the Doctor freed on the Abbot's instructions. Shortly afterward, the Yeti advance in an abortive attack on the monastery, during which one of them is overpowered and rendered dormant. The Doctor deduces it is a robot, controlled by a missing spherical unit from its chest cavity. The awakened Yeti battles its way out of Detsen, killing warrior monks and leaving Khrisong angry that Thonmi opened the door to allow it to flee ‚Äì albeit to avoid further bloodshed. Victoria and Thonmi are imprisoned for supposedly reviving the creature. The Abbot reports to Padmasambhava that their plan is working, and the old master replies that the Great Intelligence is taking on corporeal form. To make way for the next phase, Padmasambhava orders all monks to leave the monastery. When the Doctor and Jamie reach the TARDIS, they find it guarded by another Yeti, but it is inactive and the Doctor takes out its control sphere, which then returns to life. Jamie prevents it from re-entering the dormant Yeti by lodging a rock in the open chest cavity. They head back to the monastery, where the Doctor forges an alliance with Khrisong based on the need to enable the monks to stay at the monastery. Realising the monks will not leave peacefully, Songsten opens the gates of the monastery to more Yeti. Victoria has escaped and ventured alone to the Inner Sanctum of the monastery, where she finds Padmasambhava. Victoria realises he is commanding the robots. He wipes her mind of their meeting and summons more Yeti to attack. The Doctor helps Victoria recover from her trance-like state and listens to Travers, who is recovering his senses and explains about the cave and the pyramid. The Doctor pieces together the nature of the threat while Travers recalls that Songsten was in the cave too. It is clear Songsten is the link between the Yeti and the monastery. In the Inner Sanctum, Songsten has bowed to the will of the Great Intelligence and slays Khrisong. The Doctor and his friends arrive and overpower Songsten, realising he has been entranced. Songsten is bound and returned to the other monks, and the violence of his manner persuades them that he is the threat to Detsen. The Doctor tells the monks to flee so that he can defeat the Intelligence. With Jamie, Victoria, and Thonmi, he plans to destroy the equipment the Intelligence is using through Padmasambhava to control the robotic Yeti. They venture to the Inner Sanctum, where the Doctor distracts the being while Thonmi and Jamie destroy the equipment used to relay instructions to the Yeti. Destroying a further pyramid of spheres expels the Intelligence and, left in peace, Padmasambhava dies. With the danger over, the travelers depart. Travers accompanies them up the mountain and his belief in the real Yeti is renewed when he spots one. He charges off to investigate as the TARDIS departs. Production Episode is missing All episodes except for episode 2 are missing. Brief clips from episode 4 exclusively focusing on the Yeti also exist. The North Wales mountain pass at Nant Ffrancon doubled as Tibet for the filming of this serial. Filming was done there from 4 to 9 September 1967. According to Jack Watling one of the actors playing the Yeti fell hundreds of feet during filming and was feared dead, but was merely inebriated and fortunately cushioned by the foam rubber inside the costume. =Cast notes= The character of Professor Travers is played by Jack Watling, the father of actress Deborah Watling, who plays Victoria. Norman Jones later played Major Baker in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and Hieronymous in The Masque of Mandragora (1976).http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/masquemandragora/detail.shtml Ralpachan is played by David Baron, often said to be the playwright Harold Pinter under a stage name. Pinter has since denied this rumour. David Baron was indeed Pinter's name for the purposes of Equity, the British actors' union, but he had relinquished it by the time this serial was produced. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1974. At Barry Letts' request several Buddhist terms used in the screenplay as names were modified for the novelisation. There have been French, Portuguese and Turkish editions. When Target Books began numbering its releases in 1983, it chose to do so alphabetically rather than based upon publication or broadcast order. As a result, the novelisation of The Abominable Snowmen was identified as book number 1. An un-abridged reading of the Target novel was released by BBC audio on CD in February 2009. It is read by David Troughton, the son of Patrick Troughton who played the Doctor in this story. =Home media= All known copies of Episode 2, including audio recordings made by fans during the original broadcast in 1967, contain a brief audio dropout late in the episode. The Doctor is examining a captured Yeti and is supposed to say, \\"You were right about one thing Victoria ‚Äî this creature certainly doesn't seem to be flesh and blood!\\" In what appears to have been a fault with the master videotape recording, the sound cuts in with \\"...toria...\\" The original VHS release of the episode saw the soundtrack manipulated to cover the dropout, whilst maintaining the running time of the episode. The DVD release contains a \\"patchwork repair\\" of the fault, performed by Mark Ayres of the Doctor Who Restoration Team, using the appropriate words spoken by Troughton with the correct vocal inflections, taken from other Second Doctor episodes.  Audio  The audio soundtrack, along with additional linking narration by Frazer Hines, has been released on MP3 CD, along with The Web of Fear. A collection box entitled \\"Yeti Attack\\" contains both Yeti adventures on normal CD.  Video  In 1991, Episode 2 was released on VHS as part of \\"The Troughton Years\\". In 2004, that episode, along with a handful of clips gathered from other sources, were digitally restored and released on the Lost in Time DVD.

He served in the Pennsylvania state legislature and represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate. Early life, education, and marriage George Logan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 9, 1753. He was the grandson of William Penn's secretary James Logan. As a child, he was sent to England for schooling, and later his Loyalist family again sent him overseas when the American Revolution broke out, this time to get medical training. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1779. He returned to the United States in 1780, and in 1781 he married Deborah Norris, who went on to become a noted historian and diarist. Two years later they moved into Stenton, a mansion built in the Germantown area of Philadelphia by James Logan that is now open to the public. Partly due to the demands of restoring and maintaining Stenton, Logan gave up his career as a physician and became a gentleman farmer and politician. At Stenton, the couple entertained a wide circle of politicians, artists, writers, and businesspeople, counting among their friends Thomas Jefferson and the painter Charles Willson Peale. They were music lovers and had a admiration for many composers including Haydn, Mozart, Clementi and Pleyel. The Logans had three sons, Albanus (1783‚Äì1854), Gustavus George (1786‚Äì1800), and Algernon Sydney (1791‚Äì1835). Career Despite his Loyalist background, Logan took part in the political life of the new United States. In 1785 he was elected to the Pennsylvania legislature, serving for four years; and he was elected for another term in the late 1790s. In 1790, he was disowned by the Society of Friends (Quakers) for having joined a militia, an activity wholly antithetical to the Quakers' pacifist views. A Jeffersonian Republican, in 1793 he helped to found the Democratic-Republican Societies. An accomplished farmer, he was also a founder of the Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Agriculture. In 1798, he went to Paris to negotiate peace with the French to settle the Quasi-War. On his return, he found he had been denounced by the anti-Jeffersonian Federalists, who had passed a statute informally known as the \\"Logan Act\\", which made it a crime for an individual citizen to interfere in a dispute between the United States and a foreign country. In 1800, the year Jefferson was elected president, Logan was elected to the U.S. Senate for a six-year term. Logan's reputation was decidedly mixed. With reference to his political activities, he was called at various times a \\"busybody\\" and a \\"great fool\\", but Jefferson considered him \\"the best farmer in Pennsylvania, both in theory and practice.\\" Logan died in 1821, and not long afterwards Deborah Logan wrote an account of his life under the title Memoir of Dr. George Logan of Stenton, including excerpts from letters. It was published in 1899. See alsoStenton (mansion) References Further readingLogan, Deborah Norris. Memoir of Dr. George Logan of Stenton. Frances A. Logan, ed.

History =As WABC-FM= The station went on the air on May 4, 1948 under the call sign WJZ-FM.\\"WJZ-FM in New York operating at 95.5 mc.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, May 10, 1948, pg. 80. In March 1953, the station's call letters were changed to WABC-FM following the merger of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) with United Paramount Theatres.\\"Ambitious ABC planning initiated under new merged ownership.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, February 16, 1953, pp. 27-29.\\"It's now WABC-AM-FM-TV; ABC also changes slides.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, March 2, 1953, pg. 70.WABC-AM-FM-TV advertisement. Broadcasting - Telecasting, March 2, 1953, pg. 37. As most FM stations did during the medium's formative years, 95.5 FM simulcast the programming of its AM sister station, WJZ/WABC (770 AM). In the early 1960s, however, WABC-FM began to program itself separately from WABC (AM). During the 1962‚Äì63 New York City newspaper strike, the station programmed news for 17 hours daily.\\"Strikebound N.Y. depends on air news.\\" Broadcasting, December 17, 1962, pg. 44WABC-FM advertisement. Broadcasting, December 24, 1962, pp. 38- 39 Two-and-a-half years before WINS launched its own around-the-clock, all-news format in April 1965, it was the first such attempt in the New York market. This was followed by stints with Broadway show tunes and general freeform programming, including broadcasts of New York Mets baseball games.\\"Baseball tops $31 million.\\" Broadcasting, February 19, 1968, pp. 40-49. WABC's AM personalities, notably Dan Ingram, Chuck Leonard and Bob Lewis, hosted programs on the FM side which were the total opposites of the top 40-powered sound for which they were better known on AM. WABC-FM continued to simulcast its AM sister station during Herb Oscar Anderson's morning drive program. At the start of 1968, ABC split its radio network into four distinct components, one of which was dedicated to FM radio.\\"600 stations set for new ABC.\\"Broadcasting, January 1, 1968, pp. 42-44. The following year, WABC-FM and its sister stations ‚Äî KABC-FM in Los Angeles; WLS-FM in Chicago; KGO-FM in San Francisco; WXYZ-FM in Detroit; KQV-FM in Pittsburgh; and newly acquired KXYZ-FM in Houston ‚Äî began carrying an automated, youth-oriented, progressive rock format known as Love.\\"ABC Radio sends its 'Love' to FM.\\"Broadcasting, February 17, 1969, pg. 77. =As WPLJ= Album rock era (1971‚Äì1983) WPLJ's logo from the early 1970s. All of ABC's FM stations adopted this same logo style at this time; a version of this is still in use today by former sister station KLOS. In late 1970, Allen Shaw, the then-president of ABC's FM station group, announced two big changes to take place in early 1971: ABC dropped Love and installed completely live-and-local, freeform rock formats. The network also applied for call letter changes for the seven stations.\\"ABC puts a new emphasis on FM.\\" Broadcasting, August 10, 1970, pg. 45.\\"ABC asks FCC for ok to change FM calls.\\" Broadcasting, September 14, 1970, pg. 48. The New York outlet was slated to be renamed WRIF, but a clerical error on the part of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) resulted in those calls being awarded to the former WXYZ-FM in Detroit ‚Äî whose own request for WDAI (\\"Detroit Auto Industry\\") was itself given mistakenly to WLS-FM in Chicago ‚Äî leaving WABC-FM to start from scratch for its own rebranding. On February 14, 1971, the station's call letters changed to WPLJ,\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, March 8, 1971, pg. 59 chosen after Allen Shaw noticed the letter combination as the name of a song on the 1970 Mothers of Invention record, Burnt Weeny Sandwich. The song, \\"W-P-L-J\\", was originally performed by the Four Deuces in 1955 and stood for \\"White Port and Lemon Juice\\". On the air, the station hired John Zacherle, Alex Bennett, Vin Scelsa, Jimmy Fink, and Michael Cuscuna (from WMMR and WXPN in Philadelphia) as personalities. All seven ABC-owned FM stations also adopted a shared logo styling with the callsign and frequency within a multi-colored oval; WRIF and KLOS (the former KABC-FM) continue to use a form of this logo to the present day. In September 1971, Allen Shaw and ABC programming executive Bob Henaberry designed and pioneered the very first album-oriented rock (AOR) format on WPLJ, playing only the best cuts from the best-selling rock albums with a minimum of disc jockey talk. Using the slogan \\"Rock 'N Stereo\\", the station played artists such as Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, Elton John, Deep Purple, Billy Joel, Rod Stewart, David Bowie, and The Allman Brothers. The station also played pop songs from artists such as James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, and Carly Simon, distinguishing itself from top 40 stations (such as co-owned WABC) by playing more tracks from their albums. The station's Arbitron ratings shot up dramatically, and WPLJ became New York's most listened-to FM rock station for most of the 1970s. In 1973, ABC transferred Willard Lochridge, the general manager of WRIF in Detroit, to New York to manage WPLJ. The following year, Lochridge brought his Detroit program director, Larry Berger to WPLJ, and adopted a new slogan: \\"New York's Best Rock\\". Some of the personalities on the station during this period included Jim Kerr, Pat St. John, Jimmy Fink, Carol Miller, Tony Pigg, John Zacherle, Alex Bennett, Bob Marrone, and Dave Charity. Berger himself hosted a Sunday night call-in show, in which he discussed seemingly any topic with listeners ‚Äî except the specifics of the playlist. During these call-in segments, some callers suggested that the station sped up (or \\"pitched up\\") the music so that they could fit in more commercials while still being able to claim that they played a large number of songs per hour. Berger repeatedly denied that this practice was in use at WPLJ. In the September 20, 1999 episode of Crap from the Past, host Ron \\"Boogiemonster\\" Gerber suggested that music was sped up on WPLJ to make the same music sound less dynamic on other stations. Another Sunday night show begun in 1973, then-Father Bill Ayres' long-running show, at first called On This Rock and later (after Ayres left the priesthood in the 1980s) titled The Bill Ayres Show.Konig, Susan. \\"Q&A;: Bill Ayres; In Forefront of Fighting World Hunger\\". The New York Times. March 29, 1998 Known on-air as Father Bill Ayres, the show mixed spirituality and social consciousness together with the music of Harry Chapin, Bob Seger and others. The show also aired on its sister station WABC on Sunday mornings within the last years of its top 40 music format. Ayres continued to host the show until the transfer of control of WPLJ to Educational Media Foundation in May 2019. By the late 1970s, WPLJ tended to emphasize harder rock artists such as Led Zeppelin (there was a nightly \\"Get the Led Out\\" segment), Kansas, Boston, and Queen, which all happened to get less airplay than on competing station WNEW- FM. At this point, the station reduced its play of softer pop songs, and their ratings remained competitive. Berger hired Marc Coppola in 1981, a rock- oriented disc jockey from suburban rival WBAB on Long Island, to do the 10 p.m.-2 a.m. shift Monday through Saturday. During its AOR phase, the station was noted for its promotional montages consisting of snippets of classic rock songs spliced together by St. John, emphasizing a subject or theme, such as gasoline (during the gas shortages of the 1970s). From the time of Berger's arrival, WPLJ beat main rock rival WNEW-FM in virtually every Arbitron ratings period. In 1982, WPLJ received a direct competitor in WAPP, which adopted a near-identical AOR format to WPLJ (WAPP launched its rock format commercial- free and remained so for the summer of 1982). WAPP beat WPLJ in the ratings in the fall of 1982, and WPLJ reacted by adding more new wave such as A Flock of Seagulls, Dexy's Midnight Runners, The Go-Go's, Elvis Costello, Men at Work, and Soft Cell, mixed in with the usual AOR fare. WPLJ's ratings ended up besting those of WAPP after the latter started playing commercials in the fall of 1982. In early 1983, the station added \\"Billie Jean\\" by Michael Jackson, playing it several times a day (many AOR stations, including WNEW-FM, added that song and it charted on the rock tracks chart). In March 1983, WPLJ added Jackson's other hit \\"Beat It\\", which received very positive reaction. While Jackson was not a typical AOR artist, that cut was played by many AOR stations due to Eddie Van Halen's role in the song. The station also dropped most 1960s songs by May, and was cutting back on AOR artists while playing more contemporary rockers. Top 40 era (1983‚Äì1992) In early 1983, the station began a transition from AOR to top 40/CHR. With word that a top 40 format was coming to WVNJ-FM (100.3 FM), WPLJ moved further in a CHR direction. Though the station began playing artists like Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, Larry Berger stated that he did not make the decision to move to a CHR format until the last week of June; WPLJ adopted a rock-leaning CHR format on June 30, 1983. At that point, the station played predominantly AOR and new wave rock cuts, and mixed in two or three rhythmic pop cuts like \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\" by Irene Cara, \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" by Culture Club, \\"She Works Hard for the Money\\" by Donna Summer, and others. The station maintained its \\"New York's Best Rock\\" slogan, even though the station moved away from playing predominantly rock songs. Berger discussed the changes on his call-in show in July 1983, to the disapproving reaction from the rock audience. Larry Berger explains change from Rock to Top 40 - July 1983 (Competitor WNBC had been a de facto AM top-40 station while WYNY had been the de facto FM hits station throughout the early 1980s, playing many current songs as part of its hot adult contemporary format). WPLJ's airstaff, which stayed on during the early transition months, gradually changed, as WNEW-FM picked up some of the station's best-known disc jockeys such as Carol Miller and Pat St. John. (Jim Kerr and sidekick Shelli Sonstein remained with the station through the end of the decade.) Jimmy Fink, Tony Pigg, and Marc Coppola eventually moved to Infinity Broadcasting's WXRK when it debuted a couple of years later. In August 1983, at the same time WVNJ had been re- christened as WHTZ (Z100), WPLJ became known as \\"The Home of the Hits\\" and in October, added top 40-style jingles. In a way, it was \\"New York's Hit Music Station\\" just before WHTZ went on the air. The following spring, WPLJ identified itself very briefly as \\"The New Musicradio PLJ\\" before segueing to \\"Hitradio 95\\" just a short time later. In early 1985, the station became known on-air as \\"Power 95\\". Ratings went up after switching to CHR, though they were still just behind Z100 most of the time. On December 17, 1987, the station changed its call letters to WWPR (to complement its \\"Power 95\\" slogan). (Rival Z100 joked that the \\"PR\\" in the calls stood for \\"Puerto Rican\\" and that the station planned to flip to a Spanish-language format). The WPLJ call-sign returned the following year, on December 21, 1988, when research indicated that listeners still identified the station as WPLJ. Berger departed in 1988, replaced immediately by his music director Jessica Ettinger who was named acting program director. Eventually in 1989, general manager Dana Horner hired Gary Bryan from KUBE in Seattle as program director. Bryan also served as morning show host beginning that July, ousting 15-year WPLJ morning host veteran Jim Kerr, and creating an audience outcry. WPLJ continued to be successful until 1990, when ratings started to decline. With significant pop competition ‚Äî WQHT (Hot 97) playing dance and urban pop songs and WHTZ playing mainstream pop music ‚Äî WPLJ dropped the \\"Power\\" slogan and used just its call letters, while musically, the station began leaning toward more pop-rock hits. In May, Bryan left the station to host rival WHTZ's morning zoo program beginning that August. ABC brass then replaced Horner with Mitch Dolan as general manager and president of programming, while Tom Cuddy was named vice president of programming, and Rocky Allen was named as the station's new morning host in August. WPLJ began to regain some momentum, however, in early 1991, when Cuddy and Dolan hired Scott Shannon, who had just left his rock hits project, KQLZ (Pirate Radio) in Los Angeles. Shannon, who was responsible for WHTZ's early success and served as Z100's first morning zoo host, took over as WPLJ's program director and morning show host (replacing Rocky Allen) in April 1991. The station then immediately rebranded as \\"Mojo Radio\\" on April 2 (Shannon's first show was on April 11) and the station began playing mainstream pop music, with ratings improving slightly. After Shannon had a series of morning show co-hosts over the summer, Todd Pettengill joined as his permanent co-host on August 19, 1991, forming Scott & Todd in the Morning. Also, WPLJ began dayparting its programming by leaning towards adult top 40 with more gold and recurrents being played during the daytime hours, while still playing some rhythmic-leaning material during the evening hours. Hot AC era (1992‚Äì2019) By February 1992, the station shifted to what was becoming a popular format: hot adult contemporary (hot AC); at about the same time a slightly different version was being pioneered in Houston at KHMX. In an attempt to differentiate itself from its competitors, WPLJ adopted the slogan \\"No Rap, No Hard Stuff, No Sleepy Elevator Music, Just the Best Songs on the Radio\\". In addition, the \\"Mojo Radio\\" moniker was dropped and the station began using the moniker \\"95-5 PLJ\\" (with the \\"W\\" typically omitted except for legal station identification). The station playlist featured many songs familiar only to New Yorkers and obscure oldies that would not have been typical for the format in other markets. (In a bit of irony, WPLJ may have helped pioneer many of the concepts made popular by the diverse-playlist, music-intensive adult hits format of 2005.) Initially, WPLJ leaned towards 1970s hits as well as mixing in liberal doses of disco and did regular theme weekends featuring one-hit wonders and number-one songs, among others. Eventually, it also dedicated Monday-Saturday nights to playing nothing but 1970s music, hosted by former WKTU disc jockey Al Bandiero, a practice that continued for the next few years. In January 1993, Rocky Allen returned to WPLJ, this time to do afternoon drive for several years, until moving to WABC for the morning drive slot in January 1999. (Allen returned again to WPLJ in late 2005.) In 1995, WPLJ signed an agreement with Usen Group of Tokyo, a 500-channel audio cable system, to carry the station live in real time throughout Japan. Also, from August 7 to 13 of that year, WPLJ was simulcast on Heart 106.2 in London as part of testing transmissions before it signed on September 5 with a hot AC format. In mid-1996, WPLJ began syndicating Scott & Todd to WMTX in Tampa, Florida (where Scott had launched the \\"morning zoo\\" concept into nationwide success) and WKLI-FM in Albany, New York (where Todd would get his first big-market break), with a nationwide syndication deal launching in May 1997. The syndication attempt ended October 16, 1998 as management desired to refocus the show to a local audience. On February 5, 1999, WPLJ abruptly moved to a modern adult contemporary format, a variation of the hot AC format. The station eliminated all 1970s music from the playlist and changed its slogan to \\"New York's Hit Music Station Without the Rap\\" in an attempt to distance themselves from competitors that played rap music. In addition, many on-air personalities exited, including Kristie McIntyre, Danny & Onions, and WPLJ veteran Fast Jimi Roberts. However, modern AC had peaked in 1997-98, and the station transitioned back to a hot AC format, with its playlist consisting of songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and the present. =2000s= In 2005, with ratings in decline, WPLJ once again started to play more music from the 1970s and 1980s. Given its heritage as both a rock station in the 1970s and a pioneering hot AC in the early and mid-1990s, many people in the radio business saw this move as a precursor to the station switching to an adult hits format. However, they were beaten by WCBS-FM, which abruptly switched from oldies to the Jack FM format on June 3, 2005. WPLJ returned to playing music of the late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. While not an overall ratings success, WPLJ had for years been among the more financially successful stations in the New York City market, billing in excess of $40 million per year. WPLJ did extremely well with adult women in the lucrative nine northern New Jersey counties adjacent to New York City. During its top 40 years, WPLJ used jingles from JAM Creative Productions, some of which were packages previously used on sister station WABC during its top 40 days, but since becoming a hot AC station, WPLJ has used jingles from TM Studios. WPLJ and WABC were included in the sale of ABC Radio and the ABC Radio Networks by The Walt Disney Company to Citadel, announced in February 2006 and finalized on June 12, 2007. In late February 2008, the Rocky Allen Showgram featuring Rocky Allen and Blain Ensley was dropped as part of a company-wide series of staff cutbacks at Citadel. On February 16, 2009, WPLJ started airing the syndicated program The Billy Bush Show in the evenings. He was later replaced by local host Ralphie Aversa. In April 2009, WPLJ adopted a new slogan, \\"Scott and Todd in the Morning and Today's Best Music\\". A new logo was introduced that July. 2010s On July 25, 2011, Scott and Todd, with the new addition of Cooper Lawrence, were part of a six-week summer test of 20th Television's nightly entertainment news magazine Dish Nation. In January 2012, 20th announced the return of Dish Nation for a full 52-week season with Scott and Todd as members of its four-city roundtable. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. By October 2011, Nielsen BDS moved rival WWFS (owned by CBS Radio) from the AC panel to the hot AC panel, although Mediabase moved WPLJ to the hot AC panel later that month. This gave New York City two hot adult contemporary stations for the first time since 1998, when WBIX dropped it for a rhythmic oldies format. On February 7, 2014, Scott Shannon announced his retirement from WPLJ after 22 years. Co-host Todd Pettengill immediately took control of the morning show, which re-branded as The Todd Show on February 24. On January 5, 2015, The Todd Show was re-branded to Todd & Jayde in the Morning, with Jayde Donovan joining Pettengill as a co-host. With the change, co-hosts Cooper Lawrence, Fitz, and Meatballs (Richard Deaver Jr.) were all released. Monk (Joe Pardavila), Annie (Anne Marie Leamy), and Johnny on the Street (John Mingione, formerly 'John Online' of WBLI on Long Island) were the other cast members of Todd & Jayde in the Morning. During this time, WPLJ re-added 1980s and 1990s songs to its playlist due to increased competition. However, since most hot AC stations no longer play 1980s music (which is primarily heard nowadays on adult contemporary and classic hits stations), Mediabase moved the station to its AC panel, despite the station following more of a standard hot AC playlist. The station would also add more rhythmic material. By November 2015, the station removed most of the 1980s music from its playlist, thus having Mediabase move the station back to the hot AC panel. =Sale and transition to K-Love= On February 13, 2019, WPLJ and five other Cumulus Media stations were sold to the Rocklin, California-based nonprofit broadcaster, Educational Media Foundation (EMF) for $103.5 million. This transaction would allow Cumulus to generate \\"substantial cash for debt repayment and investment in other business opportunities\\", according to its President and CEO Mary Berner. After the sale received final approval by the FCC, EMF announced that WPLJ and the other Cumulus stations acquired would all begin broadcasting its primary programming service, K-Love, on June 1 at midnight local time; this was later moved up to May 31 at 7:00 p.m., five hours earlier than originally planned. Current and surviving former WPLJ air personalities and staffers gathered together for a farewell celebration, held at The Cutting Room on May 23. It was the first event in what would be a week-long celebration of the station's 48-year run, which continued through the Memorial Day weekend with the station \\"clearing out the library\\" by playing songs from each year between 1971 and the present, along with vintage jingles and sweepers. The penultimate broadcast day on May 30 was filled with guest appearances from WPLJ alumni, including an on-air reunion of Todd Pettengill and his former morning co-host, Scott Shannon. The current airstaff began their goodbyes as well and that continued into May 31, with the final air shift handled by afternoon personality Race Taylor. The last songs heard on WPLJ were \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon‚Äìthe final song played by WABC before their format switch from Top 40 to talk in May 1982‚Äìfollowed by a cover version of \\"W-P-L-J\\" by Hall & Oates, recorded live during a visit by the group to the station several years earlier. Taylor then played the closing lyrics of \\"The End\\" by the Beatles, before offering WPLJ a final toast, completing the closedown at 7 p.m.Aircheck of End of PLJ & Launch of K-Love Following just over a minute of silence, EMF began operating WPLJ as the new New York City outlet of K-Love; K-Love programming had previously been heard in the New York area since May 2011 over Port Chester, New York-licensed WKLV- FM (96.7 FM). EMF changed WKLV-FM's call letters to WARW and its format to secondary service Air1 on July 19, 2019. In addition to converting the 95.5 FM license to noncommercial educational status, EMF also acquired the WPLJ call letters from Cumulus. HD Radio WPLJ signed on digital operations in late 2005. WPLJ-HD1 carries a digital simulcast of the analog signal. The WPLJ-HD2 subchannel originally broadcast all-70s hits, WPLJ 95.5 HD-2 New York - All 70s - March 23, 2006 and then programming from Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel that was distributed by ABC Radio. On July 4, 2014, WPLJ-HD2 flipped to an adult contemporary format known as \\"FAS\\" (referring to former sister station WFAS-FM, which flipped from AC to Urban AC), due to the discontinuation of The True Oldies Channel's distribution. (The \\"FAS\\" programming was also relayed on translator W232AL (94.3 FM), located in White Plains, New York). The FAS programming moved to WPLJ-HD3 (which had previously aired a simulcast of WABC) in autumn 2017, with the Russian-language \\"Russkaya Reklama\\" programming moving from WNEW-FM-HD4 to WPLJ-HD2. On May 1, 2019, the FAS programming on WPLJ-HD3 and W232AL ceased operations. After EMF acquired the station on May 31, 2019, WPLJ-HD2 adopted a simulcast of the Christian- formatted \\"Bridge Radio\\" fed by WRDR in Freehold Township, New Jersey (this would later be moved to WPLJ-HD4, with the K-Love Classics service being installed on the HD2). Also in 2019, WPLJ-HD3 adopted a simulcast of the Christian-formatted \\"Air1\\".

It began as a railway from Clifton via Bury to Rawtenstall, and during its short life grew into a complex network of lines connecting towns and cities including Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackburn. During a period of rapid growth the company acquired several of its competitors, including the Blackburn and Preston Railway, which it purchased to gain access to Preston. It faced competition from companies such as the North Union Railway, and was involved in a notable stand-off in 1849 with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Following several years of discussions, the East Lancashire Railway was in 1859 amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Parts of the network remain in use today, and a section of the original line between Bury and Rawtenstall is now operated as a heritage railway.  History  = Manchester and Bolton Railway = In 1830, the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Company began to promote the construction of a railway along the line of their canal from Salford, to Bolton and Bury. Following an act of parliament to enable them to become a railway company, they built their line from Manchester to Bolton, although on a slightly different alignment than was first planned. This was mainly to preserve the canal for the use of mine traffic, which would not have been provided for if the canal had been infilled and replaced by a railway. A new Act had been required for the new alignment, but due mainly to the objections of the company's engineer, the connection to Bury was never built, as it would have required a tunnel on a gradient of 1 in 100, at the time a difficult and expensive proposition. The new railway therefore became known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway. = Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway = On 14 September 1843, a group of local businessmen including John Grundy, Thomas Wrigley and John Robinson Kay met at a public house in Bury to discuss the creation of a railway connection for the Bury and the Rossendale districts. Their proposed railway offered better facilities than those also proposed by the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;), whose planned connection at Bury would be made with their Heywood branch line from Castleton. The Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company (MB&RR;) was thus created, its purpose to build a railway from Bury to Clifton, where it would connect to the Manchester and Bolton Railway. The company also promoted the idea of extending the line northwards to Rawtenstall. On 4 July 1844 their private bill7 & 8 Vict. c.60 was granted Royal Assent. The Act authorised the company to raise ¬£300,000, and also to borrow ¬£100,000 (¬£ and ¬£ respectively in ). The land between Clifton and Bury, partly owned by the Earl of Derby, John Robinson Kay, William Grant and others, was mostly \\"waste, woodland, pasture or reservoirs, except at Brookbottoms where arable land was avoided by the tunnel\\". Strong financial support was offered to the MB&RR; by local businesses, who were unhappy with the idea of the M&LR; building their own railway. The Manchester and Leeds District Board of Trade produced a report in 1845 which gave their backing to the M&LR; and the line was sanctioned in 1846, however the MB&RR; project was unaffected by this connection. Inspector- General of railways Sir Charles Pasley surveyed the line between Clifton Junction and Rawtenstall, and was reported to be \\"highly pleased\\". Manchester contractors Pauling & Henfry, who tendered ¬£167,529 (¬£ in ), were in May 1844 awarded two contracts to build the Clifton to Bury and Bury to Rawtenstall sections of the new railway. The work was sub-let to smaller contractors and began quickly; in July 1844 the Manchester Guardian wrote a favourable report on the works. However, a shortage of workers in 1845 (reflecting the amount of railway construction underway at that time) meant that some men were asked to work on Sundays, resulting in some being charged with breaking the Sabbath. Further difficulties prompted the dismissal of the original contractors, their place being taken by John Waring. A graph of the gradient between Bury and Rawtenstall A map of the East Lancashire Railway network before its amalgamation with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway The railway ran north from Clifton through a cutting at Outwood. This required the removal of about of earth. It then passed north-east through Radcliffe Bridge and Withins station,Withins station closed in 1851 - Wells (1995) p. 10. and from there into Bury Bolton street station. From Bury, it ran through Summerseat, Ramsbottom, Stubbins and finally to Rawtenstall. The railway climbed a constant gradient, across a mixture of viaducts, tunnels, cuttings and embankments, one of which, the mile‚Äìlong section from Ramsbottom to Stubbins, was substantial. The extant Clifton Viaduct was built to cross the River Irwell, which flowed below, and also the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal. Its largest span is wide. = Expansion = By 1844, the Blackburn and Preston Railway (B&PR;), who shared a viaduct across the River Ribble with the North Union Railway (NUR), were planning a railway from Blackburn to Farington.7 & 8 Vict. c.34 Following an 1845 act9 & 10 Vict. c.302 the B&PR; was absorbed by the MB&RR; on 3 August 1846. The B&PR;'s Act of Parliament also allowed for a connection with the proposed Blackburn, Burnley, Accrington and Colne Extension Railway (BBA&CER;), which would run from Stubbins Junction to Accrington, providing a direct link between Blackburn and Colne. A second BBA&CER; act allowed it to lease or sell itself to the MB&RR;, and so in 1845 the two companies joined. The MB&RR; later that year changed its name to the East Lancashire Railway (ELR). The following year, the ELR acquired the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway (LO&PR;),9 & 10 Vict. c. 381 which gave it direct access to Liverpool Docks. The LO&PR;'s line would run from a junction with the Liverpool and Bury Railway at Walton-on-the-Hill to a junction with the B&PR.; The enabling act also allowed the LO&PR; to build further branch lines, and the ELR obtained further acts including one which allowed it to build a connection to Preston. Following the acquisition on 3 August 1846, a disagreement ensued over traffic priorities and arrangements for the ELR at the NUR's station in Preston. The ELR proposed a new station and a separate line with a new crossing of the Ribble, but this proved controversial; Preston Corporation petitioned against the proposed line, producing a series of witnesses who attested to the damage they presumed would be caused by the embankment necessary for the scheme to proceed. Several members of the corporation were also shareholders of the rival Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway, and the petition's proposer was brother-in-law to a director of the rival Manchester and Leeds Railway. In the end the ELR won its bid, but had to landscape its embankment (which later became the dividing line between Avenham and Miller Parks), make an ornamental arch for carriages and pedestrians crossing under the railway, and build a footbridge on the river viaduct. Meanwhile, the former MB&RR; line from Clifton to Rawtenstall was inaugurated on Friday 25 September 1846. Surveyed two days earlier by the Inspector-General of railways, Charles Pasley, who was reportedly satisfied with the project, upwards of 1,000 invitations were delivered to local people, shareholders and other interested parties. They gathered at the new Hunts Bank station in Manchester. Leaving Manchester, the train stopped near Philips Park to collect chairman John Hodges, before continuing to Radcliffe Bridge to collect more passengers. Large crowds were gathered along the course of the railway. In Bury, the train was extended to about 30 carriages and three engines, and more passengers were collected before the train finished its journey in Rawtenstall. Passengers were provided with a large meal in a closed-off section of a power-loom shed owned by John Robinson Kay. They listened to several celebratory speeches, before re- embarking the train to head home. The railway was opened to the general public on the following Monday. In November 1846 the company submitted proposals for a new line from Buckley Wells (south of Bury) through Whitefield and Prestwich, to a new terminus at Victoria Station. The plan did not progress any further than the initial planning stages; Whitefield and Prestwich eventually got their own railway stations in 1879. In two years the ELR grew from a company authorised to build of railway into one with the authority to build of railway. In February 1848 with of track open, the company reported for the week ending 5 February 1848 an annual income of ¬£553 18s 8d (¬£ in ) for passengers and parcels, and ¬£498 10s 4d for freight (¬£ in ) ‚Äì almost double the previous year's income. By March 1848 the line between Rawtenstall and Newchurch was complete, followed in June by the Blackburn to Accrington connection (), and, in August, the Stubbins junction to Accrington section. The line was extended east to Burnley () by September 1848, and, in February 1849, from Burnley to Colne, where it made an end-on junction with the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway, providing the ELR with a connection to Bradford and Leeds. The LO&PR; line to Lostock Hall () was completed on 2 April 1849, and the () extension into Preston station opened on 2 September 1850. The line ran into new platforms built on the east side of the NUR's station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. More lines followed with a connection between Newchurch and Bacup by October 1852, and the Ormskirk to Rainford Skelmersdale Branch in March 1858. A three-mile long line to Tottington opened in 1882 from a junction with the original MB&BR; line. It was electrified in 1913 before reverting to steam in 1951. It closed to passengers in 1952 and goods in 1963 and has since been reclaimed as a walkway. = Clifton Junction = In 1846, the Manchester and Bolton Railway (whose line the ELR used to gain access to Manchester) was taken over by the Manchester and Leeds Railway,9 & 10 Vict. c.378 which, the following year, became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;). The ELR's expansion and the opening of new routes‚Äîincluding an alternative route between Manchester and Leeds‚Äîhad caused a degree of consternation at the L&YR;, but the two companies initially managed to work together successfully. After about three years a dispute flared up over the collection of tolls for the ELR's use of the line. The ELR had become accustomed to running their trains on to the L&YR; line and then later declaring of the number of passengers liable for a toll but, in March 1849, the L&YR; insisted that ELR trains stop at Clifton so that passenger numbers and tickets could be checked by their own employees. The ELR accused the L&YR; of trying to impede their traffic, particularly as they had recently gained a connection to Bradford, in competition with the L&YR.; They stated that the L&YR; had access to their accounts, and to the returns made by their staff. On the morning of 12 March 1849, despite the presence of police from Bury and Pendleton, the L&YR; placed a large baulk of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it. Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold. The L&YR; also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the up line to the city. Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey. An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped. L&YR; employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station. ELR employees then removed the baulk of timber, and in an effort to push the L&YR; train out of the way, drove their train forward. The L&YR; had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L&YR; train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train. The ELR then blocked the L&YR; down line with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L&YR; train. The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the Blackburn and Darwen Railway, building up on each side of the blockage. The situation was eventually defused when the L&YR; withdrew their train. The General Manager of the ELR, Richard Hacking, wrote to The Times newspaper expressing his annoyance at the L&YR;'s tactics. He claimed to have received a letter from the company sent on 9 March 1849 informing him of proposed changes to operational procedures resulting from a near-collision at Clifton Junction. The first change was that ELR trains would at all times give way to L&YR; trains on the Manchester and Bolton line; a stop signal was to be placed along the ELR line from the junction, to be activated whenever a L&YR; train was in sight. The second change was that \\"for the safety of the public\\" all ELR trains would be required to stop before the points at the junction, where all passenger tickets to Manchester would be collected by L&YR; employees. A daily return would be required of all passengers and other freight booked from Salford \\"for the purpose of keeping regularly and balancing punctually the accounts of the two companies\\". Hacking claimed to have replied stating that the near-collision had occurred because the L&YR;'s engine driver had ignored a signal at Clifton Junction, and that the ELR would not accept the changes requested by the L&YR.; The ELR refused to supply tickets at any point, although they considered it reasonable to supply more information on their traffic using the L&YR; line. The disused Clifton Viaduct. It crosses the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal and the River Irwell. Clifton Junction is to the south of the viaduct. Now a Grade II listed structure, the bridge is presently closed to pedestrians. Hacking stated that he had received a letter from the L&YR; porter at Clifton requesting that all ELR trains stop at Clifton Junction so that tickets could be collected by L&YR; staff, and that all ELR goods trains would have to supply invoices at the junction. In his letter he concluded that the purpose of the L&YR;'s demands was to impede the flow of ELR traffic to Manchester and onwards to Yorkshire. Hacking's account of the events of 12 March is similar to that reported by The Times. He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L&YR; clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester. On his arrival there, he saw L&YR; employees ready to pull up the rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact. He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L&YR; employees had recently left for the station. He blamed the Managing Director of the L&YR;, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the baulk of timber. Hacking also mentions an approaching up- train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the down line to bypass it ‚Äì in the face of oncoming traffic. Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the down line, changing the signals accordingly. Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L&YR; train to move, effectively resolving the dispute. heritage East Lancashire Railway The matter was so serious that it was raised in the House of Commons. It was eventually settled in court, with the ELR thereon making a pro rata payment according to the distance travelled on each railway. The court also found in favour of the L&YR; who had argued that the original agreement to share the line did not extend to a vastly extended ELR network. The amount of compensation to the L&YR; was left at the discretion of both companies. Relations between the two companies were, therefore, not entirely amicable. In 1853 the ELR made further proposals for a new line from Clifton to Salford, roughly parallel to the L&YR; line, however in 1854 an agreement between the two companies meant that the Clifton Junction to Salford line was vested jointly in both companies. Amalgamation had been discussed since the early 1850s and in 1859, by an act of parliament, the ELR was absorbed by the L&YR.; = Closure and legacy = Ringley Road station is on a popular route for pedestrians, cyclists, and horse riders Following the Beeching Axe parts of the ELR's network were closed. The original MB&RR; line between Clifton Junction and Bury closed in 1966 (although Radcliffe Bridge station was closed in 1958), but the line between Bury and Rawtenstall continued to serve passengers until 1972 and freight until 1980. This section is now used by the East Lancashire Railway, a modern heritage railway opened in 1987. The trackbed between Clifton and Radcliffe now forms a part of the Irwell Sculpture Trail. The connection from Stubbins to Accrington was closed in 1966. The ELR line across the Ribble between Preston and Bamber Bridge was closed to passengers in 1968, and to goods four years later. The East Lancashire platforms 10‚Äì13 were demolished along with Butler Street Goods Yard. The line between Preston and Colne survives as the East Lancashire Line, operated by Northern. The Skelmersdale Branch was closed to passengers in 1956 and to all traffic seven years later,Marshall, J. (1981) Forgotten Railways North-West England, David & Charles (Publishers) Ltd, Newton Abbott. , p.93 however a proposal exists to reopen the line as far as Skelmersdale. Services between Liverpool and Ormskirk are now operated by Merseyrail.  Locomotives  The ELR used a range of locomotives. One of its earliest orders was for twelve Long Boiler 2-2-2s from Fenton, Craven and Company (at least one of these was used on the inauguration of the railway), but dissatisfied with the locomotives they accepted only four,. Four were diverted to the Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester Railway, and two to the Eastern Counties Railway. In 1848, the ELR's four 2-2-2s were rebuilt as 2-4-0s by R and W Hawthorn. In about 1858, they were again rebuilt as 0-6-0s by Sylvester Lees. Richard Walker, a director of the ELR between 1838 and 1854, was the supplier of about twenty locomotives to the company, including, in the 1850s, four 2-4-0s and several 0-6-0s. Walker, Richard & Brother supplied four 2-2-2 locomotives, Medusa, Hecate, Diomed and Lynx. All were later rebuilt as a 2-4-0 tank engine. In 1847, two 0-4-2s were supplied by R and W Hawthorn, rebuilt in 1868 as 2-4-0s. In 1845 the MB&RR; ordered four 0-6-0s from the Haigh Foundry, and a fifth engine from Fenton, Craven and Company. Another engine was built by Haigh in 1848. The largest ELR class was a series of outside-frame 2-4-0s with cylinders and driving wheels. Some may have originated as 2-2-2s, and some were later rebuilt as 2-4-0 tank engines. One was rebuilt as a 2-4-0 saddle tank engine. These were among the last locomotives to be built in Bury. Other manufacturers to supply the ELR were Sharp, Roberts and Company, Stothert, Slaughter and Company, and Beyer, Peacock and Company. The ELR livery for passenger locomotives was dark green with red brown frames, and polished domes and safety valves.  Infrastructure  = Station buildings = Ormskirk railway station in 1915 Station buildings generally followed one of three designs. The principal stations at Bury and Accrington were based on the same design by a Manchester-based firm of architects. Most of the other stations were designed by the company's resident engineer. They were stone-built and consisted of a station master's room, adjoining a seated waiting area, a ladies waiting room and the booking office. The third and cheapest design followed the standard design but utilised brick and timber as materials. The platform was normally roofed. = Signals = Track signals were based on two designs‚Äîstation signals on posts, each post with two moveable arms‚Äîand portable signals; flags were used by day, and coloured lanterns at night. The signals on posts were patented semaphore designs from J Stevens & Son. Each post had two arms‚Äîlinked by chain to a foot control at the base‚Äîwhich were used to alert drivers on both the up and down lines. Each foot control was held in place by a hook on the post. An arm set at an angle would indicate that the train should approach slowly, before stopping at the station. The same arm set vertically (and out of sight) would indicate that the train could pass through without stopping. The posts were also illuminated to allow use at night. Signals at Accrington station were more complex, linked to the station building with wires, and by default set at 'stop' when released. The coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side (stop), green on another (go slowly), and clear on the third (proceed). = Rails = The line was standard gauge and most sections used rails in lengths, each weighing 75 lb/yard (31.1 kg/m), fixed to wooden sleepers long and apart.  Accidents  In the early history of the railways accidents were not uncommon, and the ELR was no exception. Several incidents were reported in The Times. During Whitsuntide 1849, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision with an excursion train near Burnley, Lancashire. Despite efforts to protect the rear of the passenger train, another excursion train was in a rear-end collision with it. In January 1850, three people died when a luggage train ran into a passenger train at Maghull railway station. A serious accident occurred at Clifton Junction on 19 October 1851 when a passenger train derailed passing the points on the junction, injuring several passengers, some seriously. In September 1866 a man died after jumping from the train from Blackburn. A non- fatal collision occurred at Lostock Hall railway station in November 1876. Inclement weather was also a problem; in January 1867 trains were delayed for several hours at due to snow on the line, and on 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from Preston railway station.

The navy was instrumental in the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean Basin, but it never enjoyed the prestige of the Roman legions. Throughout their history, the Romans remained a primarily land-based people and relied partially on their more nautically inclined subjects, such as the Greeks and the Egyptians, to build their ships. Because of that, the navy was never completely embraced by the Roman state, and deemed somewhat \\"un-Roman\\". In antiquity, navies and trading fleets did not have the logistical autonomy that modern ships and fleets possess, and unlike modern naval forces, the Roman navy even at its height never existed as an autonomous service but operated as an adjunct to the Roman army. During the course of the First Punic War, the Roman navy was massively expanded and played a vital role in the Roman victory and the Roman Republic's eventual ascension to hegemony in the Mediterranean Sea. In the course of the first half of the 2nd century BC, Rome went on to destroy Carthage and subdue the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean, achieving complete mastery of the inland sea, which they called Mare Nostrum. The Roman fleets were again prominent in the 1st century BC in the wars against the pirates, and in the civil wars that brought down the Republic, whose campaigns ranged across the Mediterranean. In 31 BC, the great naval Battle of Actium ended the civil wars culminating in the final victory of Augustus and the establishment of the Roman Empire. During the Imperial period, the Mediterranean became largely a peaceful \\"Roman lake\\". In the absence of a maritime enemy, the navy was reduced mostly to patrol, anti- piracy and transport duties. By far, the navy's most vital task was to ensure Roman grain imports were shipped and delivered to the capital unimpeded across the Mediterranean. The navy also manned and maintained craft on major frontier rivers such as the Rhine and the Danube for supplying the army. On the fringes of the Empire, in new conquests or, increasingly, in defense against barbarian invasions, the Roman fleets were still engaged in open warfare. The decline of the Empire in the 3rd century took a heavy toll on the navy, which was reduced to a shadow of its former self, both in size and in combat ability. As successive waves of the V√∂lkerwanderung crashed on the land frontiers of the battered Empire, the navy could only play a secondary role. In the early 5th century, the Roman frontiers were breached, and barbarian kingdoms appeared on the shores of the western Mediterranean. One of them, the Vandal Kingdom, raised a navy of its own and raided the shores of the Mediterranean, even sacking Rome, while the diminished Roman fleets were incapable of offering any resistance. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century. The navy of the surviving eastern Roman Empire is known as the Byzantine navy.  History  = Early Republic = The exact origins of the Roman fleet are obscure. A traditionally agricultural and land-based society, the Romans rarely ventured out to sea, unlike their Etruscan neighbours. There is evidence of Roman warships in the early 4th century BC, such as mention of a warship that carried an embassy to Delphi in 394 BC, but at any rate, the Roman fleet, if it existed, was negligible. The traditional birth date of the Roman navy is set at ca. 311 BC, when, after the conquest of Campania, two new officials, the duumviri navales classis ornandae reficiendaeque causa, were tasked with the maintenance of a fleet.Livy, AUC IX.30; XL.18,26; XLI.1 As a result, the Republic acquired its first fleet, consisting of 20 ships, most likely triremes, with each duumvir commanding a squadron of 10 ships. However, the Republic continued to rely mostly on her legions for expansion in Italy; the navy was most likely geared towards combating piracy and lacked experience in naval warfare, being easily defeated in 282 BC by the Tarentines. This situation continued until the First Punic War: the main task of the Roman fleet was patrolling along the Italian coast and rivers, protecting seaborne trade from piracy. Whenever larger tasks had to be undertaken, such as the naval blockade of a besieged city, the Romans called on the allied Greek cities of southern Italy, the socii navales, to provide ships and crews.Goldsworthy (2003), p. 34 It is possible that the supervision of these maritime allies was one of the duties of the four new praetores classici, who were established in 267 BC.Goldsworthy (2000), p. 97  First Punic War  The first Roman expedition outside mainland Italy was against the island of Sicily in 265 BC. This led to the outbreak of hostilities with Carthage, which would last until 241 BC. At the time, the Punic city was the unchallenged master of the western Mediterranean, possessing a long maritime and naval experience and a large fleet. Although Rome had relied on her legions for the conquest of Italy, operations in Sicily had to be supported by a fleet, and the ships available by Rome's allies were insufficient. Thus in 261 BC, the Roman Senate set out to construct a fleet of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes. According to Polybius, the Romans seized a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme, and used it as a blueprint for their own ships.Polybius, The Histories, I.20‚Äì21 The new fleets were commanded by the annually elected Roman magistrates, but naval expertise was provided by the lower officers, who continued to be provided by the socii, mostly Greeks. This practice was continued until well into the Empire, something also attested by the direct adoption of numerous Greek naval terms.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 166 Three- banked (\\"trireme\\") Roman quinquereme with the Corvus boarding bridge. The use of the Corvus negated the superior Carthaginian naval expertise, and allowed the Romans to establish their naval superiority in the western Mediterranean. Despite the massive buildup, the Roman crews remained inferior in naval experience to the Carthaginians, and could not hope to match them in naval tactics, which required great maneuverability and experience. They, therefore, employed a novel weapon that transformed sea warfare to their advantage. They equipped their ships with the corvus, possibly developed earlier by the Syracusans against the Athenians. This was a long plank with a spike for hooking onto enemy ships. Using it as a boarding bridge, marines were able to board an enemy ship, transforming sea combat into a version of land combat, where the Roman legionaries had the upper hand. However, it is believed that the Corvus' weight made the ships unstable, and could capsize a ship in rough seas.Goldsworthy (2003), p. 38 Although the first sea engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lipari Islands in 260 BC, was a defeat for Rome, the forces involved were relatively small. Through the use of the Corvus, the fledgling Roman navy under Gaius Duilius won its first major engagement later that year at the Battle of Mylae. During the course of the war, Rome continued to be victorious at sea: victories at Sulci (258 BC) and Tyndaris (257 BC) were followed by the massive Battle of Cape Ecnomus, where the Roman fleet under the consuls Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius inflicted a severe defeat on the Carthaginians. This string of successes allowed Rome to push the war further across the sea to Africa and Carthage itself. Continued Roman success also meant that their navy gained significant experience, although it also suffered a number of catastrophic losses due to storms, while conversely, the Carthaginian navy suffered from attrition. The Battle of Drepana in 249 BC resulted in the only major Carthaginian sea victory, forcing the Romans to equip a new fleet from donations by private citizens. In the last battle of the war, at Aegates Islands in 241 BC, the Romans under Gaius Lutatius Catulus displayed superior seamanship to the Carthaginians, notably using their rams rather than the now-abandoned Corvus to achieve victory.  Illyria and the Second Punic War  as coin of the second half of the 3rd century BC, featuring the prow of a galley, most likely a quinquereme. Several similar issues are known, illustrating the importance of naval power during that period of Rome's history. After the Roman victory, the balance of naval power in the Western Mediterranean had shifted from Carthage to Rome. This ensured Carthaginian acquiescence to the conquest of Sardinia and Corsica, and also enabled Rome to deal decisively with the threat posed by the Illyrian pirates in the Adriatic. The Illyrian Wars marked Rome's first involvement with the affairs of the Balkan peninsula.Gruen (1984), p. 359. Initially, in 229 BC, a fleet of 200 warships was sent against Queen Teuta, and swiftly expelled the Illyrian garrisons from the Greek coastal cities of modern-day Albania. Ten years later, the Romans sent another expedition in the area against Demetrius of Pharos, who had rebuilt the Illyrian navy and engaged in piracy up into the Aegean. Demetrius was supported by Philip V of Macedon, who had grown anxious at the expansion of Roman power in Illyria. The Romans were again quickly victorious and expanded their Illyrian protectorate, but the beginning of the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC) forced them to divert their resources westwards for the next decades. Due to Rome's command of the seas, Hannibal, Carthage's great general, was forced to eschew a sea-borne invasion, instead choosing to bring the war over land to the Italian peninsula. Unlike the first war, the navy played little role on either side in this war. The only naval encounters occurred in the first years of the war, at Lilybaeum (218 BC) and the Ebro River (217 BC), both resulting Roman victories. Despite an overall numerical parity, for the remainder of the war the Carthaginians did not seriously challenge Roman supremacy. The Roman fleet was hence engaged primarily with raiding the shores of Africa and guarding Italy, a task which included the interception of Carthaginian convoys of supplies and reinforcements for Hannibal's army, as well as keeping an eye on a potential intervention by Carthage's ally, Philip V. The only major action in which the Roman fleet was involved was the siege of Syracuse in 214‚Äì212 BC with 130 ships under Marcus Claudius Marcellus. The siege is remembered for the ingenious inventions of Archimedes, such as mirrors that burned ships or the so-called \\"Claw of Archimedes\\", which kept the besieging army at bay for two years. A fleet of 160 vessels was assembled to support Scipio Africanus' army in Africa in 202 BC, and, should his expedition fail, evacuate his men. In the event, Scipio achieved a decisive victory at Zama, and the subsequent peace stripped Carthage of its fleet.

Rome was now the undisputed master of the Western Mediterranean, and turned her gaze from defeated Carthage to the Hellenistic world. Small Roman forces had already been engaged in the First Macedonian War, when, in 214 BC, a fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus had successfully thwarted Philip V from invading Illyria with his newly built fleet. The rest of the war was carried out mostly by Rome's allies, the Aetolian League and later the Kingdom of Pergamon, but a combined Roman‚ÄìPergamene fleet of ca. 60 ships patrolled the Aegean until the war's end in 205 BC. In this conflict, Rome, still embroiled in the Punic War, was not interested in expanding her possessions, but rather in thwarting the growth of Philip's power in Greece. The war ended in an effective stalemate, and was renewed in 201 BC, when Philip V invaded Asia Minor. A naval battle off Chios ended in a costly victory for the Pergamene‚ÄìRhodian alliance, but the Macedonian fleet lost many warships, including its flagship, a deceres. Soon after, Pergamon and Rhodes appealed to Rome for help, and the Republic was drawn into the Second Macedonian War. In view of the massive Roman naval superiority, the war was fought on land, with the Macedonian fleet, already weakened at Chios, not daring to venture out of its anchorage at Demetrias. After the crushing Roman victory at Cynoscephalae, the terms imposed on Macedon were harsh, and included the complete disbandment of her navy. Almost immediately following the defeat of Macedon, Rome became embroiled in a war with the Seleucid Empire. This war too was decided mainly on land, although the combined Roman‚ÄìRhodian navy also achieved victories over the Seleucids at Myonessus and Eurymedon. These victories, which were invariably concluded with the imposition of peace treaties that prohibited the maintenance of anything but token naval forces, spelled the disappearance of the Hellenistic royal navies, leaving Rome and her allies unchallenged at sea. Coupled with the final destruction of Carthage, and the end of Macedon's independence, by the latter half of the 2nd century BC, Roman control over all of what was later to be dubbed mare nostrum (\\"our sea\\") had been established. Subsequently, the Roman navy was drastically reduced, depending on its Socii navales.Connolly (1998), p. 273 = Late Republic =  Mithridates and the pirate threat  Pompey the Great. His swift and decisive campaign against the pirates re- established Rome's control over the Mediterranean sea lanes. In the absence of a strong naval presence however, piracy flourished throughout the Mediterranean, especially in Cilicia, but also in Crete and other places, further reinforced by money and warships supplied by King Mithridates VI of Pontus, who hoped to enlist their aid in his wars against Rome.Appian, The Mithridatic Wars, ¬ß 92 In the First Mithridatic War (89‚Äì85 BC), Sulla had to requisition ships wherever he could find them to counter Mithridates' fleet. Despite the makeshift nature of the Roman fleet however, in 86 BC Lucullus defeated the Pontic navy at Tenedos.Starr (1989), p. 62 Immediately after the end of the war, a permanent force of ca. 100 vessels was established in the Aegean from the contributions of Rome's allied maritime states. Although sufficient to guard against Mithridates, this force was totally inadequate against the pirates, whose power grew rapidly. Over the next decade, the pirates defeated several Roman commanders, and raided unhindered even to the shores of Italy, reaching Rome's harbor, Ostia.Cassius Dio, Historia Romana, XXXVI.22 According to the account of Plutarch, \\"the ships of the pirates numbered more than a thousand, and the cities captured by them four hundred.\\"Plutarch, Life of Pompey, ¬ß 24 Their activity posed a growing threat for the Roman economy, and a challenge to Roman power: several prominent Romans, including two praetors with their retinue and the young Julius Caesar, were captured and held for ransom. Perhaps most important of all, the pirates disrupted Rome's vital lifeline, namely the massive shipments of grain and other produce from Africa and Egypt that were needed to sustain the city's population.Appian, The Mithridatic Wars, ¬ß 93 The resulting grain shortages were a major political issue, and popular discontent threatened to become explosive. In 74 BC, with the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War, Marcus Antonius (the father of Mark Antony) was appointed praetor with extraordinary imperium against the pirate threat, but signally failed in his task: he was defeated off Crete in 72 BC, and died shortly after.Goldsworthy (2007), p. 186 Finally, in 67 BC the Lex Gabinia was passed in the Plebeian Council, vesting Pompey with unprecedented powers and authorizing him to move against them.Appian, The Mithridatic Wars, ¬ß 94 In a massive and concerted campaign, Pompey cleared the seas of the pirates in only three months.Appian, The Mithridatic Wars, ¬ß 95‚Äì¬ß 96 Afterwards, the fleet was reduced again to policing duties against intermittent piracy.  Caesar and the Civil Wars  In 56 BC, for the first time a Roman fleet engaged in battle outside the Mediterranean. This occurred during Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars, when the maritime tribe of the Veneti rebelled against Rome. Against the Veneti, the Romans were at a disadvantage, since they did not know the coast, and were inexperienced in fighting in the open sea with its tides and currents.Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, III.9 Furthermore, the Veneti ships were superior to the light Roman galleys. They were built of oak and had no oars, being thus more resistant to ramming. In addition, their greater height gave them an advantage in both missile exchanges and boarding actions.Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, III.13 In the event, when the two fleets encountered each other in Quiberon Bay, Caesar's navy, under the command of D. Brutus, resorted to the use of hooks on long poles, which cut the halyards supporting the Veneti sails.Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, III.14 Immobile, the Veneti ships were easy prey for the legionaries who boarded them, and fleeing Veneti ships were taken when they became becalmed by a sudden lack of winds.Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, III.15 Having thus established his control of the English Channel, in the next years Caesar used this newly built fleet to carry out two invasions of Britain. Silver denarius struck by Sextus Pompeius in 44‚Äì43 BC, featuring a bust of Pompey the Great and a Roman warship. The last major campaigns of the Roman navy in the Mediterranean until the late 3rd century AD would be in the civil wars that ended the Republic. In the East, the Republican faction quickly established its control, and Rhodes, the last independent maritime power in the Aegean, was subdued by Gaius Cassius Longinus in 43 BC, after its fleet was defeated off Kos. In the West, against the triumvirs stood Sextus Pompeius, who had been given command of the Italian fleet by the Senate in 43 BC. He took control of Sicily and made it his base, blockading Italy and stopping the politically crucial supply of grain from Africa to Rome. After suffering a defeat from Sextus in 42 BC, Octavian initiated massive naval armaments, aided by his closest associate, Marcus Agrippa: ships were built at Ravenna and Ostia, the new artificial harbor of Portus Julius built at Cumae, and soldiers and rowers levied, including over 20,000 manumitted slaves. Finally, Octavian and Agrippa defeated Sextus in the Battle of Naulochus in 36 BC, putting an end to all Pompeian resistance. The Battle of Actium, by Laureys a Castro, painted 1672. Octavian's power was further enhanced after his victory against the combined fleets of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, where Antony had assembled 500 ships against Octavian's 400 ships. This last naval battle of the Roman Republic definitively established Octavian as the sole ruler over Rome and the Mediterranean world. In the aftermath of his victory, he formalized the Fleet's structure, establishing several key harbors in the Mediterranean (see below). The now fully professional navy had its main duties consist of protecting against piracy, escorting troops and patrolling the river frontiers of Europe. It remained however engaged in active warfare in the periphery of the Empire. = Principate =  Operations under Augustus  Under Augustus and after the conquest of Egypt there were increasing demands from the Roman economy to extend the trade lanes to India. The Arabian control of all sea routes to India was an obstacle. One of the first naval operations under princeps Augustus was therefore the preparation for a campaign on the Arabian Peninsula. Aelius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt ordered the construction of 130 transports and subsequently carried 10,000 soldiers to Arabia. But the following march through the desert towards Yemen failed and the plans for control of the Arabian peninsula had to be abandoned. At the other end of the Empire, in Germania, the navy played an important role in the supply and transport of the legions. In 15 BC an independent fleet was installed at the Lake Constance. Later, the generals Drusus and Tiberius used the Navy extensively, when they tried to extend the Roman frontier to the Elbe. In 12 BC Drusus ordered the construction of a fleet of 1,000 ships and sailed them along the Rhine into the North Sea.Tacitus, The Annals II.6 The Frisii and Chauci had nothing to oppose the superior numbers, tactics and technology of the Romans. When these entered the river mouths of Weser and Ems, the local tribes had to surrender. In 5 BC the Roman knowledge concerning the North and Baltic Sea was fairly extended during a campaign by Tiberius, reaching as far as the Elbe: Plinius describes how Roman naval formations came past Heligoland and set sail to the north-eastern coast of Denmark, and Augustus himself boasts in his Res Gestae: \\"My fleet sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea...\\".Res Gestae, 26.4 The multiple naval operations north of Germania had to be abandoned after the battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the year 9 AD.  Julio-Claudian dynasty  In the years 15 and 16, Germanicus carried out several fleet operations along the rivers Rhine and Ems, without permanent results due to grim Germanic resistance and a disastrous storm.Webster & Elton (1998), pp. 160‚Äì161 By 28, the Romans lost further control of the Rhine mouth in a succession of Frisian insurgencies. From 43 to 85, the Roman navy played an important role in the Roman conquest of Britain. The classis Germanica rendered outstanding services in multitudinous landing operations. In 46, a naval expedition made a push deep into the Black Sea region and even travelled on the Tanais. In 47 a revolt by the Chauci, who took to piratical activities along the Gallic coast, was subdued by Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 161 By 57 an expeditionary corps reached Chersonesos (see Charax, Crimea). It seems that under Nero, the navy obtained strategically important positions for trading with India; but there was no known fleet in the Red Sea. Possibly, parts of the Alexandrian fleet were operating as escorts for the Indian trade. In the Jewish revolt, from 66 to 70, the Romans were forced to fight Jewish ships, operating from a harbour in the area of modern Tel Aviv, on Israel's Mediterranean coast. In the meantime several flotilla engagements on the Sea of Galilee took place. In 68, as his reign became increasingly insecure, Nero raised legio I Adiutrix from sailors of the praetorian fleets. After Nero's overthrow, in 69, the \\"Year of the four emperors\\", the praetorian fleets supported Emperor Otho against the usurper Vitellius,Tacitus, The Histories, II.12 and after his eventual victory, Vespasian formed another legion, legio II Adiutrix, from their ranks.Tacitus, The Histories, II.67 Only in the Pontus did Anicetus, the commander of the Classis Pontica, support Vitellius. He burned the fleet, and sought refuge with the Iberian tribes, engaging in piracy. After a new fleet was built, this revolt was subdued.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 164  Flavian, Antonine and Severan dynasties  Two-banked lburnians of the Danube fleets during Trajan's Dacian Wars. Casts of reliefs from Trajan's Column, Rome. Mosaic of a Roman galley, Bardo Museum, Tunisia, 2nd century AD. During the Batavian rebellion of Gaius Julius Civilis (69‚Äì70), the rebels got hold of a squadron of the Rhine fleet by treachery,Tacitus, The Histories, IV.16 and the conflict featured frequent use of the Roman Rhine flotilla. In the last phase of the war, the British fleet and legio XIV were brought in from Britain to attack the Batavian coast, but the Cananefates, allies of the Batavians, were able to destroy or capture a large part of the fleet.Tacitus, The Histories, IV.79 In the meantime, the new Roman commander, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, advanced north and constructed a new fleet. Civilis attempted only a short encounter with his own fleet, but could not hinder the superior Roman force from landing and ravaging the island of the Batavians, leading to the negotiation of a peace soon after.Tacitus, The Histories, V.23‚Äì25 In the years 82 to 85, the Romans under Gnaeus Julius Agricola launched a campaign against the Caledonians in modern Scotland. In this context the Roman navy significantly escalated activities on the eastern Scottish coast.Tacitus, Agricola, 25; 29 Simultaneously multiple expeditions and reconnaissance trips were launched. During these the Romans would capture the Orkney Islands (Orcades) for a short period of time and obtained information about the Shetland Islands.Tacitus, Agricola, 10 There is some speculation about a Roman landing in Ireland, based on Tacitus reports about Agricola contemplating the island's conquest,Tacitus, Agricola, 24 but no conclusive evidence to support this theory has been found. Under the Five Good Emperors the navy operated mainly on the rivers; so it played an important role during Trajan's conquest of Dacia and temporarily an independent fleet for the Euphrates and Tigris rivers was founded. Also during the wars against the Marcomanni confederation under Marcus Aurelius several combats took place on the Danube and the Tisza. Under the aegis of the Severan dynasty, the only known military operations of the navy were carried out under Septimius Severus, using naval assistance on his campaigns along the Euphrates and Tigris, as well as in Scotland. Thereby Roman ships reached inter alia the Persian Gulf and the top of the British Isles.  3rd century crisis  As the 3rd century dawned, the Roman Empire was at its peak. In the Mediterranean, peace had reigned for over two centuries, as piracy had been wiped out and no outside naval threats occurred. As a result, complacency had set in: naval tactics and technology were neglected, and the Roman naval system had become moribund.Lewis & Runyan (1985), p. 3 After 230 however and for fifty years, the situation changed dramatically. The so-called \\"Crisis of the Third Century\\" ushered a period of internal turmoil, and the same period saw a renewed series of seaborne assaults, which the imperial fleets proved unable to stem.Lewis & Runyan (1985), p. 4 In the West, Picts and Irish ships raided Britain, while the Saxons raided the North Sea, forcing the Romans to abandon Frisia. In the East, the Goths and other tribes from modern Ukraine raided in great numbers over the Black Sea.Casson (1991), p. 213 These invasions began during the rule of Trebonianus Gallus, when for the first time Germanic tribes built up their own powerful fleet in the Black Sea. Via two surprise attacks (256) on Roman naval bases in the Caucasus and near the Danube, numerous ships fell into the hands of the Germans, whereupon the raids were extended as far as the Aegean Sea; Byzantium, Athens, Sparta and other towns were plundered and the responsible provincial fleets were heavily debilitated. It was not until the attackers made a tactical error, that their onrush could be stopped. In 267‚Äì270 another, much fiercer series of attacks took place. A fleet composed of Heruli and other tribes raided the coasts of Thrace and the Pontus. Defeated off Byzantium by general Venerianus,Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Gallienii, 13.6‚Äì7 the barbarians fled into the Aegean, and ravaged many islands and coastal cities, including Athens and Corinth. As they retreated northwards over land, they were defeated by Emperor Gallienus at Nestos.Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Gallienii, 13.8‚Äì9 However, this was merely the prelude to an even larger invasion that was launched in 268/269: several tribes banded together (the Historia Augusta mentions Scythians, Greuthungi, Tervingi, Gepids, Peucini, Celts and Heruli) and allegedly 2,000 ships and 325,000 men strong,Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Divi Claudii, 6.2‚Äì4; 8.1 raided the Thracian shore, attacked Byzantium and continued raiding the Aegean as far as Crete, while the main force approached Thessalonica. Emperor Claudius II however was able to defeat them at the Battle of Naissus, ending the Gothic threat for the time being.Zosimus, Historia Nova, I.42‚Äì45 Barbarian raids also increased along the Rhine frontier and in the North Sea. Eutropius mentions that during the 280s, the sea along the coasts of the provinces of Belgica and Armorica was \\"infested with Franks and Saxons\\". To counter them, Maximian appointed Carausius as commander of the British Fleet.Eutropius, Breviarium, IX.21 However, Carausius rose up in late 286 and seceded from the Empire with Britannia and parts of the northern Gallic coast.Panegyrici Latini, 8.6 With a single blow Roman control of the channel and the North Sea was lost, and emperor Maximinus was forced to create a completely new Northern Fleet, but in lack of training it was almost immediately destroyed in a storm.Panegyrici Latini, 8.12 Only in 293, under Caesar Constantius Chlorus did Rome regain the Gallic coast. A new fleet was constructed in order to cross the Channel,Panegyrici Latini, 6.5; 8.6‚Äì8 and in 296, with a concentric attack on Londinium the insurgent province was retaken.Eutropius, Breviarium 9.22; Aurelius Victor, Book of Caesars 39.42 = Late antiquity = By the end of the 3rd century, the Roman navy had declined dramatically. Although Emperor Diocletian is held to have strengthened the navy, and increased its manpower from 46,000 to 64,000 men,Treadgold (1997), p. 145 the old standing fleets had all but vanished, and in the civil wars that ended the Tetrarchy, the opposing sides had to mobilize the resources and commandeered the ships of the Eastern Mediterranean port cities. These conflicts thus brought about a renewal of naval activity, culminating in the Battle of the Hellespont in 324 between the forces of Constantine I under Caesar Crispus and the fleet of Licinius, which was the only major naval confrontation of the 4th century. Vegetius, writing at the end of the 4th century, testifies to the disappearance of the old praetorian fleets in Italy, but comments on the continued activity of the Danube fleet.MacGeorge (2002), pp. 306‚Äì307 In the 5th century, only the eastern half of the Empire could field an effective fleet, as it could draw upon the maritime resources of Greece and the Levant. Although the Notitia Dignitatum still mentions several naval units for the Western Empire, these were apparently too depleted to be able to carry out much more than patrol duties.Lewis & Runyan (1985), pp. 4‚Äì8 At any rate, the rise of the naval power of the Vandal Kingdom under Geiseric in North Africa, and its raids in the Western Mediterranean, were practically uncontested. Although there is some evidence of West Roman naval activity in the first half of the 5th century, this is mostly confined to troop transports and minor landing operations. The historian Priscus and Sidonius Apollinaris affirm in their writings that by the mid-5th century, the Western Empire essentially lacked a war navy.MacGeorge (2002), p. 307 Matters became even worse after the disastrous failure of the fleets mobilized against the Vandals in 460 and 468, under the emperors Majorian and Anthemius. For the West, there would be no recovery, as the last Western Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476. In the East however, the classical naval tradition survived, and in the 6th century, a standing navy was reformed. The East Roman (Byzantine) navy would remain a formidable force in the Mediterranean until the 11th century.  Organization  = Crews = Roman warship on a denarius of Mark Antony The bulk of a galley's crew was formed by the rowers, the remiges (sing. remex) or eretai (sing. eretƒìs) in Greek. Despite popular perceptions, the Roman fleet, and ancient fleets in general, relied throughout their existence on rowers of free status, and not on galley slaves. Slaves were employed only in times of pressing manpower demands or extreme emergency, and even then, they were freed first.Casson (1991), p. 188 In Imperial times, non-citizen freeborn provincials (peregrini), chiefly from nations with a maritime background such as Greeks, Phoenicians, Syrians and Egyptians, formed the bulk of the fleets' crews.Starr (1960), p. 75 Table 1 During the early Principate, a ship's crew, regardless of its size, was organized as a centuria. Crewmen could sign on as marines (Called Marinus), rowers/seamen, craftsmen and various other jobs, though all personnel serving in the imperial fleet were classed as milites (\\"soldiers\\"), regardless of their function; only when differentiation with the army was required, were the adjectives classiarius or classicus added. Along with several other instances of prevalence of army terminology, this testifies to the lower social status of naval personnel, considered inferior to the auxiliaries and the legionaries. Emperor Claudius first gave legal privileges to the navy's crewmen, enabling them to receive Roman citizenship after their period of service. This period was initially set at a minimum of 26 years (one year more than the legions), and was later expanded to 28. Upon honorable discharge (honesta missio), the sailors received a sizable cash payment as well. As in the army, the ship's centuria was headed by a centurion with an optio as his deputy, while a beneficiarius supervised a small administrative staff. Among the crew were also a number of principales (junior officers) and immunes (specialists exempt from certain duties). Some of these positions, mostly administrative, were identical to those of the army auxiliaries, while some (mostly of Greek provenance) were peculiar to the fleet. An inscription from the island of Cos, dated to the First Mithridatic War, provides us with a list of a ship's officers, the nautae: the gubernator (kybernƒìtƒìs in Greek) was the helmsman or pilot, the celeusta (keleustƒìs in Greek) supervised the rowers, a proreta (pr≈çreus in Greek) was the look-out stationed at the bow, a pentacontarchos was apparently a junior officer, and an iatros (Lat. medicus), the ship's doctor. Each ship was commanded by a trierarchus, whose exact relationship with the ship's centurion is unclear. Squadrons, most likely of ten ships each, were put under a nauarchus, who often appears to have risen from the ranks of the trierarchi.Starr (1960), p. 39Webster & Elton (1998), pp. 165‚Äì166 The post of nauarchus archigubernes or nauarchus princeps appeared later in the Imperial period, and functioned either as a commander of several squadrons or as an executive officer under a civilian admiral, equivalent to the legionary primus pilus.Starr (1960), pp. 42‚Äì43 All these were professional officers, usually peregrini, who had a status equal to an auxiliary centurion (and were thus increasingly called centuriones [classiarii] after ca. 70 AD). Until the reign of Antoninus Pius, their careers were restricted to the fleet. Only in the 3rd century were these officers equated to the legionary centurions in status and pay, and could henceforth be transferred to a similar position in the legions.Wesch-Klein (1998), p. 25 Merchant vessels were commanded by the magister navis. If privately owned, the owner was called exercitor navis.http://casopisi.junis.ni.ac.rs/index.php/FULawPol/article/view/4688 The modern term of \\"master\\" to designate a captain of a merchant vessel derives from the magister navis. = High Command = During the Republic, command of a fleet was given to a serving magistrate or promagistrate, usually of consular or praetorian rank.Rodgers (1976), p. 60 In the Punic Wars for instance, one consul would usually command the fleet, and another the army. In the subsequent wars in the Eastern Mediterranean, praetors would assume the command of the fleet. However, since these men were political appointees, the actual handling of the fleets and of separate squadrons was entrusted to their more experienced legates and subordinates. It was therefore during the Punic Wars that the separate position of praefectus classis (\\"fleet prefect\\") first appeared.Livy, AUC XXVI.48; XXXVI.42 Initially subordinate to the magistrate in command, after the fleet's reorganization by Augustus, the praefectus classis became a procuratorial position in charge of each of the permanent fleets. These posts were initially filled either from among the equestrian class, or, especially under Claudius, from the Emperor's freedmen, thus securing imperial control over the fleets.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 165 From the period of the Flavian emperors, the status of the praefectura was raised, and only equestrians with military experience who had gone through the militia equestri were appointed. Nevertheless, the prefects remained largely political appointees, and despite their military experience, usually in command of army auxiliary units, their knowledge of naval matters was minimal, forcing them to rely on their professional subordinates. The difference in importance of the fleets they commanded was also reflected by the rank and the corresponding pay of the commanders. The prefects of the two praetorian fleets were ranked procuratores ducenarii, meaning they earned 200,000 sesterces annually, the prefects of the Classis Germanica, the Classis Britannica and later the Classis Pontica were centenarii (i.e. earning 100,000 sesterces), while the other fleet prefects were sexagenarii (i.e. they received 60,000 sesterces).Pflaum, H.G. (1950). Les procurateurs √©questres sous le Haut-Empire romain, pp. 50‚Äì53 = Ship types = Model of a Roman bireme The generic Roman term for an oar-driven galley warship was \\"long ship\\" (Latin: navis longa, Greek: naus makra), as opposed to the sail-driven navis oneraria (from onus, oneris: burden), a merchant vessel, or the minor craft (navigia minora) like the scapha. The navy consisted of a wide variety of different classes of warships, from heavy polyremes to light raiding and scouting vessels. Unlike the rich Hellenistic Successor kingdoms in the East however, the Romans did not rely on heavy warships, with quinqueremes (Gk. pentƒìrƒìs), and to a lesser extent quadriremes (Gk. tetrƒìrƒìs) and triremes (Gk. triƒìrƒìs) providing the mainstay of the Roman fleets from the Punic Wars to the end of the Civil Wars. The heaviest vessel mentioned in Roman fleets during this period was the hexareme, of which a few were used as flagships. Lighter vessels such as the liburnians and the hemiolia, both swift types invented by pirates, were also adopted as scouts and light transport vessels. During the final confrontation between Octavian and Mark Antony, Octavian's fleet was composed of quinqueremes, together with some \\"sixes\\" and many triremes and liburnians, while Antony, who had the resources of Ptolemaic Egypt to draw upon, fielded a fleet also mostly composed of quinqueremes, but with a sizeable complement of heavier warships, ranging from \\"sixes\\" to \\"tens\\" (Gk. dekƒìrƒìs).Cassius Dio, Historia Romana, L.23.2 Later historical tradition made much of the prevalence of lighter and swifter vessels in Octavian's fleet,Plutarch, Antony, 62 with Vegetius even explicitly ascribing Octavian's victory to the liburnians.Vegetius, De Re Militari, IV.33 Reconstruction of a late Roman navis lusoria at Mainz This prominence of lighter craft in the historical narrative is perhaps best explained in light of subsequent developments. After Actium, the operational landscape had changed: for the remainder of the Principate, no opponent existed to challenge Roman naval hegemony, and no massed naval confrontation was likely. The tasks at hand for the Roman navy were now the policing of the Mediterranean waterways and the border rivers, suppression of piracy, and escort duties for the grain shipments to Rome and for imperial army expeditions. Lighter ships were far better suited to these tasks, and after the reorganization of the fleet following Actium, the largest ship kept in service was a hexareme, the flagship of the Classis Misenensis. The bulk of the fleets was composed of the lighter triremes and liburnians (Latin: liburna, Greek: libyrnis), with the latter apparently providing the majority of the provincial fleets.Casson (1995), p. 141 In time, the term \\"liburnian\\" came to mean \\"warship\\" in a generic sense. In addition, there were smaller oared vessels, such as the navis actuaria, with 30 oars (15 on each bank), a ship primarily used for transport in coastal and fluvial operations, for which its shallow draught and flat keel were ideal. In late antiquity, it was succeeded in this role by the navis lusoria (\\"playful ship\\"), which was extensively used for patrols and raids by the legionary flotillas in the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Roman ships were commonly named after gods (Mars, Iuppiter, Minerva, Isis), mythological heroes (Hercules), geographical maritime features such as Rhenus or Oceanus, concepts such as Harmony, Peace, Loyalty, Victory (Concordia, Pax, Fides, Victoria) or after important events (Dacicus for the Trajan's Dacian Wars or Salamina for the Battle of Salamis).Casson (1995), pp. 357‚Äì358; Casson (1991), pp. 190‚Äì191 They were distinguished by their figurehead (insigne or parasemum), and, during the Civil Wars at least, by the paint schemes on their turrets, which varied according to each fleet.Warry (2004), p. 183 = Armament and tactics = Ballistae on a Roman ship In classical antiquity, a ship's main weapon was the ram (rostra, hence the name navis rostrata for a warship), which was used to sink or immobilize an enemy ship by holing its hull. Its use, however, required a skilled and experienced crew and a fast and agile ship like a trireme or quinquereme. In the Hellenistic period, the larger navies came instead to rely on greater vessels. This had several advantages: the heavier and sturdier construction lessened the effects of ramming, and the greater space and stability of the vessels allowed the transport not only of more marines, but also the placement of deck-mounted ballistae and catapults.Warry (2004), p. 98 Although the ram continued to be a standard feature of all warships and ramming the standard mode of attack, these developments transformed the role of a warship: from the old \\"manned missile\\", designed to sink enemy ships, they became mobile artillery platforms, which engaged in missile exchange and boarding actions. The Romans in particular, being initially inexperienced at sea combat, relied upon boarding actions through the use of the Corvus. Although it brought them some decisive victories, it was discontinued because it tended to unbalance the quinqueremes in high seas; two Roman fleets are recorded to have been lost during storms in the First Punic War.Warry (2004), p. 118 During the Civil Wars, a number of technical innovations, which are attributed to Agrippa,Appian, The Civil Wars, V.106 & V.118 took place: the harpax, a catapult-fired grappling hook, which was used to clamp onto an enemy ship, reel it in and board it, in a much more efficient way than with the old corvus, and the use of collapsible fighting towers placed one apiece bow and stern, which were used to provide the boarders with supporting fire.Warry (2004), pp. 182‚Äì183 = Fleets =  Principate period  Map of the Roman fleets and major naval bases during the Principate After the end of the civil wars, Augustus reduced and reorganized the Roman armed forces, including the navy. A large part of the fleet of Mark Antony was burned, and the rest was withdrawn to a new base at Forum Iulii (modern Fr√©jus),Tacitus, The Annals, IV.5; Strabo, Geography, IV.1.9 which remained operative until the reign of Claudius. However, the bulk of the fleet was soon subdivided into two praetorian fleets at Misenum and Ravenna, supplemented by a growing number of minor ones in the provinces, which were often created on an ad hoc basis for specific campaigns. This organizational structure was maintained almost unchanged until the 4th century. = Praetorian fleets = The two major fleets were stationed in Italy and acted as a central naval reserve, directly available to the Emperor (hence the designation \\"praetorian\\"). In the absence of any naval threat, their duties mostly involved patrolling and transport duties. These were not confined to the waters around Italy, but throughout the Mediterranean. There is epigraphic evidence for the presence of sailors of the two praetorian fleets at Piraeus and Syria. These two fleets were: * The Classis Misenensis, established in 27 BC and based at Portus Julius. Later Classis praetoria Misenesis Pia Vindex. Detachments of the fleet served at secondary bases, such as Ostia, Puteoli, Centumcellae and other harbors.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 158 * The Classis Ravennas, established in 27 BC and based at Ravenna. Later Classis praetoria Ravennatis Pia Vindex. = Provincial fleets = The various provincial fleets were smaller than the praetorian fleets and composed mostly of lighter vessels. Nevertheless, it was these fleets that saw action, in full campaigns or raids on the periphery of the Empire. * The Classis Africana Commodiana Herculea, established by Commodus in 186 to secure the grain shipments (annona) from North Africa to Italy,Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Commodi, 17.7 after the model of the Classis Alexandrina. * The Classis Alexandriae, based in Alexandria, it controlled the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. It was founded by Augustus around 30 BC, probably from ships that fought at the Battle of Actium and manned mostly by Greeks of the Nile Delta.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 159 Having supported emperor Vespasian in the civil war of 69, it was awarded of the cognomen Augusta. The fleet was responsible chiefly for the escort of the grain shipments to Rome (and later Constantinople), and also apparently operated the Potamophylaciae, the Nile river patrol. * The Classis Britannica, established in 40 or 43 AD at Gesoriacum (Boulogne-sur-Mer).Cleere (1977), pp. 16; 18‚Äì19 It participated in the Roman invasion of Britain and the subsequent campaigns in the island. The fleet was probably based at Rutupiae (Richborough) until 85 AD, when it was transferred to Dubris (Dover). Other bases were Portus Lemanis (Lympne) and Anderitum (Pevensey), while Gesoriacum on the Gallic coast likely remained active.Cleere (1977), p. 19 During the 2nd‚Äì3rd centuries, the fleet was chiefly employed in transport of supplies and men across the English Channel. The Classis Britannica disappears (at least under that name) from the mid-3rd century, and the sites occupied by it were soon incorporated into the Saxon Shore system. * The Classis Germanica was established in 12 BC by Drusus at Castra Vetera.Cleere (1977), p. 16 It controlled the Rhine river, and was mainly a fluvial fleet, although it also operated in the North Sea. It is noteworthy that the Romans' initial lack of experience with the tides of the ocean left Drusus' fleet stranded on the Zuiderzee.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 160 After ca. 30 AD, the fleet moved its main base to the castrum of Alteburg, some 4 km south of Colonia Agrippinensis (modern Cologne).K√∂ln-Alteburg at livius.org Later granted the honorifics Augusta Pia Fidelis Domitiana following the suppression of the Revolt of Saturninus.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 162 * The Classis nova Libyca, first mentioned in 180, based most likely at Ptolemais on the Cyrenaica. * The Classis Mauretanica, based at Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell), it controlled the African coasts of the western Mediterranean Sea. Established on a permanent basis after the raids by the Moors in the early 170s. * The Classis Moesica was established sometime between 20 BC and 10 AD. It was based in Noviodunum and controlled the Lower Danube from the Iron Gates to the northwestern Black Sea as far as the Crimea.Webster & Elton (1998), pp. 162‚Äì165 The honorific Flavia, awarded to it and to the Classis pannonica, may indicate its reorganization by Vespasian.Webster & Elton (1998), p. 163 * The Classis Pannonica, a fluvial fleet controlling the Upper Danube from Castra Regina in Raetia (modern Regensburg) to Singidunum in Moesia (modern Belgrade). Its exact date of establishment is unknown. Some trace it to Augustus' campaigns in Pannonia in ca. 35 BC, but it was certainly in existence by 45 AD. Its main base was probably Taurunum (modern Zemun) at the confluence of the river Sava with the Danube. Under the Flavian dynasty, it received the cognomen Flavia. * The Classis Perinthia, established after the annexation of Thrace in 46 AD and based in Perinthus. Probably based on the indigenous navy, it operated in the Propontis and the Thracian coast. Probably united with the Classis Pontica at a later stage. * The Classis Pontica, founded in 64 AD from the Pontic royal fleet,Starr (1989), p. 76 and based in Trapezus, although on occasion it was moved to Byzantium (in ca. 70),Tacitus, The Histories, II.83; III.47 and in 170, to Cyzicus.Starr (1989), p. 77 This fleet was used to guard the southern and eastern Black Sea, and the entrance of the Bosporus. According to the historian Josephus, in the latter half of the 1st century, it numbered 40 warships and 3,000 men.Josephus, The Jewish War, II.16.4 * The Classis Syriaca, established probably under Vespasian, and based in Seleucia Pieria (hence the alternative name Classis Seleucena)Codex Theodosianus, X.23.1 in Syria. This fleet controlled the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean sea. In addition, there is significant archaeological evidence for naval activity by certain legions, which in all likelihood operated their own squadrons: legio XXII Primigenia in the Upper Rhine and Main rivers, legio X Fretensis in the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee, and several legionary squadrons in the Danube frontier.  Dominate period  Our main source for the structure of the late Roman military is the Notitia Dignitatum, which corresponds to the situation of the 390s for the Eastern Empire and the 420s for the Western Empire. Notable in the Notitia is the large number of smaller squadrons that have been created, most of these fluvial and of a local operational role. = Fleets of the Danube frontier = The Upper Danube (Pannonian) limes The Lower Danube (Moesian) limes The Classis Pannonica and the Classis Moesica were broken up into several smaller squadrons, collectively termed Classis Histrica, authority of the frontier commanders (duces).Pauly-Wissowa, XXII.1300‚Äì1301 with bases at Mursa in Pannonia II,Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ., XXXII.

The naval units were complemented by port garrisons and marine units, drawn from the army. In the Danube frontier these were: * In Pannonia I and Noricum ripensis, naval detachments (milites liburnarii) of the legio XIV Gemina and the legio X Gemina at Carnuntum and Arrabonae, and of the legio II Italica at Ioviacum. * In Pannonia II, the I Flavia Augusta (at Sirmium) and the II Flavia are listed under their prefects. * In Moesia II, two units of sailors (milites nauclarii) at Appiaria and Altinum.Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Orient., XL. * In Scythia Minor, marines (muscularii)musculus (meaning \\"small mouse\\") was a kind of small ship of legio II Herculia at Inplateypegiis and sailors (nauclarii) at Flaviana.Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Orient., XXXIX. = Fleets in Western Europe = In the West, and in particular in Gaul, several fluvial fleets had been established.

Course The Maroni runs through the Guianan moist forests ecoregion. It originates in the Tumuk Humak Mountains and forms the (disputed) border between France (region of French Guiana) and Suriname. In its upper reaches, it is also known as the Lawa, and close to its source it is known as the Litani. The total length of Litani, Lawa and Maroni is . There are two nature preserves located in the estuary region on the Surinamese side of the river, near the village of Galibi. They provide protection for the birds and the leatherback sea turtles that hatch there. Territorial dispute In 1860, the question was posed from the French side, which of the two tributary rivers was the headwater, and thus the border. A joint French- Dutch commission was appointed to review the issue. The Dutch side of the commission consisted of J.H. Baron van Heerdt tot Eversberg, J.F.A. Cateau van Rosevelt and August Kappler. Luits Vidal, Ronmy, Boudet and Dr. Rech composed the French side. In 1861 measurements were taken, which produced the following result: the Lawa had a discharge of 35,960 m3/minute at a width of 436 m; the Tapanahony had a discharge of 20,291 m3/minute at a width of 285 m. Thus, the Lawa River was the headwater of the Maroni River. There were no problems with this decision until 1885. However, the discovery of gold in the area between the Lawa and the Tapanahony created a new border conflict. On 29 November 1888, France and the Netherlands reached an agreement that the conflict should be subject to arbitration. Czar Alexander III of Russia, acting as the arbitrator, decided that the Lawa was the headwater of the Maroni, and thus should be considered the border. However, this decision created another issue as to which river is the source of the Lawa. The Netherlands considered the Marowini (the eastern tributary river) to be the source of the Lawa; the French considered the Litani, located further to the west, to be the source of the Lawa. This issue has still not been resolved. The Litani originates in the Tumuk Humak Mountains at approximately ¬∞ N 55¬∞ W; along its path it is fed by Koele Koelebreek, the Lokereek, the Mapaonikreek and the Oelemari River. The Marowini also has its source in the Tumuk Humak Mountains, at approximately 2¬∞ N, 54¬∞ W; it also absorbs the Koelebreek, among others.  Numbers  The Maroni basin is 68,700 km2; above the island Langatabbetje (110 km away from the mouth of the river) this area is 63,700 km2. Between 1952 and 1973, the average discharge near Langatabbetje was about 1,700 m3/second. The minimum was 95 m3/second, the maximum 6,550 m3/second. The estuary is approximately 90 km long; the average tidal range in the estuary is 2 m; in the dry season, the salt reaches about 40 km upstream to the town of Albina. The estimated potential hydro power for Suriname is between 1150 and 1250 megawatts.  Exploration  The Maroni is the most extensively studied of all the rivers in Suriname. In the 16th century, there were already ships exploring the estuary, by Lawrence Keymis, Thomas Masham, Antonio de Berrio and Adriaen Cabeliau and in the 17th century, by Harcourt, Fisher and De Vries. In the 18th century more extensive excursions took place, by Mentell, Patris, Le Blond and Heneman and in the 19th century by Zegelaar, Jules Crevaux, Coudreau, Ten Kate, Joost and others. Of importance in the 20th century were the Gonini and Tapanahony expeditions, and the Tumuk Humak and Southern Border Expeditions. From these arose the research of the Geologisch Mijnbouwkundige Dienst (GMD) and the Centraal Bureau voor Luchtkartering (CBL). References C.F.A. Bruijning und J.

The first British Magnox reactor at Calder Hall was connected to the grid on 27 August 1956, its primary purpose was to produce plutonium for military uses.The Vallecitos Nuclear Center started producing electric power in October 1957, but it served as a test or pilot plant. It was located near the present-day Beaver Valley Nuclear Generating Station on the Ohio River in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, about 25 miles (40 km) from Pittsburgh. The reactor reached criticality on December 2, 1957, and aside from stoppages for three core changes, it remained in operation until October 1982. The first electrical power was produced on December 18, 1957 as engineers synchronized the plant with the distribution grid of Duquesne Light Company. The first core used at Shippingport originated from a cancelled nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and used highly enriched uranium (93% U-235) as \\"seed\\" fuel surrounded by a \\"blanket\\" of natural U-238, in a so-called seed-and-blanket design; in the first reactor about half the power came from the seed.J. C. Clayton, \\"The Shippingport Pressurized Water Reactor and Light Water Breeder Reactor\\", Westinghouse Report WAPD-T-3007, 1993 The first Shippingport core reactor turned out to be capable of an output of 60 MWe one month after its launch. The second core was similarly designed but more powerful, having a larger seed. The highly energetic seed required more refueling cycles than the blanket in these first two cores. The third and final core used at Shippingport was an experimental, light water moderated, thermal breeder reactor. It kept the same seed-and-blanket design, but the seed was now uranium-233 and the blanket was made of thorium.Kasten, P. R. (1998). \\"\\" Science & Global Security, 7(3), 237-269. Being a breeder reactor, it had the ability to transmute relatively inexpensive thorium to uranium-233 as part of its fuel cycle. The breeding ratio attained by Shippingport's third core was 1.01. Over its 25-year life, the Shippingport power plant operated for about 80,324 hours, producing about 7.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Owing to these peculiarities, some non-governmental sources label Shippingport a \\"demonstration PWR reactor\\" and consider that the \\"first fully commercial PWR\\" in the US was Yankee Rowe. Criticism centers on the fact that the Shippingport plant had not been built to commercial specifications. Consequently, the construction cost per kilowatt at Shippingport was about ten times those for a conventional power plant.  Construction  Reactor pressure vessel during construction (1956) In 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations. Commercial nuclear power generation was cornerstone of his plan. A proposal by Duquesne Light Company was accepted by Admiral Rickover and the plans for the Shippingport Atomic Power Station started. Ground was broken on Labor Day, September 9, 1954. President Eisenhower remotely initiated the first scoop of dirt at the ceremony. The reactor achieved first criticality at 4:30 AM on December 2, 1957. Sixteen days later, on December 18, the first electrical power was generated and full power was achieved on December 23, 1957, although the station remained in test mode. Eisenhower opened the Shippingport Atomic Power Station on May 26, 1958. The plant was built in 32 months at a cost of $72.5 million. The type of reactor used at Shippingport was a matter of expediency. The Atomic Energy Commission urged the construction of a reactor integrated into the utility grid. The only suitable reactor available at the time was the one that was intended for the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier desired by the Navy, but which Eisenhower had just vetoed. Kenneth Nichols of the AEC said it \\"became obvious\\" that the Rickover-Westinghouse pressurised-water reactor intended for an aircraft carrier was \\"the best choice for a reactor to demonstrate the production of electricity\\" with Rickover \\"having a going organization and a reactor project under way that now had no specific use to justify it\\". This was accepted by Lewis Strauss and the Commission in January 1954. The acceptance of Duquesne Light as the utility partner was announced on 11 March. The ground-breaking ceremony in August was initiated by Eisenhower from Denver where he was giving a talk on atomic energy on Labor Day; Rickover ensured that the unmanned bulldozer pushing dirt did not dig in and stall by having the dozer blade riding along two railroad rails buried under six inches of dirt. The origin of the project explains why the Shippingport reactor used 93%-enriched uranium, unlike later commercial power reactors that do not exceed 5% enrichment. Other significant differences from commercial reactors include the use of hafnium for its control rods, although these were necessary and used only in the reactor's seed. Shippingport was created and operated under the auspices of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, whose authority included a substantial role within the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).  Cores  The Shippingport reactor was designed to accommodate different cores during its lifetime; three were used. The first, installed in 1957, held 14.2 tons of natural uranium (the \\"blanket\\") and 165 pounds of high-enriched (93% U-235) uranium (the \\"seed\\"); despite this disparity in mass, about half the power was generated in the seed. The seed was depleted quicker than the blanket, and it was replenished three times during the lifetime of the first core. Seven years later (when running on its fourth seed) the first core was retired, after having produced 1.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The second core had increased generating capacity (more than five times) and instrumentation to measure performance, but otherwise used the same seed-and- blanket design. For the second core, the seed volume was 21% of the total core volume. The second core thus required only one seed refueling. It began operating in 1965 and over the next nine years generated almost 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. In 1974 the turbine-generator suffered mechanical failure, causing the plant to be shut down. The third and final core was a light water breeder, which began operating in August 1977 and after testing was brought to full power by the end of that year. It used pellets made of thorium dioxide and uranium-233 oxide; initially the U233 content of the pellets was 5-6% in the seed region, 1.5-3% in the blanket region and none in the reflector region. It operated at 236 MWt, generating 60 MWe and ultimately produced over 2.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. After five years (29,000 effective full power hours) the core was removed and found to contain nearly 1.4% more fissile material than when it was installed, demonstrating that breeding had occurred.Thorium information from the World Nuclear Association  Decommissioning  On October 1, 1982, the reactor ceased operations after 25 years. Dismantlement of the facility began in September 1985. In December 1988, the 956-ton (870-T) reactor pressure vessel/neutron shield tank assembly was lifted out of the containment building and loaded onto land transportation equipment in preparation for removal from the site and shipment to a burial facility in Washington State. The site has been cleaned up and released for unrestricted use. While the Shippingport Reactor has been decommissioned, Beaver Valley Nuclear Generating Station Units 1 and 2 are still licensed and in operation at the site. The $98 million (1985 estimate) cleanup of Shippingport has been used as an example of a successful reactor decommissioning by proponents of nuclear power; however, critics point out that Shippingport was smaller than most commercial nuclear power plants, most reactors in the United States are about 1,000 MWe, while Shippingport was only 60 MWe. Others argue that it was an excellent test case to prove a reactor site could be safely decommissioned and a site released for unrestricted use. Shippingport, while somewhat smaller than a large commercial reactor today, was representative, with four steam generators, pressurizer and reactor. The reactor alone, when packaged for shipment, weighed in excess of 1000 tons (921 tons weight of the vessel plus the weight of a structural steel shipping skid) and was successfully shipped by waterway for burial at the Hanford Reservation. The reactor vessel from Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (located in Oregon), was also successfully shipped by waterway to the Hanford site; a much shorter trip than the Shippingport reactor. Subsequent to Shippingport's decommissioning, three other large commercial reactors have been entirely leveled: Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station having been entirely decommissioned in 2007 with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) notifying Yankee that August that the former plant site had been fully decommissioned in accordance with NRC procedures and regulations; Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant completely decommissioned in 2005; and Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. All three prior commercial reactor sites have been returned to greenfield conditions and are open to visitors.

Billiken statue on the campus of Saint Louis University Wooden statue of the Billiken in Ts≈´tenkaku tower The Billiken is a charm doll created by an American art teacher and illustrator, Florence Pretz of Kansas City, Missouri, who is said to have seen the mysterious figure in a dream. It is believed that Pretz found the name Billiken in Bliss Carman's 1896 poem \\"Mr. Moon: A Song Of The Little People\\". In 1908, she obtained a design patent on the ornamental design of the Billiken,, Florence Pretz, \\"Design for an image\\", issued October 6, 1908. which she sold to the Billiken Company of Chicago. The Billiken was monkey-like with pointed ears, a mischievous smile and a tuft of hair on his pointed head. His arms were short and he was generally sitting with his legs stretched out in front of him. Billiken is known as \\"The God of Things as They Ought to Be\\". To buy a Billiken was said to give the purchaser luck, but to receive one as a gift would be better luck.. The image was copyrighted and a trademark was put on the name. After a few years of popularity, the Billiken faded into obscurity. Although they are similar, the Billiken and the baby-like kewpie figures that debuted in the December 1909 Ladies' Home Journal are not the same. Today, the Billiken is the official mascot of Saint Louis University and St. Louis University High School, both Jesuit institutions located in St. Louis. The Billiken is also the official mascot of the Royal Order of Jesters,University of Cincinnati News an invitation only Shriner group, affiliated with Freemasonry. The Billiken also became the namesake of Billiken Shokai, the Japanese toy & model manufacturing company (established 1976). History The Billiken sprang from the height of the \\"Mind-Cure\\" craze in the United States at the start of the twentieth century. It represented the \\"no worry\\" ideal, and was a huge hit. Variations appeared, such as the \\"Teddy-Billiken Doll\\" and the Billycan/Billycant pair (to drive petty problems away). The Billiken helped touch off the doll craze of the era. At least two Billiken-themed songs were recorded, including \\"Billiken Rag\\" and the \\"Billiken Man Song.\\" The latter was recorded by Blanche Ring.Donation of the month. Object: Billiken Doll, Rogers Historical Museum, City of Rogers, Arkansas (undated). The Billiken, as a good luck charm, appears multiple times in the Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor movie Waterloo Bridge. It is employed as a device that both prompts recollections of the male lead, Robert Taylor, and that links several scenes within the movie as the plot unfolds. Wizard of Oz author L. Frank Baum kept a Billiken doll on his piano. The Billiken made its Japanese debut in 1908. A statue was installed in the uppermost level of the original Tsutenkaku Tower as it was opened to the public in 1912. When the nearby Luna Park was closed in 1925, the tower's Billiken statue disappeared. In 1980, a replacement statue made its appearance in a new Tsutenkaku Tower that was built in 1956. Sports mascot In its heyday, the Billiken enjoyed worldwide celebrity. In the United States he became the athletic mascot of Saint Louis University, because the figure was said to resemble coach John R. Bender. The school's athletic teams remain the Billikens to this day. A bronze statue of the Billiken stands in front of the Chaifetz Arena on the Saint Louis University Campus. A junior version of the Billiken became the mascot of nearby St. Louis University High School; a stainless steel statue of the Junior Billiken stands adjacent to the Danis Fieldhouse, on the St. Louis University High School Campus. Bud Billiken was a youth-club mascot for The Chicago Defender, and was created in 1923, and is known more contemporarily as the inspiration for the yearly parade of the same name held shortly before the start of the school year. The Billiken was the team nickname for several minor league professional baseball teams, including the Fort Wayne Billikens of the 1908‚Äì1910 Central League, the Montgomery Billikens of the 1910 Southern Association (a Class A league that ran from 1902‚Äì1935), the Bay City Billikens of the 1911 and 1912 Southern Michigan League (a league that dwelled in several classifications between 1906 and 1912), and the McLeansboro Billikens of the 1910 Kentucky‚ÄìIllinois‚ÄìTennessee League (\\"KITTY League\\"), a Class D professional baseball league that ran from 1903 until 1955. McLeansboro is located in southern Illinois, 116 miles from St. Louis. Alaska Two Billikens from the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition of 1909 In 1909, the Billiken began its appearance in souvenir shops of Alaska. In Nome, Alaska, an Eskimo carver by the name Angokwazhuk copied a Billiken figurine in ivory brought to him by a merchant. Since that first appearance in Alaska, some Eskimo carvers began to include the billiken in the collection of figurines they created. By the 1960s the Billiken was ubiquitous in larger Alaskan cities like Anchorage, and heavily touristed areas. Billikens were often carved from Alaskan ivory and were used in jewelry and knick-knacks. Often these souvenirs were accompanied by printed, romanticized Billiken lore. In Anchorage, the name was also adopted by merchants, as in the Billiken Drive-In movie theater. Japan Throughout Japan representations of the Billiken were enshrined. Pre-World War II statues of the Billiken could be found in Kobe city's Chinju Inari and Matsuo Inari shrines. Both of these statues were removed from display for many years at the onset of the war when foreign deities fell out of favor. The most famous representation of the Billiken was in an amusement park, Luna Park, in the Shinsekai district of Osaka, Japan. In 1912, he was enshrined in the park as a symbol of Americana and there was revered as \\"The God of Things As They Ought to Be\\". Popular Billiken souvenirs in the park included dolls and manj≈´. When the park closed in 1923, the wooden statue of the Billiken went missing. A replica of the statue was placed in the second-generation Ts≈´tenkaku Tower in 1980. The Billiken was a star in Sakamoto Junji's 1996 comedy Billiken in which the statue is restored to the Tsutenkaku in an effort to revive the popularity of the tower and save Shinsekai.. The statue was a permanent fixture in the tower until September 2005 when it made its first departure and was taken, as an ambassador of sorts, to Shibuya's Tokyu Hands department store in Tokyo as a part of a fair to promote Naniwa (traditional Osaka) culture. As a part of the cultural exchange, a replica of the statue of Shibuya's most famous dog, Hachik≈ç, was sent to Osaka. In October 2008, the Billiken of Tsutenkaku took a journey all the way from Japan to its \\"home\\" city of St. Louis, Missouri where it was visited by students of St. Louis University, whose mascot is also the Billiken. Due to wear (particularly to the soles of the feet), the dark, worn statue replica from 1980 was replaced in May 2012 with a new one. Presently he resides on the fifth floor observation deck and has become closely associated with the tower. Each year thousands of visitors place a coin in his donation box and rub the soles of his well-worn feet to make their wishes come true. The Billiken also became the namesake of Billiken Shokai, the Japanese toy & model manufacturing company established in 1976.

Wittgenstein argued that a word or even a sentence has meaning only as a result of the \\"rule\\" of the \\"game\\" being played. Depending on the context, for example, the utterance \\"Water!\\" could be an order, the answer to a question, or some other form of communication.  Philosophical Investigations  In his work Philosophical Investigations (1953), Ludwig Wittgenstein regularly referred to the concept of language- games. Wittgenstein rejected the idea that language is somehow separate and corresponding to reality, and he argued that concepts do not need clarity for meaning.Jago 2007, p. 55 Wittgenstein used the term \\"language-game\\" to designate forms of language simpler than the entirety of a language itself, \\"consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven\\" (PI 7) and connected by family resemblance (Familien√§hnlichkeit). The concept was intended \\"to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or a form of life,\\" (PI 23) which gives language its meaning. Wittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a language-game. Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples,See ¬ß7. but intends it to be used for the many ways in which we use language.¬ß23 The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is the meaning of the word \\"game\\". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, \\"war games\\". These are all different uses of the word \\"games\\". Wittgenstein also gives the example of \\"Water!\\", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word \\"water\\" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society. Wittgenstein does not limit the application of his concept of language games to word-meaning. He also applies it to sentence-meaning. For example, the sentence \\"Moses did not exist\\" (¬ß79) can mean various things. Wittgenstein argues that independently of use the sentence does not yet 'say' anything. It is 'meaningless' in the sense of not being significant for a particular purpose. It only acquires significance if we fix it within some context of use. Thus, it fails to say anything because the sentence as such does not yet determine some particular use. The sentence is only meaningful when it is used to say something. For instance, it can be used so as to say that no person or historical figure fits the set of descriptions attributed to the person that goes by the name of \\"Moses\\". But it can also mean that the leader of the Israelites was not called Moses. Or that there cannot have been anyone who accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses, etc. What the sentence means thus depends on its context of use. The term ‚Äòlanguage-game‚Äô is used to refer to: * Fictional examples of language use that are simpler than our own everyday language. (e.g. PI 2) * Simple uses of language with which children are first taught language (training in language). * Specific regions of our language with their own grammars and relations to other language-games. * All of a natural language seen as comprising a family of language-games. These meanings are not separated from each other by sharp boundaries, but blend into one another (as suggested by the idea of family resemblance). The concept is based on the following analogy: The rules of language are analogous to the rules of games; thus saying something in a language is analogous to making a move in a game. The analogy between a language and a game demonstrates that words have meaning depending on the uses made of them in the various and multiform activities of human life. (The concept is not meant to suggest that there is anything trivial about language, or that language is \\"just a game\\".)  Examples  The classic example of a language-game is the so-called \\"builder's language\\" introduced in ¬ß2 of the Philosophical Investigations: Later \\"this\\" and \\"there\\" are added (with functions analogous to the function these words have in natural language), and \\"a, b, c, d\\" as numerals. An example of its use: builder A says \\"d ‚Äî slab ‚Äî there\\" and points, and builder B counts four slabs, \\"a, b, c, d...\\" and moves them to the place pointed to by A. The builder's language is an activity into which is woven something we would recognize as language, but in a simpler form. This language-game resembles the simple forms of language taught to children, and Wittgenstein asks that we conceive of it as \\"a complete primitive language\\" for a tribe of builders.

Biography  Bo was born on January 25, 1911 in Sestri Levante, Italy. Bo wrote his first book in 1935, a monograph on Jacques Riviere. Before the Second World War, in the year 1936, he published an essay on the literary magazine Il Frontespizio which gathered together the most relevant poets like Mario Luzi, and contemporary artists from Ottone Rosai to Giorgio Morandi and Quinto Martini. His essay was titled \\"Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)\\", containing the theoretical-methodological fundamentals of hermetic poetry. In 1939 he began teaching French literature at the University of Urbino. Bo was the rector of French literature of University of Urbino from 1947, for more than 50 years. Bo was appointed a Senator for life on July 18, 1984 and has been a member of several parties. He served with the Christian Democrats, from 1987 to 1994; the Italian People's Party, from 1994 to 2001; and The Daisy, from 2001 until his death. Bo died in Genoa on July 21, 2001.  Legacy  His focus on hermetic poetry was to become a strong poetical movement comprising important poets, such as Salvatore Quasimodo and Eugenio Montale, both of whom would go on to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature (1959, 1975). Carlo Bo himself, however, never did and, at the age of 86, was rendered incapable of understanding Dario Fo's 1997 receipt of the Nobel Prize in Literature, saying \\"I must be too old to understand. What does this mean? That everything changes, even literature has changed.\\" Bo is credited with writing roughly 40 books and would also found the national Gentile da Fabriano prize.

The suburb is located 18 km from Perth's central business district. It is bordered by the Mitchell Freeway, Hepburn ave, Wanneroo road and Warwick road History The Gold Land Development Corporation used the name Greenwood Forest as the promotional name of the estate which commenced development in the area in 1969. The reserve between the suburbs of Duncraig and Greenwood was used for the construction of the Mitchell Freeway in 1985-1986. Education Greenwood is home to a senior high school and three primary schools: * Greenwood College * Greenwood Primary School * West Greenwood Primary School * Liwara Catholic Primary School The original Greenwood Primary School closed in 1997 and the land was sub-divided and sold as residential lots. During June 2007, the government announced that Allenswood Primary School and East Greenwood Primary schools would amalgamate, temporarily at the East Greenwood site, and a new school would be built on the Allenswood site. Allenswood primary closed at the end of the 2007 school year and was demolished, making way for the construction of the new school, expected to be completed in late 2009. In 2008, East Greenwood Primary School was renamed Greenwood Primary School, later relocating, at the commencement of Term 4 2010 to the newly constructed, ex Allenswood Primary Site. East Greenwood Primary was then also demolished. Greenwood Senior High School became independent in 2011-2012 and changed its name to Greenwood College.

It is a physiographic section of the Columbia Plateau province, which in turn is part of the larger Intermontane Plateaus physiographic division. The South Fork of the Payette has its headwaters in the Sawtooth Wilderness, which is part of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. Geography The principal tributaries of the Payette River are the North and South forks. The North Fork drains about , beginning north of McCall and flowing into Payette Lake. The North Fork exits at the southwest end of Payette Lake at and flows south in the \\"Long Valley\\" of Valley County toward Cascade. It then flows into the Cascade Reservoir, then continues south, accompanied by Highway 55. The South Fork Payette River drains about , originating on the west side of the Sawtooth Wilderness beneath the Mount Payette. It flows past Grandjean and down to Lowman, along Highway 21. The shorter Middle Fork Payette River parallels the lower North Fork to the east, flowing south and joining the South Fork just southwest of Crouch. Further east, the Deadwood River parallels the Middle Fork and empties into the South Fork just west of Lowman. The main stem of the Payette River is shown on USGS topographic maps as beginning at the confluence of the South and Middle forks. The North Fork joins the Payette at the village of Banks, at an elevation of . The main stem flows south from Banks for to Horseshoe Bend, then west into Black Canyon Reservoir. Below the reservoir's dam, the river flows past Emmett and Payette, then empties into the Snake River at the Oregon border. The Payette River has an average annual discharge into the Snake River of of water. History Rafters prepare for rapids on the North Fork near Banks, close to the beginning of the main stem of the Payette The river's watershed was originally settled by the Shoshone, Nez Perce, Paiute and Bannock Native American groups. Before contact with Europeans, many of the indigenous peoples had no permanent villages or settlements. During the fall and winter, they camped in the semi-arid lower valley of the main stem Payette River. In spring and summer, they temporarily moved to the lush area of lakes and wetlands along the North Fork now known as Long Valley, where they hunted and gathered in preparation for the coming winter. Camas bulbs, widespread in this area, was a staple of their diet. In order to maintain the naturally occurring fields of camas, they would set controlled burns whenever they moved to the next camp. The seasonal burning also cleared unwanted vegetation and protected their campsites from overgrowth. In the early 19th century, Europeans began exploring western Idaho. Francois Payette, for whom the river is named, was a French-Canadian fur trapper who worked for the North West Company and was one of the first people of European descent to explore the Payette River basin. Payette ventured east from Fort Astoria in 1818. From 1835 to 1844, he headed the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Boise trading post near Parma, on the Snake River some distance south of the Payette River. In 1844, Payette retired to Montreal, still over twenty years before settlers began to arrive in great numbers from the eastern United States. One of the first pioneer settlements was on Clear Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Payette River. Many of the Native Americans were unhappy with the new settlers for taking and causing damage to their lands, especially due to mining, logging, and grazing. Armed conflicts resulted, including the Nez Perce War of 1877, when the US Army was dispatched to western Idaho. Due to the abundant timber in the Payette River basin, one of the first new industries in the 19th century was logging, but did not reach large scale until the early 20th century. Demand for wooden railroad ties for the Oregon Short Line (OSL) in the 1880s increased logging operations in the area. One of the main centers of logging was in the southern part of Long Valley downstream from what is now the town of Cascade. A splash dam was built in 1902 by the Minnesota-based Payette Lumber and Manufacturing Company on the North Fork in order to help the transportation of logs downstream. Settlers began to move into the upper Payette basin, and in 1911, the Idaho Northern Railroad was constructed between Emmett along the Payette River, through Black Canyon and the North Fork, and ending just below Long Valley at Smith's Ferry on the river, named for a settler who bought the operation in 1891. The railroad transported timber, livestock and crops between Long Valley and the Treasure Valley. Starting around 1874, there was heavy agricultural development in the valley of the lower Payette River. Irrigation systems were necessary due to the semi-arid climate of this area. The Last Chance Canal and Nobel Canal were among the first private ditches constructed to divert water from the Payette River. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) constructed Black Canyon Diversion Dam in 1924 to direct water from the Payette River into the Emmett and Black Canyon Canals, which run at higher elevations than the older ditches and vastly increased the potential for irrigation. In order to store water for irrigation in the dry season, the USBR constructed Deadwood Dam in 1929 on the Deadwood River tributary of the South Fork. Cascade Dam was constructed in 1948, flooding a large area of Long Valley. It provides more than four times the storage capacity of Deadwood. Fish and reservoirs Cascade Dam forms Cascade Lake on the North Fork, the largest body of water in the Payette River drainage Due to the wide range in elevation, the Payette River has a variety of fish and fish habitats. Salmon and steelhead were eliminated in the drainage by the Black Canyon Diversion Dam, which was first completed in 1924. From its mouth upstream to Black Canyon Dam, the river supports a mixed fishery for coldwater and warmwater species. Mountain whitefish make up the bulk of game fish in this section of river, with smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, black crappie, rainbow trout, and brown trout making significant contributions. Upstream from Black Canyon Dam, the gradient of the river increases with coldwater species increasing in abundance. The South Fork of the Payette River supports excellent populations of wild rainbow trout. The North Fork of the Payette River has been severely altered by railroad and highway construction and provides only a marginal fishery for salmonids. However, in unaltered sections such as the Cabarton reach, the North Fork is very productive for salmonids. There are five major impoundments in the Payette basin: Black Canyon, Sage Hen, Paddock, Cascade, and Deadwood reservoirs. There are also several small impoundments and natural lakes with increased storage, such as the three Payette Lakes. Black Canyon, on the mainstem, provides only marginal fish habitat. Sand from upstream land disturbances has covered most of the habitat. Paddock Reservoir, on Big Willow Creek, has one of the better populations of black crappie in the state and a good fishery for largemouth bass. Cascade Reservoir on the North Fork is one of the most heavily fished waters in the state. Cascade has an abundance of yellow perch, coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Deadwood Reservoir, completed in 1931, contains kokanee and cutthroat trout. Alpine lakes within the Payette River drainage are stocked with rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, cutbow (rainbow-cutthroat hybrids), golden trout, and Arctic grayling. Brook trout are also present in a number of lakes. Whitewater The Payette River is famous for its whitewater. Experts call the North Fork Class V run one of the most challenging river reaches in North America, if not the world. Kayaking on the lower North Fork from Smith's Ferry to Banks is world-class, easily viewed from state highway #55, which closely hugs its bank, primarily on the west side. The lower North Fork narrows and drops 1700 feet (518 m) in the 16 miles (26 km) above Banks, providing nearly endless Class V rapids (see International Scale of River Difficulty). The average gradient is per mile (21 m/km) with a maximum gradient of 200 ft/mile (38 m/km). The North Fork's flow rate is controlled through the Cascade Dam, completed in 1948, providing relatively warm water from the shallow Cascade Reservoir. To the east of Banks, the South Fork's Canyon, west of Lowman, is a challenging Class IV run for rafting. Along this trip is a Class VI waterfall (Big Falls), which is portaged. The North Fork and South Fork merge at Banks to form the Payette River (main), providing a float trip with numerous Class III rapids. The highway on this lower stretch of the river is on the east bank and a scenic railroad, the Thunder Mountain Line, runs above the west side.

At its northwestern corner is the Hillarys Boat Harbour, built in the late 1980s. History Sorrento Beach A private subdivision of freehold land known as \\"Sorrento\\" was surveyed here in 1929. It is assumed that the name was taken from the Italian seaside town of Sorrento which is located south of Naples opposite the Isle of Capri. Prior to white settlement, the Whadjuk Aboriginal people, who called the area Mooro, gathered abalone and other shellfish in large numbers off the nearby reefs. The first European to settle in the area was Patrick Marmion, master whaler, who operated a whaling station in the area in 1849. There are still some remains of the old whaling station at the present-day Surf Lifesaving Club site, and a monument to Marmion can be found in Geneff Park in Padbury Circle. The area was popular with fishermen in the 1930s, and numerous boatsheds and shacks were built there. Residential settlement commenced in the early 1950s and until 1981, it was part of the suburb of Marmion. Sorrento's development (1950‚Äì1990) In 1958, the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions bought land in Sorrento at what was then the end of the West Coast Highway, and in 1967, the Sisters and boarding students moved from Highgate to the new site, Sacred Heart College Sorrento. The college became coeducational in 1977, and in 1989, the Catholic Education Commission took over management of the school.Sacred Heart - History , accessed 2007-01-17 In preparation for Australia's defence of the 1987 America's Cup at Fremantle, the State Government commissioned the building of Hillarys Boat Harbour, the first major marina in the north metropolitan area. The retail complex on the site, called Sorrento Quay, commenced trading in December 1987 and was officially opened in January 1988. Also, in May 1987, the Government declared Marmion Marine Park over a region from Burns Beach to Trigg, to which the new marina complex provided a gateway. Geography Sorrento is bounded by Hepburn Avenue to the north, Marmion Avenue to the east, Marine Terrace to the south and West Coast Drive and the Indian Ocean to the west. At the 2001 Australian census, Sorrento had a population of 7,321 people living in 2,796 dwellings. Sorrento's oceanside location and to Hillarys Boat Harbour has seen the suburb become affluent since the 1980s, and the ABS identified many managers and professionals living within the suburb. However, many tradespeople and service employees also live in the area. Facilities Sorrento is a residential suburb, relying on the Seacrest Village shopping centre for basic commercial services, and Whitford City and Centro Warwick for other services. Several parks of various sizes are situated in the suburb. The Sorrento Quay retail development within the Hillarys Boat Harbour sits on the northwestern boundary of the suburb. Off the coast is the Marmion Marine Park, which provides a home for many species of marine animals.

Dedicated April 17, 2009.) (August 26, 1879 ‚Äì July 2, 1958) is considered one of the best heavyweight boxers of the early 20th century. Because he was African-American, he was not given a shot at the world heavyweight title, though he did win the World Colored Heavyweight Championship. Early life and career Jeannette was born on August 26, 1879, in West Hoboken, New Jersey, which is now part of Union City, to Mena and Benjamin F. Jeanette, who worked for a local blacksmith. He began work as his father's apprentice, and then as a coal truck driver for Jaels and Bellis. In 1904, at the age of 25, he began his boxing career on a dare, fighting against Arthur Dickinson in Jersey City. At and weighing , Jeanette was relatively short and stocky, with his initial knowledge of fighting stemming from youthful street brawls.Rosero, Jessica (February 19, 2006). \\"Native Sons and Daughters: North Hudson Native and 20th Century Boxing Sensation Joe Jeanette\\". The Hudson Reporter. Professional career Joe Jeanette and Tom Kennedy, circa 1910-1915 Within two years, Jeanette was considered one of the best black heavyweights in the United States. Jeanette mimicked the style of Sam Langford, whom he fought 15 times (some sources say 14Moyle, Clay. \\"Sam Langford: Boxing's Greatest Uncrowned Champion\\" Interview by Bob Carroll, Doghouse Boxing; Mar 19, 2009), developing defensive techniques that were elusive and effective. Opponents considered Jeanette, whose style reflected the \\"inside punching\\" style of the times, a dangerous inside boxer whom few wished to fight. Because of the racial barrier, black boxers only had a small number of prospective opponents from which to choose, and often ended up matched against the same fighters over and over. Jeanette fought the future heavyweight champion Jack Johnson seven times in his first two years as a pro, and a total of ten times. According to the Ken Burns documentary Unforgivable Blackness, Jeanette lost twice, won one fight on a foul after two rounds, had two draws, and five \\"No Decisions\\" in his fights against Johnson. Johnson called Jeannette \\"the toughest man I ever fought.\\" After Johnson became the first African-American Heavyweight Champion of the World on December 26, 1908, he never again fought Jeanette, despite numerous challenges. Johnson's refusal to fight African-Americans offended the African-American community. Jeanette criticized Johnson, saying, \\"Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.\\" Jeanette was never allowed to fight for the heavyweight championship during his 15-year career, despite having a stellar record against opponents of all races. Joe's most memorable fight occurred on April 17, 1909 in a return bout with Sam McVey in Paris, France that lasted three- and-a-half-hours, and 49 rounds, the longest boxing match of the 20th century, and one of the greatest marathons in boxing history. Although McVey began the fight strong and looked like a sure winner, knocking down the usually sturdy Jeannette 27 times, and almost knocking him out in the 16th round with a right uppercut to Jeanette's jaw, he weakened greatly by the 19th round. Jeanette took control, knocking down McVey, a boxer (who had only been stopped once in his career, by Johnson), 19 times. After the 49th round, McVey could not rise from his stool at the call of time and Jeannette was declared winner on a technical knockout. This won him the \\"World Colored Heavyweight Championship,\\" as Jack Johnson had defeated Tommy Burns for his heavyweight title the previous December. Jeanette retired in 1919Burns, Ken. \\"Sparring\\" Profiles of Jack Johnson's opponents at Unforgivable Blackness at the age of 40. Of his 166 documented pro fights (he believed it was closer to 400), in a career spanning 1904-1922, Jeanette had 106 wins, 68 of which were by knockout, with 20 losses. Only two of his losses were by knockout, once early in his career and once late in his career. He is rated alongside the very best boxers of his era, including Johnson, Langford, and McVey. Personal life Jeanette met his wife, Adelaide, at a dance in Hoboken. They had two children, a son, Joe Jr., and a daughter, Agnes.\\"The Real World's Champion\\" JoeJennette.com; 2008; Accessed July 9, 2010 Post-boxing career and legacy Historical marker in Union City, New Jersey, in front of where Jeanette's home and gym once stood Unlike many boxers, Jeanette was not a spendthrift and invested his money and time wisely. He spent most of his career fighting in and around the Eastern Seaboard, with only brief tours of Europe. After his career, he became a referee and a trainer of young boxers. He owned a boxing gym on 27th Street and Summit Avenue in Union City, New Jersey, where he was a fixture on the boxing scene for many years, training hundreds of boxers, including Heavyweight Champion James J. Braddock. Jeanette, who was fond of automobiles, eventually converted his boxing gym into a garage, out of which he operated a fleet of rental limousines, and then a taxi company named Adelaide, after his wife, which was located at 522 Clinton Avenue, now New York Avenue.

The battle was initiated upon the advancement of elite Imperial Japanese Army forces towards Pasir Panjang Ridge on 13 February. 13,000 Japanese troops had made an amphibious landing in northwestern Singapore near Sarimbun (see Battle of Sarimbun Beach) and had started to advance south towards Pasir Panjang. They had already captured Tengah Airfield en route. The 13,000 soldiers constituted a significant part of the total strength of 36,000 Japanese troops deployed in the invasion of Singapore. Preparations The 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade, comprising the British 2nd Loyal Regiment under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Mordaunt Elrington, together with the 1st Malaya Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J.R.G. Andre, consisted of less than three sections of the Mortar Platoon, Anti- Aircraft Platoon along with the Bren Gun Carrier Platoon under Captain R.R.C. Carter, all of which were held in reserve. These units were tasked with defending the approach to Pasir Panjang Ridge, also known as \\"The Gap\\". The 44th Indian Brigade were positioned on their right flank. A Malay platoon, consisting of 42 soldiers and their officers, commanded by Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, was holding a critical part of the British defences at Bukit Chandu. Adnan and his men would take the brunt of the Japanese assault shortly after. Battle Contemporary Map for the Battle of Pasir Panjang, circa 1945 The first battle between the Malay Regiment and Japanese soldiers occurred on 13 February at around 1400 hours. The Japanese 18th Division started to attack the southwestern coast along Pasir Panjang Ridge and astride Ayer Rajah Road. The Japanese 56th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Nasu, supported by a considerable force of artillery, attacked the ridge during the morning. One of the units defending the line was B Company of the Malay Regiment. Under heavy fire from the Japanese, who had artillery and tank support, B Company was forced to retreat to the rear. However, before the retreat could be completed, the Japanese succeeded in breaking through B Company's position. In the battle, the troops fought hand-to-hand combat using bayonets against the Japanese. A few from B Company managed to save themselves while others were captured as prisoners-of-war. This penetration led to the withdrawal after dark, of both the 44th Indian and 1st Malay Brigade, to the general line at Mount Echo (junction of Ayer Rajah and Depot Road, around present-day Buona Vista). =Bukit Chandu= Malay mortar crew on display at Bukit Chandu On 14 February, the eve of Chinese New Year, the Japanese again launched a large- scale attack at 0830 hours with heavy support by intense mortar bombardment and artillery gunfire, on the battlefront held by the 1st Malay Brigade. The defenders managed to beat this off and a number of other attacks despite suffering considerable casualties. The fighting also included bitter hand-to- hand combat and losses on the Japanese side were as heavy as their Malay foes. At 1600 hours, another attack, this time also supported by tanks, eventually succeeded in penetrating the left flank and the defenders on this side were forced back to a line running from the junction of Ayer Rajah Road to Depot Road through to Alexandra Brickworks and along the canal leading to Bukit Chermin further southeast. Owing to the failure of units on both of its flanks to hold their ground, the 1st Malay Brigade had to withdraw at 1430 hours the following day. It was at this point that C Company of the Malay Regiment received instructions to move to a new defence position sited at Bukit Chandu. Bukit Chandu (meaning \\"Opium Hill\\" in Malay) was so named after an opium- processing factory located at the foot of the hill. This was also where C Company of the Malay Regiment made their final stand against the imminent Japanese attack. Bukit Chandu was a key strategic defence position for two important reasons. Firstly, it was situated on high ground overlooking the island to the northwest and secondly, if the Japanese gained control of the ridge, it gave them direct passage to the Alexandra area just behind. The British military in Singapore had its main ammunition bases and supply depots, one of their military hospitals (Alexandra Hospital) and other key installations (such as the Normanton Oil Depot) located right next to Alexandra. C Company's position was separated from D Company by a big canal. Oil was burning in the canal, which flowed from the bombed-out and severely- destroyed Normanton Oil Depot. The burning oil in the canal prevented C Company's soldiers from retreating further back. The company was under the command of Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi. He encouraged his men to defend Bukit Chandu down to the last soldier and was killed together with many of his fellow soldiers in the last desperate defensive battle at Pasir Panjang. The Japanese military pressed on their attack on Bukit Chandu in the afternoon, but this time they did so under the guise of a deception attempt. They sent a group of their soldiers, dressed in captured British Indian troops' uniforms (with their faces and skin smeared with dirt and soot and the wearing of turbans to pass off as Punjabis), to present themselves as allied Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army. C Company saw through this trick as they knew that soldiers of the British Army typically marched in a line of three columns while the supposed Punjabi soldiers in front of their lines were moving in a line of four columns. When they reached the Malay Regiment's defensive line, C Company's troops opened fire, killing many disguised Japanese soldiers. Those who survived escaped downhill back to friendly lines. =Last stand= Two hours later, the Japanese forces launched an all-out banzai charge in great numbers in an attempt to wipe out the Malay troops ahead through sheer numbers and over-arching strength. The attack, conducted again with artillery shelling and tank support, overwhelmed the Malay Regiment and the defence line eventually broke. Despite being greatly outnumbered and short of ammunition (with only a few grenades at hand and not many rounds for their machine guns and rifles left) and much-needed combat supplies (including medication and bandages), the Malay Regiment continued to resist the Japanese. Both sides engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat as well as using bayonets. Adnan was seriously wounded but refused to retreat or surrender and instead encouraged his men to fight to the end. Soon after, with the whole area of Pasir Panjang falling under Japanese control, Adnan, who was badly wounded and unable to fight, was captured. Instead of taking him prisoner, the Japanese continuously kicked, punched and beat him before tying him to a tree and stabbing him to death with their bayonets (some sources claim that Adnan was brutally beaten up before being thrown into a tied-up gunny sack, which was then stabbed repeatedly by his Japanese captors, while others indicate that they stabbed him to death before hanging him upside down from a tree). Casualties During the entire Malayan Campaign, but mostly from 12 to 15 February 1942 in Singapore, the Malay Regiment suffered a total of 159 killed. Six of them were British officers, seven Malay officers, 146 other ranks and a large but unspecified number wounded. About 600 surviving Malay Regiment soldiers reassembled in the Keppel Golf Link area. Here, they were separated from their British officers. They later joined prisoners-of-war from the British Indian Army battalions at the Farrer Park concentration area. It remains unclear as to how many casualties the Japanese suffered. Aftermath The battle of Pasir Panjang had little strategic significance. From a purely military operational perspective, the Battle of Pasir Panjang could not change the outcome of the fate of Singapore and it was a matter of time before the British would surrender to the Japanese 25th Army. The Allied units stationed there were simply tasked with defending the approach to the ridge, but instead had to resist the main invasion force. Bukit Chandu itself is situated on high ground overlooking the island to the north, and it controlled the direct passage to the Alexandra area where the British army had its main ammunition and supply depots, military hospital and other key installations. The fall of Bukit Chandu allowed Japan access to the Alexandra area, indirectly contributing to the Alexandra Hospital massacre. Adnan Saidi is described by many Singaporeans and Malaysians today as a hero for his actions on Bukit Chandu ‚Äì he encouraged his men not to surrender and instead fight to the death. In Singaporean and Malaysian school textbooks, he is also credited as the soldier who noticed the error in the marching style of the Japanese soldiers disguised as Indian troops. Fighting continued after his death and the subsequent British signing of surrender of Singapore to the Empire of Japan at 1810 hours on 15 February 1942 in the area around Alexandra Hospital, Tanjong Pagar and Pulau Belakang Mati (Sentosa) where some of the Malay Regiments regrouped.

Tahir ul-Qadri: A political 'enigma' aljazeera.com =Long March 2012= In December 2012, after living for seven years in Toronto, Canada, Qadri returned to Pakistan and initiated a political campaign. Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march in Islamabad to protest against the government's corruption. On 14 January 2013, a crowd marched down the city's main avenue. Thousands of people pledged to sit-in until their demands were met. When he started the long march from Lahore about 50,000 people were with him. He told the rally in front of parliament: \\"There is no Parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits [bandits] ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.\\" After four days of sit-in, the Government and Qadri signed an agreement called the Islamabad Long March Declaration, which promised electoral reforms and increased political transparency. Although Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march, the estimated total present for the sit-in in Islamabad was more than 500,000 . Critics have charged that the protests were a ploy by the Pakistan Armed Forces to delay elections and weaken the influence of the civilian government, citing Qadri's close ties to the military, dual nationality and suspect foreign and Pakistani sources of funding.Arab News, \\"Pak crisis deepends: PM arrest ordered as rally shakes capital,\\" front page, Vol. XXXVIII, #45. Wednesday, 16 January 2013 Lawyers for the Supreme Court of Pakistan claimed that Qadri's demands are unfeasible because they conflict with the Constitution of Pakistan. The Tribune reported on 17 February 2013, that Qadri seemed to have capitulated on most of his demands in the Islamabad Long March Declaration. =Long March 2014= On 17 June 2014, a violent clash occurred between the Punjab Police and PAT activists resulting in the deaths of several protesters from police gunfire. As of the end of September 2014, the Inqilab March began, with sit-in protests with allied partner Imran Khan, chairman and founder of Tehreek-e- Insaaf (PTI) and organiser of 2014 Azadi March, in the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. \\"'Revolution March' to Begin on August 14: Tahirul Qadri\\" , The News International, 10 August 2014. Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri did not fully join their protest marches nor decline to support each other. On 10 August 2014, Qadri formally announced that his party's political march, the Inqilab March, would proceed parallel with PTI's Azadi march. Both marches were organised to take different routes, albeit closely mirroring each other. It is apparent that the two parties have similar objectives yet different aims and strategies. The announcement of two parallel marches by parties in opposition gave rise to speculation that a coalition between PTI and PAT was possible. The chiefs of the two parties never clearly stipulated a formal coalition; but an informal agreement to support each other was achieved On 21 August 2014, Qadri said that the government had not been allowing his workers to supply food items and potable water to the participants of the sit-in. The Daily Dawn of 31 August 2014 claimed that hundreds of people were injured in the federal capital as police battled throngs of protesters led by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Pakistan Awami Tehreek. It was reported that Tahir-ul- Qadri led the Eid prayer at Islamabad's D-Chowk. The congregation was attended by Imran Khan and other political leaders, including Raja Nasir Abbas Jafary of MWM.

Five police officers remain under arrest. The standoff lasted for almost 11 hours when the police's anti- encroachment squad launched an operation to remove the barriers from the road leading to the offices of Minhaj-ul-Quran and the residence of PAT founder Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri in Model Town, Lahore. Although, police officials were given a court order by PAT leaders, stating \\"due to terrorism issues, place security barriers in front of Minhaj-ul-Quran and the residence of PAT founder Qadri\\", but the police still attacked. The incident was broadcast live on various local news channels and there were conflicting accounts of how the standoff began. Police claimed that they were attacked by people inside the PAT secretariat, a claim that is denied by party chief Qadri. In the live footage broadcast on television, the policemen were shown firing assault rifles and lobbing tear gas canisters at the protesting masses while the protesters threw stones at the police for defence. Qadri strongly condemned the attack and called it the worst form of state terrorism. Qadri vowed to avenge the deaths of his political workers by bringing about a revolution that would hasten the end of the rule of prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif. =The Day of Martyrs= Qadri and his party observed Youm-e-Shuhada (Day of Martyrs) at 9 August 2014 in Tehreek-e-Minhaj ul Quran secretariat in Model Town. A Country-Wide clash occurred between Police and the Workers of PAT. After the gathering of People, He assured his supporters and the government that the rally on 10 August would be peaceful while requesting his followers to bring their prayer mats for recitation of the Quran. =Other Events= He has been invited to deliver his lectures by several organisations. In July 2011, he gave a lecture on the issues of terrorism and integration at the Parliament of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia where he was invited by the member of the NSW Legislative Council, Shaoquett Moselmane MLC. Qadri also made appearances on Australian media, where he discussed Islam, terrorism and possible troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. On 24 September 2011, Minhaj-ul-Quran convened the \\"Peace for Humanity Conference\\" at Wembley Arena in London where Tahir-ul-Qadri and the assembled speakers issued a declaration of peace on behalf of religious representatives of several faiths, scholars, politicians, and 12,000 participants present from various countries. This conference was endorsed by, or received supportive messages from, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar University, Ban Ki-Moon (Secretary General of the United Nations), Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu (Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), David Cameron (British Prime Minister), Nick Clegg (British Deputy Prime Minister), Rowan Williams (Archbishop of Canterbury) and others. On 30 November 2011, Qadri delivered a lecture at the \\"Peaceful Future of Afghanistan\\" conference in Istanbul, Turkey which was organised by the Center for World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution of George Mason University together with Marmara University and was attended by more than 120 Afghan leaders. On 22 February 2012, Qadri visited Delhi for a four-week tour of India. Qadri delivered a message of peace and said: \\"Terrorism has no place in Islam\\", while addressing the fatwa book launch in Delhi. People gathered to listen to Qadri along with government officials in Gujarat. Pak scholar debunks Islamic stereotypes Qadri also urged the Pakistani and Indian governments to reduce their defence expenditures and instead spend money on the welfare of poor people. He also visited Ajmer, where he was given a large reception, at which he gave a lecture on Sufism. On 4 January 2015, he declared terrorism as biggest problem of the world. =Fatwa on Terrorism= The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings is a 600-page (Urdu version), 512-page (English version) is an Islamic decree by Qadri which demonstrates from the Quran and Sunnah that terrorism and suicide bombings are unjust and evil, and thus un-Islamic. It was published in London as a book. This fatwa is a direct refutation of the ideology of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. It is one of the most extensive Islamic anti-terrorism rulings, an \\"absolute\\" condemnation of terrorism without \\"any excuses or pretexts\\" which goes further than ever and declares that terrorism is kufr under Islamic law. The launch was organised by Minhaj-ul-Quran UK. Qadri said during the launch that \\"Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts.\\" The fatwa received widespread media attention and was positively covered by the international press. According to CNN, experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting. CNN's Amanpour show added the fatwa summary to its website and declared it to be fatwa for peace, while the US State Department declares the fatwa to be significant step in taking Islam back from terrorists. Before it had been released, Douglas Murray described the Fatwa on Terrorism, in an article in the Evening Standard, as \\"potentially important\\", although he said \\"A single-fatwa will not change the level of denial and self criticism inherent in so much of modern Islam\\". ITV news channel questioned the credibility of the fatwa and asks if it was not by the British government because senior counter-terrorism officials from Scotland Yard and MI5 were present at the launch. The 512-page English book version of the fatwa, Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings, (London: Minhaj-ul-Quran, 2011. ) has a foreword by John Esposito and an introduction by Joel Hayward, both of whom share Qadri's scholarly assessment that, regardless of any intention, the evil of terrorism remains evil and must be exposed, opposed and condemned. The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings has been officially endorsed by Al- Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. In January 2011, the fatwa was discussed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2011. In June 2011, Pope Benedict XVI received a copy of the fatwa from representatives of Minhaj Interfaith Relations. The Pope reportedly appreciated that it promoted peace, harmony and interfaith dialogue. Minhaj man meets Pope The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings was reviewed positively by Kemal Argon who published a review in the Journal of Rotterdam Islamic and Social Sciences, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2011, pp. 149‚Äì160. Islamic University of Rotterdam, Netherlands.

The species of the genus, commonly known as milk-caps, are characterized by the milky fluid (\\"latex\\") they exude when cut or damaged. Like the closely related genus Russula, their flesh has a distinctive brittle consistency. It is a large genus with over 500 known species, mainly distributed in the Northern hemisphere. Recently, the genus Lactifluus has been separated from Lactarius based on molecular phylogenetic evidence. Systematics and taxonomy The genus Lactarius was described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797 with L. piperatus as the original type species. In 2011, L. torminosus was accepted as the new type of the genus after the splitting-off of Lactifluus as separate genus. The name \\"Lactarius\\" is derived from the Latin lac, \\"milk\\". =Placement within Russulaceae= Molecular phylogenetics uncovered that, while macromorphologically well-defined, milk- caps were in fact a paraphyletic genus; as a consequence, the genera Lactifluus was split from Lactarius, and the species L. furcatus was moved to the new genus Multifurca, together with some former Russula species. Multifurca also represents the likely sister group of Lactarius (see phylogeny, right). In the course of these taxonomical rearrangements, the name Lactarius was conserved for the genus with the new type species Lactarius torminosus; this way, the name Lactarius could be retained for the bigger genus with many well-known temperate species, while the name Lactifluus has to be applied only to a smaller number of species, containing mainly tropical, but also some temperate milk-caps such as Lactifluus volemus and Lf. vellereus. =Relationships within Lactarius= left Phylogenetic analyses have also revealed that Lactarius, in the strict sense, contains some species with closed (angiocarpous) fruitbodies, e.g. L. angiocarpus described from Zambia. The angiocarpous genera Arcangeliella and Zelleromyces are phylogenetically part of Lactarius. Systematics within Lactarius is a subject of ongoing research. Three subgenera are currently accepted and supported by molecular phylogenetics: *Piperites: Northern temperate region, three species in tropical Africa. *Russularia: Northern temperate region and tropical Asia. *Plinthogalus: Northern temperate region, tropical Africa, and tropical Asia. Some more species, all tropical, do not seem to fall into these subgenera and occupy more basal positions within Lactarius. This includes for example L. chromospermus from tropical Africa with an odd brown spore color. Currently, around 600 Lactarius species are described, but roughly one fourth or 150 of these are believed to belong to Lactifluus, while the angiocarpous genera Arcangeliella and Zelleromyces have not yet been synonymized with Lactarius. It is estimated that a significant number of Lactarius species remain to be described. Description =Macromorphology= right Spores of right right The eponymous \\"milk\\" and the brittle consistency of the flesh are the most prominent field characters of milk-cap fruitbodies. The milk or latex emerging from bruised flesh is often white or cream, but more vividly coloured in some species; it can change upon exposition or remain unchanged. Fruitbodies are small to very large, gilled, rather fleshy, without veil, often depressed or even funnel-shaped with decurrent gills. Cap surface can be glabrous, velvety or pilose, dry, sticky or viscose and is often zonate. Several species have pits (scrobicules) on the cap or pileus surface. Dull colors prevail, but some more colorful species exist, e.g. the blue Lactarius indigo or the orange species of section Deliciosi. Spore print color is white to ocher or, in some cases, pinkish. Some species have angiocarpous, i.e., closed fruitbodies. =Micromorphology= Microscopically, Lactarius species have elliptical, rarely globoid spores with amyloid ornamentation in the form of more or less prominent warts or spines, connected by ridges, like other members of the family Russulaceae. The trama (flesh) contains spherical cells that cause the brittle structure. Unlike Russula, Lactarius also have lactiferous, i.e. latex-carrying hyphae in their trama. =Species identification= Distinguishing Lactarius from Lactifluus based on morphology alone is difficult; there are no synapomorphic characters known so far that define both genera unequivocally but tendencies exist: zonate and viscose to glutinose caps are only found in Lactarius, as well as closed (angiocarpous) and sequestrate fruitbodies. All known annulate and pleurotoid (i.e., laterally stiped) milk-caps, on the contrary, belong to Lactifluus. Characters important for identification of milk-caps (Lactarius and Lactifluus) are: initial colour of the latex and color change, texture of cap surface, taste (mild, peppery, or bitter) of latex and flesh, odor, and microscopical features of the spores and the cap curticle (pileipellis). The habitat and especially the type of host tree can also be critical. While there are some easily recognizable species, other species can be quite hard to determine without microscopical examination. Distribution Lactarius is one of the most prominent genera of mushroom-forming fungi in the Northern hemisphere. It also occurs natively in Northern Africa, tropical Africa, tropical Asia, Central America, and Australia. Its possible native distribution in South America and different parts of Australasia is unclear, as many species in those regions, poorly known, might in fact belong to Lactifluus, which has a more tropical distribution than Lactarius. Several species have also been introduced with their host trees outside their native range, e.g. in South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Ecology Lactarius belongs to a lineage of ectomycorrhiza obligate symbionts. As such, they are dependent on the occurrence of possible host plants. Confirmed habitats apart from temperate forests include arctic tundra and boreal forest, mediterranean maquis, tropical African shrubland, tropical Asian rainforest, mesoamerican tropical oak forests, and Australian Eucalyptus forests. left While most species display a preference towards either broadleaf or coniferous hosts, some are more strictly associated with certain genera or species of plant hosts. A well-studied example is that of alders, which have several specialized Lactarius symbionts (e.g. L. alpinus, L. brunneohepaticus, L. lilacinus), some of which even evolved specificity to one of the Alnus subgenera. Other examples of specialized associations of Lactarius are with Cistus shrubs (L. cistophilus and L. tesquorum), beech (e.g. L. blennius), birches (e.g. L. pubescens), hazel (e.g. L. pyrogalus), oak (e.g. L. quietus), pines (e.g. L. deliciosus), or fir (e.g. L. deterrimus). For most tropical species, host plant range is poorly known, but species in tropical Africa seem to be rather generalist. Lactarius species are considered late-stage colonizers, that means, they are generally not present in early-colonizing vegetation, but establish in later phases of succession. However, species symbiotic with early colonizing trees, such as L. pubescens with birch, will rather occur in early stages. Several species have preferences regarding soil pH and humidity, which will determine the habitats in which they occur. Edibility Lactarius deliciosus for sale on a market in Barcelona, Spain Several Lactarius species are edible. L. deliciosus notably ranks among the most highly valued mushrooms in the Northern hemisphere, while opinions vary on the taste of other species, such as L. indigo or L. deterrimus. Several species are reported to be regularly collected for food in Russia, Tanzania and Hunan, China. Some Lactarius are considered toxic, for example L. turpis, which contains a mutagenic compound, or L. helvus. There are, however, no deadly poisonous mushrooms in the genus. Bitter or peppery species, for example L. torminosus, are generally not considered edible, at least raw, but are nevertheless consumed in some regions, e.g. in Finland. Some small, fragrant species, such as the \\"candy caps\\", are sometimes used as flavoring. L. deliciosus is one of the few ectomycorrhizal mushrooms that has been successfully cultivated. Chemistry Different bioactive compounds have been isolated from Lactarius species, such as sesquiterpenoids, aromatic volatiles, and mutagenic substances. Pigments have been isolated from colored Lactarius species, such as L. deliciosus or L. indigo. Pharmacology An extract of Lactarius badiosanguineus exhibits inhibitory activity on thrombin.

Spencer of Essex, Connecticut, invited 200 Hungarian wine-making families then employed in the mining industry in Pennsylvania to settle on of land at this site. Many accepted this offer and were led by a Catholic priest, Father Frances Janisek. They named their larger community Budapest in honor of the capital of Hungary. A nearby village was named Tokaj in honor of a wine- producing region in Hungary. Tokaj was founded to satisfy the desire of brothers Jacob and Paul Estavanko for lots larger than . A smaller, third village, named Nitra, was also founded and populated by Hungarian settlers who participated in the local wine industry. Various groups from Ohio and other parts of the United States were attracted to the area and the new industry. The colony quickly flourished into a town with sixty buildings, including a Catholic church, stores and a post office. Soon the sloping hills were garlanded with grape vines. Storage vats were prepared and wineries were planned. It looked as though a new industry had succeeded in the South, but with passage of the Georgia Prohibition Act of 1907, the wine industry fell into ruins. One by one the families were forced to go elsewhere for their livelihood until today there are only one or two of the original families remaining. The wine produced in and around Tallapoosa was sold in the North. The last of the descendants of the Budapest settlers still living there died in 1964. Besides a cemetery located at the original site, all that today remains of the Hungarian colony is the original 6000 sq/ft mansion built by Father Janisek and the immigrants. It is currently referred by its owners to as Key's Castle, for the man, William Key (a relative of Francis Scott Key), who purchased the house and several vineyard plots from the Hungarians in 1906. The home is still owned by descendants of the Key family. The Estavanko family remained in Haralson County after the demise of the wine industry, and a local road is named after them.

The most famous line of the proclamation was that the Danish Duchy of Schleswig and the County of Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire, should now be, in the original Middle Low German language, Up Ewig Ungedeelt, or \\"Forever Undivided\\". This was to assume great importance as the slogan of German nationalists in the struggles of the 19th century, under completely different circumstances.  The treaty  The proclamation was issued in 1460 and declared that the King of Denmark should also be Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein. Another clause granted the nobility the right to revolt should the king break the agreement (a common feature of several medieval coronation charters). The agreement was most straightforward in regard to the future of Holstein, since King Christian I merely added the title of count to his existing titles. He was forbidden from annexing Holstein to Denmark and Holstein retained its independence and its position as an afterlehen of Saxe- Lauenburg (which, as part of the former Saxony, inherited this right), indirectly under the Holy Roman Emperor. Regarding the future of Schleswig, the agreement seems at first sight to contradict itself: the Danish king became Duke of Schleswig, a Danish fief, in effect becoming his own vassal. This arrangement should be seen as a guarantee against excessive Danish domination of the new union, whilst safeguarding against the partitioning of Holstein among Danish nobles. The most obvious result of this distinction was the exclusion of Schleswig in subsequent Danish laws, although the medieval Danish Code of Jutland (Danish: Jyske Lov) was retained as Schleswig's legal code. Another important, but much later, development was the gradual introduction of German-speaking administrators in the duchy resulting in a gradual but permanent Germanisation of the southern part of the province. German culture first spread in the cities, most probably as a result of the presence of merchants from the Hanseatic League. The process was greatly accelerated following the Lutheran Reformation, which introduced German liturgy in the churches in southern Schleswig - although the vernacular in most of this area was Danish. The major breakthrough of the process of Germanisation, however, did not occur until the end of the eighteenth century.  Historical background  = Early history = From the beginning of Danish history, the direct border to the mighty Frankish Empire posed a strategic threat to Danish independence. In fact, many historians have seen the construction of the first border fortifications, known as the Danevirke, as the first proof of the beginning of an independent Danish state. The border was challenged from both sides; Charlemagne sought to conquer Denmark, and Danish kings supported Saxons wishing to cast off the Frankish rule. Despite minor wars, a border was relatively quickly established at the River Eider. This border, which Denmark later considered to be its \\"natural border\\" is exemplified in a stone once set in the walls of Rendsburg (), a city on the border between Schleswig and Holstein. The stone had the following inscription: Eidora Terminus Imperii Romani (The Roman Empire ends at the Eider) = Valdemar the Victorious = During the early Middle Ages, a number of nobles from Holstein tried to expand their influence across the border into Schleswig. Most notably of these were the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein ruling Holstein. The border was also challenged by a number of Danish kings, most notably King Valdemar the Victorious who sought to obtain control of Northern Germany, then a part of the Holy Roman Empire. 1214 marked an important step in this process, when the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued a Golden Bull surrendering all imperial territories north of the rivers Elbe and Elde to Valdemar the Victorious. An action provoking many Holsatian nobles. In 1223, the fates were reversed when Henry I, Count of Schwerin (a.k.a. Heinrich der Schwarze) abducted Valdemar and his eldest son and imprisoned them in the Waldemarturm of Dannenberg Castle. Henry demanded that Valdemar should surrender all of his conquests in the Holy Roman Empire and instead swear allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. In fact, Emperor Frederick II tried to intervene and arrange Valdemar's release, but he was rebuffed by Count Henry. Henry's terms were flatly refused by the Danish envoys sent to negotiate the release of their king, and Danish nobles decided to attack Henry. The war ended in 1225 in Danish defeat. Valdemar was now forced to not only surrender his conquests in the Holy Roman Empire but also to take an oath not to seek revenge. Henry released him in 1226 and Valdemar immediately appealed to Pope Honorius III to have his oath declared void, a request granted by the Pope. In 1226, Valdemar returned with an army and attacked the Schauenburgers in Holstein. He used the utmost diligence in collecting an army, with which he entered Holstein, and, in the terms of the treaty concluded with his nephew Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, he was joined by Otto and the troops of Brunswick. Their united forces formed a very respectable array, and they took and destroyed a number of towns, and had recovered a great part of the County of Holstein, when they were opposed by Schauenburg Count Adolf IV of Holstein, who had been joined by his liege lord Albert I, Duke of Saxony and Prince-Archbishop Gerhard II of Bremen. The two armies were nearly of equal strength, and as both parties were anxious to try the issue of a general battle, they were not long in coming to an engagement. The field chosen for this action, was in the neighborhood of the town of Bornh√∂ved in Holstein. On 22 July 1227, the two armies clashed in the Battle of Bornh√∂ved. The battle was a decisive victory for Count Adolf IV of Holstein, in part owed to a number of troops from Dithmarschen who abandoned the Danish army during the battle. In the following peace settlement, Valdemar definitively gave up the hope of ever regaining his former possessions in the northern Holy Roman Empire (Northern Germany). =Denmark is dissolved= The next major turn of events took place in the early fourteenth century, as a result of the bankruptcy of the Danish state. This century saw Schleswig being dominated by a more Holstein-born or Low Saxon-speaking nobility. These local lords sought to keep Schleswig independent of the king and to forge close ties to Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire. This pursuit of autonomy would have effects for centuries to come. The bankruptcy of Denmark resulted in a rising influence of the King's creditors (mostly Holsatian nobles) in all parts of the country. In 1326, King Valdemar III of Denmark - by many Danish regarded as a usurper - was forced by the nobility of Schleswig and Holstein to sign the Constitutio Valdemaria promising that the Duchy of Schleswig and the Kingdom of Denmark may never be united under the same ruler, a first precursor to the Treaty of Ribe. Schleswig was consequently granted as a fief to Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg, the leader of one of the then four Holstein lines of the Schauenburg dynasty. By 1327, virtually all strongholds in Denmark had fallen under the control of Holsatian noblemen. In 1330, Valdemar III of Denmark abdicated his untenable kingship and returned to his former position as Duke Valdemar V of Schleswig). As compensation, Gerhard was awarded the island of Funen as a fief instead. In 1331 war broke out between Gerhard and the new king, Christopher II, ending in a Holstein-Rensburg victory. The peace terms were extremely harsh. King Christopher was only left in effective control of the island of Langeland and was faced with an impossible task of raising 100,000 silver marks to redeem his country. Denmark had effectively been dissolved and the country was left without a king between 1332 and 1340. =Valdemar IV regains Denmark= In 1340, King Valdemar IV of Denmark began a more-than-twenty-year-long struggle to reclaim his father's kingdom. Although eventually succeeding in regaining control of Zealand, Funen, Jutland, and the Scanian lands, he failed to obtain control of Schleswig, whose ducal House of Estridsen managed to continue its virtual independence. To gain influence over the province, Valdemar married Helvig of Schleswig, the only daughter of Duke Eric II of Schleswig. In 1372, he again turned his attention to Schleswig and conquered Gram. In 1373, he conquered Flensburg. The southern part of Schleswig had been mortgaged to a number of Holsatian nobles by Duke Henry of Schleswig (d 1375, a son of the former king Valdemar III of Denmark), the last duke of the Estridsen line. The childless, elderly Henry transferred his rights to his kinsman and brother-in-law, King Valdemar IV in 1373. This seemed a clear success for the king, but the Holsatian nobles refused to allow him to repay the mortgage and redeem the area in question. In 1374, Valdemar succeeded in buying large tracts of land in the province and was on the verge of starting a campaign to conquer the rest when he died on 24 October 1374. The nobles acted quickly and managed to establish control over the province in 1376. In 1386, Queen Margaret I of Denmark, the younger daughter of Valdemar IV of Denmark and Helvig of Schleswig, gave Schleswig as a hereditary fief under the Danish crown to Count Gerhard VI of Holstein-Rendsburg, provided that he swore allegiance to her son King Oluf. She too was unsuccessful in regaining effective control of the province. In 1409, Margaret's adopted son and Denmark's future king, Eric of Pomerania forced the Schauenburgers to surrender the city of Flensburg to him. War broke out in 1410, and Eric conquered the islands of Als and √Ür√∏. In 1411, Holstein-Rendsburg, which until 1403 had incorporated all Schauenburg lines except of Pinneberg, retook Flensburg, but in 1412 both sides agreed that an arbiter should settle the dispute, Ulrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard. Ulrich awarded the city to Denmark, and Queen Margaret took possession of it. During her stay in Flensburg, she was struck by the plague and died shortly after. War returned and a new mediation attempt was undertaken in 1416 by the Hanseatic League. Both sides recognised the League as arbitrators and Denmark pledged the city of Schleswig as security; the Holstein-Rendsburg pledged the stronghold of T√∂nning, but the mediation attempts were in vain. In 1421, the Holsteiners succeeded in regaining the cities of Haderslev, Schleswig, and T√∏nder. =The Emperor's verdict= In 1422, both sides recognised Duke Henry X of Silesia (also known as duke Heinrich Rumpold), envoy of the Holy Roman Emperor, as arbitrator. He managed to persuade the Schauenburgers to call off a planned attack on Flensburg, but died on 18 January 1423 before reaching a verdict. His master, Emperor Sigismund, now wished to settle the issue, a decision strongly opposed by the Schauenburgers. He called upon Louis of Cattaneis from Verona to travel to the disputed province and investigate the case. A similar process took place in Denmark. The Assemblies of both Lund, Ringsted, and Ribe all reached the conclusion that Schleswig was governed by Danish laws and formed part of Denmark. The decision made by the Assembly of Ribe on 4 August 1421 is of particular interest, since both the bishops of Ribe and Schleswig, the abbots from the monasteries of Ryd (modern Gl√ºcksburg) and L√∏gum as well as councillors from Flensburg, Aabenraa, Haderslev, and Ribe were all present. The assembly ruled that Schleswig was part of Denmark with the following argument ... the (people) of Southern Jutland use Danish law and have kept it since it was given. Second, all the old rights granted upon the chapels and House of God in Schleswig, Ribe, and Haderslev were given by the kings of the Realm. Thirdly, every man knows where the borders are located, that Denmark and Holstein are separated; even the language in Southern Jutland is Danish to this day. In 1424, a similar decision was made by Emperor Sigismund who decided that since his envoy had reported that the people of Schleswig spoke Danish, followed Danish customs, and considered themselves to be Danes, the province rightfully belonged to Denmark. Henry IV, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and Duke of Schleswig, strongly protested this verdict and refused to follow it. War returned in 1425. In 1431, a group of burghers in favour of Holstein-Rendsburg opened the gates of Flensburg and a Holsatian army took control of the city. In 1432, peace was settled, and Eric recognised the conquests made by the Holsatian nobles. =Adolf VIII dies= In 1439, the new Danish king Christopher III (a.k.a. Christopher of Bavaria) acquired the loyalty of Count Adolf VIII of Holstein-Rendsburg by granting him the entire Duchy of Schleswig as a hereditary fief but under the Danish crown. In 1459, Adolf died without leaving an heir and no other count could produce claims to both the Duchy of Schleswig and the County of Holstein-Rendsburg. King Christian I of Denmark did however hold a claim to Schleswig, and the separation of Schleswig and Holstein would have meant economic ruin for many members of the Schleswig and Holstein nobility. Moreover, the nobility failed to agree on taking a course. In 1460, King Christian summoned the nobles to Ribe, and on 2 March 1460, they agreed to elect him as the successor of Count Adolf and new count of Holstein. Their main motivation was to prevent the separation of the two provinces. On 5 March, Christian granted a coronation charter (or Freiheitsbrief) which repeated that Schleswig and Holstein must remain united dat se bliven ewich tosamende ungedelt. By this action, Christian managed to gain control of the county of Holstein-Rendsburg within the Empire, but the price was a permanent link between two provinces, one Danish and one of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1474 Emperor Frederick III elevated Christian as Count of Holstein-Rendsburg to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial vassal (see imperial immediacy). The smaller Holstein-Pinneberg remained a county further ruled by the House of Schauenburg until seized by the duchy in 1640. 19th century nationalism and the Treaty of Ribe The proclamation later played an important role in the nineteenth century during the nationalist awakening in both the German Confederation and Denmark. German nationalists, seeking the Unification of Germany, cited the Treaty of Ribe and wished to integrate the ethnically mixed Schleswig as well as the all-German Holstein, which until 1806 had been part of the Holy Roman Empire and then was part of the German Confederation, into a new German Empire. Danes refused to abandon Schleswig and sought to integrate the duchy into the Danish kingdom. The status of Holstein as part of the confederacy, on the other hand, was not questioned. This dispute culminated in two wars, the First War of Schleswig in 1848‚Äì1851 and the Second War of Schleswig in 1864.

Prior to 2015, there were 19 chairlifts, of skiable terrain and an average of of snow each winter, making Canyons the largest ski and snowboard resort in Utah. The base area is located 32 miles (51 km) from the Salt Lake City International Airport, accessed via Interstate 80, and is four miles (7 km) from Main Street in Park City, along State Route 224. In the summer of 2010, Canyons was significantly upgraded by Talisker Corporation in order to compete with the other nearby resorts. In 2013, Talisker and Vail Resorts signed a 50-year lease for Vail to run the resort operations. One year later, Vail Resorts purchased neighboring Park City Mountain Resort and merged the two resorts via an interconnect gondola, re-branding as Park City at that time. The former Canyons base area was then renamed as Canyons Village at Park City. The resort has also been used as a major concert venue hosting artists such as Heart, Meat Loaf, Barry Manilow, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cheap Trick, Sheryl Crow, Bon Jovi, Sting, The B-52's and The Beach Boys. Ski Beach with Orange Bubble in the background History The Canyons opened as Park City West in 1968, a sister resort to the nearby Park City Mountain Resort which opened five years earlier. It was renamed ParkWest in 1975 after a change in ownership, and the name was changed again in 1995 to Wolf Mountain (not to be confused with the small ski area of the same name near Ogden, Utah) for two seasons, then became The Canyons in 1997, after the acquisition by American Skiing Company. In 2007, American Skiing Company sold all of its assets and dissolved as an active corporation. The Canyons sale to Talisker Corporation was finalized in 2008. In 2010, Talisker finished significant upgrades to the resort and officially changed the name to Canyons Resort. The upgrades included relocating the base terminal of Red Pine Gondola to a new gathering area called Ski Beach, installing two high speed quads (including Orange Bubble Express, the first chairlift in North America with heated seats), opening Iron Mountain and of new terrain, and many new dining and retail outlets. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Vail Resorts would operate Canyons under a 50-year lease, with six 50-year renewal options. =Canyons under Vail Resorts= Vail Resort announced a plan to combine Canyons Resort with Park City Mountain Resort through an interconnect gondola between Iron Mountain at Canyons and the Silverlode lift at PCMR in 2015. The combined areas are operating as Park City Mountain Resort, but the former Canyons base area has been renamed Canyons Village at Park City. In addition, Vail has improved snowmaking and the mid-mountain chalet, Red Pine Lodge. In 2018, High Meadow, a fixed grip quad servicing a learning area at Red Pine Lodge, was replaced with a high speed quad constructed by Doppelmayr. In 2019, an egress fixed grip quad known as Over and Out was installed to provide a direct return route from Tombstone and Iron Mountain back to the Canyons Village base area. Resort description Prior to its merger with Park City Mountain, Canyons Resort covered nine mountain peaks with maximum elevation of on Peak9990. The terrain had 182 trails, five bowls, six natural halfpipes, and three terrain parks. Side-mountain and backcountry skiing on the surrounding National Forest land could be accessed through gates found on some of the peaks. In 2010, Canyons began hosting part of the Sprint Grand Prix of Skicross and Snowboardcross, which lasted several consecutive years. In the summer, Canyons Resort had an extensive trail and lift system open for mountain biking or hiking. The resort also operated two zip lines and a miniature golf course. As with most four-season resorts, Canyons Resort had dining, shopping, and lodging options. The village also hosts concerts throughout the year at its outdoor amphitheater.

For this reason, she is called the \\"Mother of Miami.\\" She is the only woman to found a major American city. History Julia Sturtevant was the daughter of Ephraim Sturtevant, a Florida planter and state senator. She married Frederick Leonard Tuttle on January 22, 1867. They had two children: a daughter, Frances Emeline (b. 1868), and a son, Henry Ethelbert (b. 1870). Julia Tuttle first visited the Biscayne Bay region of southern Florida in 1875 with her husband, visiting a 40-acre (16 ha) orange grove her father had purchased. She loved the experience, but returned to Cleveland, Ohio, with her family. Moving to southern Florida Tuttle came to Fort Dallas, Florida, from Cleveland, Ohio, on a steamship after her father and mother had moved to South Florida. A little over ten years later, in 1886, her husband died; the foundry had already been sold. Upon his death, she found that her husband had not been good at managing money. This placed Julia in dire financial straits. To supplement her small income, she had to turn their four-story home into a boarding house and tearoom for young ladies. In 1890, when her father died and left her his land in Florida, she sold her home in Cleveland, Ohio and relocated to Biscayne Bay. Tuttle used the money from her parents' estate to purchase the James Egan grant of , where the city of Miami is now located, on the north side of the river, including the old Fort Dallas stone buildings, and the two-story rock house built by Richard Fitzpatrick's slaves some 50 years earlier. This was converted into her home. In 1891, Tuttle brought her family to live there. She repaired and converted the home into one of the show places in the area with a sweeping view of the river and Biscayne Bay.Andrew K. Frank. Before the Pioneers: Indians, Settlers, Slaves, and the Founding of Miami (University Press of Florida, 2017) Tuttle immediately decided to take a leading role in the movement to start a new city on the Miami River, but knew that decent transportation (in that time, a railroad) was necessary to attract development. Tuttle tried to induce Henry Flagler to extend his railroad to Fort Dallas (Miami), and offered to divide her large real estate holdings if he would do this. She wanted to extend it to that place because she wanted to make it easier to get around. She wrote numerous letters to Flagler in this connection and finally made the trip to St. Augustine and in person repeated her offer. Her efforts were of no avail at that time; however, providence favored Tuttle. The Great Freeze of 1894-1895 devastated the old orange belt of central and northern Florida, destroying valuable groves and wiping out fortunes overnight. Either Flagler then recalled Tuttle's story of the tropical Biscayne Bay weather and sent some men to investigate, or Tuttle alerted Flagler that the freeze had spared the Miami River, sending as evidence a bouquet of flowers and foliage (possibly oranges) to Flagler, whose order to extend the Florida East Coast Railway was then given. On February 15, 1896, Joseph B. Reilly, John Sewell, and E.G. Sewell, the vanguard of the Flagler forces, arrived, and the work of building the Royal Palm Hotel was commenced. Under an agreement between the two, Tuttle supplied Flagler with the land for a hotel and a railroad station for free, and they split the remainder of her 640 acres (2.6 km¬≤) north of the Miami River in alternating sections. On April 22, 1896, train service of the Florida East Coast Railway came to the area. On July 28, male residents voted to incorporate a new city, Miami. Thereafter, the city steadily grew from a small town to a metropolis. Death and legacy In 1898, Tuttle fell ill with apparent meningitis. Plans were made to move her to Asheville, North Carolina, by rail for treatment, but her condition deteriorated before she could be transported. She died on September 14, 1898, at age 49. Her funeral took place at her Fort Dallas home, and she was buried in a place of honor at the City of Miami Cemetery. Tuttle died leaving a large amount of debt, partly the result of her altruistic land grants to Flagler. Her children sold her remaining land to pay off the debt. For that reason, her name was mostly forgotten until it was placed on a causeway for Interstate 195 over Biscayne Bay. In contrast, the name of William Brickell, a large landowner on the south side of the Miami River who contributed to Tuttle's efforts to incorporate the city, was widely used on the south side of what became Miami. Just as Tuttle is called the Mother of Miami, Flagler became known as the Father of Miami. Coincidentally, both Tuttle and Flagler had previously lived in Cleveland, where they first met. In addition to the Julia Tuttle Causeway, the memory of Tuttle has been honored with a sculpture in Bayfront Park, by Daub and Firmin.

Little interested in religion in his youth, he became a committed Christian at the age of 21, while serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He was ordained as a priest in 1949, and spent three years as a curate and five years as a vicar in and around Oxford where he had studied for the priesthood. He was vice principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford from 1957 to 1960, the founding head of Rochester Theological College from 1960 to 1966, Bishop of Liverpool from 1966 to 1975, and Archbishop of York from 1975 to 1983. Blanch was evangelical in outlook, but gained the trust of high church Anglicans, and also of Roman Catholics and nonconformists. He was well known as a lecturer and published ten books, most of them scholarly and theological. Life and career =Early years= Blanch was born at Viney Hill Farm, Blakeney, Gloucestershire in the Forest of Dean, the youngest of three sons of a farmer, William Edwin Blanch, and his wife, Elizabeth, n√©e Yarworth.Williams, R H L. \\"Blanch, Stuart Yarworth, Baron Blanch (1918‚Äì1994)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 May 2012 William Blanch was killed in a shooting accident in 1923 and his widow and youngest child moved to London, where the two older sons were already living.Christmas, Linda. \\"Stuart Yarworth Blanch, 55, Archbishop of York\\", The Guardian, 15 December 1977, p. 11 Blanch attended Alleyn's School, Dulwich, winning a scholarship after the first year. His mother could not afford to pay for him to go to a university, and after leaving school at the age of 18 he started work. He would have preferred to become a journalist, but found that \\"journalism in particular was hard to get into without contacts.\\" He gained employment in the office of the Law Fire Insurance Society Ltd in Chancery Lane at a salary of ¬£90 a year. He said later, \\"The job taught me a great deal, not just about administration ‚Äì how to write letters and so on ‚Äì but how to deal with people from all walks of life.\\" On the outbreak of the Second World War Blanch enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He was on guard duty at Christmas at the RAF depot in Heaton Park (not, he later said, \\"a prospect to quicken the pulse or engender much seasonal cheer\\"),\\"The Right Rev Lord Blanch ‚Äì Obituary\\", The Times, 4 June 1994, p. 19 and for lack of anything else to read he read the New Testament thoroughly for the first time in his life, and his hitherto mild adherence to Christianity was turned into firm evangelical faith. \\"This strange book spoke, its words glowed on the page, and I knew that from that moment my life was bound up for better or worse with the Man who is described there.\\"Blanch, quoted in the Times obituary. In the RAF he served as a corporal in the force's police, and then volunteered for aircrew duties. After training as a navigator, he was commissioned as a flight lieutenant. He flew reconnaissance missions over Burma from Calcutta. During this period he became an Anglican lay reader and sought ordination as a priest. In 1943 he married Brenda Gertrude Coyte. His biographer R H L Williams writes, \\"Their years of wartime separation were bridged by a remarkable correspondence in which they explored their faith together.\\" =Priest= On demobilisation Blanch was accepted for ordination training at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. His ability impressed the principal, Canon J P Thornton-Duesbery, who arranged for him to be matriculated at St Catherine's Society. He obtained a first class degree in theology in 1948, and was ordained priest in 1949.\\"Blanch, Baron\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008, online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 17 May 2012 After three years as a curate in the Oxford parish of Highfield, he was appointed vicar of Eynsham a few miles out of the city. He remained there for five years, building up a small congregation into a large one, described by The Times as \\"thoroughly committed to Christian outreach.\\" He formed close ties with the local Roman Catholic, Baptist, and Methodist churches. This was Blanch's only experience as a parish priest.Say, David. \\"Obituary: The Right Rev Lord Blanch\\", The Independent, 7 June 1994 While he was at Eynsham three of the Blanches' five children were born, all daughters. He was a part-time lecturer during this period, and his lectures on the New Testament led to an invitation to return to Wycliffe Hall as tutor and vice-principal to F J Taylor, who had succeeded Thornton-Duesbery as principal. Blanch took up the appointment in 1957 The chairman of the governing body of Wycliffe Hall was the Bishop of Rochester, Christopher Chavasse. Nearing the end of his twenty-year reign at Rochester, Chavasse wished it to culminate in the foundation of an evangelical theological college for mature students. He persuaded Blanch to become the founding head of the college and Oriel canon of Rochester Cathedral. Blanch was Warden of Rochester Theological College from 1960 to 1966. The Independent's obituary of Blanch said of this period: During this period, the Blanches had a son and a daughter. =Bishop= Liverpool Cathedral In 1966, the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, invited Blanch to succeed Clifford Martin as Bishop of Liverpool. On opening Wilson's letter Blanch is said to have taken it for a prank by Rochester students. He was not altogether pleased by the offer. Because he had acquired his faith not from churchgoing but from his private reading of the New Testament, he was, in the words of The Independent, \\"uncoloured and uninfluenced by anything ecclesiastical and failed to see the relevance of much of it.\\" The prospect of exchanging academic life for the complexities of a bishop's duties was daunting. The Times later said, \\"He was at that time a bad chairman of committees and councils (he got better at it) and he knew there would be plenty of both. He did not know Lancashire. But he knew his duty and off he went to Merseyside.\\" Aged 47 he was the youngest Anglican bishop of his day.Hickman, Baden. \\"Low pressure: Baden Hickman on the new Archbishop of York\\", The Guardian, 14 September 1974, p. 13 In the 1960s Liverpool underwent large-scale rehousing, with residents of inner city slums being moved to new housing estates on greenfield sites outside the city. Blanch supervised the resulting reorganisation of parishes and construction of new churches. The diocese was predominantly evangelical, but there was a substantial high church minority whose relations with some previous Bishops of Liverpool had been difficult. The Guardian said that one of Blanch's greatest achievements during his years in Liverpool (and later at York) was reconciling evangelical and high church Anglicans: \\"it was universally acknowledged that he left behind him a peaceful and reconciled diocese.\\"Hickman, Baden. \\"Flat cap beneath the mitre\\", The Guardian, 4 June 1994, p. 32 The Times comments that Blanch and his wife \\"threw themselves into the richness of Liverpool life. He grew to love Scouse humour and resilience. He bicycled to work ‚Ä¶ he played squash most Saturday mornings ‚Ä¶ whenever he could, he went to listen to the Philharmonic concerts (Sir Charles Groves, the then conductor, becoming a firm friend).\\" As he had done as a parish priest at Eynsham, Blanch reached out to other Christian denominations. He established friendships and close working relationships with George Beck and Rex Kissack, respectively the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool and the chairman of the Liverpool Methodist District. They helped to end Liverpool's history of sectarian hostility, and fostered ecumenism in what became known as the \\"Mersey miracle\\", built upon by their successors. While Bishop of Liverpool, Blanch had numerous invitations to give lectures, as far afield as Alabama and Bermuda. The first of his ten books, The World our Orphanage (1972) was based on a series of lectures he gave in York. =Archbishop= Interior of York Minster In 1974 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey announced his forthcoming retirement. His successor was the Archbishop of York, Donald Coggan, an evangelical. In view of the church's tradition of balance it was widely expected that Coggan's successor at York would be a higher churchman. The two candidates most tipped were Robert Runcie (Bishop of St Albans) and Kenneth Woollcombe (Bishop of Oxford).Hickman, Baden \\"Short list ready for York post\\" The Guardian, 21 June 1974, p. 8 There was a long delay in making the appointment, and it was rumoured that at least three bishops had declined the post. The Times later named one of them as Runcie. The offer of the archbishopric to Blanch came as a surprise to him. He said that the Prime Minister's invitation \\"came in one of those plain white envelopes that you open with caution. I am only now beginning to get over the shock.\\" He told the press that he found the prospect daunting because he was at a loss with high formality, was not well up on central church administration and had not much political experience.Symon, Penny. \\"Bishop of Liverpool to become Archbishop of York\\", The Times, 14 September 1974, p. 1 Blanch was enthroned as ninety-fourth Archbishop of York on 25 February 1975. Of his years as Archbishop, Williams writes, \\"A superb pastor, he presided over a happy diocese and travelled widely in his province. ‚Ä¶ No lover of bureaucracy, he was described as the most unecclesiastical of archbishops.\\" One admirer, noting his common touch, said that he wore a flat cap underneath his mitre. In fact, as an evangelical, Blanch was not enthusiastic about vestments and seldom wore a mitre. Blanch's reputation as a theologian and lecturer continued to grow. The Guardian said of him, \\"At York, Blanch emerged as one of the most thoughtful and touching preachers ever to occupy an archiepiscopal throne.\\" Williams notes that while at York, Blanch made ten working trips abroad, carrying out engagements in fifteen countries, in Europe, Australasia, Asia and the Americas. Academically his strong point was Old Testament scholarship, and this enabled him to establish close ties with the Jewish community. In 1981 Blanch suffered a breakdown in his health. He was absent from his ecclesiastical work for only a month, but thereafter, according to The Times: He resigned in 1983, and was the first retiring Archbishop of York to be made a life peer, being created Baron Blanch of Bishopthorpe in the County of North Yorkshire on 5 September 1983. =Last years= Blanch retired to Oxfordshire, living first in Bloxham and then in Shenington. He conducted services at Shenington parish church, and continued to lecture and write. He made four more lecture trips abroad after retiring from York, and wrote two more books. Blanch died of cancer at a hospice in Banbury, Oxfordshire at the age of 76, and was buried in Shenington churchyard. He was survived by his wife, son, and three of the four daughters, the eldest predeceasing him.

Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case deciding that an individual could sue for a violation of a federal law pursuant to a statute enacted by the U.S. Congress which created a general right to access certain information.. Facts The plaintiffs were registered voters who had asked the defendant Federal Elections Commission (\\"FEC\\") to determine that an organization called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (\\"AIPAC\\") was a \\"political committee\\" subject to certain regulations and reporting requirements under the Federal Election Campaign Act, because AIPAC had crossed certain spending thresholds. The FEC determined that AIPAC had indeed crossed those thresholds, but still did not require it to make the required reports because the organization was issue-oriented, not campaign-related. The plaintiffs sought review in the District Court, which granted summary judgment for the FEC; this ruling was affirmed by a panel of the Court of Appeals, but the Court of Appeals en banc reversed. The government sought certiorari, and challenged the plaintiff's standing on the grounds that the plaintiffs had suffered no 'injury in fact'; that if the plaintiffs had any injury it was not fairly traceable to the FEC decision; and that a decision in favor of the plaintiffs would not redress their injury.

Opinion of the Court The Court, in an opinion by Justice Breyer, held that Congress has, by statute, allowed \\"any party aggrieved by an order of the Commission\\" to file a suit, which is a broad grant; not getting the requested information is an \\"injury in fact\\" just like the denial of any other information which is statutorily required to be provided to citizens by the government. The grievance is a \\"generalized grievance,\\" but the harm is concrete enough to overcome this, and the harm is fairly traceable to the FEC ‚Äì even though the FEC may find other grounds not to make AIPAC provide the info.Akins, 524 U.S. at 24 (\\"[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found 'injury in fact.'\\"). The Court distinguished this case from lawsuits where an individual seeks relief based on mere taxpayer standing - an insufficient ground for standing to sue. It instead employed a \\"zone of interests test,\\" asking whether the injury asserted fell into the zone of interests protected by the statute. The case was remanded to the FEC to review its definition of 'members.' The Court noted that the FEC was producing new guidelines regarding this issue, which would address it and not require a new legal precedent. The plaintiffs were bitterly disappointed by the decision not to intervene, as the effort to have AIPAC legally declared a political action committee was a higher priority than the (successful) effort to show standing to have filed this lawsuit in the first place. While they repeatedly attempted filings to have the case re-opened, these were entirely rejected, and in 2010 a Federal court in D.C. ruled that the lawsuit had no merit as electoral law and it was officially and finally dismissed. Dissent Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion asserting that the fact the statute differentiated between 'any person' (in defining the class of persons who could file a complaint with the FEC over a violation) and 'any party aggrieved' (in defining the class of persons who could bring suit in federal court over the FEC's decision on the complaint) demonstrated the limiting force of the latter provisionanyone could file a complaint with the FEC if they believed a violation had occurred, but only parties who had actually been aggrieved (suffered a particularized injury) as a result of the FEC's decision on the complaint could sue.

She is the original Wonder Girl and later temporarily adopts another identity, Troia. Created by Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani, she first appeared in The Brave and the Bold vol. 1 #60 (July 1965). Donna has been commonly featured in stories involving the Teen Titans, which she originally joined during their second adventure and is since depicted as a founding member of the team. Donna has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. She makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans, played by Conor Leslie. Fictional character biography =Introduction= Wonder Girl's original costume was patterned after Wonder Woman's, as shown in her first appearance from The Brave and the Bold vol. 1 #60 (July 1965). Art by Bruno Premiani. Wonder Girl adopts her classic red costume‚Äîand the secret identity Donna Troy‚Äîin Teen Titans vol. 1 #22 (July‚ÄìAug. 1969). Art by Nick Cardy. After the shake-up in comics that resulted from the publication of Seduction of the Innocent, DC Comics searched for a way to portray Wonder Woman that would be acceptable to parents. One of the more favored approaches was to publish a series of \\"Impossible Tales\\" in which Wonder Woman (Diana) appeared for various reasons side-by-side with younger versions of herself as well as her mother, creating a \\"Wonder Family\\". A teen-aged version of Wonder Woman was dubbed \\"Wonder Girl\\". By issue #123 of Wonder Woman (July 1961) the label \\"Impossible Tale\\" was not being included on many of these stories. In this particular issue the character of Wonder Girl is referred to as if she is an entity entirely different from Diana, a character unto herself. Wonder Woman's younger sister Wonder GirlWonder Girl appears in the same frame as Wonder Woman and refers to Wonder Woman's mother Queen Hippolyta as \\"Mother\\" in her first two Teen Titans appearances, The Brave and the Bold #60 and Showcase #59.The name \\"Wonder Girl\\" itself had been regularly used for a variety of flashback tales of Wonder Woman's childhood exploits. made her first appearance outside the Wonder Woman book in The Brave and the Bold #60 (July 1965) as a member of a \\"junior Justice League\\" called the Teen Titans, consisting of Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West), and Aqualad (the sidekicks of Batman, The Flash, and Aquaman, respectively). After next being featured in Showcase #59 (December 1965), the Teen Titans were spun off into their own series with Teen Titans #1, cover-dated February 1966. Writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gil Kane created an origin for Wonder Girl in Teen Titans #22 (July‚ÄìAug. 1969) which introduced the character's new costume. This story established Wonder Girl's origin as an orphan rescued by Wonder Woman from an apartment building fire. Unable to find her birth family, Wonder Woman brought her to Paradise Island to be raised by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, and she eventually was given Amazon powers by Paula von Gunther's Purple Ray. In 1969, Wonder Girl dons a new, red bodysuit-style costume and‚Äîsince thus far she has been called only Wonder Girl or \\"Wonder Chick\\" by her teammates‚Äîadopts the secret identity Donna Troy. Donna remains with the Teen Titans until the series' cancellation with issue #43 in February 1973. She is still part of the team when the comic picks up again with #44 in November 1976. Teen Titans is canceled again in February 1978 with issue #53, with Donna and the others, no longer \\"teens\\", going their separate ways. =1980s revival= Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez revived the series yet again in 1980 as The New Teen Titans, with original members Wonder Girl, Robin, and Kid Flash joined by new heroes Raven, Starfire, Cyborg, and Beast Boy / Changeling. Donna is romantically involved with much older professor Terry Long, but along the way is put under the romantic spell of Hyperion, one of the Titans of Myth.The New Teen Titans vol. 1 #11 (September 1981) Donna's origin is expanded in the January 1984 tale, \\"Who is Donna Troy?\\"The New Teen Titans vol. 1 #38 (January 1984) Robin investigates the events surrounding the long ago fire after finding Donna's doll in a box from a coal bin. He learns that Donna's birth mother was Dorothy Hinckley, a dying unwed teen who had placed her for adoption. After Donna's adoptive father Carl Stacey had been killed in a work-related accident, her adoptive mother Fay Stacey was forced to place her for adoption again, unable to raise the toddler because of mounting expenses. However, Donna became victim to a child-selling racket, which ended with the racketeers' deaths in a furnace explosion and the fire. With Robin's help, Donna is reunited with Fay, who had married Hank Evans and given birth to two additional children, Cindy and Jerry. Donna marries Terry Long in a huge, lavish ceremony in Tales of the Teen Titans #50 (February 1985). =Post-Crisis= The subsequent Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries (1985‚Äì1986) rewrote the history of many DC Comics characters; Wonder Woman's own pre-Crisis history was written out of existence, and the character was reintroduced in Wonder Woman vol. 2 #1 (February 1987) as a new arrival from Themyscira (the former Paradise Island). With the character of Donna tied predominantly to the Titans, her origin was retconned to fit into the new continuity created by Wonder Woman's relaunch, one severing her direct ties to the Amazons. In the storyline \\"Who Is Wonder Girl?\\" featured in The New Titans #50‚Äì54 (December 1988‚ÄìMarch 1989), the Titans of Myth enlist Donna's aid against the murderous Sparta of Synriannaq. It is revealed that the Titan Rhea had rescued a young Donna from a fire; Donna and Sparta had then been part of a group of 12 orphans from around the universe who had been raised on New Cronus by these Titans as \\"Titan Seeds\\", their eventual saviors. The Seeds had been given superhuman powers, and named after ancient Greek cities. Called \\"Troy\\", Donna (like the others) had eventually been stripped of her memories of her time with the Titans of Myth, and reintroduced into humankind to await her destiny; Sparta had retained her memories, and the knowledge had eventually driven her mad. Killing her fellow Seeds to \\"collect\\" their powers and destroy the Titans of Myth, Sparta is ultimately defeated by Donna and the only other Seed left alive, Athyns of Karakkan. In The New Titans #55 (June 1989), Donna changes her identity from Wonder Girl to Troia and adopts a new hairstyle and costume incorporating mystical gifts from the Titans of Myth. =Lord Chaos= During the \\"Titans Hunt\\" storyline, Donna discovers she is pregnant; in the New Titans Annual #7 (1991), a group calling themselves the Team Titans appears, intent on killing her. They come from a future in which Donna's son is born with the full powers of a god and full awareness of them, which drives him mad. He instantly ages himself, kills his mother, and becomes a dictator known as Lord Chaos. The Team Titans travel back to the past to kill Donna before her son can be born. Donna eventually gives birth to Robert; to prevent him from becoming Lord Chaos, she sacrifices her powers and becomes a normal human.New Titans #89‚Äì92 (August‚ÄìNovember 1992). DC Comics. Eventually, Donna rethinks her decision and asks the Titans of Myth to grant her powers again; her request is rejected. She then joins the Darkstars. During the Zero Hour crisis, her farm in New Jersey is destroyed and all the Team Titans are wiped out of existence except for Terra and Mirage. Her marriage in ruins, Donna loses custody of her son to her now ex-husband Terry.New Titans Annual#11 (1995).DC Comics. Donna rejoins the New Titans for a time, with her Darkstar suit giving her the ability to aid them. She dates Kyle Rayner for a while and retires from the Darkstars, leaving her powerless. Donna and Kyle break up immediately following the death of her son, stepdaughter and ex-husband in a car accident.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #121. DC Comics. =Magical duplicate= Her post-Crisis origin was updated in the late 1990s. This version had it that she was originally created by the Amazon sorceress Magala as a magical duplicate of the young Princess Diana of Themyscira (a nod to the original Wonder Girl) to be a playmate for Diana, who was previously the only child on the island. However, Donna was soon kidnapped by the Dark Angel (a World War II villainess and sworn enemy of Queen Hippolyta, Diana's mother), who thought the girl was Diana.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #131‚Äì135 Dark Angel cursed Donna to live endless variants of a life characterized by suffering, with her life being restarted and erased from the world's memory when Donna was at her lowest. Even Donna would forget her past lives until the moment at which Dark Angel would arrive to restart her life, at which point she would immediately recall all of her past suffering. With the help of Wonder Woman, Hippolyta, and the third Flash (her former Titans teammate, Wally West), the only people who remembered the previous version, Donna was restored. Somehow, she also regained her powers, presumably because that was how Wally remembered her. Initially, she was concerned that she was not the \\"same\\" Donna, but an idealized form based on Wally's memories. She has since accepted that this is not the case.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #136 Shortly afterwards, the Titans gathered together to save their friend Cyborg. They came into conflict with the JLA, but they saved their friend. During this incident Donna was seemingly reunited with her son via virtual reality, but with the aid of Nightwing, realized it was not real.JLA/Titans #1‚Äì3 After that, the original five Teen Titans, including Troia, decided to reform the team.Titans vol. 1 #1 A subsequent battle with Dark Angel suggested her constant rewriting of Donna's history involved Hypertime.Titans vol. 1 #23‚Äì25 It is not clear how this ties in with later revelations. Realizing that Donna was created from a portion of Diana's soul, Queen Hippolyta accepted Donna as a blood-related daughter and held a coronation on Themyscira to formally introduce Donna as the second princess of Paradise Island.Wonder Woman Secret Files #3 This aspect brought Donna more in-line with her Pre-Crisis Themyscirian origins. After her coronation, Donna and Diana's bond as sisters grew stronger. The two Amazons shared a high end apartment in New York CityWonder Woman vol. 2 #170 and Donna became more active in life on Themyscira. While the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall saw Diana as an official moderator between the Themyscirian Amazons and themselves, Donna made strides in becoming an accepted member of both tribes in their eyes.Wonder Woman Secret Files #3 and Wonder Woman vol. 2 #168‚Äì169 While aiding the Amazons, Donna also came into contact with the villain Angle Man who immediately became enamored with her. After their awkward yet flirtatious first meeting, a seriously wounded Angle Man later teleported himself to Donna seeking her help after being attacked by The Cheetah.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #180‚Äì187 In a separate battle, Donna was apparently killed by a rogue Superman robot in the Titans/Young Justice crossover \\"Graduation Day\\", but was later shown to be alive on another world. The Return of Donna Troy, a four-issue miniseries written by Phil Jimenez with art by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez and George P√©rez, expanded upon the resurrection of Donna Troy and cleared up her multiple origins. =DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy= Donna Troy has now discovered that like every other person after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, she is a merger of every alternate version of Donna Troy in the Multiverse. Unlike everyone else, Donna is the repository of knowledge of every alternate universe version of herself and remembers the original Multiverse. She learned that her counterpart on Earth-Two was saved by a firefighter and was raised in an orphanage, while her Earth-S counterpart died in the fire. She also discovered that her sworn enemy of the past, Dark Angel, was in fact the Donna Troy of Earth-Seven, saved from certain death by the Anti-Monitor, just like the Monitor had saved Harbinger.Phil Jimenez, the writer of The Return of Donna Troy, stated in direct mail conversation in January 2007, \\"While there was some discussion about making Lyla an alternate Donna, DC Editorial and I realized this would never work in any continuity, so the idea was scrapped. What we did decide, however, was that Dark Angel was the Anti-Monitor's Harbinger, and that Dark Angel herself was an alternate Earth duplicate of Donna Troy.\\" When the Multiverse was reconfigured in one single Universe, Dark Angel, who had somehow escaped the compression of every Donna Troy into one single person in the new Earth, sought to kill her (every life she forced her to relive was in fact an aspect of an alternate Donna as a way to avoid the merging and remain the last one standing). When she was defeated, Donna became the real sum of every Donna Troy that existed on every Earth, a living key to the lost Multiverse. Her role in Infinite Crisis is, at the end of The Return of Donna Troy, fully stated: Donna had been reborn after her death at the hands of the Superman android. The Titans of Myth, realizing that she was the child who was destined to save them from some impending threat, brought her to New Cronus and implanted false memories within her mind to make her believe she was the original Goddess of the Moon and wife of Coeus. The Titans of Myth incited war between other worlds near New Cronus in order to gain new worshipers. They would then use the combined power of their collective faith to open a passageway into another reality, where they would be safe from destruction. Donna was another means to that end until she was found by the Titans and the Outsiders, who restored her true memories. This was not without casualties, however. Sparta (who was restored to full mental health and stripped of the bulk of her power) had been made an officer in the Titans of Myth's royal military. She was sacrificed by the Titans of Myth in an attempt to lay siege to the planet Minosyss, which housed a Sun-Eater factory miles beneath its surface. Sparta's death had inadvertently helped trigger Donna's memory restoration. Athyns had also reappeared by this time and aided the heroes and the Mynossian resistance in battling the Titans of Myth. It was then that Hyperion, the Titan of the Sun, revealed Donna's true origins to her and ordered her to open a passageway into another reality by means of a dimensional nexus that once served as a gateway to the Multiverse itself, within the Sun-Eater factory's core. This turned out to be the Titans of Myth's real target. Donna did so, but, fearing that they would simply continue with their power-mad ambitions, she banished most of them into Tartarus. However, Hyperion and his wife, Thia, were warned of the deception at the last moment. Enraged, they turned on Donna, intending to kill her for the betrayal, but Coeus activated the Sun-Eater to save her and Arsenal. As the Sun-Eater began absorbing their vast solar energies, Hyperion and Thia tried to escape through the Nexus, but they were both torn apart by the combined forces of the Nexus' dimensional pull and the Sun-Eater's power. Coeus, who had learned humility and compassion from Donna, vowed to guard the gateway to make certain the other Titans of Myth remained imprisoned forever.DC Special The Return of Donna Troy #1‚Äì4 (June 2005‚ÄìAugust 2005) =Infinite Crisis and 52= Donna returns to the now-barren New Cronus where she shares a joyful reunion with Wonder Woman. Donna, charged with the guardianship of the Universe Orb containing the Multiverse Chronicles collected by Harbinger, makes the startling discovery that an impending doom is facing the DC Universe, a doom she cannot avert alone. Leaving Nightwing behind on Earth, Donna brings several heroes to New Cronus, including Animal Man; Cyborg; Firestorm; Herald; Bumblebee; Red Tornado; Shift; Green Lanterns Alan Scott, Kyle Rayner, and Kilowog; Jade; Starfire; Supergirl and Captain Marvel Junior (in Outsiders 30). The heroes confront a mysterious and menacing rip in space caused by Alexander Luthor, Jr. (as a part of his plan), which has sparked an intergalactic war. Donna's team contributes to the resolution of the conflict, but things take a dangerous turn when Alexander uses the inter-dimensional tear to recreate Earth-Two and, later, the Multiverse. Donna, along with Kyle Rayner (now called Ion), leads the team to attack Alexander Luthor through his space rift, giving Nightwing, Superboy, and Wonder Girl the time needed to destroy Alexander's device, and save the two Supermen and Wonder Woman from being merged with their Earth-Three counterparts. Though most of the team vanishes when they attempt to leave via the portal opened by Mal Duncan and Adam Strange, she returns to Earth shortly after the Battle of Metropolis, and provides a \\"junior red-sun eater\\" to the Green Lantern Corps in which to imprison Superboy-Prime at the end of the battle on Mogo. In the series 52, Cyborg, Herald, Alan Scott, Bumblebee, Hawkgirl, and Firestorm were all returned to Earth although gravely injured, while other heroes such as Supergirl, Starfire, Animal Man, and Adam Strange were lost in space. In the History of the DC Universe backup feature, when Donna and the artificial intelligence in charge of Harbinger's historical records finished her task of reviewing the DC Universe's history, both the artificial intelligence and one of the new Monitors revealed to her that the current timeline has diverged from its rightful path, in which Donna herself, instead of Jade, should have sacrificed herself for Kyle Rayner. During the World War III storyline, Donna goes into battle as Wonder Woman against a rampaging Black Adam. =\\"One Year Later\\"= During the \\"One Year Later\\" storyline event, Donna Troy has assumed the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana stepped down following the Crisis, feeling the need to 'find out who Diana is'.Wonder Woman vol. 3 #1 Donna wears a set of armor during her tenure as Wonder Woman, which includes the bracelet and star-field material used as part of her Titans regalia. Donna's post- Infinite Crisis origin, which incorporates elements from her previous origins, is as follows: Donna was a magical twin of Diana created by the Amazon Magala and intended as a playmate for the lonely princess. Donna was later captured by Hippolyta's enemy‚ÄîDark Angel who mistook her for Diana and placed her in suspended animation for several years. Years later, the grown up Diana, now Wonder Woman, eventually freed Donna and returned her to Themyscira. Donna was then trained by both the Amazons and the Titans of Myth. A few years later, Donna followed Diana into Man's World and became Wonder Girl, wearing a costume based on Wonder Woman's and helped form the Teen Titans.Wonder Woman Annual vol. 3 #1 In her last adventure as Wonder Woman, Donna battles The Cheetah, Giganta, and Doctor Psycho. The trio attacks Donna as a means of finding the then-missing Diana. This eventually happens with the revelation that Circe is the mastermind behind the attacks and capture. After Donna is freed from Circe, she dons her old red Wonder Girl jumpsuit and aids her sister in battle telling Diana that she wants to give the Wonder Woman title back to her as she was never really comfortable using that name and would rather just be called Donna Troy. Donna later works alongside ex-boyfriend Kyle Rayner, who has taken up the powers and title of Ion again. They go up against one of the Monitors who attempts to remove them from the newly rebuilt Multiverse, claiming the two are unwanted anomalies. Donna returns to Earth with Ion in time for him to say goodbye to his dying mother. After that event, Donna joins several former Teen Titans in the current team's battle against Deathstroke and his Titans East team. =Countdown to Final Crisis= Donna attends Duela Dent's funeral with the Teen Titans.

Donna does not initially appear in this continuity at all; the Teen Titans are first established in the present day, with Cassie Sandsmark as Wonder Girl, and Wonder Woman's new origin presents her as the natural-born daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. Donna is reintroduced in the pages of Wonder Woman as an Amazon created by a sorcerer, Derinoe, as an attempt to usurp Diana's place as queen, replacing her with a new ruler. Diana defeats Donna and Donna sets about a period of soul-searching. Meanwhile, in the Titans Hunt storyline which seeks to retroactively reestablish the history of the Teen Titans in the New 52, Donna is shown as having been a Teen Titan, working alongside Titans co-founders such as Dick Grayson and Garth, until an encounter with the telepathic supervillain Mister Twister resulted in the Titans' memories being erased.Titans Hunt #6 In the Wonder Woman series, Donna struggles with her rage and anger and after being killed in a battle is chosen by Zeus to replace the Fates, making Donna a new embodiment of Fate.Wonder Woman #46 (2016)Wonder Woman #50 (2016) In the last issue of Titans Hunt, Donna confirms that she is \\"the Fate of the Gods\\", but does not reconcile her history depicted in Titans Hunt with her creation depicted in Wonder Woman.Titans Hunt #8 Titans Hunt led into the DC Rebirth initiative, which brought back more popular elements of past continuity after former Titan Wally West returns to the DC Universe and reunites his friends.

On touching Wally in Titans Rebirth #1, Donna has her childhood memories of Wally restored.Titans Rebirth #1 (2016) Later, the Titans Annual #1 (May 2017) reconciles the two accounts of Donna's history ‚Äî recent magical creation or longtime ally of Wonder Woman ‚Äî revealing that Donna was, as in the New 52 story, created out of clay to destroy Wonder Woman, but the Amazons later gave her false memories of being an orphan rescued by Wonder Woman. This allowed Donna to be more than a living weapon, and to establish a stable life. Though Donna was heartbroken by the revelation, she was supported by her Titans colleagues, who affirmed their friendship.Titans Annual #1 (May 2017) Donna remains a main character in the ‚Äò‚ÄòTitans‚Äô‚Äô series at DC after the team was broken up by the Justice League and reformed by Nightwing with supervision from the League this time. After Dick Grayson was shot in the head by KGBeast, Donna becomes leader of the team while he is recovering from his injury and amnesia. Origin retcons Donna Troy is often noted for having had a number of complicated revisions to her origin. Writer Marv Wolfman recounted: > I wrote the original Donna Troy origin story back in the first Titans run. > She had never had one and was, in fact, not a \\"real\\" character (if you can > call any of them real). She was a computer simulation of Wonder Woman as a > girl. That story also named her Donna Troy and set up everything that > followed. Unfortunately, after Crisis on Infinite Earths and the Wonder > Woman revamp, we had to go back and redo it again as a brand new Wonder > Woman being born on Earth could not have rescued the girl from the burning > building. I wish we had been able to keep it as I think it's gone insane > now. I just wanted a simple origin story. I came up with the original, and > then [in \\"Who is Donna Troy?\\"] George [P√©rez] and I simply elaborated on > what had been done, giving her real knowledge of who she was. I would love > to say that everything after \\"Who is Donna Troy?\\" should be forgotten, but > that's not the way continuity works, sadly. Under John Byrne, Donna was retconned to be a mirror-image duplicate of Wonder Woman, created by the Amazon sorceress Magala using a spell to give life to Diana's reflections so that the young princess would have an age-appropriate friend. This duplicate is kidnapped by WWII Wonder Woman's nemesis, Dark Angel. Dark Angel forces Donna to undergo multiple \\"lives\\" that all end in tragedy and result in her resetting back to her beginning. Hippolyta and Wonder Woman attempt to rescue Donna, but Dark Angel destroys her rather than release her from her clutches. With help from Wally West, Donna is recreated as a golem, drawing from Wally's incomplete, Pollyanna-esque memories of her.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #130‚Äì138 Later, Dark Angel attempts to erase all memories of Donna from the various Hypertime realities, drawing Dark Angel into conflict with Donna, the Titans, and their alternate reality counterparts from the story Kingdom Come. During the battle, Donna is mindwiped and then reprogrammed with all of her old memories after she is made to relive her past lives.Titans V1 #23‚Äì25 After Donna Troy is killed by a fleet of Superman androids reprogrammed by Brainiac, she is resurrected by the Titans of Myth, who seek to exploit her status as an \\"anomaly\\" from the world that existed before Crisis on Infinite Earths to escape the coming cataclysm of Infinite Crisis. This story establishes Donna's status as an anomaly of the timeline, explaining that she survived the Crisis and was later subjected to multiple alternate origins as the universe tried to fit her into the new timeline created following the collapse of the Multiverse. This makes Donna in effect \\"a living key to the lost Multiverse\\". This same storyline also reveals that Dark Angel is an evil alternate universe version of Donna from Earth-Seven. Another pre-Crisis survivor, she \\"was saved by the Anti-Monitor, and raised to be his harbinger of doom, Dark Angel. But Dark Angel was uncontrollable, and vanished\\".DC Universe: The Return of Donna Troy #4 Within a short time after 2011's The New 52 reboot that followed the Flashpoint story, DC had already presented two conflicting new origins for Donna Troy in the pages of Wonder Woman and Titans Hunt. In the first case, she is introduced as a new character: magical golem, ruthless warrior, and challenger to Wonder Woman's status as leader of the Amazons. She later goes on a journey of discovery. In Titans Hunt, this same Donna, alongside other former Teen Titans, rediscovers memories of childhood heroism with the Teen Titans, which should be impossible for her. In the DC Rebirth relaunch, Donna has a fuller set of childhood memories restored to her after meeting the pre-Flashpoint Wally West. In the DC Rebirth relaunch of Wonder Woman, the storyline \\"The Lies\\" reveals that the savage depiction of Thymiscira and the Amazons in the New 52 Wonder Woman series in which Diana is made the Queen of the Amazons and the God of War and has Donna Troy reinvented as a mass-murdering villain is, in fact, an illusion by the Olympians to keep her away from the real island. A later Titans story clarified that Donna is still a magical golem created to destroy Wonder Woman, with fake memories granted by the Amazons. Powers and abilities Donna's superhuman powers have changed several times over the years, but in all of her various incarnations, they have always consisted of considerable superhuman strength, endurance, speed, and the power of flight. * In her pre-Crisis origin, Donna was granted those powers by the Amazon's Purple Ray, and these powers increased as she grew older. She also wielded a lasso of her own, but it apparently had no magical properties like Diana's Lasso of Truth, aside from being infinite in length and virtually indestructible. Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths, it was revealed that Donna's original lasso was a STAR Labs creation. * The first major redefinition of Donna's powers came about when she took the name of Troia. She still possessed all the abilities she had before, but now in addition to those, she could wield photonic energy as power blasts and protective force fields, and generate light from her hands.New Titans #57 Donna has the ability to project three dimensional images of a person's memories, provided the subject is a willing participant in the process.New Titans #59 Donna's Troia costume was made of various gifts given to her by the Titans of Myth, the most notable of which was the unique star field material that showed the exact location of New Chronus. * After Donna petitioned the Titans of Myth to depower her, she became Darkstar, gaining the standard exomantle all members wore, granting her superhuman strength, speed, and agility. The exomantle also possessed a personal force field for protection against physical impact and energy attacks. The main weapons were twin laser units that fired energy blasts with pinpoint accuracy; however, it seems that Donna did not undergo the surgical procedure to attain the instant mastery of maser control that the other Darkstars had, and had a split-second delay in reaction time when wearing the less powerful deputy version of the exo-mantle. A powerful shoulder mounted cannon complemented the maser system of the Darkstars' exo-mantle. With the exo-mantle, one could achieve high speeds during flight, all the while protected from wind friction by the force field. * After her post-Crisis origin was created, Donna regained the powers she had lost at the Titans of Myth's behest, but now they were virtually identical to Diana's. Donna and Diana also share a psychic rapport which allows one to feel either what the other is experiencingWonder Woman vol. 2 #169 or even share dreams.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #47‚Äì48 and #176 Shortly after her resurrection as the Goddess of the Moon, during the Return of Donna Troy limited series, Donna's powers were enhanced and upgraded. She retained all of the abilities she had before, and regained her energy manipulation abilities (which, being cosmic-based, were far more powerful). She also commanded darkness and cold to great effect. Donna has not been shown using those powers since regaining her memories. Over the years, Donna has grown extremely powerful, with power and strength, almost rivaling her big sister, Diana (Wonder Woman). She is considered to be one of the strongest superheroines of the DC Universe along with Power Girl, Supergirl, Big Barda, Mary Marvel, Isis, Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman. Donna also has incredible super-speed. She is fast enough to effortlessly dodge bullets, and like Wonder Woman, she's said to be able to move at speeds far beyond the speed of sound. Donna has also been shown moving fast enough to catch up to speedsters such as Jesse Quick. And while not totally invulnerable, she has an extremely high degree of resistance to injury. Donna has been punched through several floors of reinforced steel and concrete, as well as taken on powerful beings such as Etrigan, Black Mary Marvel, Wonder Woman, Superwoman, Black Adam, and Superman. * Like all Amazons, Donna is exceptionally well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts. Her sister Diana, mother Hippolyta, General Phillipus, and Artemis seem to be her only rivals as a warrior (among the Amazons). She is also a very capable leader and strategist. * Pre-Flashpoint, Donna wielded a new lasso of her own called the Lasso of Persuasion. It glows blue, and like Wonder Woman's lasso is quite durable. It also has the ability to force anyone within its confines to do Donna's bidding if her willpower is greater than theirs.Justice League of America #44 (April 2011) * Donna has the ability to flawlessly imitate the voice of anyone she has heard.Brave and the Bold #149 *Post-DC Rebirth, Donna also wields an indestructible sword and shield. She also retains her vast superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, senses, reflexes, agility, flight, and immortality. However it was revealed by her evil future version, Troia, that Donna can feed on more power if she kills. Other versions =Earth 2= Another version of Donna exists in the New 52 on the alternate Earth-2. In Earth 2: Society, the character, Fury, reveals her name is Donna. This character is the daughter of the late Earth 2 Wonder Woman and the New God, Steppenwolf. This is the first time Fury is used as a doppelganger of Donna Troy and not just an analogue. In Earth 2: Society, Fury/Donna has adopted her mother's mantle of Wonder Woman and taken over Amazonia. She is critical in helping the team recreate Earth 2 after the fall on Telos. =DC Bombshells= In the DC Comics Bombshells universe, Donna Troy is a Nisei Japanese American teenager from Los Angeles.

During his prolific career, which began in the late 1960s when he was aged eleven, he recorded more than 75 albums and was one of the major stars of lovers rock, a subgenre of reggae. Bob Marley cited Brown as his favourite singer,Dennis Brown ReggaeTrain.com, accessed 3 December 2007. dubbing him \\"The Crown Prince of Reggae\\", and Brown would prove influential on future generations of reggae singers.Thompson (2002), p. 43.Adebayo (1999). Biography =Early life and career= Dennis Brown was born on 1 February 1957 at the Victoria Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.Reel (2000), p. 9. His father Arthur was a scriptwriter, actor, and journalist, and he grew up in a large tenement yard between North Street and King Street in Kingston with his parents, three elder brothers and a sister, although his mother died in the 1960s.Simmonds (2008), p. 416. He began his singing career at the age of nine, while still at junior school, with an end-of-term concert the first time he performed in public, although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age, and as a youngster was a keen fan of American balladeers such as Brook Benton, Sam Cooke, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin. He cited Nat King Cole as one of his greatest early influences. He regularly hung around JJ's record store on Orange Street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw Brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard. Brown's first professional appearance came at the age of eleven, when he visited \\"Tit for Tat\\" a local West Kingston Nightclub where his brother Basil was performing a comedy routine, and where he made a guest appearance with the club's resident group, the Fabulous Falcons (a group that included Cynthia Richards, David \\"Scotty\\" Scott, and Noel Brown). On the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist. When the group performed at a JLP conference at the National Arena, Brown sang two songs ‚Äì Desmond Dekker's \\"Unity\\" and Johnnie Taylor's \\"Ain't That Loving You\\" ‚Äì and after the audience showered the stage with money, he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds. Bandleader Byron Lee performed on the same bill, and was sufficiently impressed with Brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting US artists, where he was billed as the \\"Boy Wonder\\". As a young singer Brown was influenced by older contemporaries such as Delroy Wilson (whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing),Walker (2006), p. 214. Errol Dunkley, John Holt, Ken Boothe, and Bob Andy. Brown's first recording was an original song called \\"Lips of Wine\\" for producer Derrick Harriott, but when this was not released, he recorded for Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd's Studio One label, and his first session yielded the single \\"No Man is an Island\\", recorded when Brown was aged twelve and released in late 1969.Reel (2000), p. 10. The single received steadily increasing airplay for almost a year before becoming a huge hit throughout Jamaica. Brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for Dodd, amounting to around thirty songs, and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists, including providing harmonies along with Horace Andy and Larry Marshall on Alton Ellis's Sunday Coming album.Foster (1999), p. 244. Brown was advised by fellow Studio One artist Ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting, and after convincing Dodd to buy him an instrument, was taught the basics by Ellis. These Studio One recordings were collected on two albums, No Man is an Island and If I Follow my Heart (the title track penned by Alton Ellis), although Brown had left Studio One before either was released.Reel, p. 12. He went on to record for several producers including Lloyd Daley (\\"Baby Don't Do It\\" and \\"Things in Life\\"), Prince Buster (\\"One Day Soon\\" and \\"If I Had the World\\"), and Phil Pratt (\\"Black Magic Woman\\", \\"Let Love In\\", and \\"What About the Half\\"), before returning to work with Derrick Harriott, recording a string of popular singles including \\"Silhouettes\\", \\"Concentration\\", \\"He Can't Spell\\", and \\"Musical Heatwave\\", with the pick of these tracks collected on the Super Reggae and Soul Hits album in 1973.Reel, p. 13. Brown also recorded for Vincent \\"Randy\\" Chin (\\"Cheater\\"), Dennis Alcapone (\\"I Was Lonely\\"), and Herman Chin Loy (\\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Song My Mother Used to Sing\\") among others, with Brown still at school at this stage of his career.Reel, p. 17. =International success= In 1972, Brown began an association that would result in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist; He was asked by Joe Gibbs to record an album for him, and one of the tracks recorded as a result, \\"Money in my Pocket\\", was a hit with UK reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances. This original version of \\"Money in my Pocket\\" was in fact produced by Winston \\"Niney\\" Holness on behalf of Gibbs, with musical backing from the Soul Syndicate.Reel, p. 19. In the same year, Brown performed as part of a Christmas morning showcase in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, along with Delroy Wilson, Scotty, Errol Dunkley, and the Fabulous Flames, where he was billed as the \\"Boy Wonder of Jamaica\\" and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review. The song's popularity in the UK was further cemented with the release of a deejay version, \\"A-So We Stay (Money in Hand)\\", credited to Big Youth and Dennis Brown, which outsold the original single and topped the Jamaican singles chart. Brown and Holness became close, even sharing a house in Pembroke Hall. Brown followed this with another collaboration with Holness on \\"Westbound Train\\", which was the biggest Jamaican hit of summer 1973,Reel, p. 20. and Brown's star status was confirmed when he was voted Jamaica's top male vocalist in a poll by Swing magazine the same year. Brown followed this success with \\"Cassandra\\" and \\"No More Will I Roam\\", and tracks such as \\"Africa\\" and \\"Love Jah\\", displaying Brown's Rastafari beliefs, became staples on London's sound system scene. In 1973, Brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork, although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live, or had contracted tuberculosis. He was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies. Brown returned to music and toured the United Kingdom for the first time in late summer 1974 as part of a Jamaican showcase, along with Cynthia Richards, Al Brown, Sharon Forrester, and The Maytals, after which he was invited to stay on for further dates (where he was backed by The Cimarons, staying in the UK for another three months.Reel, p. 23. While in the UK, he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization, working with producer Sydney Crooks, and again backed by the Cimarons. While Brown was in the UK, Gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in Jamaica, released as The Best of Dennis Brown, and Brown's first single to get a proper UK release was issued on the Synda label ‚Äì \\"No More Will I Roam\\".Reel, p. 25. He returned to Jamaica for Christmas, but six weeks later was back in the UK, now with Holness in tow as his business manager, to negotiate a record deal with Trojan Records, the first Brown album to be released as a result being Just Dennis, although the pair would be left out of pocket after Trojan's collapse and subsequent buyout by Saga Records.Reel, p. 27. On their return to Jamaica, Brown and Holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album, including \\"So Long Rastafari\\", \\"Boasting\\", and \\"Open the Gate\\".Reel, p. 28. During 1975, Brown also recorded one-off sessions for Sonia Pottinger (\\"If You leave Me\\") and Bunny Lee (\\"So Much Pain\\", a duet with Johnny Clarke), and the first recordings began to appear on Brown's new DEB Music label.Reel, p. 30. In the wake of the Trojan collapse, Brown and Holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners Castro Brown (who ran Morpheus Records) and Larry Lawrence (Ethnic Fight) to distribute their releases in the UK.Reel, p. 31. Brown saw the UK as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the Georgian Club in Croydon to raise funds to start his new DEB Music label with Castro Brown.Reel, p. 33. In early 1976, Castro secured a deal with Radio London disc jockey Charlie Gillett for Morpheus (and hence DEB) output to be issued through the latter's Oval Records, which had a distribution deal with Virgin Records, but after a dispute over Castro's separate supply of these records to London record shops, the deal was scrapped and the early DEB releases suffered from a lack of promotion.Reel, p. 35 Later that year, Brown voiced two tracks at Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's Black Ark studio, \\"Take a Trip to Zion\\" and \\"Wolf and Leopard\\", the latter of which was a hit in Jamaica and would prove to be one of Brown's most popular songs, with a lyric criticizing those criminals who \\"rode the natty dread bandwagon\\".Reel, p. 39 Brown confirmed in an interview in Black Echoes that he had parted company with Holness, stating: \\"I was going along with one man's ideas for too long. Niney was trying to find a new beat at all times, which was disconcerting, so I hadn't been working with my true abilities. Now I know that I can produce myself.\\"Reel, p. 44. Brown began working again with Joe Gibbs, with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions, Brown would allow Gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process.Reel, p. 45 The first album from this arrangement, the 1977 release Visions of Dennis Brown, gave him his biggest success so far, blending conscious themes and love songs, and confirming Brown's transformation from child star to grown up artist.Reel, p. 55. The biblical-themed sleeve and portrait of Haile Selassie on the back complemented the roots reggae tracks on the album, including \\"Repatriation\\", \\"Jah Can Do it\\", and cover versions of Earl 16's \\"Malcolm X\\" and Clive Hunt's \\"Milk and Honey\\". The album immediately entered the Black Echoes chart and stayed there well into the following year, although it was only available in the UK as an expensive import.Reel, p. 57. Visions... was voted reggae album of the year by Melody Maker writers and was given the same award by readers of Black Echoes. A reissued \\"Wolf and Leopard\\" single, and the eventual album release of the same name also sold well in the UK, both topping the Black Echoes chart.Reel, p. 60. Brown toured the UK in Autumn 1977 with Big Youth, and described the tour: \\"It's like I was appointed to deliver certain messages and now is the time to deliver them\\".Reel, p. 66. He had also begun producing recordings by his protege, Junior Delgado. In 1978, Brown moved to live in London, and set up premises in Battersea Rise, near Clapham Junction to relaunch the DEB Music label with Castro Brown, with artists featured on the label including Junior Delgado, 15.16.17, Bob Andy, Lennox Brown, and later, Gregory Isaacs.Reel, p. 69. Brown had further success himself with a discomix of \\"How Could I Leave You\\", a version of The Sharks' rocksteady standard \\"How Could I Live\\" with accompanying toast by Prince Mohamed. In March 1978, Brown flew to Jamaica, where he was booked at the last minute to perform at the One Love Peace Concert at the National Arena, backed by Lloyd Parks' We The People Band.Reel, p. 81. Visions of Dennis Brown was given a wider distribution via a deal between Lightning Records and WEA and topped the UK reggae album chart in September 1978, this chart run lasting for five months.Reel, p. 84. In August 1978, Brown returned to the UK, bringing Junior Delgado with him, and DEB Music released a series of singles, although they sold moderately compared to the label's earlier successes, but in the same month, Brown's breakthrough single was first released. Initially released as a discomix featuring a new version of \\"Money in my Pocket\\" and the deejay version \\"Cool Runnings\\" by Price Mohamed, which became unavailable for a time after quickly selling out its first pressing, this single gave Brown his first UK Top 40 hit, reaching number 14 the following year and becoming one of the biggest international hits in Jamaica's history,Roberts (2006), p. 81.Thompson, p. 44. after crossing over first into soul clubs and then rock clubs.Reel, p. 88. This success led to Brown featuring on the cover of the NME in February 1979. Brown's next two albums were both released on DEB ‚Äì So Long Rastafari and Joseph's Coat of Many Colours, although the label was closed down in 1979, after which Brown again did the rounds of Jamaica's top producers, as well as continuing self-productions with singles such as \\"The Little Village\\" and \\"Do I Worry?\\" in 1981.Thompson, p. 45. =A&M; and the dancehall era= With continuing commercial success, Brown signed an international deal with A&M; Records in 1981, and now based permanently in the UK, his first album release for the label was the Gibbs-produced Foul Play, which while not wholly a success included the roots tracks \\"The Existence of Jah\\" and \\"The World is Troubled\\".Thompson, p. 47. This was followed in 1982 by Love Has Found its Way, a Gibbs/Brown/Willie Lindo production that blended lovers rock with a more pop sound, and again was not a great success. His final album with the label, 1983's The Prophet Rides Again, again mixed roots themes with commercial R&B; style tracks, and proved to be his swansong with the label. While his association with A&M; had taken him in a more commercial pop direction, Kingston's music scene had shifted towards the new dancehall era, and Brown enthusiastically adapted to the new sound, recording for some of the genre's major producers including Prince Jammy and Gussie Clarke. In the early 1980s he also started a new label, Yvonne's Special, dedicated to his wife.Foster, p. 246. In 1984, he collaborated with Gregory Isaacs on the album Two Bad Superstars Meet and the hit single \\"Let aaf Sum'n\\", recorded with Sly & Robbie and Jammy, which was followed by a second album featuring the two stars, Judge Not, in 1985.Thompson, p. 46. Brown released a huge amount of work through the 1980s, including the 1986 Jammy-produced album The Exit, but his biggest success of the decade came in 1989 with the Gussie Clarke-produced duet with Isaacs \\"Big All Round\\", and the album Unchallenged. He continued to record prolifically in the 1990s, notably on the Three Against War album in 1995 with Beenie Man and Triston Palma, and on albums produced by Mikey Bennett, and his profile in the United States was raised by a series of album releases on RAS Records. In the late 1990s he was managed by Tommy Cowan, who contrasted Brown to Bob Marley, who he had also managed, stating \\"Bob Marley was a serious businessman, I don't think Dennis was as serious when it came to investment. Dennis was like a community person, he would earn money and in one hour he would give it away.\\" Brown said of his approach to songwriting in the late 1990s: > \\"When I write a song I try to follow Joseph's way ‚Äì deliverance through > vision from all ‚Äì true vibration. I want to be a shepherd in my work, > teaching and learning, really singing so much. I don't want to sing and not > live it. I must live it. If I can sing songs that people can watch me > living, then they can take my work\\"Chang & Chen (1998), p. 152. Brown's 1994 album Light My Fire was nominated for a Grammy Award, as was the last album recorded by Brown, Let Me Be the One (in 2001).Moskowitz (2006), p. 43.Kenner (2001). =Death= In the late 1990s, Brown's health began to deteriorate. He had developed respiratory issues, probably exacerbated by longstanding problems with drug addiction, namely cocaine,Salewicz (1999) leading to him being taken ill in May 1999 after touring in Brazil with other reggae singers, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. After returning to Kingston, Jamaica, on the evening of 30 June 1999, he was rushed to Kingston's University Hospital, suffering from cardiac arrest.Cooksey, MusicianGuide. Brown died the next day, the official cause of his death was a collapsed lung.Greene, Allmusic.Salewicz (1999).Doran (1999). Sitting Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson and former prime minister, serving at the time as opposition leader, Edward Seaga of the Jamaica Labour Party both spoke at Brown's funeral, which was held on 17 July 1999 in Kingston. The service, which lasted for three hours, also featured live performances by Maxi Priest, Shaggy, and three of Brown's sons. Brown was then buried at Kingston's National Heroes Park.VH1 Brown was survived by his wife Yvonne and ten children. Prime Minister Patterson paid tribute to Brown, saying: \\"Over the years, Dennis Brown has distinguished himself as one of the finest and most talented musicians of our time. The Crown Prince of Reggae as he was commonly called. He has left us with a vast repertoire of songs which will continue to satisfy the hearts and minds of us all for generations to come.\\"Jamaica Gleaner, 2 July 1999. Dennis Brown's brother Trevor Clarke spoke about his brother as follows; \\"I just give Jah thanks and praise for Dennis‚Äô life and what he has contributed to the world through the root of music, regardless of the rumors out there about him, he has done a lot. He has paid his dues. You want to know the true Dennis? Listen to his lyrics. He was singing from the heart\\" (The Beat, Volume 18, #5/6). Legacy Dennis Brown was an inspiration and influence for many reggae singers from the late 1970s through to the 2000s, including Barrington Levy, Junior Reid, Frankie Paul, Luciano, Bushman, and Richie Stephens.Campbell, 2009. In July 1999, a group of UK-based musicians and more than fifty vocalists working under the collective name The British Reggae All Stars (including Mafia & Fluxy, Carlton \\"Bubblers\\" Ogilvie, Peter Hunnigale, Louisa Mark, Nerious Joseph, and Sylvia Tella) recorded \\"Tribute Song\\", a medley of six of Brown's best-known songs, in memory of Brown. He was honoured on the first anniversary of his death by a memorial concert in Brooklyn, which featured performances from Johnny Osbourne, Micky Jarrett, Delano Tucker, and Half Pint. In 2001, a charitable trust was set up in Brown's name. The Dennis Emanuel Brown Trust works to educate youngsters, maintain and advance the memory of Dennis Brown, and help to provide youngsters with musical instruments. The trust awards the Dennis Emanuel Brown (DEB) bursary for educational achievement each year to students between the ages of 10 and 12 years.Walters (2005). In 2005, George Nooks, who had worked with Brown in the mid-1970s in his deejay guise as Prince Mohamed, released an album of Brown covers, George Nooks Sings Dennis Brown: The Voice Lives On, with Nooks stating: \\"I was always inspired by his talent and I used to sing like him. Dennis had a large influence on me. To me he was the greatest. He was my number one singer.\\"Jackson (2005). In the same year, Gregory Isaacs paid a similar tribute with the album Gregory Isaacs Sings Dennis Brown. In February 2007, a series of events were staged in Jamaica in celebration of the lives of both Brown and Marley (both would have had birthdays that month).Evans (2007). In 2008, the Dennis Brown Trust announced a new internet radio station, dedicated solely to the music of Dennis Brown,Walters (2008) and in the same month a tribute concert was staged by the Jamaican Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA) featuring Dwight Pinkney, Derrick Harriott, Sugar Minott, George Nooks, and John Holt.Cooke (2008). Songs about or dedicated to Brown include \\"If This World Were Mine\\" by Slightly Stoopid, \\"Drive\\" by Pepper (band), and Whitney Houston's \\"Whitney Houston Dub Plate\\" on The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book album by Wyclef Jean. On 26 April 2010, Brown was featured on NPR Morning Edition news program as one of the \\"50 great voices ‚Äì The stories of awe-inspiring voices from around the world and across time\\". The NPR \\"50 Great Voices\\" list includes Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson and Jackie Wilson among others.Johnson, 2010. On 6 August 2011, being the 49th anniversary of the country's independence, the Governor- General of Jamaica posthumously conferred the Order of Distinction in the rank of Commander (CD) upon Brown, for his contribution to the Jamaican music industry. In April 2012, a commemorative blue plaque was placed on Brown's home in Harlesden by the Nubian Jak Community Trust.Campbell, Howard (2012), \\"D Brown's UK home gets blue plaque\\", Jamaica Observer, 25 April 2012, retrieved 29 April 2012.\\"Blue plaque erected in Harlesden in honour of reggae singer Dennis Brown\\", Brent & Kilburn Times, 10 April 2012.

Designed by Italian sculptor Pietro Canonica and built in two and a half years with financial support from the population, it was unveiled by Dr. Hakkƒ± ≈ûinasi Pasha on August 8, 1928. The high monument portrays the founders of the Turkish Republic, with prominent depictions of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º and Fevzi √áakmak. The monument has two sides: the side facing north depicts Atat√ºrk in military uniform during the Turkish War of Independence, while the side facing south (towards ƒ∞stiklal Avenue) has Atat√ºrk and his comrades dressed in modern Western clothing; the former symbolizing his role as military commander-in-chief, and the latter symbolizing his role as statesman.

During his career at Playboy, Mecey had numerous solo pictorials including; ‚ÄúThe Girls of Texas‚Äù, and \\"Women of Wall Street‚Äù. Along with David Chan, he also worked on all of the college girl pictorials produced since 1980. Mecey is credited with discovering 20 Playmate of the Month, including Brooke Berry, Suzi Schott, Suzi Simpson, and 1998 Playmate of the Year Karen McDougal. Early years Though David's formative years were all about art and music, his love for photography blossomed after college, and quite literally, by accident. After a near tragic motorcycle collision put him convalescing for nearly a year, his doctor suggested photography after admiring David's artwork. So photography became a career by beginning with what many consider a dream job. David began working for Playboy magazine in the fall of 1979, soon after becoming a staff photographer, moving to Chicago. In 1987, he would take a title change to Contributing Photographer where he would continue with Playboy until 2003. It was after this time he would begin to expand on his photography style to include fashion, beauty, and celebrity work for various editorial and advertising assignments worldwide. Mecey has also photographed such celebrities as Michael Keaton, Peter Horton, Robert Palmer, Ray Liotta, Sparky Anderson, Brooke Shields, Lynda Carter, Rachel Hunter, Carmen Electra, and Sharon Stone. Called upon to shoot Petersen Publishing‚Äôs SPORT magazine swimsuit issue for four successive years, the final year culminated with a broadcast on ESPN, ESPN-2, and Prime Ticket. Mecey served as its narrator. He also acted in a made-for-TV movie titled Posing, which aired on CBS. While working as a technical advisor on the film, Mecey was asked by the director to play a fictional Playboy photographer. From 2000‚Äì2003, David was co-host and photographer on Playboy TV's, Sexy Girls Next Door. In 2001, David founded, David Mecey's FotoFantasyCamp¬Æ, a workshop that has grown to be considered one of the premier photographic workshops in the world. Featured in American PHOTO, David brings a select number of aspiring photographers together to a fantastic location for three days of intensive training in his style of lighting, posing, rapport with models, literally everything that makes up professional-level photography. Along with his continued catalog and beauty photography, David has self-published a number of books on his work. One, shot in B&W; and titled Passion, is a collection of nudes shot over the past decade. A gallery of his work is on display at the German GQ magazine website, as well as MenSTYLE-France magazine's website, with galleries also planned for the French GQ website. In the fall of 2008 and again in 2010, Mecey was selected as guest speaker and program presenter at the international photographic trade show, Photokina, held in Cologne, Germany. Mecey has worked on other projects, such as an ad campaign for a line of cosmetics called M Professional. He works regularly on various swimsuit and lingerie catalogs, posters, and calendars. Mecey uses Apple computers when working on the digital side of photography. Personal life In addition to his passion for photography, David also has a passion for cars. For well over a decade, he has pursued road racing as a way to relax. David is currently Chief Driving Instructor for the Los Angeles Chapter of the BMW Car Club of America, has established his own driving events organization, Precision Performance Driving, and often works for various auto manufacturers as a pro driver, including Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, and Chrysler. He has competed in a number of endurance races including three 25-hr races where the team finished 3rd in class, and 2nd in class, respectively, for two successive years.

History Marston Green began as a small village surrounded by agricultural land in the estate of Coleshill at this time, the village was known as Merstone The village grew into a leafy suburb in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, due to the construction of many detached and semi-detached homes in the 1930s, which were typical of many suburban homes in the area. The growth of homes here was encouraged by the presence of a rail station. Following the expansion of the nearby Birmingham Airport, the construction of the National Exhibition Centre and the local housing estate of Chelmsley Wood, Marston Green has grown largely into a commuter village with many of its residents working in Solihull and Birmingham. There was a Canadian air force base in Marston Green during the Second World War. Afterwards, the buildings were used as a maternity hospital and then a psychiatric hospital, then were demolished in the 1990s. Famous people Professional footballer, Terry Cooke who has played for Manchester United and Manchester City was born in the village on August 5, 1976.

In the year 1919, it was re-organized as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Roots of the Chicago Butter and Egg Board are traceable to the 19th century. Initially, the Chicago Butter and Egg Board traded only two types of contracts, butter and eggs. Over several decades, it evolved into the CME which traded futures contracts and options contracts on over 50 products, from pork bellies to eurodollars and stock market indices. The butter and egg markets died out in the 1960s after the production of both commodities had become much less seasonal, which reduced both the price volatility and the need for inter-temporal signals for guiding the disposal of inventories. Background The United States was experiencing significant population growth in the late 19th century, but periods of food scarcity continued. Markets were not yet well organized, refrigeration had not been invented and production was still governed by seasonal cycles. Butter was salted and stored for later use. By 1915 the Butter and Egg Board has developed 28 rules for butter grading. Formation The Chicago Butter and Egg Board was formed in 1898 out of the Chicago Produce Exchange. time contracts were only a small part of the Board's activity and early attempts to implement margin rules were controversial. When futures trading rules were finally put in place in 1919 the Board's mandate expanded to include futures trading, eventually giving way to the CME which began trading butter and eggs on December 1, 1919.

He formerly held the record for the most stage wins in the Tour de France by a British rider, winning eight between 1967 and 1975. He holds the record (now shared with David Millar) for the most Tours completed by a British rider ‚Äì having finished 11 of the 12 he started between 1965 and 1978. He was also the first Briton to win two consecutive stages of the Tour (a feat matched by Mark Cavendish in 2008, twice in 2009 and once in 2010, and by Geraint Thomas in 2018).Barry Hoban: British Legends Cycling Weekly 15-Sep-2010 Early career Hoban started cycle racing in 1955, joining Calder Clarion, and by the end of the year was competing against Tom Simpson in individual time trials. Two years later, he was fourth in the British League of Racing Cyclists hill-climb (the senior title being won by Simpson). Despite his early prowess as a climber, Hoban later established himself as one of Europe's best sprinters. Inspired by the European successes of fellow Yorkshireman Brian Robinson and of Simpson, Hoban went to France in 1962, turned professional two years later, and stayed abroad for another 16 years. He rode for Mercier-Hutchinson-BP where his team leader was Raymond Poulidor who is famous for coming second three times in the Tour de France but never winning. Hoban was single then and used to come back to Wakefield for the winter with a case full of used shorts/jerseys etc. and sell them to the local riders (it wasn't easy then to get good quality kit and what was available was expensive). Dozens of riders in the BCF West Yorks division had a pair of shorts with Mercier Hutchinson embroidered on the legs. Back then, the best frames were hand-built British ones and Maurice Woodrup, a Leeds frame builder, would have a new frame sprayed Mercier pink waiting for him each year. He would take it back to have Mercier transfers attached. In the 1967 Tour de France, after the death of Tom Simpson, Hoban won the next stage. Two years later, in 1969, Hoban married Simpson's widow, with whom he has a daughter Daniella, and two stepdaughters Jane and Joanne.

Hoban also won two stages of the 1964 Vuelta a Espa√±a and the 1974 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, where he finished ahead of Eddy Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck. In the ‚ÄôMonument‚Äô Classics, his best performances were third places in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge (1969) and Paris‚ÄìRoubaix (1972). Towards the end of a career spent largely in mainland Europe, Hoban occasionally returned to the UK to race; he won the London-Bradford race and was second in the British professional road-race championship in 1979, and he won the Grand Prix of Manchester in 1980. At least one bicycle was made with his name on it, including Barry Hoban-badged frames made by Coventry Cycles (later trading as Coventry Eagle). This is a common practice of retired racing cyclists. Hoban lives in Mid-Wales after moving there to work with the factory that built his frames. In 2009 he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.

Once a major producer of whisky with as many as 30 distilleries, and claiming the title \\"whisky capital of the world\\", its production has markedly declined. Most of the distilleries have gone out of business and little trace of them remains. The reason for this decline was the fact that the town was \\"churning out whisky in volume ... with little concern for quality\\", according to a 2018 book that covers the entire industry and its history. By 2010 only three distilleries continue to produce whisky in Campbeltown: Springbank, Glengyle, and Glen Scotia.WHISKY DISTILLERIES IN CAMPBELTOWN The Springbank distillery produces three distinct whiskies; Springbank, Hazelburn, and Longrow. Glengyle distillery has only recently been revived by J & A Mitchell and Co Ltd., who own and operate the Springbank distillery, and its whisky is sold under the name Kilkerran to avoid confusion with the Highland blended malt named Glengyle. By 2016, Kilkerran had started bottling and selling a 12 year old spirit, to go along with their previously released No-Age-Statement offerings. Flavours A 2019 review indicated that the whisky produced here offers notes of \\"dried fruit, vanilla, toffee, and brine within a dry and pungent body\\". The Visit Scotland web site is more specific, defining Springbank malts as \\"robust and smoky with hints of their maritime roots\\", the Glen Scotia single malts as \\"lighter with grassy notes\\" and Glengyle's Kilkerran whisky as \\"lighter and sweeter, but with the distinctive oily and salty notes\\".A Comprehensive Guide to Scotland‚Äôs Whisky RegionsWHISKY DISTILLERIES IN CAMPBELTOWN Legal status Campbeltown is a \\"protected locality\\" for Scotch Whisky distilling under UK Government legislation.Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009, Section 10: Locality and region geographical indications List of Campbeltown distilleriesGlen Scotia *Glengyle *Springbank References Further reading *Stirk, David (2002).

Life and career Born in Nuremberg, Distler attended the Leipzig Conservatory from 1927 to 1931, first as a conducting student with piano as his secondary subject, but changing later, on the advice of his teacher, to composition and organ. He studied there with Martienssen (piano), G√ºnther Ramin (organ) and Grabner (harmony). He became the organist at St. Jacobi in L√ºbeck in 1931. In 1933 he married Waltraut Thienhaus. That same year he joined the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party), reluctantly, as his continued employment depended on his doing so. In October 1933 Distler was appointed head of the chamber music department at the L√ºbeck Conservatory, and at about the same time he began teaching at the Spandauer Kirchenmusikschule (Spandau school of church music).Klaus L. Neumann, \\"Hugo Distler,\\" Grove online In 1937 Distler was appointed as a lecturer at the W√ºrttemberg Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Stuttgart, where he also directed its two choirs. In 1940 he moved to Berlin to teach and conduct at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik there, and in 1942 he was named the conductor of the State and Cathedral Choir. Hugo Distler's grave near Berlin He became increasingly depressed due to the deaths of friends, aerial attacks, job pressures, and the constant threat of conscription into the German Army, causing him to commit suicide in Berlin at the age of 34.Dietrich Bonhoeffer, p. 371 However, his suicide was probably not a direct result of antagonistic government pressure; \\"rather, it appears that he saw the futility of attempting to serve both God and Nazis, and came to terms with his own conscience unequivocally.\\"Strimple, Choral Music in the Twentieth Century, p. 39 He is buried in the . Music Distler enjoyed his first success in 1935 at the official Kassel Music Days (Kasseler Musiktage). He achieved his greatest public success in 1939 at the German Choral Music Festival in Graz, when the Stuttgart Hochschule choir gave the premi√®re of sections from the M√∂rike-Chorliederbuch; the event was regarded as the climax of the festival, but the dissemination of the work took place only after the war. His M√∂rike- Chorliederbuch is now recognized as \\"the most important German secular a cappella collection of the 20th century.\\" He composed chamber pieces, works for solo piano and two concertos (one for harpsichord in 1935 and 1936 and one for piano in 1937), but he is known mostly for his sacred choral music and as a champion of Neo-Baroque music. His works are a re-invention of old forms and genres, rich with word painting, based on the music of Heinrich Sch√ºtz and other early composers. His music is polyphonic and frequently melismatic, often based on the pentatonic scale. His works remain \\"tonally anchored\\", while at the same time they \\"reveal an innovative harmonic sense\\". Because of these characteristics, his music was stigmatized by some Nazis as \\"degenerate art\\". He is now recognized as \\"one of the most significant German composers of his generation\\". He is often associated with other German neo-Baroque choral composers, including Johann Nepomuk David, Ernst Pepping and Wolfgang Fortner.Strimple, p. 36 One of Distler's most prominent students, who carried on many of his rhythmic and harmonic innovations, was Jan Bender. Distler's style was spread by choirs in Germany and abroad during the years after World War II, stimulating and influencing other later composers. The composer on a German stamp of 1992 In 1953 a choir in Berlin was named for the composer, the Hugo-Distler-Chor, an ensemble that is still active today.Hugo-Distler-Chor Berlin In 1992 a German stamp was designed honouring him. Distler's style and importance spread to the United States through the influence of organists including Larry Palmer,, who wrote the first important book on the composer in the English language, and subsequently by organist and composer Justin Rubin, who performed the entire cycle of Distler's keyboard works in New York City in 1995.

Two of the passengers were never found, and are presumed to have drowned. Accident World Airways Flight 30 was a regularly scheduled flight from Oakland to Boston via Newark. The first leg of the flight was uneventful. Flight 30 departed Newark under the command of Captain Peter Langley (58), First Officer Donald Hertzfeld (38), and Flight Engineer William Rodger (56). The DC-10 touched down beyond the displaced threshold. Under normal circumstances, such an incident would have been of minor importance and the plane would have had sufficient space to come to a full stop on the long runway. However, the runway was covered in ice, and the braking action was poor to nil (though reported to the pilots as \\"fair to poor\\"). When it became apparent that the aircraft was not going to be able to stop on the runway, and since there was insufficient space remaining on the runway to take off again (\\"touch and go\\"), the pilots steered the plane off the runway in order to avoid hitting approach lights beyond the runway.

He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he wrestled under the ring name Caylen Croft. He was one half of the DudeBusters tag team with Trent Barreta. Pavone debuted in 2001 using the name Chris Cage. After two years on the independent circuit, he signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was assigned to the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) territory. In OVW, he won the Southern Tag Team Championship four times (three times with Tank Toland and once with Mike Mizanin) and the Heavyweight Championship once. He was released from his WWE developmental contract in March 2006 before being re-signed in 2008. He competed for the Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory, where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, and debuted for the ECW brand in December 2009. Professional wrestling career Pavone made his debut in 2001 as a student of Nightmare Danny Davis and Nick Dinsmore. Within two years, he appeared at the ECWA Super 8 Tournament in April 2003 and began competing in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) several weeks later. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2003‚Äì2006)= After forming a brief tag team with Nova, using the ring name Chris Cage, Pavone later teamed up with Tank Toland to form Adrenaline. Together, they went on to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during 2003 and 2004. He later won his first and only OVW Heavyweight Championship after defeating Matt Morgan, before losing it a few months later to Chad Toland, the on-screen cousin of his tag partner Tank. He later won his fourth and final OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, this time with newcomer Mike Mizanin. Together, they feuded with the Toland Cousins (Tank and Chad) and The Throwbacks. Pavone, however, was released from his contract due to behavior problems, leaving Mizanin to defend and ultimately lose the Tag Team Championship to The Throwbacks. =Return to WWE (2008‚Äì2010)= Pavone in FCW as Caylen Croft After wrestling on the independent circuit, including a one- time appearance in Ring of Honor, throughout 2006 and 2007, Pavone was re- signed to a development deal by WWE, and he began working in their development territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the name Caylen Croft. Soon after debuting in FCW, he formed a tag team with Trent Barreta called The Dude Busters. On May 30, 2009, Barreta and Croft won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship from Tyler Reks in a handicap match when his partner Johnny Curtis failed to appear. On July 23, Croft and Barreta lost the championship to Justin Angel and Kris Logan. On November 19, Croft won his second FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, this time with Curt Hawkins, after they defeated The Rotundos (Bo and Duke). While they were champions, Croft and Hawkins would defend the title with Barreta via the Freebird Rule. On January 14, 2010 at an FCW television taping, the Dude Busters lost the Florida Tag Team Championship to The Fortunate Sons (Brett DiBiase and Joe Hennig). On the December 1, 2009 episode of ECW on SyFy, Croft and Barreta, no longer using the Dude Busters name, debuted as villains, defeating Tyler Hilton and Bobby Shields, two local competitors. The duo would then feud with Goldust and Yoshi Tatsu, which culminated in a loss to Goldust and Tatsu in a match to determine the number one contenders to the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship on the February 9, 2010 episode of ECW. When the ECW brand ended in February 2010, its roster became free agents. Barreta and Croft signed with SmackDown, making their debut for the brand on February 19 in a losing effort against Cryme Tyme. Baretta and Croft would then feud with The Hart Dynasty, but could never manage a win against them. In April, they began using their Dude Busters name again, which they had seemingly dropped since debuting in ECW. The Dude Busters then turned face when they entered into a feud with the Gatecrashers (Curt Hawkins and Vance Archer) in August. The Dude Busters then earned their first tag team victory since joining the SmackDown roster when they defeated the Gatecrashers on the August 26 episode of Superstars. On November 19, 2010, Pavone was released from his contract. He retired from professional wrestling shortly after.  Personal life  Pavone grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. He was influenced by Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. Pavone attended Youngstown State University graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. After leaving WWE, Pavone became an elementary school art teacher in the Hillsborough County School District in Florida. Pavone is also the illustrator and author of the children's book No Beard The Pirate. He married Rachael Ferguson on October 10, 2015.

On December 8, 1963, the Boeing 707 serving the flight crashed near Elkton, Maryland, while flying from Baltimore to Philadelphia, after being hit by lightning. All 81 occupants of the plane were killed. It was the first fatal accident on a Pan Am jet aircraft since the company had taken its first delivery of the type five years earlier. An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that the cause of the crash was a lightning strike that had ignited fuel vapors in one of the aircraft's fuel tanks, causing an explosion that destroyed one of the wings. The exact way that the lightning had ignited the fumes was never determined. However, the investigation revealed various ways that lightning can damage aircraft in flight, which led to new safety regulations. The crash also led to research into the safety of different types of aviation fuel and research into methods of reducing dangerous fuel-tank vapors. Accident Pan American Flight 214 was a regularly scheduled flight from Isla Verde International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Philadelphia International Airport with a scheduled stopover at Baltimore's Friendship Airport. It operated three times a week as the counterpart to Flight 213, which flew from Philadelphia to San Juan via Baltimore earlier the same day. Flight 214 left San Juan at 4:10p.m. Eastern time with 140 passengers and 8 crew members, and arrived in Baltimore at 7:10p.m. The crew did not report any maintenance issues or problems during the flight. Upon arrival, 67 of the passengers disembarked in Baltimore. After refueling, the aircraft left Baltimore at 8:24p.m. with the remaining 73 passengers for the final leg to Philadelphia International Airport. As the flight approached Philadelphia, the pilots established contact with air traffic control near Philadelphia at 8:42p.m. The controller informed the pilots that the airport was experiencing a line of thunderstorms in the vicinity of the airport, accompanied by strong winds and turbulence. The controller asked if the pilots wanted to proceed directly to the airport, or to enter a holding pattern to wait for the storm to pass. The crew of Pan Am flight 214 elected to hold, at 5,000 feet, in a holding pattern with five other aircraft. The air traffic controller told them that the delay would be approximately 30 minutes. There was heavy rain in the holding area, with frequent lightning and gusts of wind up to . At 8:58p.m., the aircraft exploded. The pilots were able to transmit a final message, \\"MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY. Clipper 214 out of control. Here we go.\\" Seconds later, the first officer of National Airlines Flight 16, holding 1,000 feet higher in the same holding pattern, radioed in, \\"Clipper 214 is going down in flames\\". The aircraft crashed at 8:59p.m. in a corn field east of Elkton, Maryland, near the Delaware Turnpike, setting the rain-soaked field on fire. The aircraft was completely destroyed, and all of the occupants were killed. The aircraft was the first Pan American jet plane to crash in the five years they had been flown by the airline. Aftermath Wreckage from the flight after the crash A Maryland State Trooper had been patrolling on Route 213 and he radioed an alert as he drove toward the crash site, east of Elkton near the state line. The Trooper was first to arrive at the crash site and later stated that ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a large fire. It was several smaller fires. A fuselage with about 8 or 10 window frames was about the only large recognizable piece I could see when I pulled up. It was just a debris field. It didn‚Äôt resemble an airplane. The engines were buried in the ground 10- to 15-feet from the force of the impact.‚Äù The emergency radio communications tape from that evening was preserved, recording the early minutes of the accident as police officers and firefighters arrived at the scene. The streaming audio is available on the blog, A Window on Cecil County's Past It was soon obvious to firefighters and police officers that there was little to be done other than put out the fires and begin the collection of bodies. The wreckage was engulfed in intense fires that burned for more than four hours. First responders and police from across the county, along with men from the Bainbridge Naval Training Center assisted with the recovery. They patrolled the area with railroad flares and set up searchlights to define the accident scene and to make sure that the debris and human remains were undisturbed by curious spectators. Remains of the victims were brought to the National Guard Armory in Philadelphia where a temporary morgue was set up. Relatives came to the armory, but officials there ruled out any possibility of being able to visually identify the victims. It took the state medical examiner nine days to identify all of the victims, using fingerprints, dental records, and nearby personal effects. In some cases, the team reconstructed the victims' faces as much as possible using mannequins. The main impact crater contained most of the aircraft's fuselage, the left inner wing, the left main gear, and the nose gear. Portions of the plane's right wing and fuselage, right main landing gear, horizontal and vertical tail surfaces, and two of the engines were found within of the crater. A trail of debris from the plane extended as far as from the point of impact. The complete left wing tip was found a little under from the crash site. Parts of the wreckage ripped a hole in a country road, shattered windows in a nearby home, and spread burning jet fuel across a wide area. The Civil Aeronautics Board was notified of the accident and was dispatched from Washington, D.C., to conduct an investigation. Witnesses of the crash described hearing the explosion and seeing the plane in flames as it went down. Of the 140 witnesses interviewed, 99 reported seeing an aircraft or a flaming object in the sky. Seven witnesses stated that they saw lightning strike the aircraft. Seventy- two witnesses said the ball of fire occurred at the same time or immediately after the lightning strike. Twenty-three witnesses reported that the aircraft exploded after they saw the plane on fire. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Boeing 707-121 registered with tail number N709PA. Named the Clipper Tradewind, it was the oldest aircraft in the U.S. commercial jet fleet at the time of the crash. It had been delivered to Pan Am on 27 October 1958 and had flown a total of 14,609 hours. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney JT3C-6 turbojet engines. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was estimated to have a book value of $3,400,000 (). Nearly five years earlier, in 1959, the same aircraft had been involved in an incident when the right outboard engine had been torn from the wing during a training flight in France. The plane entered a sudden spin during a demonstration of the aircraft's minimum control speed, and the aerodynamic forces caused the engine to break away. The pilot regained control of the aircraft and landed safely in London using the remaining three engines. The detached engine fell into a field on a farm southwest of Paris, where the flight had originated, with no injuries. Passengers and crew The plane carried 73 passengers, who all died in the crash. All the passengers were residents of the United States. The pilot of the plane was George F. Knuth, 45, of Long Island. He had flown for Pan Am for 22 years and had accumulated 17,049 hours of flying experience, including 2,890 in the Boeing 707. He had been involved in another incident in 1949, when as pilot of Pan Am Flight 100, a Lockheed Constellation in flight over Port Washington, New York, a Cessna 140 single-engine airplane crashed into his plane. The two occupants of the Cessna were killed in the accident, but Captain Knuth was able to land safely with no injuries to the crew or passengers of the Pan Am flight. The first officer of the flight was John R. Dale, 48, of Long Island. He had a total of 13,963 hours of flying time, of which 2,681 were in the Boeing 707. The second officer was Paul L. Orringer, age 42, of New Rochelle, New York. He had 10,008 hours of flying experience, including 2,808 in Boeing 707 aircraft. The flight engineer was John R. Kantlehner, of Long Island. He had a total flying time of 6,066 hours, including 76 hours in the Boeing 707. Investigation CAB engineer examines the badly damaged flight recorder of Pan Am Flight 214 Diagram showing Flight 214's fuel tank layout. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) assigned more than a dozen investigators within an hour of the crash. They were assisted by investigators from the Boeing Company, Pan American World Airways, the Air Line Pilots Association, Pratt & Whitney, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Aviation Agency. The costs of investigations by the CAB at the time rarely exceeded $10,000, but the agency would spend about $125,000 investigating this crash (), in addition to the money spent by Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the engine manufacturer, and other aircraft parts suppliers on additional investigations. Initial theories of the cause of the crash focused on the possibility that the plane had experienced severe turbulence in flight that had caused a fuel tank or fuel line to rupture, leading to an in-flight fire from leaking fuel. U.S. House Representative Samuel S. Stratton of Schenectady, New York, sent a telegram to the Federal Aviation Administration urging them to restrict jet operations in turbulent weather, but the FAA responded that it saw no pattern that suggested the need for such restrictions, and the Boeing Company concurred. Other possibilities of the cause of the crash included sabotage or that the aircraft had been hit by lightning, but by nightfall after the first day, investigators had not found evidence of either. There was also some speculation that metal fatigue as a result of the aircraft's 1959 incident could be involved in the crash, but the aircraft had gone through four separate maintenance overhauls since the accident without any issues being detected. Investigators rapidly located the flight data recorder, but it was badly damaged in the crash. Built to withstand an impact 100 times as strong as the force of gravity, it had been subjected to a force of 200 times the force of gravity, and its tape appeared to be hopelessly damaged. Alan S. Boyd, chairman of the CAB, told reporters shortly after the accident, \\"It was so compacted there is no way to tell at this time whether we can derive any useful information from it.\\" Eventually, investigators were able to extract data from 95 percent of the tape that had been in the recorder. The recovery of the wreckage took place over a period of 12 days, and 16 truckloads of the debris was taken to Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., for investigators to examine and reassemble. Investigators revealed that there was evidence of a fire that occurred in flight, and one commented that it was nearly certain that there had been an explosion of some kind before it crashed. Eyewitness testimony later confirmed that the plane had been burning on its way down to the crash site. Within days, investigators reported that it was apparent that the crash had been caused by an explosion that had blown off one of the wing tips of the airplane. The wing tip had been found about from the crash site bearing burn marks and bulging from an apparent internal explosive force. Remnants of of the wing tip had been found at various points along the flight path short of the impact crater. Investigators revealed that it was unlikely that rough turbulence had caused the crash because the crews of other aircraft that had been circling in the area reported that the air was relatively smooth at the time. They also said that the plane would have had to dive a considerable distance before aerodynamic forces would have caused it to break up and explode, but it was apparent that the aircraft had caught fire near its cruising altitude of 5,000 feet. Before this flight, there had been no other known case of lightning causing a plane to crash despite many instances of planes being struck. Investigators found that on average, each airplane is struck by lightning once or twice a year. Scientists and airline industry representatives vigorously disputed the theory that lightning could have caused the aircraft to explode, calling it improbable. The closest example of such an instance occurred near Milan, Italy, in June 1959 where a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation crashed as a result of static electricity igniting fuel vapor coming from the fuel vents. Despite the opposition, investigators found multiple lightning strike marks on the left wing tip, and a large area of damage that extended along the rear edge of the wing, leading investigators to believe that lightning was the cause. The CAB launched an urgent research program in an attempt to identify conditions in which fuel vapors in the wings could have been ignited by lightning. Within a week of the crash, the FAA issued an order requiring the installation of static electricity dischargers on the approximately 100 Boeing jet airliners that had not already been equipped with them. Aviation industry representatives were critical of the order, saying there was no evidence that the dischargers would have any beneficial effect since they were never designed to handle the effects of lightning, and they said the order would create a false impression that the risk of lightning strikes had been resolved. The CAB conducted a public hearing in Philadelphia in February 1964 as part of their investigation. Experts had still not concluded that lightning had caused the accident, but they were investigating different ways lightning could have triggered the explosion. The FAA said that it was going to conduct research to determine the relative safety of the two types of jet fuel used in the United States, both of which were present in the fuel tanks of Flight 214. Criticism of the JP-4 jet fuel that had been present in the tanks centered around the fact that its vapors can be easily ignited at the low temperatures encountered in flight. JP-4 advocates countered that it was as safe or safer than kerosene, the other fuel used in jets at the time. Pan American World Airways conducted a flight test in a Boeing 707 to investigate whether fuel could leak from the tank venting system during a test flight that attempted to simulate moderate to rough turbulence in flight. The test did not reveal any fuel discharge, but there was evidence that fuel had entered the vent system, collected in the surge tanks, and returned to the fuel tanks. Pan American said that it would test a new system to inject inert gas into the air spaces above the fuel tanks in aircraft in an attempt to reduce the risk of hazardous fuel-air mixtures that could ignite. On March 3, 1965, the CAB released the final accident report. The investigators concluded that a lightning strike had ignited the fuel-air mixture in the number 1 reserve fuel tank, which had caused an explosive disintegration of the left outer wing, leading to a loss of control. Despite one of the most intensive research efforts in its history, the agency could not identify the exact mechanics of how the fuel had ignited, concluding that the lightning had ignited vapors through an as-yet unknown pathway. The board said, \\"It is felt that the current state of the art does not permit an extension of test results to unqualified conclusions of all aspects of natural lightning effects. The need for additional research is recognized and additional programming is planned.\\" Legacy The crash of Pan Am Flight 214 called attention to the fact that there were previously unknown risks to aircraft in flight from lightning strikes. One month after the crash, the FAA formed a technical committee on lightning protection for fuel systems, with experts from the FAA, CAB, other government agencies, and lightning experts. The committee made commitments to conduct both long-range and short-range studies of the hazards of lightning on the fuel systems of aircraft, and how to defeat those hazards. In 1967, the FAA updated airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes with requirements that the fuel systems of aircraft must be designed to prevent the ignition of fuel vapor within the system by lightning strikes, and published guidance related to that requirement. Additional requirements to protect the aircraft from lightning were enacted in 1970. Many aircraft design improvements emerged as a result of the new guidelines and regulations. There was increased attention to the electrical bonding of the components installed in the outer surfaces of the fuel tanks located in the wings, such as fuel filler caps, drain valves, and access panels, to the surrounding structures. Fuel vent flame arrestors were added to aircraft to detect and extinguish fuel vapors that had ignited at fuel vent outlets. The thickness of the aluminum surfaces of the wings was thickened in order to reduce the chances that a lightning strike could cause a complete melt-through of the wing surface into the internal components of the wings.

He started his wrestling career in 2004, working for WWE, first in their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling and later on their main roster from 2006 to 2008. While in WWE he would occasionally do commentary during events, but was primarily used as a wrestler, especially as part of the New Breed stable. From 2009 to 2013, and again from 2015 to 2017 Burke worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling, his first stint as a wrestler and the second stint as one of their main television commentators. Burke has won the OVW Heavyweight Championship, OVW Television Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship and was voted the 2010 Most Improved Wrestler of the Year by the readers of Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Prior to his wrestling career Burke worked as a corrections officer in Florida, later gaining a degree in criminal justice, as well as an amateur boxer, a background that influenced his in ring style. Law enforcement and boxing career Burke is a former Corrections Officer for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office in Florida who would become an amateur boxer in Jacksonville's Club 5 and Club Plush where he had a 98‚Äì1 win/loss record. According to his WWE.com profile, Burke has a record of 103‚Äì1 with 102 knockouts in his amateur career. According to WWE, the only loss he sustained was a disqualification, after he knocked his opponent out and refused to back down to his corner. Before each of his matches he writes the phrase \\"4-Up\\" on his wrist tape, and in an interview with WWE Magazine, Burke stated that this came from the phrase \\"I'm going to give you five upside your head,\\" used by comedians such as Redd Foxx. However, when you punch somebody, it's more accurately four upside the head. On the \\"Right After Wrestling\\" program on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel 98, Burke told hosts Arda Ocal and Jimmy Korderas that early in his professional wrestling career, he never threw worked punches due to having difficulty pulling his punches. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Entertainment= Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004‚Äì2006) After signing with WWE, he was sent to their developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, he won the Heavyweight Championship on December 8, 2004, by defeating Chad Toland. On April 14 Burke lost the championship to Matt Morgan. While in OVW, Burke was offered a spot in the Spirit Squad by WWE's creative team, but turned it down, which forced him to stay in OVW on a longer stint before moving to SmackDown! with Sylvester Terkay. The New Breed (2006‚Äì2007) Burke (right) with Sylvester Terkay at December to Dismember Burke would be brought up to the main roster of SmackDown! on July 28, 2006 working a mixed martial arts cornerman gimmick with the also debuting former MMA fighter Sylvester Terkay. His first WWE match saw him defeating Scott Wright and he would also break Vito's four month winning streak while on SmackDown!, albeit with Terkay's assistance. On November 7, 2006, Burke and Terkay debuted on the ECW brand by cutting a backstage promo. The following week, Burke replaced Tazz, who had knee surgery, as color commentator alongside play-by-play announcer Joey Styles. Two weeks later, Burke returned to the ring; he and Terkay lost to The Hardys. At the ECW brand's December to Dismember pay-per-view, Burke and Terkay defeated The Full Blooded Italians. The pair were later dubbed The Knock-Out/Tap-Out Connection, in reference to Burke's amateur boxing career and Terkay's mixed martial arts background. On January 18, 2007, Terkay was released from WWE. Following this, Burke usually wrestled in singles matches, and appeared in a segment where WWE owner Vince McMahon showed disdain for members of the original ECW and called Burke to the ring, naming him \\"The Future of ECW\\". Burke was then attacked by Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, and The Sandman, who would later form the ECW Originals stable. Burke then became the official leader of The New Breed, a group of new ECW stars including Matt Striker, Marcus Cor Von and Kevin Thorn, who proceeded to feud with the ECW Originals. At WrestleMania 23, The New Breed faced off against the ECW Originals but were ultimately defeated. After several weeks of trying to recruit fellow roster mate and new ECW superstar CM Punk, Burke and the New Breed were successful on April 10. Just two weeks later, however, CM Punk betrayed the New Breed, attacking Burke after a match. The next week, Kevin Thorn quit the New Breed due to lack of interference in his match with CM Punk. The same night, Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von were defeated by the debuting Major Brothers. After being pinned, Burke screamed at Striker creating tension between the two. The New Breed would then feud with the ECW Originals, CM Punk and the Major Brothers at the same time. At Judgment Day, Burke was defeated by CM Punk. Then, at One Night Stand, Burke, Marcus Cor Von and Matt Striker were defeated by Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and CM Punk in a tables match, ending the New Breed stable. Singles competition and departure (2007‚Äì2008) Burke in 2007 On June 19, 2007, Burke lost to Chris Benoit (which would be Benoit's last match before his death) in a match that would decide who would face either CM Punk or Marcus Cor Von for the vacant ECW World Championship at Vengeance: Night of Champions. Burke then lost to Punk in a two out of three falls match, which would see the winner becoming the number-one contender to Johnny Nitro's ECW World Championship. On July 10, Burke rebounded with a decisive victory over Balls Mahoney. He was then named the number one contender for the ECW Championship and went on to face CM Punk at the Unforgiven pay-per-view where he was beaten after Punk cleanly pinned him. Two days later on ECW, an elimination chase was set up by ECW General Manager Armando Estrada. This challenge was to determine the number one contender to CM Punk's ECW Championship in order to compete for the title at No Mercy 2007. Estrada pitted four ECW wrestlers (Burke, Kevin Thorn, Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards) against each other in a fatal four-way that night, which Burke won, removing the loser of the match, Richards, from contention. The following week Thorn was eliminated and in the final match of the elimination chase, Burke was eliminated by Dreamer. Towards the end of 2007, Burke had a short feud with then-World Heavyweight Champion Batista after Batista claimed his upcoming match with Burke was the last thing on his mind, thus disrespecting him and leading to two singles matches against Batista with Burke on the losing end of both. On the November 20 episode of ECW, Burke introduced and formed an alliance with the newest member of the ECW roster, Shelton Benjamin, who moved over from the Raw brand. Burke was then taken off television for several months but he later reappeared by participating in the 2008 Royal Rumble, entering as the 28th entrant but was eliminated by Triple H after having Mick Foley pushed into him, after which both Foley and Burke were eliminated. He later participated in a 24-man battle royal at WrestleMania XXIV to determine who would face ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero. Burke was eliminated early in the match (shortly after he himself eliminated Stevie Richards) by Kane. Burke then reappeared again in a tag team match on SmackDown where he and Shelton Benjamin faced Kofi Kingston and then- United States Champion Matt Hardy in a losing effort. Burke faced Hardy the following week in what would be his final televised match, but was unsuccessful. Burke later resurfaced once again in 2008 with a new \\"Black Pope\\" gimmick defeating Stevie Richards, Kung Fu Naki and Jamie Noble in dark matches. On November 10, 2008, Burke was released from his WWE contract after being absent from television since May 2008. =Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2010, 2012‚Äì2015)= On November 16, 2008, One Pro Wrestling based in England announced that Burke would be appearing on their Friday the 13th show in February 2009, but was canceled.

On July 29, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that Burke had signed a contract with TNA. On the August 6 episode of Impact! a vignette was aired that announced that Burke would be debuting under the ring name D'Angelo Dinero at Hard Justice. Burke made his debut as a heel on August 16 in the Steel Asylum match, which was won by Daniels. On August 20, 2009, he made his Impact! debut and defeated Consequences Creed before he was attacked by Suicide, who had lost the Steel Asylum match because of Dinero's interference. On the September 17 episode of Impact!, Dinero defeated Suicide. At No Surrender, Dinero defeated Suicide once again, this time in a \\"falls count anywhere\\" match. The following week on Impact! Suicide finally defeated Dinero, by pinning him in a street fight. Burke was slated to take part in the Ultimate X match at Bound for Glory, but ended up missing the event due to a \\"family emergency\\". Dinero returned on the November 12 episode of Impact!, aligning himself with Matt Morgan and Hernandez against Team 3D and Rhino, which turned him face as a result. Three days later, on November 15, 2009, Dixie Carter announced on her Twitter account that Burke had signed a new long term deal with the company. At Turning Point Rhino and Team 3D defeated Dinero, Morgan and Hernandez. On the following Impact! Rhino and Team 3D won the rematch as well, when Jesse Neal turned heel and joined them. On the December 3 episode Impact! Suicide accepted Dinero's offer for peace and joined him, Morgan and Hernandez in their war with Rhino, Team 3D and Neal. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On the January 4, 2010, special live three-hour Monday night episode of Impact!, Dinero defeated Desmond Wolfe. Two weeks later at Genesis, however, Wolfe avenged his loss and defeated Dinero in a rematch. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, Dinero scored a non-title victory over the World Heavyweight Champion, A.J. Styles. At Against All Odds Dinero defeated Desmond Wolfe, Matt Morgan and Mr. Anderson, despite being attacked by Scott Hall and Sean Waltman prior to the match, to win the 8 Card Stud Tournament and earn himself a shot at Styles' World Heavyweight Championship at Lockdown. Two months later, at Lockdown, Dinero failed in his attempt to win the World Heavyweight Championship from Styles. During the match Burke suffered ligament damage in his shoulder, which would sideline him for over two months. In storyline, Dinero's absence was attributed to Mr. Anderson attacking him backstage on the May 3 episode of Impact!. Dinero returned on the July 1 episode of Impact! and was immediately challenged to a match by Kurt Angle, who had vowed to go through TNA's top ten wrestlers in the Championship Committee's rankings and had now arrived to the man ranked number eight. At Victory Road Dinero was defeated by Angle in his return match. Afterwards, Dinero started a storyline with Mr. Anderson, who had recently turned face and wanted to prove his change to the man he had injured two months earlier by saving him from Matt Morgan. On the August 19 episode of Impact! the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and Dinero was entered into an eight-man tournament for it. In his first-round match he defeated Morgan to set up a semifinal match against Anderson. At No Surrender Anderson defeated Dinero to eliminate him from the tournament. D'Angelo Dinero in October 2010 On the September 16 episode of Impact!, and the Reaction following it, Dinero seemingly turned heel by aligning himself with Kevin Nash and Sting, who had been feuding with Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff and Jeff Jarrett for months over the way TNA was run, claiming to know that they were up to something. Dinero later claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right. At Bound for Glory Dinero, Sting and Nash faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting and Nash had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett, Abyss and Jeff Hardy, and in the process turned Dinero, Sting and Nash back to being faces. On the following episode of Impact! Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan's and Bischoff's new Immortal stable and instead walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her, but she had not listened. Dinero, now left alone, then became a target of the Immortal/Fortune alliance, with Fortune members A.J. Styles, Douglas Williams, Kazarian, James Storm and Robert Roode defeating him in a 5‚Äìon‚Äì1 handicap match. The following week Dinero received a shot at Styles' Television Championship in a street fight, but was defeated after an interference from Abyss. Afterwards, Dinero tried to form an alliance with Samoa Joe to fight Immortal and Fortune, but was turned down. At Turning Point Abyss defeated Dinero in a Lumberjack match, after Dinero's lumberjacks, including his own brother, turned on him, after being bought out by Eric Bischoff. The following month at Final Resolution Dinero was defeated by Abyss in a casket match. Devon from Mexican America On the following episode of Impact! Dinero started collecting donations in order to help those in need, however, after a vignette, filmed secretly by Samoa Joe's associate Okato, where Dinero visited a strip club, his true motivations were questioned by Joe on the January 6, 2011, episode of Impact!. On the January 27 episode of Impact!, Dinero completed his heel turn, talking down to the crowd at the Impact! Zone and confessing his dislike of Samoa Joe. On February 13 at Against All Odds Dinero was defeated by Joe in a singles match. After the match Dinero attacked Joe and bloodied him. On the following episode of Impact!, Joe got his revenge on Dinero by giving him a muscle buster through a table, after Okato prevented him from escaping the ring. On the March 10 episode of Impact!, Dinero defeated Joe in a rematch between the two, after hitting him with a chain. On April 17 at Lockdown, Joe defeated Dinero in a steel cage match. In June, Dinero helped Brother Devon in his feud with Mexican America, even though Devon tried to decline his help, claiming that he was a bad influence on his two sons Terrence and Terrell. Later that month, Dinero and Devon were both entered into the Bound for Glory Series to determine the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, during the course of which Dinero handed Devon a win in a tag team match, but Devon did not return the favor and save Dinero from a post-match assault at the hands of Samoa Joe. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Dinero defeated Devon in a Bound for Glory Series match. At the start of the match, Dinero offered to lay down for Devon, but the offer was refused. Devon finally changed his attitude towards Dinero by saving him from Samoa Joe on the August 25 episode of Impact Wrestling. The attack however forced Dinero to pull out of the Bound for Glory Series with a storyline injury. On the September 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Dinero and Devon defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus) to become the number one contenders to the World Tag Team Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, Dinero and Devon failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from Anarquia and Hernandez of Mexican America. On the December 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, Dinero and Devon defeated Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) and Mexican America to become the number one contenders to the World Tag Team Championship, now held by the team of Crimson and Matt Morgan. On December 11 at Final Resolution, Dinero and Devon failed to capture the World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Dinero, along with Terrence and Terrell, turned on Devon. On January 8, 2012, at Genesis, Terrence and Terrell turned on Dinero and helped their father defeat him in a singles match. Dinero returned to TNA on the June 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, when he entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, taking part in the opening gauntlet match, from which he was eliminated by James Storm. After only one win and eight losses, Dinero suffered a legitimate shoulder injury and was sidelined from the tournament during its final weeks in mid-August. In storyline Dinero was sidelined as a result of being attacked by Aces & Eights at Hardcore Justice. On January 8, 2013, Burke announced on Twitter that his TNA contract had expired on January 1, and he would not be re-signing with the company. =Return to OVW (2013‚Äì2015)= On September 11, 2013, Burke returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling and defeated Flash Flanagan to win the Television Championship. After defeating Flanagan to retain the OVW Television Championship in a rematch the following week, Burke successfully defended his title twice against Raul LaMotta and Rockstar Spud before losing the title to Shiloh Jonze on October 5 at the OVW Saturday Night Special. On October 9, 2013, Burke teamed with Eddie Diamond to defeat The Marauders (Joe Coleman & Shiloh Jonze), then made a challenged to Jonze for a title rematch. On October 16, Burke faced Shiloh Jonze in a Steel Cage match for the Television Championship but was unsuccessful. On September 16, 2015, Burke made his return under the ring name General Pope, teaming with Private Anthony defeating Adam Revolver and Reverend Stuart Miles in a number one contenders match for an opportunity at the Southern Tag Team Championship. On December 5, The Band of Brothaz (General Pope and Private Anthony) defeated The Van Zandt Family Circus (Dapper Dan Van Zandt and The Ringmaster) to win the Southern Tag Team Championship. With this victory, Burke became the sixteenth triple crown champion in OVW history. =Return to TNA (2015‚Äì2017)= Pope (left) commentating with Josh Mathews in October 2015 Burke returned to TNA on the June 3, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling alongside Josh Mathews on commentary under the ring name Da Pope. On October 4, 2015, at Bound For Glory, Pope entered in a twelve-man Bound For Gold Gauntlet match which was won by Tyrus. On the March 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Pope saved Josh Mathews from an attack by Lashley only to be attacked himself. The following week, Pope cost Lashley a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when he interfered in a gauntlet match he was competing in and then fighting him to the backstage area. On the April 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Pope was defeated by Lashley in a street fight. He was acting as a face commentator. On August 16, 2017, Dinero announced his departure from TNA. = Return to the independent circuit (2017‚Äìpresent) = Since leaving TNA, he has primarily wrestled for Fighting Evolution Wrestling, a Florida-based promotion.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1179&page;=4 Burke debuted on the December 23, 2019 episode of NWA Powerrr, using his \\"Pope\\" moniker.

The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness = Summary = Gilroy's 1993 book The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness marks a turning point in the study of diasporas.Chivallon, Christine. \\"Beyond Gilroy's Black Atlantic: The Experience of the African Diaspora\\". Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies, Vol. 11, Issue 3 (Winter 2002): pp. 359‚Äì382 (p. 359). Applying a cultural studies approach, he provides a study of African intellectual history and its cultural construction.Barnes, Natasha. \\"Black Atlantic: Black America\\", Research in African Literatures, 27, n. 4 (Winter 1996): p. 106. Moving away from all cultural forms that could be deemed ethnic absolutism, Gilroy offers the concept of the Black Atlantic as a space of transnational cultural construction.Braziel, Jana Evans, and Anita Mannur, Theorizing Diaspora. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006, p. 49. In his book, Gilroy makes the peoples who suffered from the Atlantic slave trade the emblem of his new concept of diasporic peoples. This new concept breaks with the traditional diasporic model based on the idea that diasporic people are separated by a communal source or origin, offering a second model that privileges hybridity. Gilroy's theme of Double Consciousness involves Black Atlantic striving to be both European and Black through their relationship to the land of their birth and their ethnic political constituency being absolutely transformed. Rather than encapsulating the African-American tradition within national borders, Gilroy recognizes the actual significance of European and African travels of many African-American writers. To prove his point, he re-reads the works of African-American intellectuals against the background of a trans-Atlantic context.Erickson, Peter. Reviews. African American Review, Vol. 31, Issue 3 (Fall 1997): p. 506. Gilroy's concept of the Black Atlantic fundamentally disrupts contemporary forms of cultural nationalism and reopens the field of African-American studies by enlarging the field's interpretive framework. Gilroy offers a corrective to traditional notions of culture as rooted in a particular nation or history, suggesting instead an analytic that foregrounds movement and exchange. In an effort to disabuse scholars of cultural studies and cultural historians in the UK and the U.S. from assuming a \\"pure\\" racial, ethnic, and class-based politics/political history, Gilroy traces two legacies of political and cultural thought that emerge through cross-pollination. Gilroy critiques New Leftists for assuming a pure British nationalist identity that in fact was influenced by various Black histories and modes of exchange. Gilroy's initial claim seeks to trouble the assumptive logics of a \\"pure\\" western history (canon), offering instead a way to think these histories as mutually constituted and always already entangled. Gilroy uses the transatlantic slave trade to highlight the influence of \\"routes\\" on black identity. He uses the image of a ship to represent how authentic black culture is composed of cultural exchanges since the slave trade stifled blacks' ability to connect to a homeland. He claims that there was a cultural exchange as well as a commodity exchange that defines the transatlantic slave trade and thus black culture. In addition, he discusses how Black people and Black cultures were written out of European countries and cultures via the effort to equate white people with institutions and cultures, which causes whiteness to be conflated with Europe as a country and Black people being ignored and excluded. This causes Blackness and Britishness to be viewed as separate entities lacking symbiosis. Whiteness and Britishness even went so far as to create a culture such that Blackness becomes a threat to the sanctity of these European and British cultures. To further an understanding of this, one can think of how race is a taboo subject in Germany, which allows Blackness to never be introduced as a dimension of what it means to be German, allowing Black people and their struggles with racism to be unnamed, unmarked, and ignored. An example of how Gilroy and his concepts in The Black Atlantic directly affected a specific field of African-American studies is its role in defining and influencing the shift between the political black British movement of the 1960/70s to the 1980/90s.Shukra, Kalbir. \\"The Death of a Black Political Movement\\", Community Development Journal, Vol. 32, No. 3 (July 1997): p. 233. Gilroy came to reject outright the working-class movements of the 1970s and '80s on the basis that the system and logic behind the movements were fundamentally flawed as a result of their roots in the way of thinking that not only ignored race but also the trans-Atlantic experience as an integral part of the black experience and history.Shukra (1997), p. 234. This argument is expanded upon in one of his previous co-authored books, The Empire Strikes Back (1983), which was supported by the (now closed) Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies of the University of Birmingham in the UK. The Black Atlantic received an American Book Award in 1994. The book has subsequently been translated into Italian, French, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. The influence of the study is generally accepted to be profound, though academics continue to debate in exactly what form its greatest significance may lie.Evans, Lucy, \\"The Black Atlantic: Exploring Gilroy's Legacy\\", in Dave Gunning and Abigail Ward (eds), Tracing Black America in Black British Culture, Special Issue of Atlantic Studies, Vol. 6, No. 2 (August 2009), pp. 255‚Äì68. The theoretical use of the ocean as a liminal space alternative to the authority of nation-states has been highly generative in diasporic studies, in spite of Gilroy's own desire to avoid such conflations.Edwards, Brent Hayes. \\"The Uses of Diaspora\\". Social Text 66(19): 2001, 45‚Äì73. The image of water and migration has been taken up as well by later scholars of the Black diaspora, including Omise‚Äôeke Natasha Tinsley, Isabel Hofmeyr, and Stephanie E. Smallwood, who expand Gilroy's theorizations by engaging questions of queerness, transnationality, and the middle passage.Tinsley, Omise‚Äôeke Natasha. \\"Black Atlantic, Queer Atlantic: Queer Imaginings of the Middle Passage\\". GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 14(2‚Äì3): 2008, 191‚Äì215.; Hofmeyr, Isabel. \\"The Black Atlantic Meets the Indian Ocean: Forging New Paradigms of Transnatinalism for the Global South ‚Äì Literary and Cultural Perspectives\\", Social Dynamics: A Journal of African Studies, 33(2):2008, 37‚Äì41; Smallwood, Stephanie, Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007. = Academic responses and criticisms = Among the academic responses to Gilroy's Black Atlantic thesis are: Africadian Atlantic: Essays on George Elliott Clarke (2012), edited by Joseph Pivato, and George Elliott Clarke's \\"Must All Blackness Be American? Locating Canada in Borden's 'Tightrope Time,' or Nationalizing Gilroy's The Black Atlantic\\" (1996, Canadian Ethnic Studies 28.3).Clarke, George Elliott, \\"Must All Blackness Be American?: Locating Canada in Borden's 'Tightrope Time,' or Nationalizing Gilroy's The Black Atlantic\\", Athabasca University, 11 October 2012. Additionally, scholar Tsiti Ella Jaji discusses Gilroy and his conceptualization of the Black Atlantic as the \\"inspiration and provocation\\" for her 2014 book Africa in Stereo: Modernism, Music, and Pan-African Solidarity. While finding Gilroy‚Äôs discussion of music in the Black diaspora compelling and inspiring, Jaji has two main points of contention that provoked her to critique and to dissect his theories, the first being his failure to include continental Africa in this space of music production, creating an understanding of black diaspora that is exclusive of Africa. Jaji's second point is that Gilroy fails to examine the role that gender plays in Black music production. Jaji discusses how Gilroy's The Black Atlantic, while enriching our collective understanding of trans- Atlantic Black cultural exchange, devalues the incorporation of gender into his analysis, as can be seen in chapter one of The Black Atlantic, where Gilroy says: \\"Black survival depends upon forging a new means to build alliances above and beyond petty issues like language, religion, skin colour, and to a lesser extent gender.\\" Further, Gilroy did not include female voices in his discussion of music and trans-Atlantic Black cultural exchange, which Jaji argues contributes to a gendered understanding of pan-Africanism that is largely male-dominated. An additional academic response to Gilroy's work is by scholar Julian Henriques. Gilroy concludes the first chapter of his book The Black Atlantic Modernity and Double Consciousness with the quote: \\"social self-creation through labour is not the centre-piece of emancipatory hopes....Artistic expression...therefore becomes the means towards both individual self-fashioning and communal liberation\\" (Gilroy, 40). This quote about the liberatory potential of art as a transatlantic cultural product. Gilroy argues that for Black people forms of culture take on a heightened meaning in light of Black persons being excluded from representation in the traditional political apparatus. As such, Gilroy argues that culture is the mode through which Black persons should aspire to liberation. In working to understand Black culture, Gilroy implores us as readers to focus on routes of movement of Black persons and Black cultural production as opposed to focusing on roots of origin. However, scholar Julian Henriques argues Gilroy's focus on routes in itself is limiting to our understanding of the Black diaspora. Henriques introduces the idea of propagation of vibration, described as the diffusion of a spectrum of frequencies through a variety of media, in his paper Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session (Henriques, 221). This theory of the propagation of vibrations provides language to understand the diffusion of vibrations beyond the material (accessible) sonic and musical fields or the physical circulation of objects that can be tracked through Gilroy's routes. Henriques described vibrations as having corporeal (kinetic) and ethereal (meaning based) qualities that can be diffused similarly to the accessible fields, and argues that Gilroy's routes language does not encapsulate these frequencies of vibrations (224‚Äì226). When considered together, Henriques and Gilroy's writing suggests that these plethora of vibrational frequencies propagate through the Black diaspora as part of Black musical production, with the potential to be used as a mode of liberatory practice.

The aircraft crashed in a clover field near Unionville, in Putnam County, Missouri, killing all 45 crew and passengers on board. The investigation determined the cause of the crash was a suicide bombing committed as insurance fraud. Crash Continental Airlines Flight 11 memorial erected in Unionville, MissouriThomas G. Doty arrived at the gate after the doors had been closed. Although airline policy is that once the doors are closed they are not to be reopened, the doors were reopened and Doty was allowed to board.Memorial honors Continental Flight 11 Flight 11 departed O'Hare at 8:35 p.m. The flight was routine until just before the Mississippi River when it deviated from its filed flight plan to the north to avoid a line of thunderstorms. In the vicinity of Centerville, Iowa, the radar image of the aircraft disappeared from the scope of the Waverly, Iowa, Flight Following Service. At approximately 9:17 p.m. an explosion occurred in the right rear lavatory, resulting in separation of the tail section from the fuselage. The flight crew initiated the required emergency descent procedures and donned their smoke masks due to the dense fog that formed in the cabin immediately after decompression. At a separation of the tail, the remaining aircraft structure pitched nose down violently, causing the engines to tear off, after which it fell in uncontrolled gyrations. The fuselage of the Boeing 707, minus the aft 38 feet, and with part of the left and most of the right-wing intact, struck the ground, headed westerly down a 10-degree slope of an alfalfa field. Witnesses in and around both Cincinnati, Iowa and Unionville reported hearing loud and unusual noises at around 9:20 p.m., and two more saw a big flash or ball of fire in the sky. A B-47 Stratojet bomber flying out of Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, Kansas, was flying at the altitude of 26,500 feet in the vicinity of Kirksville, Missouri. The aircraft commander saw a bright flash in the sky forward of and above his aircraft's position. After referring to his navigation logs he estimated the flash to have occurred at 9:22 p.m. near the location where the last radar target of Flight 11 had been seen. Most of the fuselage was found near Unionville, but the engines and parts of the tail section and left wing were found up to six miles away from the main wreckage. Of the 45 individuals on board, 44 were dead when rescuers reached the crash site. One passenger, a 27-year-old man from Evanston, Illinois, was alive when rescuers found him in the wreckage, but he died of internal injuries at Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in Centerville, Iowa, an hour and a half after being rescued.\\"Unraveling the crash of Flight 11...\\", Sun Herald Investigation FBI agents discovered that Doty, a married man with a five-year-old daughter, had purchased a life insurance policy from Mutual of Omaha for $150,000, the maximum available; his death would also bring in another $150,000 in additional insurance (some purchased at the airport) and death benefits. Doty had recently been arrested for armed robbery, and was to soon face a preliminary hearing in the matter. Investigators determined that Doty had purchased six sticks of dynamite for 29 cents each shortly before the crash and were able to deduce that a bomb had been placed in the used towel bin of the right rear lavatory. Doty went into the lavatory with his briefcase and blew himself up, killing himself and everyone on board. His motive was so that his wife and daughter would be able to collect on the $300,000 of life insurance. His widow attempted to collect on the insurance, but, when Doty's death was ruled a suicide, the policy was voided, and the widow was only able to get a three dollar refund. Not talking publicly about the bombing, she died in 2008 at the age of 81.Passengers were mostly businessmen plus one bomber In July 2010, a memorial was erected near the crash site in Unionville, Missouri on the anniversary of the crash. In May 2012 a special 50th anniversary memorial service was held in Unionville.

He has been a faculty member of the University of Connecticut since 1975 and is best known for his scientific position on the possibility of time travel. Early life and education Mallett was born in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania, on March 30, 1945, and grew up in The Bronx in New York City, New York. When he was 10 years old, his father died at age 33 of a heart attack. About one year later, at age 11, Mallett found a Classics Illustrated comic book version of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. Inspired by this literature, he resolved to travel back in time to save his father. This idea became a lifelong obsession and the basis of his research into time travel. Mallett served in the United States Air Force for four years, during the Vietnam War. He returned to civilian life in 1966. This was the year that the science fiction TV series Star Trek started, in which he \\"quickly became immersed\\". During its first season, Mallett watched the episode The City on the Edge of Forever that \\"involved both the theme of time travel and lost love\\", and this became his favorite of the entire series. In 1973, when he was 28 years old, Mallett earned his Ph.D. in physics from Pennsylvania State University. In the same year, he received the Graduate Assistant Award for Excellence in Teaching. Career In 1975, Mallett was appointed a job as assistant professor at the University of Connecticut. He was promoted to the rank of full professor in 1987 and has received multiple academic honors and distinctions. His research interests include black holes, general relativity, quantum cosmology, relativistic astrophysics and time travel. As of 2018, he is a Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Connecticut. In 2007, Mallett's life story of pursuing a time machine was told on This American Life, Episode #324, Act 2. =Time travel research= For quite some time, Ronald Mallett has been working on plans for a time machine. This technology would be based upon a ring laser's properties in the context of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Mallett first argued that the ring laser would produce a limited amount of frame-dragging which might be measured experimentally, saying: > \\"In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, both matter and energy can > create a gravitational field. This means that the energy of a light beam can > produce a gravitational field. My current research considers both the weak > and strong gravitational fields produced by a single continuously > circulating unidirectional beam of light. In the weak gravitational field of > an unidirectional ring laser, it is predicted that a spinning neutral > particle, when placed in the ring, is dragged around by the resulting > gravitational field.\\" In a later paper, Mallett argued that at sufficient energies, the circulating laser might produce not just frame-dragging but also closed timelike curves (CTC), allowing time travel into the past: > For the strong gravitational field of a circulating cylinder of light, I > have found new exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for the > exterior and interior gravitational fields of the light cylinder. The > exterior gravitational field is shown to contain closed timelike lines. > The presence of closed timelike lines indicates the possibility of time > travel into the past. This creates the foundation for a time machine based > on a circulating cylinder of light. Funding for his program, now known as the Space-time Twisting by Light (STL) project, is progressing. Full details on the project, Mallett's theories, a list of upcoming public lectures and links to popular articles on his work can be found at the Mallett's faculty web page, and an illustration showing the concept on which Mallett has designed the time machine can be seen here. Mallett also wrote a book entitled, Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality, co-written with author Bruce Henderson, that was first published in 2006. In June 2008, motion picture director Spike Lee's production company announced it had acquired the film rights to Mallett's book. Lee is co-writing the movie script and directing the picture. In 2006, Mallett declared that time travel into the past would be possible in the 21st century and possibly within a decade. Mallett used general relativity to attempt to substantiate his claims. He created a prototype illustrating how lasers could be used to create a circulating beam of light that twists space and time, and has an equation which he supports his theory.  Criticism  In a paper by Ken Olum and Allen Everett the authors claimed to have found problems with Mallett's analysis. One of their objections is that the spacetime which Mallett used in his analysis contains a singularity even when the power to the laser is off and is not the spacetime that would be expected to arise naturally if the circulating laser were activated in previously empty space. Mallett has not offered a published response to Olum and Everett, but in his book Time Traveler he mentions that he was unable to directly model the optical fiber or photonic crystal which bends the light's path as it travels through it, so the light circulates around rather than moving in a straight line; as a substitute he chose to include a \\"line source\\" (a type of one- dimensional singularity) which would act as a \\"geometric constraint\\", bending spacetime in such a way that the light would circulate around on a helix- shaped path in a vacuum (for an older solution involving an infinite cylinder which creates CTCs, in this case due to the cylinder's own rotation rather than light circulating around it, see the Tipler cylinder). He notes that closed timelike curves are present in a spacetime containing both the line source and the circulating light, while they are not present in a spacetime containing only the line source, so that \\"the closed loops in time had been produced by the circulating flow of light, and not by the non-moving line source.\\" However, he does not provide any additional argument as to why we should expect to see closed timelike curves in a different spacetime where there is no line source, and where the light is caused to circulate due to passing through a physical substance like a photonic crystal rather than circulating in a vacuum due to the curved spacetime around the line source. Another objection by Olum and Everett is that even if Mallett's choice of spacetime were correct, the energy required to twist spacetime sufficiently would be huge, and that with lasers of the type in use today the ring would have to be much larger in circumference than the observable universe. At one point Mallett agreed that in a vacuum the energy requirements would be impractical but noted that the energy required goes down as the speed of light goes down. He then argued that if the light is slowed down significantly by passing it through a medium (as in the experiments of Lene Hau where light was passed through a superfluid and slowed to about 17 metres per second) the needed energy would be attainable. However, the physicist J. Richard Gott argues that slowing down light by passing it through a medium cannot be treated as equivalent to lowering the constant c (the speed of light in a vacuum) in the equations of General Relativity, saying: > One has to distinguish between the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a > constant, and through any other medium, which can vary enormously. Light > travels more slowly through water than through empty space, for example, but > this does not mean that you age more slowly while scuba diving or that it is > easier to twist space-time underwater. > The experiments done so far don't lower the speed of light in empty space; > they just lower the speed of light in a medium and should not make it easier > to twist space-time. Thus, it should not take any less mass-energy to form a > black hole or a time machine of a given size in such a medium. Later, Mallett abandoned the idea of using slowed light to reduce the energy, writing that, \\"For a time, I considered the possibility that slowing down light might increase the gravitational frame dragging effect of the ring laser ... Slow light, however, turned out to be helpful for my research.\\" Finally, Olum and Everett note a theorem proven by Stephen Hawking in a 1992 paper on the Chronology Protection Conjecture, which demonstrated that according to General Relativity it should be impossible to create closed timelike curves in any finite region that satisfies the weak energy condition, meaning that the region contains no exotic matter with negative energy. Mallett's original solution involved a spacetime containing a line source of infinite length, so it did not violate this theorem despite the absence of exotic matter, but Olum and Everett point out that the theorem \\"would, however, rule out the creation of CTC's in any finite-sized approximation to this spacetime.\\" Personal life Mallett is a member of both the American Physical Society and the National Society of Black Physicists; his brother is artist Keith Mallett.

It is commonly known as sea grapes (along with the related Caulerpa lentillifera) and is found in many areas of shallow sea around the world. There are a number of different forms and varieties, and one that appeared in the Mediterranean Sea in 1990, which is giving cause for concern as an invasive species. Taxonomy There are about 75 species of Caulerpa. Many of them exhibit polymorphism, showing different growth forms in different habitats which makes them difficult to identify. Caulerpa racemosa, C. laetevirens and C. peltata form a species complex. A number of forms and varieties for C. racemosa are listed but further study is needed to clarify their exact phylogenetic relationships.Overview of the Genus Caulerpa Proceedings of the International Caulerpa taxifolia Conference, 2002. Description A plant of C. racemosa consists of a number of branches linked to stolons which are anchored to the sandy substrate by rhizoids. The branches are a few centimetres apart and can grow to a height of . Many spherical or ovate side-shoots branch off these and give the seaweed its name of sea grapes.Sea grapes (Caulerpa racemosa) Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-08-20. Like other members of the order Bryopsidales, each C. racemosa plant consists of a single enormous cell with a large number of nuclei. The chloroplasts containing chlorophyll are free to migrate from any part of the organism to another and there is a network of fibrous proteins that helps movement of organelles.The Cell Biology of the Bryopsidales Retrieved 2011-08-18 Distribution Much-branched form of C. racemosa. C. racemosa is widely distributed in shallow temperate and tropical seas. In 1926 a new form of the alga was reported off Tunisia, possibly an immigrant from the Red Sea, and this later spread to much of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In 1990, a new, larger form with two vertical rows of branches on opposite sides of the stem was found off Libya. It spread widely, invading much of the Mediterranean Sea and becoming more widespread than the invasive species, Caulerpa taxifolia. It is known as C. racemosa var. cylindracea and may have originated from Australian waters.On the identity and origin of the Mediterranean invasive Caulerpa racemosa (Caulerpales, Chlorophyta). Retrieved 2011-08-22. In America C. racemosa is found in shallow water in the Caribbean Sea, around Bermuda and along the eastern seaboard of America from Florida to Brazil. Biology In the Mediterranean, growth begins in April when new stolons develop and erect branches start growing, and continue till December, after which the plants decline and become dormant.Grazing on Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea (Caulerpales, Chlorophyta) in the Mediterranean Sea by herbivorous fishes and sea urchins. Retrieved 2011-08-22. C. racemosa reproduces vegetatively by fragmentation. When pieces of the plant get broken off they develop into new plants. Small pieces of tissue only a few millimetres across are capable of doing this.Ceccherelli, G., L. Piazzi., 2001. Dispersal of Caulerpa racemosa fragments in the Mediterranean: lack of detachment time effect on Establishment. Bot. Mar. 44, 209-213. C. racemosa can also reproduce sexually and in so doing exhibits holocarpy. This means that all the organism's cytoplasm is used up in the creation of the gametes and only a husk remains at the site of the original plant. The plants are monoecious with male and female gametes being produced by the same plant and liberated into the water column where they unite to give spherical zygotes. These settle and after five weeks produce germ tubes which elongate and branch to develop into new plants.Culture studies on Caulerpa (caulerpales, chlorophyceae) III.

A study has been done on herbivores that graze on meadows of the invasive C. cylindracea in the north west of its range in the Mediterranean. The sea breams Boops boops and Sarpa salpa were found to feed on the algae, as did the sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and Sphaerechinus granularis. Other herbivores also grazed occasionally, but the total amount consumed was compensated for by the rapid growth of the plant and it was considered that these organisms were not likely to play a valuable role in bio-control of the plant. Caulerpa taxifolia and Caulerpa racemosa shows the great influence of substratum on their spatial distribution with a high colonization of the dead matte of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica Caulerpenyne content is lesser in Caulerpa racemosa than in the related and also invasive Lessepsian migrant Caulerpa taxifolia. Uses Like the closely related Caulerpa lentillifera, C. racemosa is edible. It is consumed widely in salads in Japan, Fiji, the Philippines, and Thailand. It is also eaten by local fishermen in Malaysia and Indonesia. They are rich in fiber, proteins, minerals (calcium and magnesium), folic acid, ascorbic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin B1 while also being low in fat.

Biography Born in Amberg, Bavaria, in 1914 into a military family, Baumann was a German nationalist. He belonged to the Catholic organization \\"New Germany\\". He started writing songs and poems when he was still an adolescent (e.g. \\"Macht keinen L√§rm\\", 1933). In 1934 he was noticed by the Hitler Youth leadership and invited to Berlin to work as a songwriter, author and journalist. In 1935, Baumann applied for membership in SS-Sturm 11/75. He joined the NSDAP in 1933.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, CD-Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, p. 260. Then, he served two years in the Wehrmacht.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 182f In the 1930s he wrote numerous poems, ballads and songs with various themes, both political and romantic. Some of his songs, such as his famous 1932 Es zittern die morschen Knochen (\\"The frail bones tremble\\", especially known for the line changed, \\"Denn heute da h√∂rt uns Deutschland/Und morgen die ganze Welt\\", in English \\"For today Germany hears us/But tomorrow the whole world shall\\", where da h√∂rt was frequently replaced by geh√∂rt, \\"belongs to\\") which became the official marching song of the Reichsarbeitsdienst in 1935, were enormously popular within the National Socialist movement, and are naturally no longer accepted today. Others, like the ballad \\"Hohe Nacht der klaren Sterne\\", were of less Nazi content and are to some degree still sung today.though that, too, is problematic especially in that it intended to be a replacement for Christmas carols purposely void of any specifically religious themes The song collections Unser Trommelbube, Wir z√ºnden das Feuer, Der helle Tag and others date from that period. In September 1938, when Baumann visited Passau, the Donau-Zeitung informed its readers that Baumann was on his way to Bulgaria. The newspaper also announced Baumann's latest contribution to Bayerische Ostmark, where he praised Passau.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 182f In February 1939, Baumann returned to Veste Oberhaus at Passau, where he recited from his new play R√ºdiger von Bechelaren.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 201f In July 1940, the play was performed there for the second time.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 252ff At the outset of World War II he joined the German army in 1939 and spent most of the war on the Eastern front in a propaganda unit (Propagandakompanie 501). Continuing his work as much as possible throughout the war, he wrote two collections of war poems (Briefgedichte, 1941 and Der Wandler Krieg in 1942). In December 1942, Baumann returned to Passau again. This time, to marry Elisabeth Zoglmann at Veste Oberhaus. Among his guests was Hans Carossa.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp.272 f In April 1944, the Donau-Zeitung reported about a rally where Hans Baumann addressed Passau Hitler Youth.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, p. 280 After the war and a period spent in a prisoner of war camp, he distanced himself from the policies of the National Socialist government and made a remarkable comeback as one of the most popular contemporary writers for children and teenagers. His novels dealt with natural and historical themes (e.g. I Marched with Hannibal, The Sons of the Steppe, Barnabas the Dancing Bear, The Barque of the Brothers, Son of Columbus, In the Land of Ur) and won a number of international prizes, including the New York Herald Tribune prize for the best children's book in 1968 and the Batchelder Award in 1971. They have been compared to the novels of Rosemary Sutcliff, his earlier books described as major works: \\"long complicated stories, full of difficult concepts and problems of psychology\\".Marcus Crouch, Treasure Seekers and Borrowers: Children's books in Britain 1900-1960, The Library Association, 1962, p 127 His attempted strides into other literature genres were less successful as he was viewed with suspicion by the post-war German literary and political circles because of his past NS involvement. In 1962 he was at a center of a literary controversy when forced to return the prestigious Gerhard-Hauptmann Prize received in 1959 for his drama Im Zeichen der Fische (written under a pseudonym), after his real identity was revealed. Baumann was also an accomplished translator, having translated numerous books from Russian to German, including works by Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Anna Akhmatova and others. His own work was translated into more than twenty languages.

It is owned by J & A Mitchell & Company, which also owns the Glengyle Distillery, the oldest independent bottler, William Cadenheads, and several blended scotch labels. Licensed in 1828, Springbank is one of the last surviving producers of single malt whiskies in Campbeltown, an area that once had over thirty active distilleries. The distillery produces three types of peated and unpeated malt whisky that it bottles under three distinct brands. The majority of its distillate is bottled as a single malt, with a small percentage sold to larger blenders or ending up in one of J&A; Mitchell's own blended scotch labels, such as Campbeltown Loch. Malt variants Springbank produces three variants from its distillery by tweaking the production process at various stages. None of the malts produced at this distillery is chill-filtered, and they do not contain colorants, such as caramel E150. *Springbank Single Malt is a 10-year- old, medium-peated and distilled two and a half times. A cask-strength 12-year bottling, as well as 15-year, 18-year, and 21-year bottlings are produced. *Longrow Single Malt is a highly peated, double-distilled whisky, named for a mothballed distillery of the same name. The standard bottling bears no age statement, with age-statement-bearing editions experimenting with different casks such as tokaji and Barolo. The Red edition (released annually) uses a different type of wine cask each year such as Pinot Noir, Malbec, and Port. Longrow won Best Campbeltown Single Malt at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards. *Hazelburn Single Malt, the newest variety, was first distilled in 1997 and since bottled as a 10-year-old. In 2009 a 12-year-old variety was released. Hazelburn is a triple-distilled, non-peated whisky. Hazelburn is also named for a mothballed distillery near the Springbank one. Production Springbank is the only Scottish distillery to perform every step in the whisky making process, from malting the barley to bottling the spirit. Several distilleries malt some percentage of their barley and source the balance from an industrial malting facility, such as Port Ellen; however, Springbank maintains a traditional malting floor that provides for 100% of their distillate. Springbank then dries its barley using peat sourced from Islay for various lengths of time (30 to 48 hours) to imbue different levels of the smoky flavor associated with Scottish whisky. Unpeated malt becomes Hazelburn, whereas medium-peated and heavily peated malts become the distillery's Springbank and Longrow labels, respectively. Once dried, the barley is ground into grist, mixed with warm water in a cast iron open-top mash tun to extract the barley sugars, the wort is cooled, then pumped into six boatskin larch washbacks to ferment for 72-110 hours and produce what's now called 'wash'. This long fermentation period allows for the formation of esters that shape the fruity secondary characteristics that help make the identity of the final product. The alcoholic wash goes on to the stills for the distillation phase. Springbank uses three copper pot stills (one using direct-fire, the other two using steam) used in various combinations to produce its malts: Hazelburn (unpeated) is triple-distilled to produce a lighter, higher ABV end product of 74-76% ABV. The medium-peated Springbank is two and a half times distilled: during the distillation process some of the low wines are collected before the second distillation, and then mixed back into the feints for another distillation. This means that some parts of the spirit have been through the stills twice and some parts three times; hence, the \\"half\\" distillation. The amount of spirit that goes through the \\"half\\" time is judged by the stillman as the process takes place to ensure consistency. It emerged at around 71-72% ABV. The heavily peated Longrow is double-distilled leaving a heavier, smoky distillate that leaves the still at 68% ABV. The distillery employs traditional worm-tub condensers, which limit copper contact and make for a richer, oilier spirit. The spirit is then aged primarily in ex-bourbon and ex- sherry casks, although Springbank experiments with a wide range of casks to produce secondary characteristics that accent its house style.

He served as Assistant District Attorney of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from 1957 to 1964, a member of the Pittsburgh City Council from 1966 to 1970, the 54th Mayor of Pittsburgh from 1970 to 1977, United States Deputy Attorney General during the Carter administration from 1977 to 1978, and County Commissioner of Allegheny County from 1984 to 1996.  Early life and education  Flaherty was born and raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh. He served in the United States Air Force from 1943 to 1946 during World War II, reaching the rank of Captain. Flaherty was honorably discharged and used the G.I. Bill to become the first in his family to attend college. He graduated from Carlow University in three years, then graduated cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association. He then established his own legal practice which included the Pittsburgh Steelers among his clients. In 1971, he earned a Masters in Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. Career In 1965, Flaherty led the Democratic Party ticket when he was elected to the Pittsburgh City Council. He was elected mayor in the 1969 Pittsburgh mayoral election, defeating Judge Harry A. Kramer in the primary election. In the general election Flaherty beat the Republican, John K. Tabor. Four years later, in the 1973 election, Flaherty was re-elected by winning the Democratic primary, the Republican primary, and the Constitutional party primaries. During his seven years as mayor, Flaherty reduced the payroll by almost one third, balanced the budget each year without a tax increase or any new taxes, reduced the taxes by two mils, eliminated the wage tax for three years, and left office with a substantial budget surplus and taxes lower than when he took office. He increased the amount of street repaving from less than ten miles in 1969 to more than 100 miles in his last year in office. This was accomplished in part by using city personnel and a city owned asphalt plant instead of continuing to contract out the work.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 19, 1979, page A3. Flaherty was featured in a book on city governing called City Money: Political Processes, Fiscal Strain, and Retrenchment by Terry N. Clark and Laura Crowley Ferguson, Columbia University Press 1983. Throughout most of his tenure as mayor, Flaherty successfully opposed the Early Action Program, a project which included the development of Skybus. At the end of his tenure, the dispute over this program was resolved by a study performed through the agreement of Flaherty, the county commissioners, representatives of labor and the City Council. The study recommended the abandonment of Skybus and the use, instead, of steel wheel on steel rail technology. This recommendation was adopted by the County transit agency.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, p. 1, March 5, 1976. Although he was criticized in the African-American community for opposing forced busing, his administration was a leader in recruiting minorities and women for top administrative posts and throughout the work force. One of his early appointments was former Duquesne University and Boston Celtics basketball star Chuck Cooper, as Director of Parks and Recreation. He eliminated the Police Tactical Police Force unit which was associated by African Americans with racism during the late 1960s and especially the disturbances that erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Pittsburgh was the first major city in Pennsylvania to adopt a successful affirmative action program for minorities and women. =Deputy Attorney General= Flaherty was a prominent supporter of Jimmy Carter during the 1976 United States presidential election. After Carter was elected, he nominated Flaherty to serve as the 16th United States Deputy Attorney General from April 12, 1977 to 1978. Flaherty served under Attorney General Griffin Bell, and was succeeded in office by Benjamin Civiletti. After Flaherty left the Carter administration, he supported the Ted Kennedy 1980 presidential campaign. =Senate and gubernatorial elections= Flaherty was the Democratic Party nominee for United States Senate in 1974, losing to incumbent Republican Senator Richard Schweiker in the general election. Flaherty was also the Democratic Party's nominee for governor of Pennsylvania in 1978, losing in the general election to Republican Richard Thornburgh, who would go on to become United States Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush. In 1980, he again ran statewide as the Democratic nominee for United States Senate. Flaherty was defeated by Republican Arlen Specter, winning 48% of the vote. =County Commissioner= Flaherty was elected to the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners in November 1983. He supported longtime Commissioner and fellow Democrat Tom Foerster's long-term goal of building a world class airport in Allegheny County. This became a reality in 1992 when a first class airport was opened and later named its terminal in Foerster's honor. He supported Foerster and served as Foerster's intermediary with the City of Pittsburgh to build a new county jail to replace a facility which was designed by famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson in the 1800s. The team of Foerster as chairman and Pete Flaherty as the second Democrat on the three member Board of County Commissioners served together for three four year terms. Both Foerster and Flaherty were defeated for re-election in 1995. Death Flaherty died on April 21, 2005 in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania at the age of 80. He is interred in the Roman Catholic Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Obituary, post-gazette.com; accessed July 11, 2018.

It is designed to carry heavy and oversized loads in such a way that the load makes up part of the car. The load is suspended between the two ends of the cars by lifting arms; the lifting arms are connected to an assembly of span bolsters that distribute the weight of the load and the lifting arm over many wheels. When a Schnabel car is empty, the two lifting arms are connected and the car can usually operate at normal freight train speeds. Some Schnabel cars include hydraulic equipment that will either lift or horizontally shift the load while in transit (at very low speeds) to clear obstructions along the car's route. As of 2012, there were 31 Schnabel cars operating in Europe, 30 in North America, 25 in Asia, and one in Australia. The largest Schnabel car in public railroads operation, reporting number WECX 801, was completed in 2012 by Kasgro Railcar for Westinghouse Nuclear and is used in North America primarily to transport reactor containment vessels. It has 36 axles (18 for each half). Each half contains nine trucks which are connected by a complex system of span bolsters. Its tare (unloaded) weight is and has a load limit of for a maximum gross weight of . WECX 801 has the ability to shift its load vertically and up to laterally on either side of the car's center line. When empty, this car measures long; for comparison, a conventional boxcar currently operating on North American railroads has a single two-axle truck at each end of the car, measures long and has a capacity of . The train's speed is limited to when WECX 801 is empty, but only when loaded and requires a crew of six operators in addition to the train's crew. The word Schnabel is from German Tragschnabelwagen, meaning \\"carrying-beak-wagon\\", because of the usually tapered shape of the lifting arms, resembling a bird's beak. In World War II the German Wehrmacht used Schnabel cars for transporting the Karl-Ger√§t heavy- calibre (54 cm and 60 cm calibre) siege mortars. These were self-propelled with a continuous track suspension chassis of substantial length to maneuver into a firing position over a short range, but depended on a pair of purpose- designed Schnabel cars for long-range transport by rail.

Headstone of Anne Royall in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington DC Early life She was born Anne Newport in Baltimore, Maryland. Anne grew up in the western frontier of Pennsylvania before her impoverished and fatherless family migrated south to the mountains of western Virginia. There, at 16, she and her widowed mother were employed as servants in the household of William Royall, a wealthy American Revolution major, freemason and deist who lived at Sweet Springs in Monroe County (now in West Virginia). Royall, a learned gentleman farmer twenty years Anne's senior, took an interest in her and arranged for her education, introducing her to the works of Shakespeare and Voltaire, and allowing her to make free use of his extensive library. Marriage Anne and William Royall were wed in 1797. The couple lived comfortably together for fifteen years until his death in 1812. His death touched off litigation between Anne and Royall's relatives, who claimed that they were never legally married and that his will leaving her most of his property was a forgery. After seven years, the will was nullified and she was left virtually penniless. Career in journalism Anne spent the next four years traveling around Alabama, writing letters to a friend about the evolution of the young state that were eventually turned into a manuscript published as Letters from Alabama. She also penned a novel called The Tennessean before setting off for Washington D.C. She became an \\"itinerant storyteller\\", according to biographer Jeff Biggers, traveling first to the new state of Alabama, where she wrote the initial of her series of \\"Black Books\\". The popular volumes were \\"informative but sardonic portraits of the elite and their denizens from Mississippi to Maine\\". In an expanding nation, Royall's incisive descriptions of American life and individual Americans from many walks of life were popular reading and a sharp contrast to the sentimental literature penned by other female writers. She arrived in Washington in 1824 to petition for a federal pension as the widow of a veteran; under the pension law at the time, widows had to plead their cases before Congress. She remained unsatisfied until Congress passed a new pension law in 1848. Even then, her husband's family claimed most of her pension money. While in Washington attempting to secure a pension, Anne caught President John Quincy Adams during one of his usual early morning naked swims in the Potomac River. It is commonly recounted, but apocryphal, that she gathered the president's clothes and sat on them until he answered her questions, earning her the first presidential interview ever granted to a woman.Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848 Adams afterward supported Anne's petition for a pension. He also invited her to visit his wife, Louisa Adams, at their home in Washington, which she did. Mrs. Adams gave her a white shawl when she journeyed north to obtain proof of her husband's military service. Afterward Anne toured New England, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts, all the while taking copious notes and using her Masonic connections to help fund her travels. In Boston, she stopped in on former President John Adams to give him an update on his son and daughter-in- law. Then, in 1826, at 57, she published her notes in a book titled Sketches of History, Life and Manners in the United States. Her previous manuscript The Tennessean would follow a year later. The caustic observations in her books and public stances on issues caused a stir and earned her some powerful enemies. She was derided as an eccentric scold, a virago, and (in the words of one newspaper editor) \\"a literary wild-cat from the backwoods\\". In 1829, Anne Royall returned to Washington, D.C. and began living on Capitol Hill, near a fire house. The firehouse, which had been built with federal money, had been allowing a small Presbyterian congregation to use its facilities for their services. Royall, who had long made Presbyterians a particular object of scorn in her writing, objected to their using the building as a blurring of the lines between church and state. She also claimed that some of the congregation's children began throwing stones at her windows. One member of the congregation began praying silently beneath her window and others visited her in an attempt to convert her, she claimed. Royall responded to their taunts with cursing and was arrested. She was tried and convicted of being a \\"public nuisance, a common brawler and a common scold\\". Although a ducking stool had been constructed nearby, the court ruled that the traditional common law punishment of ducking for a scold was obsolete, and she was instead fined $10. Two reporters from Washington's newspaper, The National Intelligencer, paid the fine. Embarrassed by the incident, Royall left Washington to continue traveling. Back in Washington in 1831, she published a newspaper from her home with the help of a friend, Sally Stack. The paper, Paul Pry, exposed political corruption and fraud. Sold as single issues, it contained her editorials, letters to the editor and her responses, and advertisements. It was published until 1836, when it was succeeded by The Huntress. Royall hired orphans to set the type and faced constant financial woes, which were exacerbated when postmasters refused to deliver her issues to subscribers, until her death at 85 in 1854, bringing an end to her 30-year news career. She is buried in the Congressional Cemetery.http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/Q-R.pdf Congressional Cemetery Interment Records References Further readingOriginal text based on An Uncommon Scold by Cynthia Earman ‚Äì Retrieved May 2004 from the Library of Congress' online archives *Jeff Biggers (2017), The Trials of a Scold: The Incredible True Story of Writer Anne Royall, St. Martin's Press/Thomas Dunne Books. *Elizabeth J.

In an interview in 2008, Ramesh Chauhan of Parle Bisleri revealed that he had approached the owners of Duke's Lemonade, requesting them to share the formula for the drink with the promise not to make it in India, which was turned down. Chauhan decided to come up with his own formula, which he launched under the Limca brand in 1977.

In order to carry out these intentions France and Great Britain are at one in encouraging and assisting the establishment of indigenous Governments and administrations in Syria and, Mesopotamia, now liberated by the Allies, and in the territories the liberation of which they are engaged in securing and recognising these as soon as they are actually established. Far from wishing to impose on the populations of these regions any particular institutions they are only concerned to ensure by their support and by adequate assistance the regular working of Governments and administrations freely chosen by the populations themselves. To secure impartial and equal justice for all, to facilitate the economic development of the country by inspiring and encouraging local initiative, to favour the diffusion of education, to put an end to dissensions that have too long been taken advantage of by Turkish policy, such is the policy which the two Allied Governments uphold in the liberated territories.Report of a Committee set up to consider certain correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon (his majesty's high commissioner in egypt) and the Sharif of Mecca in 1915 and 1916, Annex I.

In pursuit of those intentions, France and Great Britain agree to further and assist in the setting up of indigenous governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia, which have already been liberated by the Allies, as well as in those territories which they have been endeavouring to liberate, and to recognize them as soon as they are actually set up. Far from wishing to impose this or that system upon the populations of those regions, their [i.e., France's and Great Britain's] only concern is to offer such support and efficacious help as will ensure the smooth working of the governments and administrations which those populations will have elected of their own free will to have; to secure impartial and equal justice for all; to facilitate the economic development of the country by promoting and encouraging local initiative; to foster the spread of education; and to put an end to the dissensions which Turkish policy has for so long exploited. Such is the task which the two Allied Powers wish to under-take in the liberated territories.Special note by Sir Abdur Rahman in 1947 before the UN, APPENDIX III.(I), p.27; also here UNSCOP, 3 September 1947 (doc.nr.

For about two decades, Brani Naval Base was the RSN's only base. An expansion of the fleet in the early 1980s meant that more space was needed for the fleet and its shore infrastructure. However, this was not possible as the land around Brani was reserved for use by the port authority to develop container facilities. As a result, Tuas was selected as the site for a second naval base. Better utilisation of space at TNB resulted in two and a half times more berthing space than Brani, even though TNB only has a shoreline of 850 m (0.5 mi). Provision was also made for recreational facilities. Automation was incorporated into the design of TNB to reduce manpower requirements, such as mechanical ramps for the loading and unloading of vehicles and an automatic storage and retrieval system. It also has a floating dock which can lift 600 tonnes and transfer a ship from sea to land to facilitate repairs and maintenance. Currently, the Littoral Mission Vessels, the missile corvettes, patrol vessels and mine counter-measures vessels are based at TNB.

It is located in the town of Salasar, on National Highway 65 near Sujangarh in Churu district, Rajasthan. The temple of Balaji, founded by a farmer is situated in the middle of Salasar and attracts innumerable worshippers throughout the year. On Chaitra Purnima and Ashvin Purnima, large fairs are organized that attract devotees as they pay homage to the deity. Salasar Balaji is in the religious circuit that includes the pilgrim centers of Rani Sati Temple, Jeen Mata and Khatushyamji, which are located close to it. Initially a small construction, the temple of Salasar Balaji is now considered to be a Shakti Sthal (a shrine) and Swayambhu (self- creation) by faith, belief, miracles and wish fulfilments of the devotees. Legend History claims the site was discovered by a Jat farmer of Asota village in Nagaur district of Rajasthan in samvat 1811 (1754 AD). The farmer hit an item in the ground while plowing his field and discovered it to be an idol covered with sand. His wife arrived and cleaned it the idol with her saree before determining it to be of Lord Hanuman, also known as Balaji in northern parts of India (not to be confused with Lord Vishnu worshipped as Balaji in southern parts of India). The news of the appearance of Balaji soon spread in the Asota village and reached the Thakur of Asota. That night Balaji appeared in Thakur's dream and ordered him to send the idol to Salasar in the Churu district. The same night a devotee of Lord Hanuman, Mohandas ji Maharaj of Salasar saw Lord Hanuman or Balaji in his dream too. Balaji told him about the idol of Asota. He immediately sent a message to the Thakur of Asota. The thakur was surprised to discover that Mohandas ji knew even minor details without coming to Asota. The idol was sent to Salasar and was consecrated at the place presently known as Salasar Dham. Temple =Deity= The principal deity of the temple is Lord Hanuman who receives veneration along with other deities. Of the idols of Lord Hanuman found in India, that at Salasar Balaji is unique because it has a round face with mustache and beard. It is believed that drinking water of the wells of the Salasar is due to the blessings of the Balaji. =Construction= The temple was constructed in 1754 AD. Inspired by a strange dream in which Balaji featured, the founder of the temple, Mohandas ji Maharaj, constructed a mud and stone temple initially with the help of craftsmen Noora and Dau of Fatehpur Shekhawati. The place was later developed into a concrete temple with the help of the successor of Sikar Jagirdar Rao Devi Singh who contributed to the construction of the temple as he was once saved from the loot by Dungji-Jawaharji by the blessings of Balaji. Later, inspired by Mohandas' devotion towards Balaji, his descendants Kaniram and Ishwardas developed and renovated the temple which took the present form of a large temple complex. A patta of the land was made in the name of Balaji in the presence of Shobhasar Thakur Dhiraj Singh, Salasar Thakur Salim Singh and elders of Tetarwal Jats. =Architecture= The temple was constructed over a period of about two years using bricks, stones, cement, lime mortar, and white marble. While white marble is used extensively throughout, the entire circulatory path, the Sabha Mandap (prayer hall) and the Sanctum Sanctorum are covered with artistic works of gold and silver. The vestibule, the doors and the utensils used in worshipping are made of silver. The main gate is made up of carving works of white marble. The temple shrine and the sanctum sanctorum are decorated with floral patterns and other kinds of mosaic works done in gold and silver. =Administration= While the worship of the deity is managed by the Brahmins priests from the Dadhich clan who are descendants of Mohandas ji's sister, the temple is managed and maintained by the trust Hanuman Sewa Samiti. They also look after the management of the fairs, social works, public and private facilities such as the maintenance of road, water supply, charitable hospitals, in the village. Over the years, there have been many Dharamshalas and restaurants constructed here to stay and eat comfortably. =Timings= The temple is open to devotees from early morning 4:00 am till 10:00 pm in the night. However, the temple is not closed at all on some special occasions such as Hanuman Jayanti. Religious aspects Thousands of visitors choose to come on feet, while some on prostrated movement showing their intensity of devotion for Balaji. =Rituals= Coconut tying Of many rituals and traditions performed at the temple, the most widely followed is the tying of coconuts with moli (sacred red threads) in the temple premises by a large number of devotees. It is widely believed that such practice helps them to fulfill their wishes if done with sincere faith. The practice was originated by the Jagirdar of Sikar, Rao Raja Devi Singh. Devi Singh did not have a son. He heard about Balaji and came to this place and tied a coconut on a tree to fulfill his wish of having a son. He was later blessed with a handicapped son Rao Raja Laxman Singh after ten months. Thus the custom of tying coconuts to fulfill wishes continues at the temple from that time onwards. Savamani The other widely followed practice is the offering of food (weighing up to 50 kg) by the devotees to their deity, referred to as Savamani. The term \\"Savamani\\" is derived from the word \\"Sava\\" meaning one and a quarter in Hindi and the word \\"Mun\\" or \\"Maund\\", a mass unit weighing about 40 kg; thus adding the total up to 50 kg. Though the food is mostly prepared by the cooks of the temple kitchens, the process is now being outsourced to several independent shopkeepers & food-caterers due to the increasing number of offerings every day. Several delicacies like Dal, Baati, Churma, Boondi, Peda & Laddu is chosen for Savamani. The food after first being offered to the deity, is later used as part of family celebrations, distributed over to family and relatives or donated to the needy. =Activities= Some of the regular activities of the temple include: *Regular worships of the deity *Performing Aarti on fixed time slots *Feasting of Brahmins and other mendicants *Recitation of Ramayan *Recitation of Kirtan & Bhajans *Arrangement for Savamanis *Recitation of Sundar Kand on every Tuesday in a union by the singers. *Arrangement of stay for the visitors Festivals and fairsSri Hanuman Jayanti / Chaitra shukla Chaturdashi and Purnima. *Ashvin Shukla Chaturdashi and Purnima *Bhaadra Shukla Chaturdashi and Purnima References External linksTemple Profile Hanuman temples Hindu temples in Rajasthan Tourist attractions in Churu district Rajasthani culture ","title":"Salasar Balaji"},{"id":"1849799","text":"The repeating decimal continues infinitely. In mathematics, 0.999... (also written as 0., among other ways) denotes the repeating decimal consisting of infinitely many 9s after the decimal point (and one 0 before it). This repeating decimal represents the smallest number no less than every decimal number in the sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...).This definition is equivalent to the definition of decimal numbers as the limits of their summed components, which, in the case of 0.999..., is the limit of the sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...). The equivalence is due to bounded increasing sequences having their limit always equal to their least upper bound. This number is equal to 1. In other words, \\"0.999...\\" and \\"1\\" represent the same number. There are many ways of showing this equality, from intuitive arguments to mathematically rigorous proofs. The technique used depends on the target audience, background assumptions, historical context, and preferred development of the real numbers, the system within which 0.999... is commonly defined. (In other systems, 0.999... can have the same meaning, a different definition, or be undefined.) More generally, every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations (for example, 8.32 and 8.31999...), which is a property of all base representations. The utilitarian preference for the terminating decimal representation contributes to the misconception that it is the only representation. For this and other reasonssuch as rigorous proofs relying on non-elementary techniques, properties, or disciplinessome people can find the equality sufficiently counterintuitive that they question or reject it. This has been the subject of several studies in mathematics education. Elementary proof The Archimedean property: any point x before the finish line lies between two of the points P_n (inclusive). There is an elementary proof of the equation , which uses just the mathematical tools of comparison and addition of (finite) decimal numbers, without any reference to more advanced topics such as series, limits, formal construction of real numbers, etc. The proof, an exercise given by , is a direct formalization of the intuitive fact that, if one draws 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. on the number line there is no room left for placing a number between them and 1. The meaning of the notation 0.999... is the least point on the number line lying to the right of all of the numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. Because there is ultimately no room between 1 and these numbers, the point 1 must be this least point, and so . =Intuitive explanation= If one places 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. on the number line, one sees immediately that all these points are to the left of 1, and that they get closer and closer to 1. More precisely, the distance from 0.9 to 1 is , the distance from 0.99 to 1 is , and so on. The distance to 1 from the th point (the one with 9s after the decimal point) is . Therefore, if 1 were not the smallest number greater than 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., then there would be a point on the number line that lies between 1 and all these points. This point would be at a positive distance from 1 that is less than for every integer . In the standard number systems (the rational numbers and the real numbers), there is no positive number that is less than for all n. This is (one version of) the Archimedean property, which can be proven to hold in the system of rational numbers. Therefore, 1 is the smallest number that is greater than all 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., and so . =Discussion on completeness= Part of what this argument shows is that there is a least upper bound of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.: a smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence. One of the axioms of the real number system is the completeness axiom, which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound. This least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions: the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations. The argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid, because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound, and that this least upper bound is equal to one. =Formal proof= The previous explanation is not a proof, as one cannot define properly the relationship between a number and its representation as a point on the number line. For the accuracy of the proof, the number , with nines after the decimal point, is denoted . Thus , , , and so on. As , with digits after the decimal point, the addition rule for decimal numbers implies and for every positive integer . One has to show that 1 is the smallest number that is no less than all . For this, it suffices to prove that, if a number is not larger than 1 and no less than all , then . So let such that for every positive integer . Therefore, This implies that the difference between and is less than the inverse of any positive integer. Thus this difference must be zero, and, thus ; that is This proof relies on the fact that zero is the only nonnegative number that is less than all inverses of integers, or equivalently that there is no number that is larger than every integer. This is the Archimedean property, that is verified for rational numbers and real numbers. Real numbers may be enlarged into number systems, such as hyperreal numbers, with infinitely small numbers (infinitesimals) and infinitely large numbers (infinite numbers). When using such systems, notation 0.999... is generally not used, as there is no smallest number that is no less than all . (This is implied by the fact that implies ). Algebraic arguments The matter of overly simplified illustrations of the equality is a subject of pedagogical discussion and critique. discusses the argument that, in elementary school, one is taught that , so, ignoring all essential subtleties, \\"multiplying\\" this identity by gives . He further says that this argument is unconvincing, because of an unresolved ambiguity over the meaning of the equals sign; a student might think, \\"It surely does not mean that the number 1 is identical to that which is meant by the notation .\\" Most undergraduate mathematics majors encountered by Byers feel that while is \\"very close\\" to 1 on the strength of this argument, with some even saying that it is \\"infinitely close\\", they are not ready to say that it is equal to 1\\\\. discusses how \\"this argument gets its force from the fact that most people have been indoctrinated to accept the first equation without thinking\\", but also suggests that the argument may lead skeptics to question this assumption. Byers also presents the following argument. Let Students who did not accept the first argument sometimes accept the second argument, but, in Byers' opinion, still have not resolved the ambiguity, and therefore do not understand the representation for infinite decimals. , presenting the same argument, also state that it does not explain the equality, indicating that such an explanation would likely involve concepts of infinity and completeness. , citing , also conclude that the treatment of the identity based on such arguments as these, without the formal concept of a limit, is premature. The same argument is also given by , who notes that skeptics may question whether is cancellable that is, whether it makes sense to subtract from both sides. Analytic proofs Since the question of 0.999... does not affect the formal development of mathematics, it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of real analysis. One requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in decimal notation, consisting of an optional sign, a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part, a decimal separator, and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part. For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives, so a decimal expansion has the form The fraction part, unlike the integer part, is not limited to finitely many digits. This is a positional notation, so for example the digit 5 in 500 contributes ten times as much as the 5 in 50, and the 5 in 0.05 contributes one tenth as much as the 5 in 0.5. =Infinite series and sequences= Perhaps the most common development of decimal expansions is to define them as sums of infinite series. In general: \\\\right) + b_2\\\\left({\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}\\\\right)^2 + b_3\\\\left({\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}\\\\right)^3 + b_4\\\\left({\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}\\\\right)^4 + \\\\cdots .}} For 0.999... one can apply the convergence theorem concerning geometric series:Rudin p. 61, Theorem 3.26; J. Stewart p. 706 Since 0.999... is such a sum with a = 9 and common ratio r = , the theorem makes short work of the question: \\\\right)^2 + 9\\\\left({\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}\\\\right)^3 + \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{9\\\\left({\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}\\\\right)}{1-{\\\\tfrac{1}{10}}} = 1.}} This proof appears as early as 1770 in Leonhard Euler's Elements of Algebra.Euler p. 170 base-4 fraction sequence (.3, .33, .333, ...) converging to 1. The sum of a geometric series is itself a result even older than Euler. A typical 18th- century derivation used a term-by-term manipulation similar to the algebraic proof given above, and as late as 1811, Bonnycastle's textbook An Introduction to Algebra uses such an argument for geometric series to justify the same maneuver on 0.999...Grattan-Guinness p. 69; Bonnycastle p. 177 A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; it can be found in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.For example, J. Stewart p. 706, Rudin p. 61, Protter and Morrey p. 213, Pugh p. 180, J.B. Conway p. 31 A sequence (x0, x1, x2, ...) has a limit x if the distance x ‚àí xn becomes arbitrarily small as n increases. The statement that 0.999... = 1 can itself be interpreted and proven as a limit:The limit follows, for example, from Rudin p. 57, Theorem 3.20e. For a more direct approach, see also Finney, Weir, Giordano (2001) Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals 10ed, Addison-Wesley, New York. Section 8.1, example 2(a), example 6(b). {}}{=} \\\\ \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}0.\\\\underbrace{ 99\\\\ldots9 }_{n} \\\\ \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \\\\ \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{k = 1}^n\\\\frac{9}{10^k} \\\\ = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{10^n}\\\\right) = 1-\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{10^n} = 1 \\\\, - \\\\, 0 = 1.}} The first two equalities can be interpreted as symbol shorthand definitions. The remaining equalities can be proven. The last step, that ‚Üí 0 as n ‚Üí ‚àû, is often justified by the Archimedean property of the real numbers. This limit-based attitude towards 0.999... is often put in more evocative but less precise terms. For example, the 1846 textbook The University Arithmetic explains, \\".999 +, continued to infinity = 1, because every annexation of a 9 brings the value closer to 1\\"; the 1895 Arithmetic for Schools says, \\"when a large number of 9s is taken, the difference between 1 and .99999... becomes inconceivably small\\".Davies p. 175; Smith and Harrington p. 115 Such heuristics are often incorrectly interpreted by students as implying that 0.999... itself is less than 1. =Nested intervals and least upper bounds= Nested intervals: in base 3, 1 = 1.000... = 0.222... The series definition above is a simple way to define the real number named by a decimal expansion. A complementary approach is tailored to the opposite process: for a given real number, define the decimal expansion(s) to name it. If a real number x is known to lie in the closed interval [0, 10] (i.e., it is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10), one can imagine dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints: [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], and so on up to [9, 10]. The number x must belong to one of these; if it belongs to [2, 3] then one records the digit \\"2\\" and subdivides that interval into [2, 2.1], [2.1, 2.2], ..., [2.8, 2.9], [2.9, 3]. Continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of nested intervals, labeled by an infinite sequence of digits b0, b1, b2, b3, ..., and one writes In this formalism, the identities 1 = 0.999... and 1 = 1.000... reflect, respectively, the fact that 1 lies in both [0, 1] and [1, 2], so one can choose either subinterval when finding its digits. To ensure that this notation does not abuse the \\"=\\" sign, one needs a way to reconstruct a unique real number for each decimal. This can be done with limits, but other constructions continue with the ordering theme.Beals p. 22; I. Stewart p. 34 One straightforward choice is the nested intervals theorem, which guarantees that given a sequence of nested, closed intervals whose lengths become arbitrarily small, the intervals contain exactly one real number in their intersection. So b0.b1b2b3... is defined to be the unique number contained within all the intervals [b0, b0 \\\\+ 1], [b0.b1, b0.b1 \\\\+ 0.1], and so on. 0.999... is then the unique real number that lies in all of the intervals [0, 1], [0.9, 1], [0.99, 1], and [0.99...9, 1] for every finite string of 9s. Since 1 is an element of each of these intervals, 0.999... = 1.Bartle and Sherbert pp. 60‚Äì62; Pedrick p. 29; Sohrab p. 46 The Nested Intervals Theorem is usually founded upon a more fundamental characteristic of the real numbers: the existence of least upper bounds or suprema. To directly exploit these objects, one may define b0.b1b2b3... to be the least upper bound of the set of approximants {b0, b0.b1, b0.b1b2, ...}.Apostol pp. 9, 11‚Äì12; Beals p. 22; Rosenlicht p. 27 One can then show that this definition (or the nested intervals definition) is consistent with the subdivision procedure, implying 0.999... = 1 again. Tom Apostol concludes, Proofs from the construction of the real numbers Some approaches explicitly define real numbers to be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers ‚Äì 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on ‚Äì begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number can be compared to another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number. The step from rationals to reals is a major extension. There are at least two popular ways to achieve this step, both published in 1872: Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.The historical synthesis is claimed by Griffiths and Hilton (p.xiv) in 1970 and again by Pugh (p. 10) in 2001; both actually prefer Dedekind cuts to axioms. For the use of cuts in textbooks, see Pugh p. 17 or Rudin p. 17\\\\. For viewpoints on logic, Pugh p. 10, Rudin p.ix, or Munkres p. 30 =Dedekind cuts= In the Dedekind cut approach, each real number x is defined as the infinite set of all rational numbers less than x.Enderton (p. 113) qualifies this description: \\"The idea behind Dedekind cuts is that a real number x can be named by giving an infinite set of rationals, namely all the rationals less than x. We will in effect define x to be the set of rationals smaller than x. To avoid circularity in the definition, we must be able to characterize the sets of rationals obtainable in this way...\\" In particular, the real number 1 is the set of all rational numbers that are less than 1.Rudin pp. 17‚Äì20, Richman p. 399, or Enderton p. 119\\\\. To be precise, Rudin, Richman, and Enderton call this cut 1*, 1‚àí, and 1R, respectively; all three identify it with the traditional real number 1. Note that what Rudin and Enderton call a Dedekind cut, Richman calls a \\"nonprincipal Dedekind cut\\". Every positive decimal expansion easily determines a Dedekind cut: the set of rational numbers which are less than some stage of the expansion. So the real number 0.999... is the set of rational numbers r such that r < 0, or r < 0.9, or r < 0.99, or r is less than some other number of the formRichman p. 399 .}} Every element of 0.999... is less than 1, so it is an element of the real number 1. Conversely, all elements of 1 are rational numbers that can be written as with and . This implies and thus and since by the definition above, every element of 1 is also an element of 0.999..., and, combined with the proof above that every element of 0.999... is also an element of 1, the sets 0.999... and 1 contain the same rational numbers, and are therefore the same set, that is, 0.999... = 1. The definition of real numbers as Dedekind cuts was first published by Richard Dedekind in 1872. The above approach to assigning a real number to each decimal expansion is due to an expository paper titled \\"Is 0.999 ... = 1?\\" by Fred Richman in Mathematics Magazine, which is targeted at teachers of collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their students.Richman Richman notes that taking Dedekind cuts in any dense subset of the rational numbers yields the same results; in particular, he uses decimal fractions, for which the proof is more immediate. He also notes that typically the definitions allow { x : x < 1 } to be a cut but not { x : x ‚â§ 1 } (or vice versa) \\"Why do that? Precisely to rule out the existence of distinct numbers 0.9* and 1. [...] So we see that in the traditional definition of the real numbers, the equation 0.9* = 1 is built in at the beginning.\\"Richman pp. 398‚Äì399 A further modification of the procedure leads to a different structure where the two are not equal. Although it is consistent, many of the common rules of decimal arithmetic no longer hold, for example the fraction has no representation; see \\"Alternative number systems\\" below. =Cauchy sequences= Another approach is to define a real number as the limit of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. This construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of rationals less directly. First, the distance between x and y is defined as the absolute value x ‚àí y, where the absolute value z is defined as the maximum of z and ‚àíz, thus never negative. Then the reals are defined to be the sequences of rationals that have the Cauchy sequence property using this distance. That is, in the sequence (x0, x1, x2, ...), a mapping from natural numbers to rationals, for any positive rational Œ¥ there is an N such that xm ‚àí xn ‚â§ Œ¥ for all m, n > N. (The distance between terms becomes smaller than any positive rational.)Griffiths & Hilton ¬ß24.2 \\"Sequences\\" p. 386 If (xn) and (yn) are two Cauchy sequences, then they are defined to be equal as real numbers if the sequence (xn ‚àí yn) has the limit 0. Truncations of the decimal number b0.b1b2b3... generate a sequence of rationals which is Cauchy; this is taken to define the real value of the number.Griffiths & Hilton pp. 388, 393 Thus in this formalism the task is to show that the sequence of rational numbers has the limit 0. Considering the nth term of the sequence, for , it must therefore be shown that This limit is plainGriffiths & Hilton p. 395 if one understands the definition of limit. So again 0.999... = 1\\\\. The definition of real numbers as Cauchy sequences was first published separately by Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor, also in 1872. The above approach to decimal expansions, including the proof that 0.999... = 1, closely follows Griffiths & Hilton's 1970 work A comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics: A contemporary interpretation. The book is written specifically to offer a second look at familiar concepts in a contemporary light.Griffiths & Hilton pp.viii, 395 = Infinite decimal representation = Commonly in secondary schools' mathematics education, the real numbers are constructed by defining a number using an integer followed by a radix point and an infinite sequence written out as a string to represent the fractional part of any given real number. In this construction, the set of any combination of an integer and digits after the decimal point (or radix point in non-base 10 systems) is the set of real numbers. This construction can be rigorously shown to satisfy all of the real axioms after defining an equivalence relation over the set that defines 1 =eq 0.999... as well as for any other nonzero decimals with only finitely many nonzero terms in the decimal string with its trailing 9s version. With this construction of the reals, all proofs of the statement \\"1 = 0.999...\\" can be viewed as implicitly assuming the equality when any operations are performed on the real numbers. Generalizations The result that 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal notation (equivalently, endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly as in the special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.Petkov≈°ek p. 408 Second, a comparable theorem applies in each radix or base. For example, in base 2 (the binary numeral system) 0.111... equals 1, and in base 3 (the ternary numeral system) 0.222... equals 1. In general, any terminating base b expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to b ‚àí 1\\\\. Textbooks of real analysis are likely to skip the example of 0.999... and present one or both of these generalizations from the start.Protter and Morrey p. 503; Bartle and Sherbert p. 61 Alternative representations of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, in the golden ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s. Generally, for almost all q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many q (including all natural numbers greater than 1) for which there is only one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was first obtained by Paul Erd≈ës, Miklos Horv√°th, and Istv√°n Jo√≥ around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the Komornik‚ÄìLoreti constant q = 1.787231650.... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence, which does not repeat.Komornik and Loreti p. 636 A more far-reaching generalization addresses the most general positional numeral systems. They too have multiple representations, and in some sense the difficulties are even worse. For example:Kempner p. 611; Petkov≈°ek p. 409 * In the balanced ternary system, = 0.111... = 1. _111_.... * In the reverse factorial number system (using bases 2!,3!,4!,... for positions after the decimal point), 1 = 1.000... = 0.1234.... =Impossibility of unique representation= That all these different number systems suffer from multiple representations for some real numbers can be attributed to a fundamental difference between the real numbers as an ordered set and collections of infinite strings of symbols, ordered lexicographically. Indeed, the following two properties account for the difficulty: * If an interval of the real numbers is partitioned into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every element of L is (strictly) less than every element of R, then either L contains a largest element or R contains a smallest element, but not both. * The collection of infinite strings of symbols taken from any finite \\"alphabet\\", lexicographically ordered, can be partitioned into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every element of L is less than every element of R, while L contains a largest element and R contains a smallest element. Indeed, it suffices to take two finite prefixes (initial substrings) p1, p2 of elements from the collection such that they differ only in their final symbol, for which symbol they have successive values, and take for L the set of all strings in the collection whose corresponding prefix is at most p1, and for R the remainder, the strings in the collection whose corresponding prefix is at least p2. Then L has a largest element, starting with p1 and choosing the largest available symbol in all following positions, while R has a smallest element obtained by following p2 by the smallest symbol in all positions. The first point follows from basic properties of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in L, but not both since L and R are supposed to be disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1 = \\"0\\", p2 = \\"1\\". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow \\"9\\" in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of \\"9\\"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string. Marko Petkov≈°ek has proven that for any positional system that names all the real numbers, the set of reals with multiple representations is always dense. He calls the proof \\"an instructive exercise in elementary point-set topology\\"; it involves viewing sets of positional values as Stone spaces and noticing that their real representations are given by continuous functions.Petkov≈°ek pp. 410‚Äì411 Applications One application of 0.999... as a representation of 1 occurs in elementary number theory. In 1802, H. Goodwin published an observation on the appearance of 9s in the repeating- decimal representations of fractions whose denominators are certain prime numbers. Examples include: * = 0. and 142 + 857 = 999. * = 0. and 0136 + 9863 = 9999. E. Midy proved a general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The publication was obscure, and it is unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., but at least one modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that if a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem.Leavitt 1984 p. 301 Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.Lewittes pp. 1‚Äì3; Leavitt 1967 pp. 669, 673; Shrader-Frechette pp. 96‚Äì98 Positions of , , and 1 in the Cantor set Returning to real analysis, the base-3 analogue 0.222... = 1 plays a key role in a characterization of one of the simplest fractals, the middle-thirds Cantor set: * A point in the unit interval lies in the Cantor set if and only if it can be represented in ternary using only the digits 0 and 2. The nth digit of the representation reflects the position of the point in the nth stage of the construction. For example, the point is given the usual representation of 0.2 or 0.2000..., since it lies to the right of the first deletion and to the left of every deletion thereafter. The point is represented not as 0.1 but as 0.0222..., since it lies to the left of the first deletion and to the right of every deletion thereafter.Pugh p. 97; Alligood, Sauer, and Yorke pp. 150‚Äì152. Protter and Morrey (p. 507) and Pedrick (p. 29) assign this description as an exercise. Repeating nines also turn up in yet another of Georg Cantor's works. They must be taken into account to construct a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines.Maor (p. 60) and Mankiewicz (p. 151) review the former method; Mankiewicz attributes it to Cantor, but the primary source is unclear. Munkres (p. 50) mentions the latter method. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.Rudin p. 50, Pugh p. 98 Skepticism in education Students of mathematics often reject the equality of 0.999... and 1, for reasons ranging from their disparate appearance to deep misgivings over the limit concept and disagreements over the nature of infinitesimals. There are many common contributing factors to the confusion: * Students are often \\"mentally committed to the notion that a number can be represented in one and only one way by a decimal.\\" Seeing two manifestly different decimals representing the same number appears to be a paradox, which is amplified by the appearance of the seemingly well-understood number 1.Bunch p. 119; Tall and Schwarzenberger p. 6\\\\. The last suggestion is due to Burrell (p. 28): \\"Perhaps the most reassuring of all numbers is 1 ... So it is particularly unsettling when someone tries to pass off 0.9~ as 1.\\" * Some students interpret \\"0.999...\\" (or similar notation) as a large but finite string of 9s, possibly with a variable, unspecified length. If they accept an infinite string of nines, they may still expect a last 9 \\"at infinity\\".Tall and Schwarzenberger pp. 6‚Äì7; Tall 2000 p. 221 * Intuition and ambiguous teaching lead students to think of the limit of a sequence as a kind of infinite process rather than a fixed value, since a sequence need not reach its limit. Where students accept the difference between a sequence of numbers and its limit, they might read \\"0.999...\\" as meaning the sequence rather than its limit.Tall and Schwarzenberger p. 6; Tall 2000 p. 221 These ideas are mistaken in the context of the standard real numbers, although some may be valid in other number systems, either invented for their general mathematical utility or as instructive counterexamples to better understand 0.999... Many of these explanations were found by David Tall, who has studied characteristics of teaching and cognition that lead to some of the misunderstandings he has encountered in his college students. Interviewing his students to determine why the vast majority initially rejected the equality, he found that \\"students continued to conceive of 0.999... as a sequence of numbers getting closer and closer to 1 and not a fixed value, because 'you haven't specified how many places there are' or 'it is the nearest possible decimal below 1.Tall 2000 p. 221 The elementary argument of multiplying 0.333... = by 3 can convince reluctant students that 0.999... = 1. Still, when confronted with the conflict between their belief of the first equation and their disbelief of the second, some students either begin to disbelieve the first equation or simply become frustrated.Tall 1976 pp. 10‚Äì14 Nor are more sophisticated methods foolproof: students who are fully capable of applying rigorous definitions may still fall back on intuitive images when they are surprised by a result in advanced mathematics, including 0.999.... For example, one real analysis student was able to prove that 0.333... = using a supremum definition, but then insisted that 0.999... < 1 based on her earlier understanding of long division.Pinto and Tall p. 5, Edwards and Ward pp. 416‚Äì417 Others still are able to prove that = 0.333..., but, upon being confronted by the fractional proof, insist that \\"logic\\" supersedes the mathematical calculations. Joseph Mazur tells the tale of an otherwise brilliant calculus student of his who \\"challenged almost everything I said in class but never questioned his calculator,\\" and who had come to believe that nine digits are all one needs to do mathematics, including calculating the square root of 23. The student remained uncomfortable with a limiting argument that 9.99... = 10, calling it a \\"wildly imagined infinite growing process.\\"Mazur pp. 137‚Äì141 As part of Ed Dubinsky's APOS theory of mathematical learning, he and his collaborators (2005) propose that students who conceive of 0.999... as a finite, indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have \\"not yet constructed a complete process conception of the infinite decimal\\". Other students who have a complete process conception of 0.999... may not yet be able to \\"encapsulate\\" that process into an \\"object conception\\", like the object conception they have of 1, and so they view the process 0.999... and the object 1 as incompatible. Dubinsky et al. also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing as a number in its own right and to dealing with the set of natural numbers as a whole.Dubinsky et al. pp. 261‚Äì262 Cultural phenomenon With the rise of the Internet, debates about 0.999... have become commonplace on newsgroups and message boards, including many that nominally have little to do with mathematics. In the newsgroup , arguing over 0.999... is described as a \\"popular sport\\", and it is one of the questions answered in its FAQ.As observed by Richman (p. 396). The FAQ briefly covers , multiplication by 10, and limits, and it alludes to Cauchy sequences as well. A 2003 edition of the general-interest newspaper column The Straight Dope discusses 0.999... via and limits, saying of misconceptions, A Slate article reports that the concept of 0.999... is \\"hotly disputed on websites ranging from World of Warcraft message boards to Ayn Rand forums\\". In the same vein, the question of 0.999... proved such a popular topic in the first seven years of Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net forums that the company issued a \\"press release\\" on April Fools' Day 2004 that it is 1: Two proofs are then offered, based on limits and multiplication by 10. 0.999... features also in mathematical jokes, such as:Renteln and Dundes, p. 27 In alternative number systems Although the real numbers form an extremely useful number system, the decision to interpret the notation \\"0.999...\\" as naming a real number is ultimately a convention, and Timothy Gowers argues in Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction that the resulting identity 0.999... = 1 is a convention as well: One can define other number systems using different rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs would need to be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of, rather than independent alternatives to, the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as \\"0.999...\\" is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then at least one of the assumptions built into the system must break down. =Infinitesimals= Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 rely on the Archimedean property of the real numbers: that there are no nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 ‚àí 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same. However, there are mathematically coherent ordered algebraic structures, including various alternatives to the real numbers, which are non-Archimedean. Non-standard analysis provides a number system with a full array of infinitesimals (and their inverses).For a full treatment of non-standard numbers see for example Robinson's Non-standard Analysis. A. H. Lightstone developed a decimal expansion for hyperreal numbers in (0, 1)‚àó.Lightstone pp. 245‚Äì247 Lightstone shows how to associate to each number a sequence of digits, indexed by the hypernatural numbers. While he does not directly discuss 0.999..., he shows the real number is represented by 0.333...;...333... which is a consequence of the transfer principle. As a consequence the number 0.999...;...999... = 1. With this type of decimal representation, not every expansion represents a number. In particular \\"0.333...;...000...\\" and \\"0.999...;...000...\\" do not correspond to any number. The standard definition of the number 0.999... is the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... A different definition involves what Terry Tao refers to as ultralimit, i.e., the equivalence class [(0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...)] of this sequence in the ultrapower construction, which is a number that falls short of 1 by an infinitesimal amount. More generally, the hyperreal number with last digit 9 at infinite hypernatural rank H, satisfies a strict inequality Accordingly, an alternative interpretation for \\"zero followed by infinitely many 9s\\" could be \\\\; = 1\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\frac{1}{10^{H}}.Katz & Katz 2010}} All such interpretations of \\"0.999...\\" are infinitely close to 1. Ian Stewart characterizes this interpretation as an \\"entirely reasonable\\" way to rigorously justify the intuition that \\"there's a little bit missing\\" from 1 in 0.999....Stewart 2009, p. 175; the full discussion of 0.999... is spread through pp. 172‚Äì175. Along with Katz & Katz, Robert Ely also questions the assumption that students' ideas about are erroneous intuitions about the real numbers, interpreting them rather as nonstandard intuitions that could be valuable in the learning of calculus.Katz & Katz (2010b)R. Ely (2010) Jose Benardete in his book Infinity: An essay in metaphysics argues that some natural pre-mathematical intuitions cannot be expressed if one is limited to an overly restrictive number system: =Hackenbush= Combinatorial game theory provides alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, motivated by the idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012... = . However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where œâ is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2.Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy (pp. 79‚Äì80, 307‚Äì311) discuss 1 and and touch on . The game for 0.111...2 follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule. This is in fact true of the binary expansions of many rational numbers, where the values of the numbers are equal but the corresponding binary tree paths are different. For example, 0.10111...2 = 0.11000...2, which are both equal to 3/4, but the first representation corresponds to the binary tree path LRLRLLL... while the second corresponds to the different path LRLLRRR.... =Revisiting subtraction= Another manner in which the proofs might be undermined is if 1 ‚àí 0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings. Richman considers two such systems, designed so that 0.999... < 1\\\\. First, Richman defines a nonnegative decimal number to be a literal decimal expansion. He defines the lexicographical order and an addition operation, noting that 0.999... < 1 simply because 0 < 1 in the ones place, but for any nonterminating x, one has 0.999... + x = 1 + x. So one peculiarity of the decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled; another is that no decimal number corresponds to . After defining multiplication, the decimal numbers form a positive, totally ordered, commutative semiring.Richman pp. 397‚Äì399 In the process of defining multiplication, Richman also defines another system he calls \\"cut D\\", which is the set of Dedekind cuts of decimal fractions. Ordinarily this definition leads to the real numbers, but for a decimal fraction d he allows both the cut (‚àí‚àû, d) and the \\"principal cut\\" (‚àí‚àû, d]. The result is that the real numbers are \\"living uneasily together with\\" the decimal fractions. Again 0.999... < 1\\\\. There are no positive infinitesimals in cut D, but there is \\"a sort of negative infinitesimal,\\" 0‚àí, which has no decimal expansion. He concludes that 0.999... = 1 + 0‚àí, while the equation \\"0.999... + x = 1\\" has no solution.Richman pp. 398‚Äì400. Rudin (p. 23) assigns this alternative construction (but over the rationals) as the last exercise of Chapter 1. =p-adic numbers= When asked about 0.999..., novices often believe there should be a \\"final 9\\", believing 1 ‚àí 0.999... to be a positive number which they write as \\"0.000...1\\". Whether or not that makes sense, the intuitive goal is clear: adding a 1 to the final 9 in 0.999... would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones place. Among other reasons, this idea fails because there is no \\"final 9\\" in 0.999....Gardiner p. 98; Gowers p. 60 However, there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s including a last 9. The 4-adic integers (black points), including the sequence (3, 33, 333, ...) converging to ‚àí1. The 10-adic analogue is ...999 = ‚àí1. The p-adic numbers are an alternative number system of interest in number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, than it is to 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals. In the 10-adic numbers, the analogues of decimal expansions run to the left. The 10-adic expansion ...999 does have a last 9, and it does not have a first 9. One can add 1 to the ones place, and it leaves behind only 0s after carrying through: 1 + ...999 = ...000 = 0, and so ...999 = ‚àí1.Fjelstad p. 11 Another derivation uses a geometric series. The infinite series implied by \\"...999\\" does not converge in the real numbers, but it converges in the 10-adics, and so one can re-use the familiar formula: (Compare with the series above.) A third derivation was invented by a seventh- grader who was doubtful over her teacher's limiting argument that 0.999... = 1 but was inspired to take the multiply-by-10 proof above in the opposite direction: if x = ...999 then 10x = ...990, so 10x = x ‚àí 9, hence x = ‚àí1 again. As a final extension, since 0.999... = 1 (in the reals) and ...999 = ‚àí1 (in the 10-adics), then by \\"blind faith and unabashed juggling of symbols\\"DeSua p. 901 one may add the two equations and arrive at ...999.999... = 0. This equation does not make sense either as a 10-adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion, but it turns out to be meaningful and true in the doubly infinite decimal expansion of the 10-adic solenoid, with eventually repeating left ends to represent the real numbersDeSua pp. 902‚Äì903 and eventually repeating right ends to represent the 10-adic numbers. =Ultrafinitism= The philosophy of ultrafinitism rejects as meaningless concepts dealing with infinite sets, such as idea that the notation 0.999\\\\ldots might stand for a decimal number with an infinite sequence of nines, as well as the summation of infinitely many numbers 9/10+9/100+\\\\cdots corresponding to the positional values of the decimal digits in that infinite string. In this approach to mathematics, only some particular (fixed) number of finite decimal digits is meaningful. Instead of \\"equality\\", one has \\"approximate equality\\", which is equality up to the number of decimal digits that one is permitted to compute. Although Katz and Katz argue that ultrafinitism may capture the student intuition that 0.999... ought to be less than 1, the ideas of ultrafinitism do not enjoy widespread acceptance in the mathematical community, and the philosophy lacks a generally agreed-upon formal mathematical foundation.Katz & Katz (2010a) Related questions Zeno's paradoxes, particularly the paradox of the runner, are reminiscent of the apparent paradox that 0.999... and 1 are equal. The runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric series. However, it is not clear if this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues Zeno was exploring.Wallace p. 51, Maor p. 17 * Division by zero occurs in some popular discussions of 0.999..., and it also stirs up contention. While most authors choose to define 0.999..., almost all modern treatments leave division by zero undefined, as it can be given no meaning in the standard real numbers. However, division by zero is defined in some other systems, such as complex analysis, where the extended complex plane, i.e. the Riemann sphere, has a \\"point at infinity\\". Here, it makes sense to define to be infinity;See, for example, J.B. Conway's treatment of M√∂bius transformations, pp. 47‚Äì57 and, in fact, the results are profound and applicable to many problems in engineering and physics. Some prominent mathematicians argued for such a definition long before either number system was developed.Maor p. 54 * Negative zero is another redundant feature of many ways of writing numbers. In number systems, such as the real numbers, where \\"0\\" denotes the additive identity and is neither positive nor negative, the usual interpretation of \\"‚àí0\\" is that it should denote the additive inverse of 0, which forces ‚àí0 = 0.Munkres p. 34, Exercise 1(c) Nonetheless, some scientific applications use separate positive and negative zeroes, as do some computing binary number systems (for example integers stored in the sign and magnitude or ones' complement formats, or floating point numbers as specified by the IEEE floating-point standard).

His grandfather, Sir Thomas Englefield (1455‚Äì1514), was an adviser to Henry VIII during the King's youth, and Speaker of the House of Commons in 1497 and 1510.. Englefield had a brother, John Englefield (died 1567), who married Margaret Fitton, the daughter of Sir Edward Fitton (d.1547/8) of Gawsworth and his wife, Mary Harbottle (died 1557),. and three sisters, Margaret Englefield (died 1563), who married firstly, George Carew (died 1538), and secondly, Sir Edward Saunders (1506‚Äì1576), Chief Baron of the Exchequer; Anne Englefield, who married Humphrey Coningsby (1515‚Äì1569); and Susan Englefield, who married Humphrey Barnes.. Career Francis, who succeeded his father in 1537, was too young to have taken any part in the opposition to the abolition of the Roman jurisdiction and dissolution of the monasteries; and he acquiesced in these measures to the extent of taking the oath of royal supremacy, serving as High Sheriff of Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1546‚Äì1547. In 1545 he purchased the manor of Tilehurst, which had belonged to Reading Abbey. He was knighted at the coronation of Edward VI of England in February 1547. But the progress of the Reformation during that reign alienated him, and he became a member of the household of Princess Mary in 1549.Baker, T.F.T. \\"Englefield, Sir Francis (1521/22-96), of Englefield, Berks\\", History of Parliament In August of that year he was sent to the Tower for permitting Mass to be celebrated in Mary's household. He was released in the following March, and permitted to resume his duties in Mary's service. But in February 1553 he was again summoned before the privy council, and may have been in confinement at the crisis of July; perhaps he was only released on Marys triumph, for his name does not appear among those who exerted themselves on her behalf before the middle of August. He was then sworn a member of the privy council like many others who owed their promotion to their loyalty rather than to their political abilities. Their numbers swelled the privy council and sadly impaired its efficiency; but Mary resisted the various attempts to get rid of them because she liked staunch friends, and regarded them as a salutary check upon the abler but less scrupulous members who had served Edward VI as well as herself. Englefield sat as M.P. for Berkshire in all Mary's parliaments except that of April 1554, but received no higher political office than the lucrative mastership of the court of wards. Exile He was an ardent supporter of the Marian persecutions, was present at Hooper's trial, sought Ascham's ruin, and naturally lost his office and his seat on the privy council at Elizabeth's succession. He retired to the continent before May 1559, and lived in exile for the remainder of his life.\\"Parishes: Englefield.\\" A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3. Eds.

He was blind for the last twenty years of his life, and received a pension of six hundred crowns from Philip. He had been outlawed in 1564 and his estates sequestered, but his correspondence with the pope and the King of Spain on behalf of Mary Queen of Scots brought an act of attainder against Englefield in 1585. Even then some legal difficulties stood in the way of their appropriation by the crown, for Englefield, obviously with an eye to this contingency, had conditionally settled them on his nephew, Francis Englefield (c. 1561 ‚Äì 26 October 1631). The long arguments on the point are given in Cokes Reports, and a further Act of Parliament was passed in 1592 confirming the forfeiture to the crown (35 Eliz. I. c. 5). The nephew, however, eventually recovered some of the family estates, and was created a baronet in 1612. His uncle was alive in September 1596, but apparently died at Valladolid about the end of that year. His tomb there used to be shown to visitors as that of an eminent man.

It was first described in rainbow trout in Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe (including Russia), the United States, South Africa, Canada and other countries. In the 1980s, M. cerebralis was found to require a tubificid oligochaete (a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle. The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst-like capsules. Whirling disease afflicts juvenile fish (fingerlings and fry) and causes skeletal deformation and neurological damage. Fish \\"whirl\\" forward in an awkward, corkscrew-like pattern instead of swimming normally, find feeding difficult, and are more vulnerable to predators. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, and those that do survive are deformed by the parasites residing in their cartilage and bone. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish's death. M. cerebralis is one of the most economically important myxozoans in fish, as well as one of the most pathogenic. It was the first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically. The parasite is not transmissible to humans. Taxonomy The taxonomy and naming of both M. cerebralis, and of myxozoans in general, have complicated histories. It was originally thought to infect fish brains (hence the specific epithet cerebralis) and nervous systems, though it soon was found to primarily infect cartilage and skeletal tissue. Attempts to change the name to Myxobolus chondrophagus, which would more accurately describe the organism, failed because of nomenclature rules. Later, the organisms previously called Triactinomyxon dubium and T. gyrosalmo (class Actinosporea) were found to be, in fact, triactinomyxon stages of M. cerebralis, the life cycle of which was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage. Similarly, other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans. Today, the myxozoans, previously thought to be multicellular protozoans, are considered animals by most scientists, though their status has not officially changed. Recent molecular studies suggest they are related to Bilateria or Cnidaria, with Cnidaria being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments,. Bilateria were somewhat closer in some genetic studies, but those were found to have used samples that were contaminated by material from the host organism, and a 2015 study confirms they are cnidarians. Morphology Diagram of the structure of a triactinomyxon stage spore of Myxobolus cerebralis'M. cerebralis has many diverse stages ranging from single cells to relatively large spores, not all of which have been studied in detail. =Triactinomyxon stage= The stages that infect fish, called triactinomyxon spores, are made of a single style that is about 150 micrometers (¬µm) long and three processes or \\"tails\\", each about 200 micrometers long. A sporoplasm packet at the end of the style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope. There are also three polar capsules, each of which contains a coiled polar filament between 170 and 180 ¬µm long. Polar filaments in both this stage and in the myxospore stage (see picture above) rapidly shoot into the body of the host, creating an opening through which the sporoplasm can enter. =Sporoplasm stage= Upon contact with fish hosts and firing of the polar capsules, the sporoplasm contained within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes mitosis to produce more amoeboid cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, to reach the cerebral cartilage. =Myxosporean stage= Myxospores, which develop from sporogonic cell stages inside fish hosts, are lenticular. They have a diameter of about 10 micrometers and are made of six cells. Two of these cells form polar capsules, two merge to form a binucleate sporoplasm, and two form protective valves. Myxospores are infective to oligochaetes, and are found among the remains of digested fish cartilage. They are often difficult to distinguish from related species because of morphological similarities across genera. Though M. cerebralis is the only myxosporean ever found in salmonid cartilage, other visually similar species may be present in the skin, nervous system, or muscle. Life cycle Life cycle of M. cerebralis Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host life cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm known to be susceptible to M. cerebralis infection is Tubifex tubifex, though what scientists currently call T. tubifex may in fact be more than one species. First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the gut lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to the gut epithelium by polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected. Around 60‚Äì90 days postinfection, sexual cell stages of the parasite undergo sporogenesis, and develop into pansporocysts, each of which contains eight triactinomyxon-stage spores. These spores are released from the oligochaete anus into the water. Alternatively, a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete. Infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least a year. The triactinomyxon spores are carried by the water currents, where they can infect a salmonid through the skin. Penetration of the fish by these spores takes only a few seconds. Within five minutes, a sac of germ cells called a sporoplasm has entered the fish epidermis, and within a few hours, the sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through the fish. Within the fish, both intracellular and extracellular stages reproduce in its cartilage by asexual endogeny, meaning new cells grow from within old cells. The final stage within the fish is the creation of the myxospore, which is formed by sporogony. They are released into the environment when the fish decomposes or is eaten. Some recent research indicates some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive. Myxospores are extremely tough: \\"it was shown that Myxobolus cerebralis spores can tolerate freezing at ‚àí20¬∞C for at least 3 months, aging in mud at 13¬∞C for at least 5 months, and passage through the guts of northern pike Esox lucius or mallards Anas platyrhynchos without loss of infectivity\\" to worms. Triactinomyxons are much shorter-lived, surviving 34 days or less, depending on temperature. Pathology Skeletal deformation in a mature brook trout caused by M. cerebralis infection. M. cerebralis infections have been reported from a wide range of salmonid species: eight species of \\"Atlantic\\" salmonids, Salmo; four species of \\"Pacific\\" salmonids, Oncorhynchus; four species of char, Salvelinus; the grayling, Thymallus thymallus; and the huchen, Hucho hucho.Lom, J. & Dykov√°, I. (1992). Protozoan Parasites of Fishes, Elsevier, Amsterdam. . M. cerebralis causes damage to its fish hosts through attachment of triactinomyxon spores and the migrations of various stages through tissues and along nerves, as well as by digesting cartilage. The fish's tail may darken, but aside from lesions on cartilage, internal organs generally appear healthy. Other symptoms include skeletal deformities and \\"whirling\\" behavior (tail-chasing) in young fish, which was thought to have been caused by a loss of equilibrium, but is actually caused by damage to the spinal cord and lower brain stem. Experiments have shown that fish can kill Myxobolus in their skin (possibly using antibodies), but that the fish do not attack the parasites once they have migrated to the central nervous system. This response varies from species to species. In T. tubifex, the release of triactinomyxon spores from the intestinal wall damages the worm's mucosa; this may happen thousands of times in a single worm, and is believed to impair nutrient absorption. Spores are released from the worm almost exclusively when the temperature is between 10 ¬∞C and 15 ¬∞C, so fish in warmer or cooler waters are less likely to be infected, and infection rates vary seasonally. =Susceptibility= Fish size, age, concentration of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, as does the species of the fish in question. The disease has the most impact on fish less than five months old because their skeletons have not ossified. This makes young fish more susceptible to deformities and provides M. cerebralis more cartilage on which to feed. In one study of seven species of many strains, brook trout and rainbow trout (except one strain) were far more heavily affected by M. cerebralis after two hours of exposure than other species were, while bull trout, Chinook salmon, brown trout, and Arctic grayling were least severely affected. While brown trout may harbor the parasite, they typically do not show any symptoms, and this species may have been M. cerebralis' original host. This lack of symptoms in brown trout meant that the parasite was only discovered after nonnative rainbow trouts were introduced in Europe. =Diagnosis= The normally uniform trout cartilage is scarred with lesions in which M. cerebralis spores develop, weakening and deforming the connective tissues. Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though \\"injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs\\", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage. In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digest‚ÄîPTD) before looking for spores. The head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis. Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units. Impact M. cerebralis has been reported in Germany (1893), Italy (1954), USSR (1955), including Sakhalin Island (1960), USA (1958), Bulgaria (1960), Yugoslavia (1960), Sweden (1966), South Africa (1966), Scotland (1968), New Zealand (1971), Ecuador (1971), Norway (1971), Colombia (1972), Lebanon (1973), Ireland (1974), Spain (1981) and England (1981) Although originally a mild pathogen of Salmo trutta in central Europe and other salmonids in northeast Asia, the introduction of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has greatly increased the impact of this parasite. Having no innate immunity to M. cerebralis, rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, such as S. trutta, can become overloaded with parasites and incur 80%‚Äì90% mortalities. Where M. cerebralis has become well-established, it has caused decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish.Nehring, R.B. (1996). \\"Whirling Disease In Feral Trout Populations In Colorado.\\" In E.P. Bergersen And B.A.Knoph (eds.), Proceedings: Whirling Disease Workshop‚Äì‚Äìwhere Do We Go From Here?

Bergersen And B.A.Knoph (eds.), Proceedings: Whirling Disease Workshop‚Äîwhere Do We Go From Here? Colorado Cooperative Fish And Wildlife Research Unit, Fort Collins.: pp.159. =Impact in Europe= The impact of M. cerebralis in Europe is somewhat lessened because the species is endemic to this region, giving native fish stocks a degree of immunity. Rainbow trout, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing feral populations are rare, so few wild rainbow trout are young enough to be susceptible to infection. On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking sport-fishing waters and for aquaculture, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the \\"ossification\\" stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges. Fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs. =Impact in New Zealand= M. cerebralis was first found in New Zealand in 1971. The parasite has only been found in rivers in the South Island, away from the most important aquaculture sites. Additionally, salmonid species commercially aquacultured in New Zealand have low susceptibility to whirling disease, and the parasite has also not been shown to affect native salmonids.Stone M A B, MacDiarmid S C, Pharo H J. (1997). Import health risk analysis: salmonids for human consumption. Ministry of Agriculture Regulatory Authority, New Zealand. An important indirect effect of the parasites presence is quarantine restriction placed on exports of salmon products to Australia. =Impact in the United States= M. cerebralis has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the Whirling Disease Initiative M. cerebralis was first recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout.Tennyson, J. Anacker, T. & Higgins, S. (January 13, 1997). \\"Scientific breakthrough helps combat trout disease.\\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Whirling Disease Foundation News Release. In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, \\"the Montana Whirling Disease Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone\\". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that M. cerebralis infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in California, Michigan, and New York.Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Division of Animal Health. (October 2001). \\"Fish Health Advisory: Whirling Disease in Trout.\\" (.pdf). =Impact in Canada= Whirling disease was first detected in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016.Parks Canada. (2016). 'Whirling disease confirmed' Although it was first discovered in Banff, it is not necessarily where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River,CBC News. (2016). 'Whirling disease confirmed in Bow River, CFIA says' and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin.CBC News. (2017). 'Whirling disease now infects entire Oldman River basin, including Waterton Lakes National Park' The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease. As a result of the new declaration, a domestic movement permit will be required from the CFIA for susceptible species and end uses identified in the Domestic Movement Control Program, the vector Tubifex tubifex, the disease causing agent Myxobolus cerebralis, and/or related things out of the infected and buffer areas of Alberta. Recreational and sport fishing, including fishing led by a professional guide, will not require a CFIA permit. Prevention and control Some biologists have attempted to disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely. In the laboratory, only extreme acidity or basicity, moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electric current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, cnidarian chemosensitizers, and trout mucus were ineffective, as were anesthetized or dead fish.El-Matbouli, M., Hoffmann, R.W., Shoel, H., McDowell, T. S., & Hedrick, R.P. (1999).\\" Whirling disease: host specificity and interaction between the actinosporean stage of Myxobolus cerebralis and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cartilage.\\" Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 35: 1‚Äì12. If spores could be disarmed, they would be unable to infect fish, but further research is needed to find an effective treatment. Some strains of fish are more resistant than others, even within species; using resistant strains may help reduce the incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture. There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time.Whirling Disease Foundation News. July, 2003. Research on whirling disease resistant rainbow trout Additionally, aquaculturists may avoid M. cerebralis infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and makes it easier to eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment. To minimise tubificid populations, techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds, and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic- lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease. Lastly, some drugs, such as furazolidone, furoxone, benomyl, fumagillin, proguanil and clamoxyquine, have been shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates. For example, one study showed that feeding fumagillin to O. mykiss reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%. Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations, and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for United States Food and Drug Administration approval. Recreational and sports fishers can help to prevent the spread of the parasite by not transporting fish from one body of water to another, not disposing of fish bones or entrails in any body of water, and ensuring boots and shoes are clean before moving between different bodies of water. Federal, state, provincial, and local regulations on the use of bait should be followed.Myxobolus cerebralis. (16 August 2012).

Cushing Island, or Cushing's Island, is a privately owned island in Casco Bay in the U.S. state of Maine. Part of the city of Portland, Maine, roughly 45 families live there seasonally. In 1623-24 English explorer Christopher Levett built a blockhouse on the island, part of granted him by the English King. Levett left behind a group of settlers to carry on after he returned to England. But the naval captain and adventurer never returned, and the fate of the men is unknown. After Levett's occupation the island was known as Andrews Island. Levett's early settlement earned him the sobriquet \\"the pioneer colonist in Casco Bay\\" from eminent Maine historian James Phinney Baxter.Christopher Levett, of York, the Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay, James Phinney Baxter, Christopher Levett, The Gorges Society, Portland, Me., 1893 After a host of owners, in September 1734, Nathaniel Jones conveyed the island to Joshua Bangs. The island was then known as 'Bangs Island'. The name 'Bangs Island' will be found on maps from the period. In the late 1750s Ezekiel Cushing obtained the island from Bangs. In 1760, Bangs regained the island. The island was later conveyed to Jedediah Preble, Joshua Bangs' son-in-law after Bangs' death. Simeon Skillings, a relation of Preble's later lived on the island and purchased small parts of the land. Lemuel Cushing, a fourth cousin of Ezekiel Cushing purchased most of the island in 1859. Cushing then consolidated the holdings of the Preble's and the Skilling's, becoming the sole owner of the island.Sargent, William M. \\"An Historical Sketch, Guide Book, and Prospectus of Cushing's Island\\" (1886) Born in Quebec, Canada, to Massachusetts emigrants, Lemuel Cushing planned to turn the island into a summer resort and built the Ottawa House hotel.* Lemuel's son Francis Cushing formed the Cushing's Island Company in 1883 and hired Frederick Law Olmsted the same year to develop the island as a planned 'summer colony'. Olmsted designed the landscape of the island, along with architect John Calvin Stevens.Plan of Cushing Island, ca. 1888, John Calvin Stevens, Maine Historical Society, Maine Memory Network, mainememory.net The first Ottawa House was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1888. The second Ottawa House burned down in 1917 and was not rebuilt. View of Fort Levett and Ram's Island ledge, Cushing Island, Maine, ca. 1904 The United States Army began acquiring land on the island in the 1890s to build Fort Levett, named for explorer Christopher Levett, the English explorer and first settler of what is now Portland, which eventually grew to 200 acres (0.8 km¬≤). (The island was initially known as Levett's Island, after the first English settler of Maine. Levett has been described by the eminent Maine historian James Phinney Baxter as \\"the first owner of the soil of Portland.\\") It was last used during World War II for coastal defense. That land was purchased by island residents in 1970. The island is now privately owned. Ferry service is provided by the St Croix, which departs from Long Wharf in Portland and lands at the summer dock, also known as Civilian Dock. Access to the island is for private/owners use only. The island has a US Coast Guard Cutter that bears its name, USCGC Cushing (WPB-1321), previously stationed in Mobile, AL and currently homeported in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina.

In jewellery, it is usually of gold and silver, made with tiny beads or twisted threads, or both in combination, soldered together or to the surface of an object of the same metal and arranged in artistic motifs. It often suggests lace and remains popular in Indian and other Asian metalwork. It was popular as well in Italian, French and Portuguese metalwork from 1660 to the late 19th century. It should not be confused with ajoure jewellery work, the ajoure technique consisting of drilling holes in objects made of sheet metal. The English word filigree is shortened from the earlier use of filigreen which derives from Latin \\"filum\\" meaning thread and \\"granum\\" grain, in the sense of small bead. The Latin words gave filigrana in Italian which itself became filigrane in 17th-century French.Oxford Dictionaries entry for \\"filigree\\" http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/filigreeOnline Etymology Dictionary http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=filigree History Though filigree has become a special branch of jewellery in modern times, it was historically part of the ordinary work of the jeweller. Indeed, all the jewellery of the Etruscans and Greeks (other than that intended for the grave, and therefore of an unsubstantial character) was made by soldering together and so building up the gold rather than by chiselling or engraving the material. =Ancient work= Archaeological finds in ancient Mesopotamia indicate that filigree was incorporated into jewellery since 3,000 BC. Specific to the city of Midyat in Mardin Province in upper Mesopotamia, a form of filigree using silver and gold wires, known as \\"telkari\\", was developed in the 15th Century. To this day, expert craftsmen in this region continue to produce fine pieces of telkari. The Egyptian jewellers employed wire, both to lay down on a background and to plait or otherwise arranged jour. But, with the exception of chains, it cannot be said that filigree work was much practiced by them. Their strength lay rather in their cloisonn√© work and their molded ornaments. Many examples, however, remain of round plaited gold chains of fine wire, such as those that are still made by the filigree workers of India, and known as trichinopoly chains. From some of these are hung smaller chains of finer wire with minute fishes and other pendants fastened to them. In ornaments derived from Phoenician sites, such as Cyprus and Sardinia, patterns of gold wire are laid down with great delicacy on a gold ground, but the art was advanced to its highest perfection in the Greek and Etruscan filigree of the 6th to the 3rd centuries BC. A number of earrings and other personal ornaments found in central Italy are preserved in the Louvre and in the British Museum. Almost all of them are made of filigree work. Some earrings are in the form of flowers of geometric design, bordered by one or more rims each made up of minute volutes of gold wire, and this kind of ornament is varied by slight differences in the way of disposing the number or arrangement of the volutes. But the feathers and petals of modern Italian filigree are not seen in these ancient designs. Instances occur, but only rarely, in which filigree devices in wire are self-supporting and not applied to metal plates. The museum of the Hermitage at Saint Petersburg contains a large collection of Scythian jewellery from the tombs of the Crimea. Many bracelets and necklaces in that collection are made of twisted wire, some in as many as seven rows of plaiting, with clasps in the shape of heads of animals of beaten work. Others are strings of large beads of gold, decorated with volutes, knots and other patterns of wire soldered over the surfaces.See the \\"Antiquites du Bosphore Cimmerien\\", by Gille, 1854; reissued by S. Reinach, 1892, which contains careful engravings of these objects. In the British Museum a sceptre, probably that of a Greek priestess, is covered with plaited and netted gold wipe, finished with a sort of Corinthian capital and a boss of green glass. =Asia= Tarakasi (silver filigree) pendant & ear rings, from CuttackSilver filigree work of Cuttack Tang Dynasty 'leopard' horse with body clad in gilded filigree It is probable that in India, Iran (in Zanjan, this handicraft is called ) and various parts of central Asia filigree has been worked from the most remote period without any change in the designs. Whether the Asiatic jewellers were influenced by the Greeks who settled on that continent, or merely trained under traditions held in common with them, it is certain that the Indian filigree workers retain the same patterns as those of the ancient Greeks and work them in the same way, down to the present day. Wandering workmen are given so much gold, coined or rough, which is weighed, heated in a pan of charcoal, beaten into wire, and then worked in the courtyard or verandah of the employer's house according to the designs of the artist, who weighs the complete work on restoring it and is paid at a specified rate for his labour. Very fine grains or beads and spines of gold, scarcely thicker than coarse hair, projecting from plates of gold are methods of ornamentation still used. Cuttack, of the eastern Indian state Odisha, features traditional filigree work Known as tarakasi in the Odia language, most filigree work revolves around images of deities, though due to lack of patronage and modern design ideas, it is a dying art. Also noted is silver filigree of Karimnagar in Telangana state. =Medieval Europe= Silver filigree icon repousse cover; History Museum in Samokov, Bulgaria Passing to later times, there are in many collections of medieval jewel work reliquaries, covers for Gospel books, etc., made either in Constantinople from the 6th to the 12th centuries, or in monasteries in Europe, in which studied and imitated Byzantine goldsmiths' work. These objects, besides being enriched with precious stones, polished, but not cut into facets, and with enamels, are often decorated with filigree. Large surfaces of gold are sometimes covered with scrolls of filigree soldered on, and corner pieces of the borders of book covers, or the panels of reliquaries, are frequently made up of complicated pieces of plaited work alternating with spaces encrusted with enamel. Byzantine filigree work occasionally has small stones set amongst the curves or knots. Examples of such decoration can be seen in the Victoria and Albert, and British Museums. Examples include the Cross of Lothair in Aachen. In the north of Europe, the Saxons, Britons and Celts were from an early period skillful in several kinds of goldsmiths' work. Admirable examples of filigree patterns laid down in wire on gold, from Anglo-Saxon tombs, may be seen in the British Museum, notably a brooch from Dover, and a sword-hilt from Cumberland. The Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver (estimated 700 CE) discovered in a field in Staffordshire, England, on 5 July 2009 contains numerous examples of very fine filigree described by archaeologist Kevin Leahy as \\"incredible\\". Irish filigree work of the Insular period is more thoughtful in design and more extremely varied in pattern. The Royal Irish Academy in Dublin contains a number of reliquaries and personal jewels, of which filigree is the general and most remarkable ornament. The Tara brooch has been copied and imitated, and the shape and decoration of it are well known. Instead of fine curls or volutes of gold thread, the Irish filigree is varied by numerous designs by which one thread can be traced through curious knots and complications, which, disposed over large surfaces, balance one another, but always with special varieties and arrangements difficult to trace with the eye. The long thread appears and disappears without breach of continuity, the two ends generally worked into the head and the tail of a serpent or a monster. The reliquary containing the \\"Bell of Saint Patrick\\" is covered with knotted work in many varieties. A two-handled chalice, called the \\"Ardagh Chalice\\" found near Limerick in 1868, is ornamented with work of this kind of extraordinary fineness. Twelve plaques on a band round the body of the vase, plaques on each handle and round the foot of the vase have a series of different designs of characteristic patterns, in fine filigree wire work wrought on the front of the repouss√© ground. Much of the medieval jewel work all over Europe down to the 15th century, on reliquaries, crosses, croziers, and other ecclesiastical goldsmiths' work, is set off with bosses and borders of filigree. Filigree work in silver was practised by the Moors of Spain during the Middle Ages with great skill, and was introduced by them and established all over the Iberian Peninsula, hence it was carried to the Spanish colonies in America. The manufacture spread over the Balearic Islands, and among the populations that border the Mediterranean. It is still made all over Italy, and in Portugal, Malta, North Macedonia, Albania, the Ionian Islands and many other parts of Greece. That of the Greeks is sometimes on a large scale, with several thicknesses of wires alternating with larger and smaller bosses and beads, sometimes set with turquoises, and mounted on convex plates, making rich ornamental headpieces, belts, and breast ornaments. Filigree silver buttons of wire-work and small bosses are worn by the peasants in most of the countries that produce this kind of jewellery. Silver filigree brooches and buttons are also made in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Little chains and pendants are added to much of this northern work.  Iberian Peninsula  The oldest filigree pieces discovered in the Iberian Peninsula date back to 2000‚Äì2500 BC, but its origin is not clear. These pieces possibly belonged to merchants and navigators originally from the Middle East and are not thought to have been produced in the region at that time. Filigree began to be produced in Portugal in the 8th century with the arrival of Arab migrants, who brought new patterns with them. With time, the peninsula began to produce different filigree patterns, but while in Spain the filigree jewellery-making tradition became less relevant, in Portugal it was perfected. After the 18th century, Portuguese Filigree already had its own distinctive imagery, motifs and shapes. Filigree from the 17th and 18th centuries became famous for their extraordinary complexity.examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum Gold and silver filigree jewellery of delicate and artistic design is still made in considerable quantities throughout the country, particularly filigree hearts, which are iconic symbols of Portuguese jewellery-making. = Africa = Filigree work was brought to Great Britain from Abyssinia after the Battle of Magdala: armguards, slippers, and cups, some of which are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. They are made of thin plates of silver, over which the wirework is soldered. The filigree is subdivided by narrow borders of simple pattern, and the intervening spaces are made up of many patterns, some with grains set at intervals. Methods of fabrication and uses Cast iron balustrades of the type sometimes called \\"filigree\\", in the central atrium of the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles The art may be said to consist in curling, twisting and plaiting fine pliable threads of metal, and uniting them at their points of contact with each other, and with the ground, by means of flux such as borax, by the help of the blowpipe. When granulated motifs are desired, small beads are made traditionally by using precious metal wire or fine sheet to start with, which is cut up in small pieces mixed with flux and placed in the small holes of a pitted block of charcoal (or any other suitable refractory material) and are then melted with a blowpipe (or today with a blowtorch), after which the bits of wire curl up and take a natural spherical like shape to end up in minuscule grains which slightly differ one from the other. Small grains or beads of the same metals are often set in the eyes of volutes, on the junctions, or at intervals at which they will set off the wirework effectively. The more delicate work is generally protected by framework of stouter wire. Brooches, crosses, earrings, buttons*Elements of a German filigree button, made c. 1880 image from Victoria & Albert Museum jewellery collection and other personal ornaments of modern filigree are generally surrounded and subdivided by bands of square or flat metal, giving consistency to the filling up, which would not otherwise keep its proper shape. Metaphorical uses \\"Filigree\\" has been used metaphorically as a term for intricate ornamental designs in a number of other contexts, including larger-scale metalwork such as wrought iron or cast iron pieces such as railings and balustrades.

Nuages gris (; French, lit. Grey Clouds), S.199 or Tr√ºbe Wolken, is a work for piano solo composed by Franz Liszt on August 24, 1881. It is one of Liszt's most haunting and at the same time one of his most experimental works, representing, according to Allen Forte, \\"a high point in the experimental idiom with respect to expressive compositional procedure.\\"'Arnold, Ben, ed., The Liszt Companion, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 169. Departing from his earlier virtuoso style, Liszt in his later years made several radical, compositional experiments, including Nuages gris, Unstern S.208 and Bagatelle sans tonalit√© S.216. Yet it was only in the second half of the twentieth century that the significance of Liszt's late experimental works began to be appreciated. R. Larry Todd, for example, has noted that \\"Arguably, Liszt was the first composer to establish the augmented triad as a truly independent sonority, to consider its implications for modern dissonance treatment, and to ponder its meaning for the future course of tonality. Liszt's accomplishments in these areas were considerable and support in no small way his position, in Busoni's phrase, as the 'master of freedom.'Arnold, The Liszt Companion, p. 140. Scholars such as Humphrey Searle, Zolt√°n Hars√°nyi, Bence Szabolcsi, Lajos B√°rdos, and Istv√°n Szel√©nyi have contributed much to placing these works in the repertoire of today's pianists.Arnold, The Liszt Companion, p. 26. Nuages gris is quite short and technically simple. According to Jim Samson, \\"the most distinctive features of Liszt's late style are present in this short work‚Äîthe avoidance of a conventional cadential structure, the importance of semitonal movement, the use of the augmented triad as the central harmonic unit and of parallelism as a principal means of progression.\\"Samson, Jim, Music in Transition, New York, 1977, p. 17. The harmonies are based on augmented triads while the melody line makes extensive reference to the Hungarian minor scale. The harmonies, which are very different from those found in his earlier works, give a very dark and almost morbid feel to the piece. Leonard Ratner has commented: \\"The restless, unresolved dissonances of Nuages gris the isolated figures, the sense of alienation‚Äîthese have a clear affinity with the somewhat later expressionism of the Viennese composers Mahler and Schoenberg.... [Nuages gris] is a musical bellwether that indicated what was happening and what would happen in European music: sound, with the assistance of symmetry, would take over, harmony would be absorbed into color and lose its cadential function.\\"Arnold, The Liszt Companion, p. 169. Claude Debussy probably had Nuages gris in mind when he composed his own Nuages.Palmer, Christopher, Impressionism in music, Volume 1973, Part 1, p. 58. Mauricio Kagel used Nuages gris in his Unguis incarnatus est (1972).Decarsin, Fran√ßois. 1985. \\"Liszt‚Äôs Nuages gris and Kagel‚Äôs Unguis incarnatus est: A Model and Its Issue\\", translated by Jonathan Dunsby.

It was written by Paul Cornell and directed by Joe Ahearne. It was one of three Doctor Who episodes that year to be nominated for the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) agrees to take his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) back to the day her father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) died in 1987. When Rose intervenes and pulls her father out of the path of a car, time is wounded and dangerous Reapers attack, threatening to erase history. Pete eventually realises that to get rid of the Reapers, he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him. Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies conceived \\"Father's Day\\" as an emotionally driven time travel story to explore Rose's character. He chose Cornell to write the episode; Cornell had written spin-off material during the years the programme was on hiatus. The monster element of the story was expanded based on suggestions from Cornell and BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter, and the Reapers went through many designs. The episode was filmed in November 2004 at St Paul's Church and streets in Cardiff. \\"Father's Day\\" was watched by 8.06 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the focus on character and emotion. Plot \\"Peter Alan Tyler, my dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Born 15 September 1954.\\" In a flashback, Rose Tyler's mother Jackie tells a young Rose about her father, Pete, who was killed in a hit-and-run accident while on the way to a friend's wedding in 1987 and died alone. The Doctor takes Rose to the day Pete died so that he is not alone when he dies. Upon their arrival in London in 1987, they witness the accident, but Rose is unable to go to comfort Pete. Going back to try again, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Later on, he and Rose argue about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking Rose for potentially damaging the timeline. Rose decides to go with Pete to his friend's wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people. Rose and Pete drive to the wedding together, and the car that was meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. A Reaper attacks the wedding guests, including Jackie and an infant Rose. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox the Reapers are fixing by consuming everyone within it. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it up in the middle of the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it. Pete realises that Rose is his and Jackie's daughter, and when Rose is unable to answer questions about how good a father he was, Pete realises he was meant to die in the accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman. In a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, which consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground. Pete realises that he must die to restore the timeline. He runs in front of the car that was originally meant to kill him; it had continued to appear and disappear on the road just outside the church. After Pete is hit by the car and fatally injured, the timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims including the Doctor reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with Pete, and she holds his hand until he dies. \\"Peter Alan Tyler, my dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Died the 7th of November, 1987.\\" =Outside references= \\"The Lamb and Flag\\", a pub from the sitcom Bottom, is referenced in the episode. It also features the 2002 song \\"Don't Mug Yourself\\" by The Streets, indicating the damage to the timeline. Rose believes Pete to be \\"a bit of a Del Boy\\", referring to the character from 1980s comedy Only Fools and Horses. The 1987 song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley and the 1987 The Communards cover of the 1971 song \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" also feature in the episode. Production The Reapers initially looked more like the Grim Reaper. (Pictured: an artist's representation of the Grim Reaper.) According to producer Phil Collinson, showrunner Russell T Davies came up with the concept for \\"Father's Day\\" at an early stage in the planning of the series, as it was a \\"perfect time travel story\\". Davies wanted the storyline to be easy to follow and drawn from human emotions. Additionally, the previous seven episodes had established why Rose was a good companion, and so \\"Father's Day\\" shows that she does make mistakes, but in a relatable way. Davies chose Paul Cornell to write the episode; Cornell had written Doctor Who spin-off material, especially in novels for the Virgin New Adventures, which bridged the gap between the classic series and the new. Davies originally intended that the episode be a small budget-saver character piece investigating the death of Rose's father, but Cornell suggested the addition of the Reapers and BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter encouraged the additions of monsters to the new series. Working titles for the episode included \\"Wounded Time\\" and \\"Wound in Time\\". Davies and Cornell debated whether it should have been Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left ambiguous in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line \\"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\\" is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message. St. Paul's Church in Grangetown. The entire episode was shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed frequently during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were in the community of Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tylers' flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the 80s; for example, peach dresses and \\"big hair\\" were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too \\"bouncy\\". Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but the number of hours they could work with the infant was limited, an \\"artificial baby\\" was used as a placeholder in some scenes. The Reapers went through many designs. Originally, they were supposed to be \\"men in cowls\\" based on the Grim Reaper; the final design retains some of this image with its \\"scythe-like tail\\". The original design was deemed too similar to creatures seen in \\"The End of the World\\", and so were reworked into something more \\"otherworldly\\". They were not originally intended to fly. There was also discussion of how much they should resemble animals as opposed to the Grim Reaper; the end result is a mixture of the two approaches. The final design had a \\"shark quality\\", bat wings, and a mouth influenced by the praying mantis. Vulture sound effects were used for its screech. The model was made over two months, being finished at the end of February 2005 rather than at the beginning of January as scheduled. The special effects team then had two or three weeks to complete the \\"40-odd shots\\" of the completely CGI Reapers in the episode. The episode ended up being more expensive than intended because of the CGI. When time is damaged, one of the effects is that mobile telephones all begin to repeat the message, \\"Watson, come here, I need you,\\" purportedly Alexander Graham Bell's first words ever spoken over a telephone. However, historical records indicate the words to be \\"Watson, come here, I want you.\\" The error was not present in Paul Cornell's original script, but crept in at some point during production. Producer Phil Collinson speculated that it was because the line was rerecorded: it was originally recorded by someone who the production team felt put on too false a Scottish accent, and so it was rerecorded by a real Scot. Broadcast and reception \\"Father's Day\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 14 May 2005 on BBC One. The episode received UK overnight ratings of 7.47 million viewers, an audience share of 42.74%. When time-shifted viewers were taken into account, the number rose to 8.06 million. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 83. \\"Father's Day\\" was met with a generally positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored as well as the accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave \\"one of the series' best performances\\" as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the let-down of the episode, finding that \\"the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should\\". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were \\"enormous logical gaps\\" involving \\"glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes\\". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as \\"a time-travel tale with immense heart\\" and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done \\"equally well if you scythed the Reapers from the script\\". Reviewing \\"Father's Day\\" for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of \\"A\\", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would have done something else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was \\"cheesy\\" and \\"disconnected\\" from the rest of the story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be \\"the best story this season\\". He called the direction \\"wonderful\\" and the script \\"sublime\\", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel. \\"Father's Day\\" was nominated for the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, alongside other first series episodes \\"Dalek\\" and \\"The Empty Child\\" / \\"The Doctor Dances\\". The latter won. \\"Father's Day\\" topped the third place category in terms of votes.

As of August 2020, Prichard is employed by WWE, where he is a Senior Vice President and working as the Executive Director of SmackDown and Raw. As a manager for the promotion, Prichard performed under the ring name Brother Love and served as the original manager of The Undertaker. During Prichard's run as Brother Love, he hosted his own segment, The Brother Love Show where he would usually support the heel wrestlers. After leaving WWE in 2008, Prichard served as the Senior Vice President of Programming and Talent Relations for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling). Since 2016, Prichard has co- hosted the Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard podcast with Conrad Thompson. Professional wrestling career =Beginnings= Prichard began his career working for Paul Boesch out of Houston, Texas. At 10 years old, he sold posters with great success. At 12, he worked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. Due to Boesch's working relationship with Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, Prichard would also act as ring announcer for some UWF shows. After Boesch sold his Houston territory to the WWF, Prichard would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised WWF events from the Houston area. =World Wrestling Federation= Early years (1987‚Äì1988) After entering the World Wrestling Federation in 1987, he first occasionally worked as an announcer for the WWF's television programs alongside Mike McGuirk and \\"The Duke of Dorchester\\" Pete Doherty and occasionally Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, before creating the Brother Love character. Brother Love Show (1988‚Äì1991) In June 1988, Prichard debuted as Brother Love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous \\"preacher\\" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of God, but \\"the word of love.\\" He was best known for his disingenuous catchphrase \\"I love you!\\", during which he would enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick Southern accent. The character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with Prichard specifically citing Robert Tilton as his most direct inspiration. Introduced to the WWF by Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, Love hosted a segment on the World Wrestling Federation's syndicated and cable television programs called \\"The Brother Love Show\\", in which he would interview wrestlers. The segment debuted on the June 19, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, and would be \\"promoted\\" to the WWF's \\"A-show,\\" Superstars of Wrestling, first appearing on the October 8, 1988 edition. The segment was patterned largely after Piper's Pit, where Brother Love would berate face wrestlers (especially Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior) and openly support such heels as \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan. It was explained that DiBiase was Brother Love's main \\"benefactor.\\" More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on \\"The Brother Love Show\\" (including Hulk Hogan's feuds vs. Big Boss Man (1988‚Äì1989) and Earthquake (1990), and the Jake Roberts-Rick Martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). The Brother Love Show was also the setting for the unveiling of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship belt and Rick Martel's \\"Arrogance\\" cologne. Brother Love made his pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam event in 1988 at Madison Square Garden when he interviewed face wrestler \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan. He later featured prominently in WrestleMania V in 1989 where Rowdy Roddy Piper in his first appearance in the WWF since his 'retirement\\" after WrestleMania III, \\"de-skirted\\" Brother Love of his \\"kilt\\" after taking over Piper's Pit. A year later, Sgt. Slaughter bestowed a medal upon Brother Love during SummerSlam for being the \\"greatest American.\\" Occasionally, Brother Love provided color commentary for the WWF's televised events; unlike during his early WWF run under his real name and using his natural voice (as Prichard), where he was pro-face, Brother Love was pro heel. His most famous assignment was alongside Sean Mooney for the WWF's televised event at Madison Square Garden on January 21, 1991, where he was roughed up by the Ultimate Warrior on his way to the ring to face \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage in a steel cage just two days after Savage had caused the Warrior to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. In a 2016 podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Prichard recalled that he had long been a fan of evangelist preachers, more for their theatrics than their religion. When Prichard first pitched the idea of Brother Love to WWF owner Vince McMahon, Vince generally liked the idea but did not believe that Prichard \\"had the face\\" for the role. Determined to get himself into the role that he had created, Prichard, dressed as Brother Love (minus the red face paint he would appear on television with), invaded a meeting at the WWF's headquarters between McMahon, the head of WWF International and the WWF's chief financial officer. There, he gave an impromptu two minute sermon before quickly departing. When he arrived back at his office at the WWF's television studios five minutes later, he discovered that he had two missed calls from McMahon who he was relieved to find had liked what he had seen. However, Vince wanted to see how it worked on camera. Thus, the Brother Love character became a reality. Prichard also told that the bright red face make up was unknown to him the first time he appeared on television as Brother Love. As it was a television taping, Prichard thought it was just normal make up being applied and he did not look in the mirror, not knowing that Vince McMahon had ordered that he be given the red face.Bruce Prichard on the Brother Love Gimmick Manager of The Undertaker (1990‚Äì1991) On November 19, 1990, Brother Love managed The Undertaker, who at the time was known as \\"Kane the Undertaker,\\" for his in-ring debut during a taping of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. That match, and another one for a taping of WWF Wrestling Challenge the following night, aired on television after his appearance live at the 1990 Survivor Series in which he was part of a Survivor Series style match between a team led by Dusty Rhodes and a team led by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase would reveal the mystery partner as The Undertaker. This was the first time Brother Love appeared on television as The Undertaker's manager. Brother Love continued to manage The Undertaker until February 1991, when he sold his contract to Paul Bearer. Controversy and release (1991) The character of Brother Love was controversial by its design and nature, since it was introduced around the time of the late 1980s scandals involving televangelists including Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. In its antics bearing it was an artistic hyperbole and apparently played off of aforementioned figures. As such several of the segments on the \\"Brother Love Show\\" that was featured on WWF TV program was explicitly offensive and exploitative and bordered on the lines of taste. One such particular segment involved Brother Love playing the part of a charlatan \\"faith healer\\", where he induced an actor, pretending to be blind and crippled, to \\"see\\" and \\"walk\\" on command. Prichard was released from the WWF in May 1991, shortly after the \\"I Can See!\\" segment aired. He was \\"offed\\" i.e., the on-screen demise of Brother Love was brought about when The Ultimate Warrior attacked him and beat him nearly unconscious, breaking his ribs, and destroyed The Brother Love Show set, slamming the lectern, tearing the curtains and knocking down a light. Prichard's release, however, was actually due to personal and private issues that he had at the time and not because of the \\"I Can See\\" segment and he would eventually be re-hired and return to the WWF the following year (1992), albeit in a different capacity not reprising the Brother Love role. =Global Wrestling Federation (1991‚Äì1992)= After his release from the WWF, Prichard eventually joined the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he worked as a manager and ringside interviewer between 1991 and 1992, using his real name. He began as a babyface color commentator, but eventually turned heel right in the middle of calling an ESPN televised match with GWF play-by-play announcer Craig Johnson. He managed Barry Horowitz in the GWF, and gave him the nickname \\"The Winner\\". Horowitz and Prichard feuded with GWF Light Heavyweight champion Chaz Taylor. Prichard said mockingly of Taylor, \\"He may be a lightweight but he's no champion!\\" After failing to win the title from Taylor, both Horowitz and Prichard left the GWF. =Return to WWF/E (1992‚Äì2008)= Prichard returned to the WWF in September 1992 and portrayed two short-lived characters. He first appeared as The Wizard, a heel color commentator on All-American Wrestling (who never appeared on camera during the character's brief run), and then as Reo Rodgers, a satire on Dusty Rhodes. Rodgers did commentary from time to time in his short stint, and his interview segment, \\"Reo's Roundup,\\" lasted only two segments before the character was dropped. After this, he remained behind the scenes, working as Vince McMahon's \\"right-hand man\\" and also as a writer for some of WWE's shows. However, Prichard has reprised his Brother Love character on occasion. Brother Love returned to the WWF in November 1995. He hosted the Brother Love Show once again, this time on Monday Night Raw. In what would prove to be a monumental moment in WWF history, Brother Love hosted Ted DiBiase introducing The Ringmaster into the World Wrestling Federation. The Ringmaster would eventually transform into Stone Cold Steve Austin. Brother Love then quietly disappeared from the WWF again soon after. Brother Love resurfaced once again for one night in January 1997, making a surprise appearance on the debut episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, helping the Flying Nuns defeat The Godwinns. Love then named the team The Sisters of Love. The gimmick was quickly scrapped, with the team later finding success as The Headbangers. Prichard (as himself) once again managed The Undertaker for a match in Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) on October 10, 1997, where he defeated Jinsei Shinzaki. Through the remainder of the Attitude Era, Prichard was occasionally seen on-screen as himself, either cleaning up between matches at ringside, or as one of the people called in to break up a backstage fight. During the fall of 1998 and into early-1999, he provided colour-commentary on Shotgun Saturday Night. He was also the only backstage employee to have an interview segment on the Raw is Owen memorial broadcast. In 2001, Brother Love participated in the gimmick battle royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. He was eliminated by Sgt. Slaughter. On the February 6, 2003 airing of SmackDown!, Brother Love confronted The Undertaker, then portraying a biker gimmick, in his feud against The Big Show. Brother Love pleaded with The Undertaker to forgive Big Show for his recent actions, but The Undertaker, however, wasn't pleased and gave Brother Love a chokeslam, followed up by a Tombstone Piledriver in the middle of the ring. Love later appeared in the Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance 2003, lasting all the way to the end before being knocked out by Bradshaw. The Brother Love Show made a short-term return on a couple of SmackDown! brand house shows in the summer of 2003 as a replacement for planned Piper's Pit segments (Roddy Piper had been released from his contract). These segments saw Love and Mr. McMahon attempt to humiliate Zach Gowen, only to get their comeuppance in the end. On December 1, 2008, Bruce Prichard was released from the WWE by Stephanie McMahon. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010‚Äì2013)= It was reported on October 7, 2010, that Prichard had been hired by TNA to presumably reprise the role he had in WWE working as a backstage agent and producer. On October 6, 2011, Prichard took over the role of TNA head writer from Vince Russo. In May 2012, Prichard was promoted to Vice President of Talent Relations to replace Terry Taylor. On October 17, 2012, Prichard was promoted to Senior Vice President, Programming & Talent Relations. In this new role, Prichard oversaw talent relations, talent scouting and development as well as the creative direction of the company. In May 2013, Prichard began appearing as a judge alongside Al Snow and Taz in the monthly Gut Check segment on TNA Impact. TNA released Prichard on July 17, 2013. =Return to TNA/Impact Wrestling (2017)= In March 2017, it was announced that Prichard would be making his return to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/810979-bruce-prichard- reportedly-returning-to-tna-impact-wrestling-backstage-news-on-his-new-role- in-the-company Bruce Prichard Reportedly Returning to TNA Impact Wrestling, Backstage News on His New Role in the Company - WrestleZone Shortly after re- signing with the company, Prichard began appearing in an onscreen role for the recently renamed Impact Wrestling.

He switched to the BBC in 1972 to report and present for Panorama and Midweek and to anchor coverage of the February and October 1974 General Election programmes, also covering the wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips. He continued to edit The Economist until 1974, where he raised the circulation by 60%. He then joined the Daily Express as editor, but resigned 18 months later. He rejoined ITN in June 1976, initially for a brief stint back on News at Ten, but in September 1976 he became the main presenter for the newly relaunched early evening bulletin News at 5:45. He returned to News at Ten in March 1978. Four years later, Burnet became an associate editor for the programme and joined the ITN board of directors. He continued to present coverage of political events including the 1979, 1983 and 1987 General Elections, by-elections, budgets and American presidential elections. Burnet also presented coverage of the royal family, commentating on the weddings of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986 and other state occasions. He also wrote and presented several Royal documentaries including In Person: The Prince and Princess of Wales, A Royal Day and The Royal Family in Scotland. Outside of ITN, he was also a presenter and interviewer for Thames Television's TV Eye (for a time, a substitute for This Week). In February 1990, Burnet resigned from the ITN board amid a dispute over the future ownership of the company, during which his own proposals to restructure the organisation were rejected. He retired from ITN as newscaster and associate editor 18 months later, presenting his final edition of News at Ten on 29 August 1991. Death Following his retirement, he did not make any further appearances on television or write for the press. In part, this was because of his being diagnosed with senile dementia, following which the requirement for twenty four-hour nursing resulted in his having to reside in the Beatrice Place Nursing Home in Kensington, London. His condition meant that he felt comfortable only with close friends, including his wife, and former ITN News director, Diana Edwards-Jones. Burnet died peacefully in the early hours of 20 July 2012, at his nursing home in Kensington, where he had been living following a series of strokes. Paying tribute, Andrew Neil referred to Burnet as \\"Britain's greatest broadcaster\\". In his will he left ¬£2 million, the majority of which was bequeathed to his wife. Popular culture The satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image portrayed Burnet as a cringing, fawning royalist (\\"lick, lick, smarm, smarm\\"), forever trying to suck up to the nearest available member of the Royal Family; one episode ended with the Burnet puppet singing a song about his love for the Queen Mother (before being pushed aside for Sandy Gall). The satirical magazine Private Eye referred to him as \\"Arslicker Burnet\\". Burnet was a supporter of Scottish football clubs Rangers and Partick Thistle. Honours Burnet was knighted in the 1984 New Year Honours \\"for services to journalism and broadcasting\\". He also won numerous awards, including the BAFTA Richard Dimbleby award three times in 1966, 1970 and 1979.

It was created as an expansion of the San Francisco Bay Area Bisexual Network (BABN) newsletter by BABN member, Karla Rossi, in collaboration with bisexual and bi-friendly editors, writers, and artists to become a full 64-page magazine with an international subscriber base. The complete title of the magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond the Myths of Bisexuality, was purposely chosen for its controversial nature, while its tag line indicated a clear intent to challenge stereotypes of bisexual identities and behaviors. The magazine took its name from the stereotype depicting bisexuals as willing to have sex with \\"anything that moves\\". The magazine's mission was to confront and redefine concepts of sexuality and gender, to defy stereotypes and broad definitions of bisexuals and to combat biphobia. Most of the issues were theme-based, designed to cohesively present the vast array of diverse bisexual voices and experiences across the lines of gender, class, race, ethnicity, spirituality, lifestyle, age, politics, culture, and sexual behaviors, desires, and preferences. Special care was taken to include a wide variety of perspectives, from straight-identified to queer-identified bisexuals, while inclusion did not require the declaration of an identity or label to indicate where one fell along the spectrum of ways to be bisexual. Changes in managing editors at the helm precipitated changes in the magazine's tag line that were made to reflect the evolving, exploratory, and creative nature of its subject matter and content.

Gendlin (born Eugen Gendelin; 25 December 1926 ‚Äì 1 May 2017) was an American philosopher who developed ways of thinking about and working with living process, the bodily felt sense and the \\"philosophy of the implicit\\". Though he had no degree in the field of psychology, his advanced study with Carl Rogers, his longtime practice of psychotherapy and his extensive writings in the field of psychology have made him perhaps better known in that field than in philosophy. He studied under Carl Rogers, the founder of client- centered therapy, at the University of Chicago and received his PhD in philosophy in 1958. Gendlin's theories impacted Rogers' own beliefs and played a role in Rogers' view of psychotherapy. From 1958 to 1963 Gendlin was Research Director at the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute of the University of Wisconsin. He served as an associate professor in the departments of Philosophy and Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago from 1964 until 1995. Gendlin is best known for Focusing, a psychotherapy technique, and for \\"Thinking at the Edge\\", a general procedure for \\"thinking with more than patterns\\". In the 1950s and 60s, under the guidance of Rogers, Gendlin did research demonstrating that a client's ability to realize lasting positive change in psychotherapy depended on their ability to access a nonverbal, bodily feel of the issues that brought them into therapy. Gendlin gave the name \\"felt sense\\" to this intuitive body-feel for unresolved issues. Realizing that people could be taught this skill, in 1978 Gendlin published his best-selling book Focusing, which presented a six step method for discovering one's felt sense and drawing on it for personal development. Gendlin founded The Focusing Institute in 1985 (now the International Focusing Institute) to facilitate training and education in Focusing for academic and professional communities and to share the practice with the public. In the mid-1980s, Gendlin served on the original editorial board for the journal The Humanistic Psychologist, published by Division 32 of the American Psychological Association (APA). He has been honored by the APA three times, and was the first recipient of their Distinguished Professional Award in Psychology and Psychotherapy (given by Division 29, this award is now called the Distinguished Psychologist Award for Contributions to Psychology and Psychotherapy). He was awarded the Viktor Frankl prize by the Viktor Frankl Family Foundation in 2008. In 2016, he was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the World Association for Person Centered and Experiential Psychotherapy and Counseling and another lifetime achievement award was given to him that same year by the United States Association for Body Psychotherapy. Gendlin was a founder and longtime editor of the journal Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice as well as the in-house journal of the Focusing Institute called the Folio, and is the author of a number of books, including Focusing-Oriented Psychotherapy: A Manual of the Experiential Method. The mass-market edition of his popular classic Focusing has been translated into 17 languages and sold more than a half million copies. Philosophy Eugene Gendlin Gendlin regarded himself first and foremost as a philosopher and he brought a rigorous philosophical perspective to psychology, presented in his early book Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning and later developed into a comprehensive theory of the deep nature of life processes, articulated in his masterwork A Process Model. From 1968 to 1995 he taught at the University of Chicago, where he taught a course on theory-building that later gave rise to a new practice called \\"Thinking at the Edge\\", a fourteen-step method for drawing on one's non-conceptual, experiential knowing about any topic to create novel theory and concepts. Gendlin asserts that an organism's living interaction with its environment is prior (temporally and philosophically) to abstract knowledge about its environment. Living is an intricate, ordered interaction with the environment, and as such, is a kind of knowing. Abstract knowledge is a development of this more basic knowing. For example, when a pen falls off a desk, that seems to be proof that gravity exists, because gravity made it fall. But what is \\"gravity\\"? In 1500, \\"gravity\\" was the pen's desire to go to the center of the earth; in 1700 \\"gravity\\" was a force that acted at a distance according to mathematical laws; in the 1900s \\"gravity\\" was an effect of curved space-time; and today physicists theorize that \\"gravity\\" may be a force carried by subatomic particles called \\"gravitons\\". Gendlin views \\"gravity\\" as a concept and points out that concepts can't make anything fall. Instead of saying that gravity causes things to fall, it would be more accurate to say that things falling cause [the different concepts of] gravity. Interaction with the world is prior to concepts about the world. The fact that concepts change does not mean that they are arbitrary; concepts can be formulated in many diverse and incompatible ways, but to the extent that they are rooted in experience, each formulation has its own precise relationship to experience. Thus Gendlin's philosophy goes beyond relativism and postmodernism. He agrees with postmodernists that culture and language are always already implicit in experiencing and in concepts. Empirical testing is crucial, but it does not keep science from changing every few years. No assertions are simply \\"objective\\". Gendlin points out that the universe (and everything in it) is implicitly more intricate than concepts, because a) it includes them, and b) all concepts and logical units are generated in a wider, more than conceptual process (which Gendlin calls implicit intricacy). This wider process is more than logical, in a way that has a number of characteristic regularities. Gendlin has shown that it is possible to refer directly to this process in the context of a given problem or situation and systematically generate new concepts and more precise logical units. Because human beings are in an ongoing interaction with the world (they breathe, eat, and interact with others in every context and in any field in which they work), their bodies are a \\"knowing\\" which is more than conceptual and which implies further steps. Thus, it is possible for one to drive a car while carrying on an animated conversation; and it is possible for Einstein to say that he had a \\"feel\\" for his theory years before he could formulate it. Human beings' ongoing interaction with the world provides ongoing validity. Each move, from pumping blood to discussing philosophy, implies a next step, an organic carrying forward. Humans feel this carrying forward both in the move itself and in the feedback it generates: at each moment, it is possible to feel how things are moving and what is implied next. With specific training, one can learn to attend to this feeling more deeply, so that a holistic felt sense of the whole situation can form. A felt sense is quite different from \\"feeling\\" in the sense of emotions; it is one's bodily awareness of the ongoing life process. Because a felt sense is a living interaction in the world, it is not relative in the way that concepts are. A felt sense is more ordered than concepts and has its own properties, different from those of logic; for example, it is very precise, more intricate, and can be conceptualized in a variety of non-arbitrary ways. Much of Gendlin's philosophy is concerned with showing how this implicit bodily knowing functions in relation to logic. For example, Gendlin has found that when the felt sense is allowed to function in relation to concepts, each carries the other forward, through steps of deeper feel and new formulation. Gendlin underlines that one can (and often does) \\"progress\\" in one's understanding, and that this involves transitions in which existing conceptual models are disrupted, but that one can \\"feel\\" when a carrying forward in insight is (or is not) occurring. One can \\"feel\\" this because human logical conceptions are dependent on a more intricate order, which is living-in-the-world. Useful concepts derive from and are relative to this sense more than logical, intricate order, not the other way round. Gendlin's two major philosophical works are Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning, which develops explicit ways of approaching the implicit; and A Process Model, which demonstrates this method by developing a body of consistent concepts for thinking about organic processes, with implications for thinking about space, time, science, genetics, ethology, consciousness, language, and spirituality. Focusing Person-Centered Experiential Psychotherapy Conference in Germany Focusing emerged from Gendlin's collaboration with psychologist Carl Rogers. Gendlin developed a way of measuring the extent to which an individual refers to a felt sense; and he found in a series of studies that therapy clients who have positive outcomes do much more of this. He then developed a way to teach people to refer to their felt sense, so clients could do better in therapy. This training is called 'Focusing'. Further research showed that Focusing can be used outside therapy to address a variety of issues. It is described in Gendlin's book, Focusing, which has sold over 400,000 copies and is printed in twelve languages. In Focusing he wrote: In 1970, Gendlin was the first person to receive the \\"Distinguished Professional Award in Psychology and Psychotherapy\\" from the Psychotherapy Division (Division 29) of the American Psychological Association. In 2000, Gendlin also received, along with The Focusing Institute, the Charlotte and Karl B√ºhler Award from the Society of Humanistic Psychology (Division 32 of the American Psychological Association). In 2007, he was a recipient of the Viktor Frankl Award of the City of Vienna for outstanding achievements in the field of meaning-oriented humanistic psychotherapy. The worldwide dissemination of Focusing has been facilitated by The International Focusing Institute. This nonprofit organization defines itself as \\"an international, cross-cultural organization dedicated to supporting individuals and groups world-wide who are practicing, teaching and developing Focusing and its underlying philosophy\\". Their 2010 Membership Directory listed about 2,000 members in over 40 countries. Its website houses the Gendlin Online Library.

Gendlin, Introduction to Thinking At the Edge\\"Thinking at the edge was developed out of Gendlin's philosophy of the implicit\\", cited from: How to Think At the Edge (TAE), The Focusing Institute is a way of developing one's implicit knowing into an articulated theory. For example, a professional might have had an inchoate felt sense for a problem for many years. Using TAE, it is possible to develop concepts that explicate the felt sense very precisely so that what was implicit knowledge can generate an explicit theory that can contribute to the field. Personal life Gendlin was born in Vienna, Austria, on December 25, 1926. He lived with his parents in the 9th district of Vienna, a very Jewish district at that time. His mother was Sylvia Gendelin-Tobell. His father, Leonid Gendelin, had earned a doctoral degree in chemistry from the University of Graz. Dr. Gendelin had a dry cleaning business in Vienna. The family left Austria due to the rise of the Nazi party and the danger to Jewish families such as his. They first fled to the Netherlands and later emigrated to the United States on the SS Paris (1916) on its last voyage to New York, arriving January 11, 1939. The family changed their name to Gendlin upon their arrival in the United States, and in English it is pronounced JEHND-lin (not with the hard \\"g\\" as in German pronunciation). Gendlin went on to serve in the United States Navy and to become a U.S. citizen. Gendlin lived in New York state until his death. He had three children: Gerry and Judith from his first marriage with wife Fran; and a daughter, Elissa, with his second wife, Mary Hendricks-Gendlin. Gerry Gendlin is an expert on Russia and serves as an associate professor in the department of History, Politics, Languages and Cultures at Edinboro University in Edinboro, Pennsylvania. Mary worked closely with Gendlin and served for many years as the director of The Focusing Institute. Mary Hendricks-Gendlin died in 2015.
